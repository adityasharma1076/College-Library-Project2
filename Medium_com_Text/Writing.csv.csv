Medium.com,Arts & Entertainment,10 Easy Steps to Writing a Blog Post,Writing,https://medium.com/@tiffanyrayconnolly/10-steps-to-writing-a-blog-post-f6026776149?source=topic_page---------0------------------1," Perhaps you’ve gotten over the first hurdle of writing for your blog — finding a topic. Now it’s time to write. But that blinking cursor on your stark-white page is ruining everything. Whoever thought such a small icon could bring so much anxiety! I’ve been there, but since then, I have created a strategic blog writing process that helps me put my ideas to paper (or word processor), with ease, every time. My blog writing process is going to be different from other writers’, and it’ll be different from yours as well. But this is what works for me, and hopefully, it will act as a good starting point for you until you figure out what process works best for your creativity and workflow. I don’t start actually writing most of the content until I’ve laid out a plan first. If I don’t have an outline, I tend to lack direction. Try and hold back on producing any writing until after you’ve completed steps one and two. Step 1: Brainstorm Headlines Some writers may choose to save headlines for last. I start with them because they give me a crystal-clear direction for my article. The headline will probably change by the time I’m finished writing, but the initial idea helps guide my writing and ensure that I’m on track. Finding the perfect headline can be really difficult. You want to use your keywords but in a way that is enticing. If you don’t come up with a headline that draws people in, then all your hard work is for nothing. Step 2: Identify your Subheadings Subheadings are the main topics that your blog article will cover. I come up with at least four per article (this one has 10). For long-form blog posts (posts over 1,000 words) I like to have at least five. I love subheadings, not only for the ease of writing, but for reading. People browsing the web are scanning for information. Subheadings allow your reader to find the exact information they are looking for and then skip everything else. Step 3: Research You would think this would come first, but for me it doesn’t. Before I do any research, I write down my own ideas. And I only write about what I know, because that’s the only way to write about something with authenticity. Once I’ve bulleted all the items I want to cover under each subheading, I conduct research, look for any holes in my content, and fill in the missing pieces. Step 4: Write Body Paragraphs The words should flow effortlessly now because all you’re doing here is connecting your points together in sentence form. In this stage, I don’t worry too much about grammar or spelling. I focus on getting my ideas out and being authentic, conversational, and easy to read. Don’t worry if a sentence doesn’t seem to sound right initially, you’ll fix that later. In step seven, you’ll go back and edit, delete, rewrite, and massage your words until they are just right. Step 5: Write the Introduction + Conclusion These are notoriously difficult sections for any writing endeavor! When you save the conclusion and introduction for last, they pretty much end up writing themselves. Introduce your topic by giving some background information and providing the why: why does anyone need this information and why are you the one to give it to them? The conclusion can be as short as 2–3 sentences, wrapping up your main ideas. The final sentences are your call to action (learn more, sign up, join us, buy now). Step 6: Create Internal + External Links Skim your post and link back to your website in relevant places. You might have a ton of links and you might have just one. That’s OK. Just make sure you’re at least linking to the places you want your readers to end up, whether it’s a product page, your contact page, or services page. Usually this is done at the end as part of your call to action, but it can also be embedded within the content itself. And never leave a hyperlink in your writing. Embed the link within the text. And if it works, link back to any relevant blog posts that you’ve already published. Step 7: Edit + Rewrite I usually save this step for the next day. It gives the article a chance to marinate and settle. I like to go back and look at my writing with fresh eyes. Usually I am aghast at my sentence structure and flow, but the ideas are there, my voice is there, and the content is there. Now I just edit, move sentences around, rewrite sentences, delete them, and add them. Step 8: Print + Proofread I always print my writing to proofread. When I was an English teacher, I used to have my students print their essays and then read them out loud to a friend. It’s a great way to find errors. If you don’t have access to a printer, then at least save the article as a PDF and proofread from there. Viewing your article from another format is super helpful. I might do this three times before I feel like I’m ready for the next step. Step 9: Upload, Format + Proofread Again Almost there! Upload your post to your platform. Read it again! It will look different and I guarantee you’ll find more mistakes. I always do. Make sure all your formatting is correct. Perhaps pull an important point out and make it pop by enlarging the text, italicizing it, or bolding it, like this. Step 10: Publish Time to hit publish. I always post my writing with a relevant picture. After I hit publish I go back and read again, and clean up any tiny errors that may have slipped through the cracks. Done! Try using these steps the next time you write a blog post and then tweak it so that it works for you. Soon, you’ll be banging out amazing content for your blog, consistently and with little stress."
Medium.com,Arts & Entertainment,Writing Superhero Movies,Writing,https://medium.com/storiusmag/writing-superhero-movies-3575a5e5a958?source=topic_page---------1------------------1," By Erik Bork W
hether you’re a diehard fan of the Marvel Cinematic Universe or agree with Coppola and Scorsese that comic book superhero movies are the scourge of our culture, I think we can all agree that they have taken over a big chunk of the American film industry — at least for now — and are making certain studios a lot of money. Most writers I coach don’t come to me because they’re interested in writing superhero movies. Either they aren’t big fans of the genre, or don’t see this as something they could do well, or just recognize the truth that the films getting made come entirely from pre-existing intellectual property owned by the studios making them. In other words, they were comics first, and have a certain built-in fanbase already. The studios aren’t looking for brand new superheroes from unknown writers. They’re looking to hire established writers to pen the latest installment of their pre-owned franchises. Still, I think it’s important to recognize what makes these films (or the best of them) work on a story level. There are lessons all writers can learn from the success of these tales of battle between special-powered heroes and villains where the fate of humanity (or something close to it) seems to be at stake. And that’s a big part of what makes them work: sky-high stakes. It’s not even just life-and-death stakes, which are already the highest kind. It’s life and death for a vast number of people. It’s hard not to feel the importance of what they’re trying to do. These movies also prioritize entertainment value. They are fun to watch. Technology has transformed what can be cinematically achieved in terms of action spectacle, and that sort of visual eye candy appeals to many people. But they’re not just about action. At their core, they’re about characters, just like any other genre. Ideally, the audience comes to bond with the superhero character on a personal level, relates to them and even feels for them as they go through difficult trials. And they have to be difficult. That’s key. Even though they have special powers, the forces aligned against them have to be more powerful, and have to be winning, for essentially the entire movie, right up until the end. So how do we get audiences to relate to these people who have special powers, and are thus so different from us, with certain advantages we might only fantasize about having? A big part of it is the difficulties. We relate to people who are having a hard time. And so the best movie main characters are usually losing, struggling, and pushed to their limit. It also helps with relatability that these characters are heroic — risking a lot to help others. There’s nothing more likable than that. The best superhero movies also tend to explore a particular kind of character situation that is really appealing to audiences. They’re about people who feel that they’re different from others, who don’t quite fit in, who might have special abilities but who also tend to have a unique flaw, or curse, that brings a lot of pain and difficulty. Blake Snyder’s Save the Cat books talk about this. They introduced the idea of ten distinct types of stories (or genres) that successful movies tend to fall into. I always recommend writers work with these when they’re developing ideas, and make sure their ideas are a good match for at least one of the ten types. It helps ensure that they’ve got a concept that is viable before they invest all that time in writing it. (Which is also the focus of my book The Idea.) In the past I’ve done posts about 8 of the other 10 genres: Fool Triumphant, Buddy Love, Whydunit, Golden Fleece, Rite of Passage, Out of the Bottle, Institutionalized and Dude with a Problem. (Only “Monster in the House” remains.) I highly recommend checking out those links, and the second book in Blake’s series, Save the Cat Goes to the Movies, which explores each genre’s five subgenres, with many movie examples for each. For the Superhero genre, this book broke it down into “Storybook Superhero” (like The Lion King), “Fantasy Superhero” ( The Matrix), “People’s Superhero” ( Gladiator) and “Comic Book Superhero” (all the Marvel and D.C. movies). Plus one last genre: “Real Life Superhero.” This is the one for writers who want to do true story adaptations about people who didn’t have literal physical super powers, but who did embark on a heroic mission of sorts against adversaries much more powerful than them, such as Erin Brockovich, Schindler’s List, Gandhi, Braveheart and Dallas Buyers Club. Notice in all of these there is a very clear antagonist/adversary that essentially functions as a super villain, and a very difficult mission to do the right thing, and save other people in some way. At the same time, the main character typically has a difficult personal journey and an arc of their own, as they struggle with playing this role in the world, and with the costs and pain that seem to come with it. This personal side is key, in any Superhero movie. What really makes audiences connect is relating to a character’s personal pain and emotional needs, beyond just the surface plot need to defeat the bad guys. Yes, they want to be entertained by the spectacle, awed by the visuals, and energized by the battles, but what makes things really resonate is a connection to a very human character dealing with struggles that anyone can relate to. And one struggle we can all relate to, ironically, is the feeling of being all alone, with a sense that no one really gets you, but with a need to achieve something that seems beyond you. In a sense, we’ve all been a “superhero” at some point in our lives: facing something huge and terrible, and having to rise up and be our best selves to defeat it — seemingly on our own. So if you’re interested in writing superhero movies of any sort, keep this in mind: It’s about universal emotional relatability, on a personal level, coupled with a heroic and difficult external challenge that is entertaining to watch, and yet feels real somehow to the world of the story. Actually one would be well served to keep those elements in mind for any story, in any genre or medium."

Medium.com,Arts & Entertainment,Politics Isn’t My Passion,Writing,https://medium.com/@lizardgrey/politics-isnt-my-passion-aa429b0ced1a?source=topic_page---------8------------------1," image courtesy of Pixabay Last night I was in a webinar that my coach, Karen Richards, hosts for her clients. Afterward I received a notification from someone in class who’d heard my latest piece was not about politics; apparently that had spurred her on to read it. This is what she said: I know politics is your passion and I’m not saying you should stop writing about it. Your writing is always top notch regardless of the subject. I would love to see more pieces like this, though. It’s definitely you. Now, she’s right. I had such a good time writing that piece. I really connected with my inner curmudgeon, and nothing makes me happier. Except maybe schadenfreude. Buy hey, Judy: Who said politics was my passion? I have spent the past year writing essays based on memoir. Now, some of those are political, because I cannot look at my life and where I was raised without writing about racism and misogyny. But those are issues that exist no matter who is in office. My passion is human nature with a major in irony, thank you very much. However, if I look at the pieces I’ve published on Medium since I joined in March of this year, 15 out of 17 are on politics. It sure does look like politics is my passion. I wonder how many other people are like me, who cannot stop writing about what is going on. Who are not writing about their passions; but are instead driven to write about this ludicrous situation in which we find ourselves. I keep meaning to get back to editing the memoir. Instead, I find myself hacking away at the mountain of problems Trump has created. Now, why is that? It’s because I am a number cruncher. My brother said this to me recently on a road trip. We have excellent conversations together while driving. It surprised me when he said that; it’s the last thing I would have called myself; I had to take Algebra twice in 9th grade. So I asked him what he meant. He said I have the ability to assess a lot of information at once; I can see the big picture about something, and all of its parts; then come to a reasonable conclusion fairly quickly. If that is a number cruncher then yes. I do know how to do that. I have always known how to do that. And this is why I can’t stop writing about this administration. I cannot make sense of it. At all. I cannot see how the hell we are going to get out of this mess. I keep batting away at it because it drives me nuts. Also, frighteningly, things are so bad I’ve lost my sense of humor about it. This is very disturbing, people. I can laugh at almost anything; and the reason I was a good disaster responder is because there is no mess too big for me. To paraphrase Chekov, it’s day to day life that kills me. But an emergency? My thinking speeds up and is crystal clear. My blood pressure drops. I am calm. I know what to do next. Follow me out, I will find the way. Lest you think I am a braggart, know this: I truly am an abject failure at daily life. Although this morning I got up out of bed and brushed my teeth, and got dressed within the first half hour of awakening. This is a major accomplishment; but you will have to read my memoir to find out why I am so constructed. (She says in a lame attempt at coyness, hoping to secure an agent.) Meanwhile, I write about politics. I write about politics because I desperately want to find a way out. I write about it because I feel like doing nothing is absolutely unacceptable; I want a record of how I tried to fight against what’s happening. I write about it because news organizations report on Trump’s actions as if they are standard, and they are not. I write about it because the entire Republican party has dropped the ball, and there are no brakes on this car. I write about it, too, because I think as bad as things are right now, they are even worse than we know. Donald Trump is just one man. He’s a small man; a hollow man. He represents the worst of America, to me; he’s all gold toilet with sub-standard, flimsy beams. He is a joke. But he’s an exceptionally dangerous joke, because incredibly, the entire Republican party has picked up his technique of lie and deny. It’s not Trump, it’s Trumpism, that’s a real danger. So, we the people find ourselves in a giant room of swarming locusts, made up of politicians, pseudo-journalists, real journalists, angry people on Twitter, Fox news, conspiracy theorists, and just as annoying, idealists. Trying to divine the truth out of this mess takes time and enormous patience. I started vetting news stories before the 2016 election. It’s tedious. Very few people have the time to do that. Americans are busy trying to survive their medical bills and mortgages. There are no longer one set of facts. This is crazy-making, because actually, there are. But because the president lies as easily as he breathes, and repeats those lies, they just sit there. They sit there, and they are referred to again and again as if they mean something. It is exhausting. Now it’s bad enough with one man doing that. But an entire political party doing that is catastrophic for our nation. Because they stood up for this treacherous, traitorous liar after the Mueller report came out, the GOP is just sticking to their guns, and fabricating anything they can to stay in power. They have abandoned their oaths of office; or, after decades in Washington, suddenly develop a need to spend more time with their families. I just wish we’d all stop pretending. We could, collectively, just stop. I wish news reporters and editors would just report GOP actions for what they are. Lindsey Graham, a Senator, has actually said he isn’t reviewing the evidence against Trump. The question reporters should be asking him is When are you handing in your resignation? If I were driving my car, and upon seeing my car, a man pushed a boulder down the hill into its path; a reporter might ask the man why he did it. But this reporter wouldn’t deny that he intentionally tried to make me crash. That goes without saying. Then they’d mention the jail where the man is being held, because it is against the law to try and kill people. No surprise there. So why do reporters ask questions like, Was there a quid pro quo? Why aren’t they asking, Hi, why did you try to bribe the president of the Ukraine to manufacture damaging info on your political opponent? Please note: the question shouldn’t be, Did you bribe? The question is Why. Matt Gaetz bursts into a hearing and screams it’s a sham, although, what a shock, Republicans have equal time to question witnesses. Let me write that headline for you: Young Congressman Makes Fool of Himself Trying to Look Tough. Then Nikki Haley, who certainly knows better, says Trump is truthful. She is lying and defending a documented, bald-faced liar. She is spreading propaganda. Yet somehow, in so doing, she seems to be securing herself a potential gig as vice-president. Lying seems to be working these days. Republicans are refusing to deal with reality. Instead, they harp on the Democrat’s obsession with impeaching this president from day one. Okay. Fine. Against all the evidence, let’s go along with their little scheme. Let’s say that all Democrats have done is try and get the president impeached. My phone records will show differently; I was a relentless caller to my Congressman and Nancy Pelosi to try and get him impeached, ever since I got to page 6 of the Mueller report. It took months of calling, begging, threatening. But for arguments sake, let’s say it’s true. The president still cannot try and get Ukraine to cough up dirt on a political opponent. It’s a terrible abuse of power. Not only that; it endangers our national security. It’s the Russians. All of our intelligence agencies agree. And what is even more incredible, the GOP acts like he isn’t the biggest liar on earth. As if he gladly gave up his tax returns. As if losing money in a casino in Atlantic City showed that he was a good business manager. As if our deficit hadn’t grown by 26%. Gee, I don’t know why these crazy Democrats would want this man out of office. So in this swarm of locusts, I try to figure out one piece of the puzzle for myself. I try and get to one bit of the truth, unobscured by false equivalencies that the media feel obliged to create. We’re so doomed. I write about the Trump administration to try and survive it."
Medium.com,Arts & Entertainment,How to Write Like a Thought Leader,Writing,https://medium.dave-bailey.com/how-to-write-like-a-thought-leader-d27b56503277?source=topic_page---------9------------------1," After starting on Medium just three years ago, my essays for entrepreneurs have reached millions of people and taken my career to new heights. But it hasn’t come easy. Each article takes me between 15 and 45 hours to produce, from idea to edited essay, depending on its complexity. And it’s not always obvious which took the longest to write. The simpler the idea, the more work probably went into it. Over the course of writing more than 80 essays, I’ve run a lot of experiments to try and improve the efficiency of my writing, but many of them haven’t worked. For example, I tried hard to work with a ghostwriter, but I just couldn’t get comfortable with another person’s words. It was quicker — and more satisfying — to write it myself. So here’s what goes into writing one of my essays. I hope it inspires you to share your big idea with the world. I started my first few essays by opening a blank Google Doc and staring at the big white canvas. I’d write the first sentence. Then delete it — it sucked. I’d write another first sentence. Then I’d delete that one too — not powerful enough. Rinse and repeat ad nauseam. I quickly realised that the first sentence wasn’t the most efficient place to start. The pressure was way too high. And yet, when I discussed the idea for an essay with a curious friend or colleague, the material flowed from my lips far more easily. Why was this the case? It turns out that answering questions is far easier than wrestling with a blank page. I just needed to find the right questions to get me started. But given that every idea is so different, how could I find questions that would apply to any given blog post? While each blog post is different, the most successful tend to follow a pattern. This diagram from Social Triggers describes an ideal structure for a blog post: I realised that if the ideal structure of a blog post could apply to any idea, maybe I could reverse engineer the questions I needed to ask to end up with the right material. That’s when I came up with the following questionnaire: All of my essays have since started with answers to these eight questions. I used a Google Form to capture all my blog ideas and every time I had a new idea, I submitted another entry. That is, until I found an even more powerful way. I’d always assumed that dictation was expensive, but Rev.com makes it cheap and easy. For $1 a minute, you can record your voice with their mobile app and receive a 99% perfect transcript within hours (and sometimes minutes). Incorporating Rev.com into my writing process has made it even easier to get ideas out of my head. Here’s a step-by-step of how I use it: 1) Answer the questionnaire. For each piece, I spend 5–15 minutes talking into the Rev app, answering in detail each of the eight questions above. My goal isn’t to dictate a perfect essay, just to get everything out of my head. 2) Curate the best bits. When I receive the transcript, I highlight the most interesting and powerful sentences, and then remove everything else. This leaves me with 30–40 sentences. 3) Reorder sentences under subtitles. I’ll spend some time thinking about the overall structure of the blog post, giving each section a subtitle. Then, I’ll organise the relevant sentences under each title. 4) Write out the first draft. I experimented with re-recording at this point, but I found that it’s easier just to write it. There’s no getting around the fact that you have to write at some point. This is by far the most time-consuming stage since it often requires further reading and evidence hunting. It’s not unusual for me to read dozens of other blog posts, or to consume a couple of books while researching an essay. 5) Sleep on it. After sleeping on it, I return to the first draft and read it over with fresh eyes. I’ll also pass it through Grammarly, a powerful online spell-checker, although it’s no substitute for a human proofreader. 6) Pass to an editor. If you’re serious about improving your writing, you need to work with an editor. My editor, Paul Fairbairn, goes far beyond merely correcting grammar, he helps me tweak the flow of a piece, check my sources, and clarify my message. ‘I read this twice . . . did you mean to say X?’ he often asks me. ‘Ah yes, that’s so much clearer,’ I usually reply. ‘Thank you!’ It was only when I started writing professionally that I fully grasped how little good writing we’re taught at school. Over the years, I’ve picked up some great advice from more experienced writers. Here are the ten best pieces of advice I’ve received: Writing has helped me in numerous ways. It’s forced me to clarify my ideas by capturing them in writing and exposing them to the outside world. As Cunningham’s law states: The best way to get the right answer on the internet is not to ask a question; it’s to post the wrong answer. Publishing a consistent flow of ideas has also helped me build my personal brand, a huge asset to any business leader, especially in the B2B space. Only your best articles will be shared, so the majority of your readers will only see your best bits. But perhaps the best part of writing is the ability to make a difference to someone, to provide ideas that help them in their life and career. And that’s a cause worth writing for."

Medium.com,Arts & Entertainment,Sales Letters Are Just Like Love Letters,Writing,https://medium.com/better-marketing/sales-letters-are-just-like-love-letters-119d49bdd960?source=topic_page---------12------------------1," A few days back, a friend of mine posted a status update of a love letter written in German. She teaches German to an English-speaking audience. And their assignment was a love letter. Of course, I couldn’t read a word of it. So she translated it. And I thought that it wasn’t a very good love letter. It was all about professing love for the recipient. I believed I could do better with my sales skills, so I embraced the challenge. To make it worthwhile, I had the ladies in my sphere of contact agree to judge how good my letter was. To be honest, it was a bit challenging to share it. A love letter is about making yourself vulnerable, putting emotions to words, and opening oneself up for criticism (as the judges can come off as harsh). And it is the same as a sales letter. A sales letter is not about selling; instead, it is about making the reader buy. If you can’t write a good love letter, I doubt if your sales letter can be any good. Here is the letter (and surprisingly, it’s my first attempt): Hey, I saw a custom piece of jewelry today. It has a shiny silver color that fits any brightly colored dress. The front view has three rows of bling that drop down towards the cleavage. There are tiny diamond pearls that glitter on any source of light. The most interesting part of it is that it has your name inscribed beautifully between the second and the third row. But that is just the beginning of the weird part. As I stopped to admire it in this jewelry store, the concierge began to give me the usual sales talk. Damn, I know all the words and emotional hot buttons, but it’s still working on me like crazy. My heart was racing. He caught me red-handed. I stared for too long. “You do know someone with that name, don’t you?” he asked. I had to smile. As he attempted to speak your name, I hushed him right there. “No, thank you.” The price tag of $2,500 got me thinking, “is it worth the risk?” As I made my way back, I was forced to make another stop at the florist. I wasn’t driving, so I had to cave in. I sat in the car for a while, but then I had to take a closer look at some lovely roses. There were these particular ones that were whitish-pink. Here is the crazy part: they smell exactly like you did the last time we had lunch (where you wore the grey t-shirt with a teddy bear on the front, the blue crazy jeans, and the black shoes you stole from your sister). You remember I told you that you smelled good, and you kept shrugging it off. Until the waitress mentioned it too. I think you blushed at that moment, but I know you’ll still say you didn’t. Unfortunately, some of those roses made it to the car, and I had to smell you all the way home. When I got home, it felt kind of uneasy because I couldn’t smell you anymore. I didn’t even have the energy to cook or microwave. I came to bed hungry… But my brain has refused to shut down. I miss you like crazy, — Jared P.S. I bought the jewelry. But I can’t gift it to you unless I know we're official. Well, I shared the letter and asked for a score and response from the ladies. In my mind, the letter was good. In fact, I think it was very good. But I had to see what those who are on the receiving side had to say about it. One mistake I see a lot of businesses make in sales copy is that they assume that their copy is great. Your copy is never great until the intended audience says it is. If the audience doesn’t find it attractive and compelling, it just isn’t. And it is not about what they say, it’s about what it makes them do. Now that I’ve shared my letter, you should see the results, too. Out of a total of 10, my average score was 7.3. My lowest score was 4 and my highest score was 10. In fact, the lady gave me “over 10"". Here is the interesting part — all those who scored me below 7 had almost the same problem. In the letter, I mentioned the cost of the piece of jewelry I got for the recipient. Those who scored me below 7 said that mentioning the cost was a turnoff. That was pretty interesting to me. I thought the cost would make them like it more. Apparently, it did the opposite. Your assumptions are worth nothing until it is tested. Test every part of your appeal. Test the graphics. This is because when you get the letter right, you can run it multiple times or create a formula from it for your audience. Some dudes went out of their way to score me for the love letter. The average score from them was zero. This, however, proved that the letter was good. If your sales letter turns off those who are not your intended audience, it is a sign that it would appeal more to those who are your audience. There are a few improvements I discovered from the ladies: It’s more of the same in sales. A long copy has been proven to do better than short copy. Customers love details. And hot buttons make the sale primarily emotionally triggered. They must feel it before they can buy it. The experience was a good one. I challenged all the guys who gave me rubbish scores to write their own love letters and make it public. But I don’t think they will be doing that. Writing love letters is my newfound way of improving my copywriting skills. I think I’ll be writing one every weekend now."
Medium.com,Arts & Entertainment,How To Sound More Like Yourself When You Write,Writing,https://medium.com/better-marketing/how-to-sound-more-like-yourself-when-you-write-8065768b169a?source=topic_page---------13------------------1," “Talent alone cannot make a writer. There must be a man behind the book.” — Ralph Waldo Emerson When I first started writing on Medium, I struggled to find my writing voice. You see, when I write copy for clients, I write with their voice. Not mine. I use different tones for corporations, universities, not-for-profits, and professional membership organizations. These could be pre-determined by style guides, content format, or simply according to the whim of the department manager. So when I started sharing my writing under my name, I wrote in a professional, friendly, yet impersonal tone. But I felt unsatisfied. And as I kept reading the work of other writers, I found a crapload of generic writing out there. Writing that doesn’t sound like anyone. Writing that sounds robotic. This type of writing doesn’t make me feel. And I want to feel. I want to feel something: happy, inspired, amused, determined… anything. I want to connect to the ideas. To the stories. To the writer. To be understood. To feel less alone. I realized my writing did help people feel. But not enough. And it was missing something important: Me. I was hiding behind my words. Finding our authentic voice in writing helps us connect with our readers — just as we connect to the people in our daily lives. You see, it’s easy to blabber out a list of ways to do this or that. Or quote this person or that person with bits of factual, bland fillers in between. It’s easy to write copy-cat inspirational yada yadas. But it wasn’t as easy to show myself in my words. What a strange problem, I thought. I was surprised and confused. I had no idea how hard it was to write with my own voice. I realized it mattered when I was helping small businesses write copy and put themselves out there. But it never seemed as hard as doing that myself. I swayed, fumbled, and spewed out crap that left a bad taste in my mouth. Like the morning after a big night out. It made me think: What makes the difference between blah and brilliant writing?
What attracts us to one writer more than another? It’s more than whether they have a journalism degree.
It’s more than whether they’ve written a bestselling book.
It’s more than how well they stick to grammar rules. I reckon it comes down to this: Who do you like and trust? Think about the people you like — why do you like them? Is it because of what they know and what qualifications they have?
It is because of what job they had last?
Is it because they’ve achieved what we want?
How much money they have?
Or because we envy their masses of followers? Sometimes it’s confusing. We think we should like someone. But when we dig deep down, we realize we actually don’t like them at all. And the people we do like, why do we like them? Perhaps they give rather than take constantly.
They‘re on your wavelength.
They empathize with your day.
They make you smile.
They challenge you.
They care about you and inspire you.
They are honest, with no ulterior motives.
They say it as it is.
They follow through. No irritating “oh look at me, my life is perfect all the time” crap. No preachy “you must”, “you should”, “you have to”. Just a real person, with the same ups and downs we all have in life. We tend to trust people we can relate to, don’t we? Well, it’s the same with writing. That’s why it’s so important that you identify your voice — and write strongly, and consistently in that voice. So readers hear the real you. If they decide they like and trust you, they’ll be more receptive to your message."

Most of the gift suggestions listed here have been tried and tested by me, a professional marketing writer and editor working out of a home-based office for almost 20 years. I discovered many of these gifts while searching for a solution to a concrete problem, like “How can I keep these cords from turning into a jumbled ball in my bag?” and “isn’t there a decent set of headphones I can plug into my phone for calls?” Other gifts I discovered through my fascination with office supply stuff — all things paper, pens, and notebooks.

hen we’re on the cusp between elementary school and middle school, one of the scariest things we can think of is going to a new school and sitting at a lunch table alone. At least, that was what used to frighten me as a small-town girl growing up in an insulated environment some years ago. Suffice it to say, the world has changed quite a bit since then. My greatest childhood fear before middle school certainly reflects first world problems and white privilege, I know. That doesn’t mean that the fear was any less real just because kids today have to worry about their schools being shot up by the local gun-toting lunatic who should never have had a gun in the first place. I was 12, and I was worried that I wouldn’t have lunchtimes with my friends. I could end up sitting alone, the friendless loser no one wanted to know. It was a fear we all shared and whispered about between classes. We would comfort each other that it would never happen. We would surely get the same lunchtimes, or if we didn’t, we’d still make new friends. I didn’t know that there could be worse things to fear, like moving away from all my friends, or that the very thing I feared would happen. Picture it: a crowded inner-city lunchroom and me, quiet and unsure. I spent most of that first lunch period in middle school in line, and the few minutes I had to eat, I ate alone. In a crowded cafeteria with overflowing tables, I sat by myself unable to bridge the gap between me and the others and incapable of trying to make a place for myself with anyone else. My nightmare, come to life. I never let it happen again. If we carry a book everywhere, it doesn’t matter if no one sits with us at lunch because we brought all our closest friends with us. It doesn’t matter that they are characters in a book who can’t hang out with us in gym class. We are not alone. Or at least, we don’t feel alone. It got to the point where I was happier reading than socializing anyway, ignoring invitations to join the others at tables overflowing with conversation. I didn’t care for the noise or the company. I just wanted to enjoy whatever adventure was unfolding on the pages in my hands. My love affair started out with Nancy Drew and the Babysitter’s Club, Anne of Green Gables and The Secret Garden. It spilled over into classic literature. Any book I could read, I did read, preferring fiction over anything else. My appetite grew, and my tastes changed, but I didn’t stop. I could read a book a day, given enough time. And there was always enough time to read. When we relocated yet again, I had my books to provide a buffer between me and the outside world. High school drama could ebb and flow, but I was safe between my pages. I didn’t have to participate. Of course, my Spanish teacher saw what I was doing, kidnapped my books, and locked me out of the classroom between classes so that I had no choice but to socialize. Eventually, she returned my captive books to me, but I now had to squeeze reading time around hanging out with my two new best friends. They were friends when I didn’t have any. They gave me a broader worldview than I could have had in small-town Tennessee or even in the city we moved to afterward. They helped me managed my anxiety and deal with my emotions. They inspired me and taught me and never left my side. Literally. Even now, I carry a book in my purse. I am never without one. But I don’t use them as a form of defense anymore, a barrier between me and the world. If there’s ever an escape, it’s the good kind. The self-care variety. A delicious treat to myself in the little downtime I have available. As a child, I’d harbored a hope that I would, one that was thoroughly stomped out by as many adults as possible. Even other children doubted that I could take my hobby of reading and my love of writing and turn it into something that paid real money to live on. For years, I internalized their beliefs, and I did many jobs that I was good at but didn’t love. But eventually, I took that leap. I still encounter skepticism when I say that I do, in fact, make my living as a writer. It’s funny that the disbelief continues, all evidence to the contrary. Some of us write full-time. It’s a thing. I now write them, creating worlds and populating them with people who live in my head. My entire world is stories and books and writing. It’s not just my living; it’s my passion. Maybe it all started as a form of protection, a talisman against an unfriendly world quick to leave out a quiet new girl with a strong accent and little life experience. But it developed into a passion that turned into a career. It’s my life’s purpose, my higher calling. Books saved me. Now I write them. There’s a beautiful symmetry in that."

I sought to win new clients by demonstrating my expertise. To achieve that goal, I wrote about marketing and copywriting. There are benefits to writing about the things you know. You act as a teacher. The process forces you to think deeply and break down complexity into simplicity. Plus, you get to show off your expertise to potential clients. Today, I rarely touch those subjects. Much of my writing now focuses on my experiences and life lessons. Writing about your expertise benefits both you and your readers. But consider this. You miss out on more profound growth when you maintain a professional distance between your personal life and your words. Writing about yourself yields surprising benefits. These benefits extend far beyond improving your writing skills or flaunting your mastery."

But what about spec fic — sprawling fantasy worlds, intrigue on a space station, a New New York where magic runs through the telephone lines? How can you know what you don’t know? Short answer: by reading. Reading is our doorway into worlds that we’re not familiar with. Not only that, it teaches us about the craft through exposure. This is a great way to learn the tricks of the trade. If you want to make it as a writer, you have to be a reader, too. Not just any reader, but a hungry and enthusiastic reader. Read more than just your preferred genre; read everything you can get your hands on. Read far and wide. Read in depth. Read for fun and read for craft. Yes, writers, I said read for pleasure. But here’s the thing: If you’re a writer, my money says you can no longer just sit back and read for fun — you probably can’t turn your writer brain off and just enjoy a book/essay/article. I know I can’t. And that’s okay! Whether you’re enjoying or analyzing work, the most important thing is that you are consuming it. I’ve heard it all and I’ve said it all: I’m too busy, I don’t have time, I can’t read when there’s too much around the house to do, I drive too much and don’t sit still to read, I can’t just read without getting distracted. My friends, I have an answer for you. Listening to audiobooks counts as reading. I know, I know. Scandal! Travesty! Blasphemy! You’re not a real bibliophile if you do this! Say what you will, but I get to spend an hour and a half to two hours nearly every day reading because I listen to audiobooks while I drive to and from work and while I cook for myself and my partner or prepare fresh parrot food in the evenings before bed. And I still have an active social life and have time to write most days. Let go of your old fashioned biases and you can have it all! What do you think, writers? Do you think audiobooks count as reading books? Why or why not? Leave me a comment with your thoughts because I’d love to hear them! Whatever you do, read far and wide! Read whatever you can get your hands on! Whether it’s your favorite genre or something you wouldn’t normally pick up, read it! If it’s a New Yorker article or a Twitter thread about history, read it! It can be an article about the Presidential race or or a puff piece about a celebrity you love. Just read it! Read it and, if you can, study it. Learn from it. Analyze it. Figure out why it works or why it doesn’t. And file that away for the next time you go to put words on the page yourself. Honestly, I don’t care how you manage to get it done, but please: Read. Read a novel. Read a short story. Read an article. Read a tweet. Read, read, read, my friends."

Medium.com,Arts & Entertainment,Five Golden Rules for Writers,Writing,https://medium.com/swlh/five-golden-rules-for-writers-a3b46b044b5b?source=topic_page---------24------------------1," Regardless of what sort of writer you are and how much you love to write, there are probably days when you’d rather clean ditches than face another blank page. As writers, we face common challenges; staying motivated and confident, avoiding “writer’s block,” and meeting goals (on time!) are some of the toughest. Here is some of the best practical advice I’ve come by, or discerned myself, for becoming and remaining productive, creative, and content while traversing the writer’s path. Try implementing these “Five Golden Rules” and see if they work for you. This is maybe the most important, and most difficult to follow of the Golden Rules. There is actually a subset of rules under this category, since there are many ways to “dwell” and many things to dwell on. Take heed, then, that thou shalt never: Stop writing for a time because you received a discouraging rejection letter. Whether or not you’ve been published yet, mark a file folder “Acceptance Letters” and expect to fill it eventually. Your day will come. Stop writing for a time because you’ve completed something or because you’ve had an acceptance. There is a tendency to relax, to say: “Ah, I’ve done it.” Savor the moment, sure; but don’t get overly lazy with your writing. Move on to your next project. Reread every sentence, paragraph, etc. after you’ve just written it. Learn to disengage your “editor” self until the work is finished you’ll be much more efficient and prolific this way. Well, maybe not “gleefully.” But it is true: you can learn from rejections. Therefore: Test your work on other writers you admire and listen to what they bring up, both the compliments and the criticisms. If you receive a rejection letter that contains comments on why your piece was turned down, read it, file it, and think about it; decide if you should edit the work some more before sending it out again. Chances are if the editor took the time to write a note to you, they saw some kind of potential in your work that’s the next best thing to being accepted! Finally, remember that you must study your markets carefully, and be selective about what article, story, etc. you send to what publication. Rejection might simply indicate that you sent your work to the wrong place. If you are sending stuff out to editors, you must keep track of what you send, where you send it, and when you send it. One good way to keep a log is to create a table, either with your word processor or by hand, with columns marked for:1. Title of work or query; 2. Title of journal, magazine, etc. you sent to; 3. Date sent; 4. Date accepted or rejected (mark A or R, date); 5. Other places the work was sent. Make sure not to leave out 5, since you don’t want to waste time re-sending a piece to somewhere it has been turned down. You might want to mark beside 2 how long you expect to wait for a reply, if you have this information. Print off extra copies of your cover letters and keep them in a file with the submitted pieces attached. You might also want to log how many hours you spend writing each day, week, etc., to help keep you honest. Organize your correspondence, research materials, notes, and other important documents and keep them in handy portable file boxes. Everyone has heard the sermon about writing “what you know.” It’s good to keep in mind, however, that what you don’t yet know can be learned, through research or contact with other people. As long as it interests you, it’s a topic worthy of pursuing. Go to the library and look it up;watch a documentary; conduct interviews with experts; listen to people’s stories, memories and impressions. Then write. If it bores you silly, but you feel you should write about it because: (a) it’s a marketable subject/theme; (b) someone has asked you to write about it; © everyone else is writing about it; or (d) nobody else is writing about it go ahead, if you’ll receive proper compensation for your boredom. If not, leave it alone. If your subject excites you tremendously, but seems to bore everyone else, you can: write it anyway because it’s good for the soul; scour the publishing world for a suitable market, since there’s bound to be someone who shares your (possibly obscure) interest; or slant your article/story to suit a particular publication. You can substitute the ceiling, some tea, and doodling if you wish. As long as you get away from the work for a bit to relax, ponder, daydream, pet the cat. “But that’s a waste of precious time,” you say. Not true. On the contrary: you can’t ignore this rule and expect to flourish as a writer. Why? Because “goofing off” actually serves to fuel your imagination and restock your creative resources. You can’t expect to function physically without sleep, right? Likewise, you can’t expect to function as a writer unless you occasionally . . . Do other creative things, whether you’re “good” at them or not. Make a cartoon with stick figures. Try watercolors. Take a dance class. Improvise a song while you shower. Move around. You’ll notice that your mind tends to go numb at about the same point your butt does: that’s your signal to get up and take a walk outside, wrestle with the kids, do Tai Chi, whatever. Just move. Is there a character in your story whose been giving you grief? Maybe you haven’t gotten to know her properly yet, or she you. Invite her to shuffle about your brain while you peel potatoes and ask her a few questions you’ll be surprised at how agreeable she becomes. Get out of the house! Or office. Cabin fever is a continuous occupational hazard for writers, but you don’t have to succumb: get together with friends, or simply be around other people in a public place. There you have them, the golden rules. Maybe you knew them already at least intuitively. I find, however, that it’s good to be explicit about how we structure and govern our writing lives. Without rules to live by, and goals to strive for, our art suffers languishes from lack of discipline and drive. So buck up and commit the rules to memory, recite them once a day. And write, write, write!"

There are three tools out there that can seriously improve your writing before it’s published on Medium, or any other blog, website, or social media page. Each of the following tools offers both free and premium versions, depending on the level of service that you require. Use this piece as a reference to help you sharpen your craft and become a better writer. As a writer with over thirteen years of professional online writing experience, Grammarly Premium has helped me to improve my skills more than any other software available online. Why? Because I’m human and I make mistakes, on a daily basis. Grammarly identifies my mistakes and helps me to correct them. English/American-Engish Checking: On a busy week, I can write upwards of fifty pieces of work. Grammarly helps me to weed out any grammatical errors and can also help to correct my spelling when flicking between English and American-English. Plagiarism Check: Grammary Premium checks your articles against hundreds of thousands of online pieces to ensure that your work is original. If you use a lot of common phrases, your work may be part-plagiarised. Luckily, Grammarly highlights the copied sentences in purple, and you can get your plagiarism score down to zero before publishing or submitting your work to an editor. 2. BuzzSumo: BuzzSumo helps writers to find topics that trend on social media via an easy to use interface, and much more. This will show you the total number of shared articles that relate to your keyword. For example: Let’s say you enter “How to Write Better Article for Medium”, there could be an article entitled “How to Write for Medium Publications” shared over 200,000 times on social media. Buzz Sumo will find the most viral topics relating to your search terms. So… how does this help you? OK, so maybe this doesn’t work great for every industry. But let’s say you search for something related to healthcare or travel. Sift through the results, and see which domains show up multiple times. The domains with multiple appearances are probably nailing the whole Content Marketing thing. Research them a bit, and look at what they’re doing for writing inspiration.
Plus, if you want to cut through all the fluff, you can even filter the results for article type and word length. Enter a keyword, and it shows you dozens of topic ideas that relate to that keyword. It shows the articles that are most popular, along with the keywords those articles are ranking for. For example, You enter “Writing Tips,” and you get back dozens of articles about writing advice, summary writing, and lots of other related topics. Looking for popular topics will help you create content that resonates with your desired audience! The social media information will help you to create pieces that go viral. Just do the math…

Hemingway Editor: Hemingway is a fantastic yet simple word processor and proofreading application that’s created to help writers. It can be downloaded to the desktop or accessed online. Hemingway has personally helped me write more clearly, and improved the clarity of my writing. This editing software detects adverbs, difficult to read sentences, complex phrases or words, and the use of the passive voice within the text. Any issues are highlighted with colours so that writers can quickly identify and rectify their mistakes. Hemingway Editor can be integrated with both Medium and WordPress directly from their online application; writers can also type their work directly into the app, which saves time copying and pasting. As a freelance writer, I use all three of these applications to ensure that I can provide my clients with the best possible writing work. Good luck, and keep writing."
Medium.com,Arts & Entertainment,On Editing,Writing,https://medium.com/writers-blog/on-editing-a06732293c91?source=topic_page---------28------------------1," Presenting your work to a professional standard can be complicated at best. You’ll, of course, have an editor to help you with style guides and the like but what can you do to make sure that your work is in good shape before presenting it? We all hope that editors and agents will be able to move past typing errors, or the incorrect formatting of our manuscripts and see the artistic genius behind our writing. Unfortunately, that’s not really how the industry works. The truth is that reading an unedited piece of work is difficult. Judging a piece of work based on what it could become rather than on what it is now is difficult for anyone who wants to invest in your work. It’s your job as a writer to polish your manuscript to the best of your ability. It should shine as much as it can in front of the people you want to impress. If your agents or editors have to read a messy manuscript, they will find it difficult to see your work for what it could become. Give your book it’s best shot by editing and proofreading it yourself. Iron out as many of the issues as you can, this will ensure that when you do present it to the people that matter, they will see the story in a much kinder light. No matter how much you’ve polished your text, if it isn’t presented correctly, it could face rejection. There are agents out there who won’t even open your letter if it isn’t in a shiny brand new envelope. Harsh as that sounds it makes sense… if you’re not willing to give your book the best chance, why should they? Your work has to look its best — clean, fresh, as error-free as you can get it and easy to read. The first thing that you can do is get someone you trust to check your manuscript for typos or spelling mistakes. It can be hard for a writer to proofread their own work because we already know how the story is going to go. Our brain fills in the blanks and the correct words automatically. Letting someone else proofread means you have a better chance of catching most of the errors. I know that there are a lot of details in there, but seriously layout is everything. It’s like the phrase “you eat with your eyes first”. It’s the same principle for reading, and you want to make sure your manuscript is as attractive as possible to an editor. The title page is import for several reasons, but the first reason is that it announces to whoever is reading that you are serious about what you do. The second most important reason for a title page is for when your book gets accepted by a publisher. The title page gets detached from the rest of the manuscript and sent to the accounts department. That’s why it’s vital to have your contact information on the title page, and the title and author name at the foot of every page. Your title page should also include an approximate word count at the bottom of the page. You should round to the nearest hundred for short stories and the nearest thousand for novels. Never staple your pages together, for a short piece use a paper clip for longer pieces use an elastic band. Flatpack your pages without folding them, no creases or crinkles please, you want your work to look shiny and new, and of course, invest in a new envelope when sending out your manuscript. You want to make sure the receiver is paying attention to your work. Something used won’t do the job!"

If you’re participating this year, then, chances are you’re doing some of the same things I am right now: questioning all my life choices, wondering why I couldn’t have been good at math and just become an engineer or doctor and never been artistic at all, wallowing in my own self-pity while cocooned by comfort foods and multiple WiFi-connected devices. If you’ve ever worked on any large creative project- whether it be a novel, publishing daily comics on Instagram, making a cookbook, recording an album, or crafting any sort of portfolio of work- you probably understand this feeling too. One of the worst and best revelations you can have as you develop your craft is seeing that the point when everything you touch seems like irredeemable, derivative garbage is a normal part of the process. You can’t make something without any mistakes, and it’s almost impossible to put something out into the real world that’s as good as you dreamt it would be. It can make you feel unqualified, unworthy, and incapable. Moving past that feeling is the difference between people who finish what they start, and people who don’t. Yes, your work might actually be trash. The problem is, you won’t really know unless you finish it, edit it, edit it some more, and then step back and look at it in the harsh light of day. It sucks. This month, I’m working on a complete, from-scratch rewrite of a manuscript I finished earlier this year. I spent hundreds of hours on the project and realized upon rereading it, that nearly all of it had to be scrapped. Writing the first draft again now, I’m questioning every choice. Every part of it seems subpar. It’s not what I wanted. Why can’t I just make the art I want to make? Why do I have to be so bad at everything? I spent this afternoon staring at a blank page and wondering if I was writing the wrong book entirely. Then, I took a break, readjusted my plot, and kept going. I don’t know if it’s going to work out, but I do know that I have to finish it to find out. I can only do so much valuable evaluation and planning until I reach the end. I can’t see the forest for the trees while I’m lost in it- for lack of a better metaphor. See? Even this article is giving me trouble today. I keep asking myself why I can’t be better, knowing the answer is that I need more practice. So I keep going and pray there will be something worth editing and learning from on the other end. If you’re struggling too, here are some tips to help you through the roughest patches. What helps you work through a slump? Let me know in the comments!"
Medium.com,Arts & Entertainment,"Writing, Fast Food, and Adventure",Writing,https://writingcooperative.com/writing-fast-food-and-adventure-d67d1683a4a5?source=topic_page---------31------------------1," Lately, it’s been hard to know what I want to keep writing about — I’ve been dabbling in a few topics to find what the best fit for me. Writing is a mystery. What gets read and what gets shared around, isn’t up to us authors. All we can do is find our niche and keep writing. Experimenting means trying new styles, finding what we’re comfortable with. Going through as many permutations as possible. That’s our duty as beginners. In my own experience, I’ve never had a clear idea of exactly what to write about, but I’ve always had this vision of demonstrating progress. Whether it was in a video series, writing, language learning — I want my work to demonstrate that someone can go from a beginner to an expert. This would make my work meaningful. Writing every day has allowed me to quickly understand who my audience is, what they like, and what I’m willing to write for them. It’s helped me get comfortable with my own style of writing and the physical act of writing itself. You’ll be surprised how effective writing every day is. There are days when it’s easier than others. Writing every day you’ll give yourself a head start, so on the days where writing isn’t coming so easy, you have a backlog of things that you can work on editing and polishing. We have to get into some topic and write about that as much as we can, but especially when we are new at something, it’s important to find what makes you comfortable. I used to work as a kitchen chef at Chipotle. In the beginning, I was responsible for making rice and washing the dishes. Everyone had their own unique method. One of the crucial steps was to mix in the seasoning with the rice. Everyone had a different way of holding the spatula, spinning the bowl to mix the ingredients. The staff bonded during the dinner rush showing each other how to wash the dishes just a little bit faster. I remember trying several different grips until I found the one I liked best. We in the writing community do the same thing when we’re reading something we might not be interested in. I’m a part of several Facebook groups dedicated to Medium writers who aim to hone their craft. In these groups, we’re exposed to so many different styles and genres of writing. Reading each of these works with a critical eye gives us something to take home to our writing every time. We get a better understanding of how each topic performs, how we can hone our own craft. The pieces that have been the most successful for me haven’t always been those which I was sure about. I’ve been very surprised to try something completely new and find it has been very successful. Similarly, I’ve written things that completely flop or get negative reviews. This is to be expected. One of the pieces I wrote without much pretension ended up being one of my most successful pieces. One of the pieces I wrote expecting to go really well flopped miserably. Those flops might be due to bad timing or not having the write home, bad titles — all things that if we experiment enough we can get better at solving. Writing is an expansive world. In exploring and getting as close to its limits, we expand our worlds (and our audiences.) It is in learning the intersection between what is fun for us to write and what is well received that we can enjoy our writing process. As creatives, we have to exercise our ability to create, not just the same thing over and over, but new and exciting things. That means sometimes risking things and trying something new. Our job as writers is not only to write. We aren’t being dictated to, we have to actively decide what will go on the page from thin air. It’s our responsibility to engage with our writing and our readers. We have to understand where we can best fit ourselves. Find what gives you those warm and fuzzy feelings, and make your best effort to share your warm and fuzzies with anyone willing to accept them!"

Use These 3 Simple Strategies,Writing,https://medium.com/swlh/3-simple-writing-strategies-that-will-improve-your-writing-fe237e9908f2?source=topic_page---------32------------------1," I didn’t just wake up one morning and decide — I love to write. In fact, English was my second language, so reading and writing was more difficult for me than for others my age. It wasn’t until I learned specific tools that my writing became better. Writing turned into a fun way to communicate to the world, rather than a daunting task. In this post, I‘ll share the most effective tools and strategies I’ve learned that will instantly amp-up any piece of writing. Creating organization in your writing is key. The truth is, people, get frustrated reading a piece of writing that has no clear organization. Trust me, I know from experience. A professor once wrote on the bottom of my Final essay, “this is frustrating to read!” My writing used to be unorganized and it made no sense to people who read it. 1. Research the topic you will write about. The trick is, look at many different sources. Get books from the library or bookstore or read a variety of different online articles and/or forums. One of my favourite tools for research is Google Scholar. Imagine, unlimited expert knowledge at your fingertips. Google Scholar is a free database where you can learn what industry experts are researching and writing about. This tool also offers related searches section so you can see what a common search query might be for the keyword you are searching."
