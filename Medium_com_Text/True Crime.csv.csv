Medium.com,Arts & Entertainment,The Heinous Crimes of Cordelia Botkin,True Crime,https://medium.com/@hlemonroe/the-heinous-crimes-of-cordelia-botkin-552d7d9e51d6?source=topic_page---------0------------------1," C
ordelia Adelaide Botkin, née Brown, was born around1854 in Kansas City, Missouri. In 1872, Cordelia married a man named Welcome Botkin and the couple had one son together, Beverly. They made their home in Stockton, California, where Welcome worked as a grain broker. The couple became estranged. In 1895, Cordelia met John Preston Dunning. Although she was nearly a decade older than him, John was smitten with the 41-year-old married woman. Although John developed an infatuation with Cordelia, he was married to Mary Elizabeth Penington-Dunning, and they had a baby daughter, Elizabeth. The married couple lived at 2529 California Street, in San Francisco. Mary’s parents were Congressman John Brown and Rebecca Rowan Penington of Dover, Delaware. C
ordelia thought very highly of herself, despite her frumpy appearance and advancing age. She bragged about being photographed in over 100 poses, her favorite pose being with her hands behind her head, and elbows out — very haughty for Victorian America. If there was anyone she loved better than herself, it was surely John Dunning. Cordelia met John while he was biking in Golden State Park. John was a better alcoholic and gambler than a husband. He served as AP Bureau Chief in San Francisco. Unfortunately, John lost his job when his employer caught him embezzling over $4000 to pay his gambling debts. Cordelia and John carried out a torrid affair for three years. When John’s wife got wind of the relationship in 1896, she would not turn a blind eye. Mary, a deeply religious woman with a respectable upbringing, didn’t care to spend her days keeping her husband on the straight and narrow. She took their daughter, Elizabeth, and went right home to Dover. Cordelia lived at the Victoria Hotel. John rented a room their also, to easier facilitate their clandestine affair. At some point, John mentioned to his mistress that his wife loved chocolate, and she had a friend in the city named Mrs. Corbaley. John’s journalism work called him away to cover the Spanish-American war. He told Cordelia that when he came home, it would be to his wife and child in Dover — not to her. She begged and pleaded for him to reconsider. John assured her he would not return to San Francisco. Cordelia saw him off on his journey and cried bitter goodbye tears. C
ordelia lost her ever-loving mind at the idea of John reuniting with his wife. She wrote taunting letters to Mary, warning her against any plans she might have of reconciliation. That summer, Cordelia went to Owl Drug Store, where she purchased two ounces of powdered arsenic and stewed in a jealous rage. She became curious about how it would be to die of arsenic poisoning. Friends describe Cordelia’s demeanor during these months as “melancholy, and almost delirious.” On July 31, 1898, She purchased a box of chocolates from Market Street Candy Store in San Francisco. Cordelia bought chocolates, and asked the clerk, Emma Herbert, to pack them in a plain box, and to leave enough room for a present. Emma complied. She next went to a novelty store called “The City of Paris” and bought a handkerchief. Cordelia prepared the package neatly, and anonymously. The box was fancy and lacked the logo needed to connect it with the Market Street Candy Store, or with her. The chocolate bonbons inside, laced with lethal amounts of arsenic. Cordelia placed the handkerchief on top, the bottom corner of which was embroidered “The City of Paris.” The letter read, “With love to yourself and baby. — Mrs. C.” Cordelia didn’t put a return address when she mailed the package from Ferry Station Post Office in San Francisco on August 4, 1898. The box addressed to Mrs. John P Dunning, arrived at the Dover Post Office five days later. The Penington family sent Mary’s young nephew, Harry, to get the mail. Henry handed the package to Mary. She had no reason to believe anyone would send her poisoned candy. She, her sister Ida Dean, Ida’s two small children, and two friends shared the candy as they visited on the veranda. Almost immediately, everyone who at the candy became violently ill with stomach pain and intense vomiting. Mary and Ida ate more chocolates than the others. The next morning, Mary Elizabeth Dunning died. Her sister, Ida, followed her in death on August 11. M
ary’s father immediately launched an investigation when he noticed the handwriting on the package of candy matched that of the anonymous letters his daughter received. The first person law enforcement wanted to speak with was Mary’s husband, John. John made his way to Dover as soon as he heard his wife was dead. When presented with the package and the letters, he also knew his mistress, Cordelia Botkin, was responsible. A chemist, Dr. Wood, examined the chocolates and confirmed the candy contained arsenic. He suddenly recalled telling Cordelia about his wife’s penchant for candy and her friend Mrs. Corbaly — “Mrs. C.” Detective BJ McVey brought the evidence to San Francisco, and John contributed love letters Cordelia gave him. Theodore Kytka, an expert in handwriting analysis, confirmed that Cordelia wrote the note with the box of poisoned candy, as well as the anonymous letters. Chief of police Isaiah Lees led the investigation. The first order of business was to get Cordelia in custody before she fled. It wasn’t difficult. She was in Stockton with her estranged husband and son. In days that followed, clerks from the candy store, drug store, and novelty shop all recognized Cordelia. Miss Henely from the Market Shop further swore the box sent to Dover was identical in every way to the one she sold Cordelia. The postal clerk who assisted Cordelia when she mailed the package happened to be named John Dunnigan. Naturally, he remembered the box addressed to Mrs. John Dunning since the name was so similar to his own. Cordelia’s crimes were unprecedented, in that they occurred through the mail over two jurisdictions. After some considerable back and forth between attorneys in Delaware and California, the supreme court ruled that Judge Carroll Cook would hear the case in San Franciso. On December 30, 1892, Judge cook found Cordelia Botkin guilty of two counts of murder in the first degree. On February 4, he handed her a life sentence. After her sentencing, Cordelia was remanded to the Branch County Jail rather than San Quentin State Penitentiary. Sadly, Judge Cook’s wife passed away. He often visited her grave. One such Sunday, the judge was on his way to pay his respects. To his astonishment, he saw Cordelia riding along in a streetcar. She was completely unaccompanied by any guards. As it turned out, Cordelia was trading sexual favors for a bit of freedom. After the great San Francisco Earthquake of 1906, the jail became too crowded, and Cordelia could no longer enjoy the small comforts the little jail offered. She was transferred to San Quentin after all. C
ordelia lived the remainder of her life in prison. During her final years, the people Cordelia cared about started to die off in rapid succession. Her husband, Welcome, died on May 2, 1904, of the same heart condition that would claim her son the next year. Her father passed away in Healdsburg, Californa, in 1900. Years of drinking caught up with John Preston Dunning, and he died in April of 1907. Naturally, Cordelia became depressed. Her sorrow was so great that her health began to suffer. Whether she was sorry for Killing Mary Elizabeth Dunning and her sister, or sorry because she was caught is anyone’s guess. On March 7, 1910, Cordelia passed away in prison. Her death certificate lists the cause of death as “Softening of the brain, due to melancholy.” She was 56 years old."
Medium.com,Arts & Entertainment,The Moonlight Murders and the Phantom Killer,True Crime,https://medium.com/@delanirbartlette/the-moonlight-murders-and-the-phantom-killer-3f532f53d9d0?source=topic_page---------1------------------1," In 1946, Texarkana, a town that straddles the border of Texas and Arkansas, was going through something of a boom. Lots of men were moving into the town to find work in the railyards, the Red River Army Depot, and other jobs. Most were perfectly law-abiding folks, but there were plenty of less-than-upstanding characters drawn in, too. Bars, gambling, and illegal prostitution, predictably, grew to accommodate them. As a result, the city was a bit more rough around the edges than most. The crime rate had escalated, and some even said that the town had become used to murders. So there wasn’t a huge reaction when, on Feb. 22, 1946, police were called to the scene of a vicious attack. That night, 25-year-old Jimmy Hollis and his 19-year-old girlfriend, Mary Jeanne Larey, had gone to see a movie downtown. Afterwards, they went to a local lover’s lane, a secluded dirt road well away from traffic and houses. About 10 minutes after they arrived, just before midnight, a man approached the driver’s side of the vehicle, blinding them with his flashlight. At first, Hollis thought it was a prank. But it became clear this was no prank when the man pointed a gun at the couple and ordered them to get out of the car, which they did. They could see the man was wearing a white cloth hood, like a pillowcase, over his face, with holes cut out for the eyes. Once the two were out of the car, the man ordered Jimmy to take off his pants, so he did. The man then hit him twice with his pistol, cracking his skull open and knocking him unconscious. Larey, thinking this was a robbery, tried to show the man Hollis’ wallet, to show him they had no money. But the man instead hit her over the head with a blunt object (possibly the gun). He then ordered her to run. She fled towards a ditch near the treeline for cover. But then he told her to run another direction. She obeyed and headed towards a nearby car, hoping to find help. But the car was empty. The attacker caught up to her and, strangely, asked her why she was running. When she answered, “Because you told me to,” he called her a liar and knocked her down. He then sexually assaulted her with the gun. Afterwards, Larey fled to a nearby house to get help. Hollis, meanwhile, had come to and flagged down a passing car for help as well. He had suffered multiple skull fractures and was in the hospital for several days. When they recounted their attack to the police, there were a few inconsistencies between their stories. Hollis, who admitted he didn’t see the man very clearly, thought he was probably white, or maybe a light-skinned black man. Larey, who had been much closer to the attacker, said he was black. Seizing on these inconsistencies, the police suspected the couple weren’t telling the truth — that they knew their attacker and were lying to protect him. The attack was chalked up to revenge."

Medium.com,Arts & Entertainment,The Real Murder Behind a Few Good Men — True Crime,True Crime,https://medium.com/true-crime-addiction/the-real-murder-behind-a-few-good-men-true-crime-ce42c9c85b2f?source=topic_page---------4------------------1," This is a true story that was made into a fictionalized movie, but the real story is stranger than fiction. And has a murder you don’t expect. That’s the line everyone remembers from the movie A Few Good Men. It’s also the scene where Tom Cruise gets Jack Nicholson to lose his cool and admit he ordered the “Code Red.” The problem is, the movie wasn’t accurate, and Hollywood was making big bucks over the suffering of others at the hands of the US Military. David Cox was a twenty-eight-year-old Marine stationed in Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, in 1986. At which time, his platoon commander gave David, and the others an order to commit hazing “Code Red” against PFC William Alvarado. The Code Red resulted in David with nine other Marines going into Alvarado’s room where they blindfolded and gagged him. They carried him into the bathroom and started shaving his head, after a few minutes they realized Alvarez wasn’t moving. David forced the others to stop the Code Red, and they took the unconscious Alvarez to the hospital, where he eventually recovered. After everything was over, David still didn’t feel right about what happened. So he wrote to his senator, telling him about the Marine misconduct that was happening in Guantanamo Bay. The ten Marines involved in the attack were charged with varying crimes. David was assigned Don Marcari to represent him on the charge of attempted murder. David claimed he was following orders from superiors. He understood it was wrong, but he had been ordered, so he had to perform the Code Red. His lawyer told him it was going to be a hard case to win, but would fight for him. Eventually, David was only found guilty of simple assault, and his sentence was considered served for the time he had been in the brig. David completed the rest of his tour and received an honorable discharge. He left the military and went back home to Boston, Massachusetts, as a civilian. Six years after the incident, the movie was made and hit theaters. David watched it and was upset over the inaccuracies in the film they were touting as based on a true story. He also had a problem with Hollywood making money off of the story he lived through. David, along with the other marines who had been involved, and were portrayed on screen, filed a suit against the production company. While they fought their lawsuit, David started giving interviews telling what really happened, so that the public would know the truth. By 1994, David and his girlfriend were living together, and David was hoping to turn his temporary UPS job into a permanent position. He was to hear from UPS on January 5, if he got it. David had been dealing with a back problem and slept on the couch the night before. His girlfriend left for work around 8:30 that morning, and David was still asleep. But when she called around noon, no one answered. She checked the voicemail and listened to a message from UPS saying that David had gotten the permanent position. She tried calling back a little while later, but still, no one answered. When she arrived home at 5:30 pm, she found the house empty, and all the doors opened. Their pet rabbit was also out of his cage. Both of these were strange incidents. David’s truck was still in the driveway, and on closer inspection, she saw the keys were in the ignition, his paycheck on the dashboard, and his gun was still in the glove box. The days and months passed by, and there was no word on David, no activity on any of his accounts. He was considered missing, but those who knew him assumed he was dead. Because they knew he would never take off without contacting them. On April 2, 1994, a body would be found next to the Charles River in Medfield, about five miles from where he lived. It was David Cox. He had been shot once in the back of his neck, and three times in his left side. Then his body was hidden under pine branches. His wallet was on his body, and nothing was missing. Based on the scene, it was considered not to be a random attack. They were too far out in the woods, and David seemed to have gone voluntarily. Police believe that David had left his place with someone he knew, not under duress. Then they had driven to the edge of the woods, from there walked in over a mile together. They don’t believe that David was being forced because they assume he would have fought back or tried to run to safety. Don Marcari, his former attorney, believes his murder is related to the military. One of the reasons for this is because David was killed in his Marine Corps jacket, which David never wore. David’s family believes he was killed because he told too many secrets about what was happening in Cuba, that the military wanted him silenced. His family also considered that he was making a lot of waves with the movie industry in fighting them on what they claimed was the real story. David’s brother believes that his murder could be tied to his job at UPS. David had found out that his supervisor and a driver had been involved in thefts shortly before he was found dead. The only thing known for sure about the killer is that it’s someone David felt comfortable with, someone he knew. He left willingly and didn’t plan on a fight or for someone to pull a gun on him. In 2019 two state troopers who were retired Marines started their own investigation into David’s murder. If you have any information, you should contact the Massachusetts State Troopers."
Medium.com,Arts & Entertainment,Identical Twins Connected by DNA and Murder — True Crime,True Crime,https://medium.com/true-crime-addiction/identical-twins-connected-by-dna-and-murder-true-crime-6e22df2b84e5?source=topic_page---------5------------------1," Twin brother’s both grow up to kill in New York State. The only thing they don’t share is actual victims. This is a great family to study nature versus nurture in creating serial killers. Robert and Stephen Spahalski grew up in Elmira, New York during the 60s. The twins were extremely close, sharing a bond most others have never experienced. They always just somehow knew where the other one was and what they were doing. Together the twins liked to party. The strangest fact is that they both grew up to also be killers. Stephen was the first to kill. In 1971 he was only 17 when he hit Ronald Ripley 48 over the head with a hammer, then finished him off by stabbing the storeowner to death. The authorities pulled Stephen in for questioning, and he confessed. He said he killed Ripley because he had made “unwanted homosexual advances” on him. He gave an interview later saying that Ripley “came after him in a homosexual way, and so, he killed him, he stabbed him.” When they were booking Stephen into the Chemung County Jail, they noticed his twin brother was already there having been arrested on a parole violation. Which it would turn out over the years both brothers would be in and out of prison, and sometimes in the same facilities with each other. Even though they never committed their crimes together. In 1978 they both happened to be at the Auburn Correctional Facility. While there, one of the twins, with another inmate, stowed away in an army truck being serviced at the prison. Corrections officers found the inmates. As they grabbed the other inmate, the Spahalski twin ran away. By the time they caught the twin, they weren’t sure if they had the right one. So they took both twins and threw them in solitary. Robert seemed to start killing in the 90s when he became addicted to crack. 1
His first kill investigators know for sure happened on December 31, 1990. Robert killed sex worker Moraine Armstrong in Rochester, New York. She was found with electrical cords wrapped around her neck. Instead of making a run for it after killing her, Robert hung around. He even spoke with police as they canvased the area, where he admitted to being a friend of the victims. 2
His next documented kill was his girlfriend, Adrian Berger. She was found in her apartment during a heatwave that hit Rochester. By the time her body was found, it was too badly decomposed to determine the cause of death. 3
Next, Robert killed his only known male victim, Charles Grande, in Webster, New York. The strangest part is the crime is very reminiscent of how his brother killed back in 1971. Robert used a hammer to bludgeoned Charles Grande to death. At the time of his death, Charles was working as a sex worker. He and Robert had gotten into an argument over payment. Robert then seemed to either stop killing, or do a better job of not being connected to the victims because all that can be found on him during that time was that he was dealing drugs. During this same time, his twin Stephen was serving a 30-year prison sentence for a 1979 armed robbery conviction. 4
In 2005 Robert strung out on crack started having visions of his friend Vivian Irizarry. He saw Vivian turn into a demon that he believed he needed to destroy. Robert strangled her, bathed her body, then placed it in the basement. Robert would later talk about how he would visit the body and cry. He said he would apologize to his dead friend over and over. In another strange twin twist, Stephen admitted that he had talked to Ronald Ripley after he stabbed him to death. Only a few days after killing Vivian Irizarry, Robert couldn’t live with what he had done any longer. He walked into the Rochester Police Station and turned himself in. He also confessed to the other three murders. Giving Robert the title of serial killer. Robert was found guilty in 2006 and sentenced to 25 years to life for each murder, and each is to run consecutively. Stephen said he was shocked to learn his twin was also a killer. “I thought I was the only murderer in the family.” When Stephen was finally released in 2009, he didn’t stay free long. Six months later, he walked into a bank in Elmira and held it up. He was sentenced to prison and then released again in 2016. At this time, Robert is still behind bars at the Great Meadows Correctional Facility. And only time will tell if his brother Stephen will stay under the same roof with his twin ever again."
Medium.com,Arts & Entertainment,A Family Surrounded by Murder and Unanswered Questions — True Crime,True Crime,https://medium.com/true-crime-addiction/a-family-surrounded-by-murder-and-unanswered-questions-true-crime-40051a6ad373?source=topic_page---------6------------------1," Do things happen randomly, or are some people drawn to unfortunate events? One family seems to have more than an average share of crimes in their history. 1960, the body of Sandra Valade was found. Four years later, in January of 1964, the body of Pamela Mason 14 was found. Both girls had disappeared during snowstorms in Hooksett, New Hampshire. In both cases, the girls had been raped and murdered and had their personal belongings deliberately placed around town. The police got a tip from a local woman named Rena Paquette 47. She said she knew who had killed the two girls. But the police never got back to her. Then early one morning in February, Rena seemed to disappear. Her son Danny had come downstairs for breakfast, expecting to see his mother, but the house was empty. Danny called his uncle, and the two of them started to search the farm. He was extremely worried about her being outside in the cold because she left her winter coat at the house. They were out looking for Rena for over an hour. Then they spotted smoke coming from the barn that sat over a mile away from the house. When Danny and his uncle reached the barn, they found Rena’s body burning. The police believed that Rena had killed herself, and ruled it a suicide. Her family and friends could not believe that she would kill herself, and especially by setting herself on fire. They feel her knowledge of who killed those girls is what led to her death. A few weeks after Rena died, the police did arrest the man they claimed killed Pamela Mason. He was a delivery driver named Edward Coolidge. During his trial, the details of Pamela’s abduction and murder came out. Pamela had posted her phone number on the message board at the local laundromat looking for babysitting jobs. That message is how Edward Coolidge got close enough to abduct, rape, beat, stab, and finally shoot Pamela, before he ditched her body along Interstate 93. Edward Coolidge was found guilty and sentenced to life in prison in New Hampshire, which meant that he wouldn’t be eligible for parole until he served 18 years. Danny continued to believe his mother was murdered and could never deal with all the unanswered questions. As he grew up without his mother, his life always seemed hard. He eventually got married, then became a parent himself. But it was bittersweet when the marriage ended in divorce, and he lost the lengthy custody battle. After being apart from his children for so long, he had a mental break down. Danny went to his ex-wife’s house and demanded to see his children. She called the authorities, and they arrested him. Danny landed in a psychiatric hospital and was ordered to undergo treatment. During a hypnosis session Danny remembered that he had seen his mother arguing with a delivery man the day she was killed, he claimed the man was Edward Coolidge. The police decided not to look into this theory and refused to re-open Rena Paquette’s case. After five months of treatment, Danny was released from the psychiatric hospital. He worked hard to turn his life around; his friends and family noticed a change in him. Then on November 9, 1985, Danny was working on a bulldozer with a few friends in his garage. Around 11 am when Danny was out of sight of his friends. They heard a loud pop. They ran towards the sound and found Danny lying on the ground. He had been shot in the back and died immediately. The only clue the killer left behind was his footprints as he ran away. A search of the area would turn up the bullet that had traveled through Danny, landing in a telephone pole. At first, authorities believed it was an accidental shooting, that a hunter in the nearby gravel pit had fired the fatal bullet. But it was quickly proven wrong. The gravel pit was over a mile away, with numerous obstacles a bullet could have never maneuvered around. Finally, in 1991, Rena’s body was exhumed, and her body was thoroughly examined after her cause of death was changed from suicide to undetermined. In a twist of fate, Edward Coolidge was released from prison this year, due to a legal technicality. In 2004, Danny’s case was re-opened after investigators continued to receive numerous tips in his murder. The tipsters were saying that Eric Windhurst killed Danny. When Danny was killed, Eric had been dating Danny’s daughter Melanie Paquette. In 2005, Eric Windhurst was arrested and charged with murder. When speaking with the police, Eric first claimed that he and Melanie were at a field hockey game the night Danny died. But Melanie eventually admitted that Eric killed her father, and she was with him when it happened. As for a reason, Melanie said that Danny had sexually abused her as a little girl. And Eric was exacting revenge. Another bit of information came out after Eric was arrested. Everyone in his family knew he had killed Danny. It was considered a family secret. Melanie Paquette Cooper received 15 months for hindering an investigation. Eric Windhurst pleaded guilty and was sentenced to 15–60 years in prison. He is eligible for parole starting in 2020. Rena Paquette’s death is still a mystery. To date, Edward Coolidge has not been questioned about his potential involvement in her murder. Also, it could be safe to assume that if Edward Coolidge killed Pamela Mason, that he most likely murdered Sandra Valade since both girls died in the same manner. But he has never been charged in her murder either."

Did he make a deal with the wrong person, or was someone looking to silence him? In October 1974, Gary Simmons owned a lucrative chain of gas stations in the greater Kansas City area. But it was his hobby of horse-trading that might have led to his disappearance. On October 14, Gary found out that a man named Tom Dixon had a pure-bred horse he was looking to sell. Gary made an appointment for Tom to come into his office the next morning. They met the next morning, and then around 10:15 am, as the two were leaving, Gary told his secretary he would be back soon. He did not tell her where he was going. Only 15 minutes later, Gary called into the office, telling his secretary to write a check for $30,000 to Tom Dixon. Half an hour after that, Tom showed up to get the check, which still needed a signature. It’s known that Tom met back with Gary because he signed the check. But no one knows where they met, or where Gary was while Tom went back to the office. Around 11:30 am Gary was seen at a truck stop, about 10 miles from his office. He was watching out the window. It appeared he was waiting for someone. Gary then called his bank and said they should be expecting a Tom Dixon with a check he had written him. The president of the bank knew Gary well and said he would help Tom cash the check. When he spoke with Gary, nothing seemed amiss. Tom arrived at the bank around noon. The bank manager asked if he’d like to open a checking account, but Tom declined. He said he had some outstanding debts and needed the cash to pay them. Five hours after cashing the $30,000 check, Tom went to a salvage yard, which sat 11 miles from the bank. Tom was driving Gary’s Lincoln Continental, and asked to have it flattened. He said he wanted to erase all traces of the car. The salvage guy suggested he drive it into the Missouri River. The last sighting of Tom Dixon came the next day when he was dropped off by a friend at a truck stop. Gary was reported missing, and the police tried to find Tom Dixon, who was the last person to see him. But both men appeared to disappear. On April 25, 1975, Gary’s Lincoln Continental was pulled out of the Missouri River. That would be the last clue investigators would receive. It would take 17 years to the day to discover where Gary Simmons was. A bus driver named Tyrone Rollins worked for a bus garage and had always had uneasy feelings about a cave that sat behind the bus lot. For years he would get a strange feeling every time he was in the lot as if there was something odd about the cave. Finally, on October 16, 1991, something drove Tyrone to walk up the hill and go into the cave. Inside he found a skeleton and figured out what had been haunting him all those years. The police examined the remains and determined it was Gary Simmons, and that he had been shot in the head. And it was most likely that he had been lying in that cave since he disappeared 17 years earlier. After re-opening the investigation, they had to look hard at the last person to see Gary alive, Tom Dixon. And what could have been his motive to kill Gary. 1
The first theory was that it was a horse deal gone wrong. Maybe the horse wasn’t what Tom described, or maybe there never was a horse, that it was just a ruse to get money out of Gary. Then Gary was killed to cover it up. 2
Soon after Gary’s body was found, a witness came forward, who knew both Gary and Tom, his name is Roy Hylton. Roy says that the horse was real, and that Tom had shown it to Gary at the Whispering Downs Horse Ranch, and that Gary agreed to purchase it. Roy says that he believed Gary was killed over black market gasoline. He said he knew that Gary’s gas station business had been in decline, and he was losing money. And that he looked to purchase black-market gasoline to keep his business afloat. A lot of gas stations were struggling during that time after the 1973 oil crisis, and many did resort to purchasing illegal gas. Gary’s brother claims that this did not happen, that Gary would have never purchased black market gasoline. 3
There was another theory to the gas story. The black market gasoline was becoming a problem, so the US Government was looking to put a stop to it. They were building a case against the suppliers, and some thought Gary was going to testify against them. He could have been silenced so he wouldn’t testify, and to send a message to anyone else who was thinking about it. At this time, all they have been able to charge Tom Dixon with is auto theft, for stealing and destroying Gary’s car. But it doesn’t really matter since they have never been able to find Tom Dixon anyways."

By the time she was 26, Eva was still single and working as a stenographer in San Francisco. Friends and family called her remarkably studious, and mild-tempered. She effortlessly attracted many friends. Although, She could become sullen and withdrawn at times. Eva was especially close to two men. One, Homer Hatch, who she knew from Paso Robles. The other, a magazine writer and Stanford athlete named Paul P. Parker, who also had a room in the boarding house on Scott Street. E

On April 20, 1910, Eva looked unusually pale and had trouble concentrating on her stenographic work. “I can’t stand this any longer!” she said as she tossed a set of keys on her bosses desk and walked out. She wasn’t upset or going through a period of despair. Friends and family made several unsuccessful attempts to reach her by telephone. Her uncle, Henry Swan, went to the boarding house and found her belongings undisturbed. Eva’s friend, Henry Hatch, also visited the boarding house that day. When he arrived from Paso Robles to San Francisco, he left her a note and later returned to wait for her. The letter went unread. Eva never returned to her rented room. Eva’s family knew she wouldn’t leave everything she owned. She never spoke of plans to leave. Something was amiss. On April 21, 1910, her family reported her disappearance to the police. Paul contacted Eva’s doctor, a man named Dr. Grant, who said that Eva was ill and recovering out in Mill Valley. Paul told his landlady this story, and she told Homer Hatch when he came looking for Eva in May. This lead turned out to be a false one. It appeared as if Eva vanished into thin air. The search for Eva Swan continued for six months with no clues. Finally, on September 19, a phone call came into the San Francisco Police Department that blew the case wide open. No one was prepared for the truth. At
first, the police thought the tipster was providing a false lead as revenge. The caller, Ben Gordon, said he knew exactly where to find Eva. She was dead and buried under concrete at 327 Eureka Street. The killer was his boss, and Ben had an ax to grind. His boss, Dr. James Grant, owed him $18. But when Ben asked for it, Dr. Grant called him a son of a bitch and handed him a $2 bill. Police waited three days to act on the tip as they gathered information from Gordon. On September 23, officer Ed Wren followed Ben Gordon to the property. They procured a key from a neighbor, and Gordon guided him through the dirt-covered rooms into the cellar where Dr. Gordon allegedly hid Eva’s body. The officers used a crowbar to pry the fresh concrete from the dirt-floor. The unmistakable stench of death wafted into the room. They uncovered a trunk and instinctively knew the search for Eva Swan was over. C
oroner William A. Walsh arrived at the scene around 8 PM. When he opened the trunk to examine its contents, the odor of Nitric Acid overcame him. Eva’s body was folded, wrapped in an old blanket, and stuffed in the trunk. Her limbs were severed at the wrists and ankles to force her body to fit. Nitric Acid eroded most of her recognizable features. Still, Mrs. Ware identified her by her prominent cheekbones and large hands. Relatives later confirmed her identification. Two hours before the grisly discovery, officers arrested Dr. James Grant at his home at 1293 Golden Gate Avenue, San Francisco. His hired nurse, 26-year-old Marie Messerschmidt, was also taken into custody. Dr. Grant’s assistant, William Saack, was nowhere to be found. The pair had little to say but tried to form an alibi. The doctor and nurse stated they were at Highland Springs, a southern California resort, during April. They well might have been, though not when Eva went missing. The two registered at the resort under a pseudonym as a married couple before April 20 and returned in May. Police put out an All Points Bulletin for Saack, as well as Eva’s male acquaintances Homer Hatch and Paul Parker. Homer responded immediately and agreed to meet investigators in San Francisco.
Parker came became a person of interest when detectives discovered a letter addressed to him in Eva’s belongings. It read in part: “If a body write a body
And a body don’t reply,
Can a body write a body
To ask the reason why?” Eventually, police detained Homer and Parker for questioning. Homer had not seen his friend for almost two years and was cleared. Parker admitted that the last time he saw Eva, was at the home of Dr. Grant, recovering from some illness. Parker denied knowing anything about the nature of the disease. On April 21, Messerschmidt told parker that Eva left. She went to recover at a sanitorium in Mill Creek. On September 24, the police learned that William Saack, Dr. Grant’s assistant, connected with the crime. Gordon told him and a man named Glenn Pike about the disposal of Eva’s body and had been blackmailing Dr.Grant. So what was Eva doing at Dr. Grant’s house, and what was this mystery illness that kept her there? Most importantly, how did she come to be buried beneath a cellar floor in a vacant house? D
r. Grant answered press questions with, “I have nothing whatever to say to reporters. I will have to refer you to my counsel, Fitzpatrick & Greeley.” Police didn’t have much success getting him to speak either. Although Nurse Messerschmidt refused to speak, she appeared to be under duress. Police asked her brother in law, August Borman, to encourage her to open up. He showed Messerschmidt a picture of her newly deceased mother and said, “What would your dead mother think of you now? If you have any respect for her memory, you will not continue to act this way!”
Her reply, “I’ll tell everything!” Her stoicism gave way to empathy for Eva. But first, she needed to clear things up. Dr. James Grant was an alias. His real name was Dr. Robert Thompson, and he served time on the east coast for counterfeiting. Furthermore, she had no license to practice nursing. Everything she did was out of fear and love for the boss she thought she would marry. Messerschmidt recalled that Eva arrived at the doctor’s office on April 16 in need of an abortion. The doctor agreed to perform one. He laid her on a table and anesthetized her, as he had done for many women. Nurse Messerschmidt laid out the tools to operate and left the room so she wouldn’t see what was about to happen. When she returned, she saw the products of Eva’s conception collected in jars. The nurse took Eva to a bedroom, and she left after a brief rest."

Rachael Raver 22, just graduated from George Washington University and was planning to go to law school. Her boyfriend Warren Fulton III 22, played baseball for George Washington University and hoped to move onto the majors. December 3, 1988, they went out to a bar in Washington, DC, where they met some friends. They left around 12:30 am in Rachael’s car and seemed to vanish. Their bodies would be found on December 6, in an isolated area in the suburbs of Washington, DC. Investigators believed that they had been approached in the city, and forced at gunpoint to drive out of town. Once the killer had them isolated he shot Warren, which caused Rachael to try and run. But it’s believed the killer caught up to her, then killed and raped her. After he fled in Rachel’s car. The only thing investigators had to go on was the killer’s DNA; he left a hair behind on Rachael’s body and semen. From that DNA, they believed the killer was African-American. As time passed, Rachael’s family continued to push for information in her case. They believed that if investigators could locate her car, they might find more evidence that could lead to the killer. Rachael’s mother would spend her free time driving around Washington, DC, looking for her daughter’s car. Without any luck. Then she got a ticket in the mail for Racheal’s car. It had been parked illegally on the street in Queens, New York. Police were able to recover the vehicle, but a search of it proved useless in identifying the killer. Police had recovered fingerprints, but they didn’t match anyone in the system. One year after the murders of Rachael and Warren, another girl named Tina Jefferson 24, was raped and shot. This murder happened in Arlington, Virginia, on May 11, 1988. As soon as Rachael’s mother heard about the murder, she knew it was connected to her daughter’s a year earlier. She contacted the police, but they told her they didn’t think the cases were related. The police reasoned that Rachael was killed with Warren, Tina was alone. Tina was African-American, and the other two were Caucasian. The investigators also looked at the locations. How the couple had been taken out to an isolated area, but Tina was killed in a schoolyard. So the DNA collected from Tina, was never run against the sample in Rachael’s case."

A single question that was the backbone of the entire case. Are you Will? A simple question on a regular day, but this wasn’t a regular day for Hong. This was the day he escaped death. I remember when I found the case on my desk. Armed carjacking, armed kidnapping, armed robbery, aggravated assault with a deadly weapon, and so the list went on. There are times as a prosecutor when you forget that these files that are delivered to you each day, en masse, aren’t stories. They are real-life events. Ones that you are charged with obtaining justice for. Hong owned a Chinese restaurant. Or his family did. He was the one in charge of the money bag at the end of each night. He had a routine that involved the same route, the same deposit, and the same drive home. Hong hadn’t been in the country for very long but was acclimating well. He thought this would just be another night. He never thought he would end up in the trunk of his own car, grasping at the strings of life."

The kind that kills without regard. Beverly McGowan 34 was a bank clerk living in Pompano Beach, Florida. She posted ads looking for a roommate to take the spare bedroom in her condo. The first woman who made an impression was Alice. She was British and worked for IBM. Alice arrived for the interview in a nice car and gave the appearance of being quite successful. As the two women started chatting, they realized they shared an interest in numerology. Alice offered to create a chart for Beverly. To create the chart, Alice said she needed Beverly’s personal numbers, her passport, social security number, and so on. After Alice presented Beverly with a chart telling her that she was going to find true love and come into money. She also cautioned Beverly that a woman and man close to her was going to hurt her. On July 17, 1990, Alice moved into the condo, two days later, Beverly disappeared. Beverly’s family and friends received letters from her on July 19. In the letters, Beverly said she had sold her condo and was planning to start a new life. Everyone who knew Beverly was suspicious; this was not like her character at all. Her brother and sister went to her condo. They found her phone disconnected, and her car was missing along with her cats, address book, birth certificate, and passport. In some ways, it looked like she had left for a trip or a new life. But in other ways, it seemed she planned to come home at any minute. Like her nightgown laying on her unmade bed. Or that she didn’t take any clothes or personal belongings. Her family found out that a telegraph had been sent to Beverly’s mortgage company, giving them the authorization to foreclose on her condo and take possession of her belongings. While her family was trying to put the pieces together and figure out what was going on, Beverly’s mutilated body was discovered. Her killer had killed her with a slit to the throat. After Beverly was dead, the killer removed part of her head and her hands. The killer also cut off a tattoo on her stomach. All of this was done to conceal who the victim was, but the police still ID’d the body. Through dental records and an additional tattoo on her ankle, they identified the body as Beverly’s. Her body has been dumped in a canal in St. Lucie County, Florida, over a hundred miles away. Looking at the letters, it appeared to be Beverly’s handwriting, and after analysis, it didn’t seem that she was forced to write them under duress. At the time the police believed they were genuine. The other thing missing from the condo was Alice, the new roommate. Police soon discovered that Alice had been using Beverly’s credit card after she was dead. The day before Beverly’s body was found, Alice showed up on security camera purchasing items with the stolen credit cards. Alice also used them to withdraw cash from an ATM. One of the other charges was for an airline ticket to England. Alice had not only purchased the ticket with Beverly’s credit card but used her identity to travel with to England. The credit card was used again, this time to rent a car from Heathrow Airport. A man dressed as a woman reserved the car on July 20, the day after Beverly’s body was discovered. He met with a travel agent and said that he was flying to London on July 22 on British Airways Flight 292. He called himself Sam and wore a Cleopatra wig. Police searched this flight, but Beverly’s ID was not used. But the police believe that either Alice or Sam was on the plane. Beverly’s car was located on July 25 at the Miami International Airport. It had been left five days before. Inside, police found wig hairs that matched the description given of Sam’s Cleopatra wig. Police believe the woman who called herself Alice to be their prime suspect. After looking into her past, they realized everything she had told Beverly was a lie. IBM had never heard of her and didn’t employee anyone from England. Police rechecked the British Airways Flight 292 passenger manifest six years later in 1996. They then put together the name Sylvia Ann Hodgkinson with Alice. It was another identity she had stolen. Eventually, investigators were able to track down her real identity, Elaine Parent. In May 1991, Elaine Parent was arrested for having multiple stolen identities, but she was released without being charged. Police were able to use some of the evidence they had collected in Beverly’s condo, to match her handwriting to Elaine Parent. Elaine is known as the “Chameleon Killer” with how she can continue killing and stealing identities so easily. America’s Most Wanted aired an episode that featured the Chameleon Killer, and someone recognized her. With the tip, police were able to track her down to Panama City, Florida. She had been living under the name Darlene Thompson. Police put her under arrest, but before taking her into the station, she asked if she could change her clothes, they let her. After she went into the other room, she shot herself in the heart with a .357 Magnum. Since the police were unable to question her, there’s a good chance that a lot of her murders will never be solved. There has also been a lot of speculation around the idea that Elaine was also “Sam”. That it wasn’t a man pretending to be a woman, but a woman pretending she was a man dressed up as a woman. Once it was confirmed that Elaine was a con artist, the letters that were supposedly written by Beverly makes more sense. It is now believed that Elaine was a skilled forger and wrote them after killing Beverly."
Medium.com,Arts & Entertainment,The Route 66 Murders of James and Utha Welch,True Crime,https://medium.com/@hlemonroe/the-route-66-murders-of-james-and-utha-welch-6ae9ba60cde9?source=topic_page---------16------------------1," Route 66 spans across 2,448 miles of The western half of the United States and is one of the first highways built in this country. “The Mother Road of America” allows travelers to experience widely varied landscapes from the Ozarks, through the deserts of the Southwest, until arriving at the Pacific Ocean in Los Angeles, California. In June of 1961, The Welch family of Spencer, Oklahoma, intended to use Route 66 to reach California for a visit with family. Unfortunately, the family never reached their destination. Halfway through the trip, Mr. and Mrs. Welch encountered a killer, and their four young boys became orphans. James and Utha Marie Welch were about to embark on a much-needed vacation with their four sons — Jimmy, 12; Billy, nine; Tommy, eight, and Johnny, who was only 5-years-old. James Sr., better known as “JD,” was a truck driver by profession. Two weeks before the trip, he purchased a 1959 Oldsmobile Sedan so the family could travel comfortably. The destination, grandma’s house. They wanted to make a long-overdue visit to Utha’s mother in Tulare, California. The journey spanned over 1400 miles, and they expected to arrive in two or three days. The family left Spencer on June 6, 1961. The first day of the journey went smoothly, and the family spent the night in Amarillo, Texas. The boys desperately wanted to camp and made sure they brought their little pup tent in case the opportunity presented itself. The next stop was Ash Fork, Arizona. The road-weary family stopped to get gas and a motel room. However, JD found the motel too expensive for his taste, and the family moved on. They passed the next town of Seligman, Arizona, by thirteen miles. Here, the boys got to erect their little pup tent and do some real roadside camping while their parents slept in the car just feet away. The car was somewhat obscured from route 66 by a rocky embankment just off the shoulder of the road. The boys didn’t wake up when gunshots rang out in the night. At dawn, the youngest child, Johnny, climbed out of the tent and stumbled half-asleep over to the Oldsmobile. He looked at his mother’s face. Something wasn’t right — his parents wouldn’t wake up, and there was something on his mom’s face. “There’s something on mommy’s face,” Johnny told his brothers. Jimmy, the oldest brother, went to investigate. He opened the car door and was horrified to find both parents lifeless and covered in blood. Jimmy rounded up his brothers, and the four went to the highway to find help. They screamed for help and waved their arms frantically on the side of the highway. Most of the motorists couldn’t be bothered with the four young boys and zoomed right passed them. After an hour or so, a man named Don Cramer and his companion stopped to see what the matter was. “Somebody shot mommy and daddy!” One of the traumatized boys screamed. The children sobbed uncontrollably. When Don saw the bodies in the car, he immediately notified the authorities. Arizona Highway Patrolman Darrell Birdno arrived at the scene shortly after 6 AM. He discovered that Utha and JD Welch died from gunshot wounds. They were just 33 and 31, respectively. Yavapai County Sherrif Jim Cramer responded to Officer Birdno’s call for back up, and Sherriff’s Deputy Perry Blankenship wasn’t far behind. The officers requested the assistance of Seligman Doctor AJ Gungle. Mr. and Mrs. Welch had been shot in their sleep at close range with a .22 caliber weapon. JD likely heard the shots that killed his wife, as he was shot trying to defend himself. They had been dead for since about 2 AM. If the motive was robbery, the killer wasn’t the best thief. Utha still clutched her purse containing $147, and her expensive jewelry remained untouched. The murderer only stole JD’s wallet with $60 in it. The murder weapon was not found. Dr. Daniel J Condon, medical examiner, performed an Autopsy on Mr. and Mrs. Welch. JD received four shots to the head and Utha three. The boys, along with their deceased parents, were transported to Prescott, Arizona. The grieving children waited for their aunt, Era Martin, to bring them home. The FBI performed ballistics testing on the .22 caliber slugs, but no real evidence presented itself. Law enforcement, as well as residents of Seligman, searched desperately for the perpetrator of this evil crime. Police arrested several suspects, but none of the charges stuck. The actual killer didn’t realize the rookie mistake that gave him away. On June 8, 1961, a waitress named Bertie worked her shift at Johnson’s Coffee shop in Seligman. Early in the evening, a young diner came in and ordered coffee. However, he only had a nickel to his name. Bertie felt sorry for him and bought the coffee herself. The diner left, only to return between 2:30-and 3 AM — almost immediately after the murders occurred. This time, he ordered a full meal with tomato juice. He paid with a crisp $20 bill. Bertie thought the whole thing stunk of fish. The man, the money, and even the time of day made her suspicious. When her husband returned from work, she told him the story. Her husband happened to be Officer Blankenship, and he covered the crime scene that morning. The nameless man was now the number one suspect in the murder of JD an Utha Welch. The unnamed diner drifted south to Phoenix. On June 21, he robbed and shot a gas station attendant named Edward Smith. The transient fled to Fort Scott, Kansas, where he was apprehended. Interrogation revealed two things; his name was James Abner Bentley, and he was in Seligman on the night JD and Utha died. James Bently attempted suicide twice in the Kansas jail but was unsuccessful. Bentley admitted that he and his friend, Fred Waldo, participated in the attempted murder in Phoenix. Officers learned that Bentley was wanted in Fresno, California, for the robbery and killing of liquor store owner Homer Bryan May. Bently and Waldo were tried in California for that murder, and both men found guilty. Waldo received a life sentence, and Bentley got the death penalty. Bentley was confined to San Quentin State Prison while he waited for his date with California’s gas chamber. He bragged to a fellow prisoner about killing a family out in Arizona, and how he didn’t kill the children. Immediate thoughts were that he was speaking of the Welch family. California officers sent his photograph to Seligman and showed it to Bertie. She recognized the picture of James Bentley as the diner she served just before and just after the deaths of JD and Utha Welch. Bentley was charged with the homicide but never tried. After all, you can’t kill him twice, and a trial would be a waste of time and effort. For this reason, some authors say that the crime is unsolved. Technically, no one has been held accountable for these murders, but the murderer is known to be James Abner Bentley, who died by execution on January 23, 1963. He was 27-years-old. The boys settled into their new lives in California, where they adjusted well. Years went by, and the world has forgotten the way their parents died, and the killer who left them to discover the tragedy. The old-time residents of Seligman, though, remember the four orphan boys who lost their childhood on that desolate shoulder of Route 66.

Medium.com,Arts & Entertainment,The Last Line of Gucci,True Crime,https://medium.com/harsh-light-news/the-last-line-of-gucci-1ed8dd73219a?source=topic_page---------17------------------1," The gloved hand appeared out of nowhere on that March 1995 morning. Just like it happens in the old movies or on TV. Three shots were fired. Maurizio Gucci fell to the ground and took his last breath. There was just one witness to the crime, Giuseppe Onorato. Onorato was the doorman for Gucci’s office building. Even now it boggles his mind that someone would want his friend dead. In his own words; “Mr. Gucci arrived carrying some magazines and said good morning,” seems like just another morning at the office. Except what happened next. “Then I saw a hand. It was a beautiful, clean hand, and it was pointing a gun.” And Gucci died an unfashionable death. But who would want the fashion scion killed? The answer is closer to home than one would think. Patrizia Reggiani was the socialite of the 1%. As the wife of Maurizio Gucci, the world was her oyster. And she did love her seafood. Nobody worked the social circles quite as she did. When the pair married in 1972, they were immediately named Italy’s celebrity power couple. Everyone wanted them at their parties and the pair enjoyed the prestige afforded to them. The gifts would be amplified in 1983. Maurizo’s father, Rodolfo Gucci passed away. In his will, he left his stake in the fashion empire to his only son. This would prove to be the beginning of the end of his marriage to Patrizia. No longer was she his chief adviser on all things fashion, he didn’t want to hear a word about what she is to say. He sold the company for $120 million and divorced Patrizia. Right after relieving himself of his wife, Maurizo moved in with another woman, Paola Franchi. Maurizio moved in with her and her son weeks after the divorce was finalized. Many people, including Patrizia, thought of the new lady love as a gold digger. Paola denied those claims. In fact, she says she had no need for Maurizo’s money because her ex-husband had left her a ton of money. Paola claims that Patrizia began stalking them. On top of that, the ex-wife allegedly made threats against Maurizo, which he shrugged off because of the daughters they shared. As many wealthy women did, Patrizia believed in psychics. She believed in one so much that she had one on her payroll. The paid psychic claimed that mere hours after Maurizo was declared dead, Patrizia had Paola and her son kicked out of the apartment they shared with Maurizio. Patrizia and her daughters moved into the apartment. One day, the psychic had a crisis of conscience and went to the police. She claimed that Patrizia had masterminded the assignation of Maurizio Gucci. There was a hotel bellhop, the actual hitman, and of course a getaway driver. With the testimony, Patrizia was arrested. The 1997 trial of Patrizia Reggiani was wild. The psychic friend who turned her in began claiming that killing Maurizio had been a project for years. For her part, Patrizia didn’t do herself any favors. She would tell anyone that would listen that she wanted her ex-husband dead. The jury heard witness after witness say the exact same thing. It did not take them long to come to the conclusion that Patrizia did indeed hire the hitman to kill Maurizio. She was sentenced to 26 years behind bars. That was reduced on appeal to 18 years. Oh, how the mighty have fallen. After she was released from prison in 2016, Patrizia found work with a jeweler. Far from being known as Lady Gucci, Patrizia has to fight to keep that job. She was also forced to move in with her elderly mother. This drove her crazy as her mother found fault in everything she did and was fond of letting Patrizia know exactly where she went wrong. Perhaps committing to a murder for hire plot? Daughters Alessandra and Allegra Gucci have cut ties with their mother. Patrizia has complained that she had yet to meet her two grandsons. She also noted that both daughters had cut her off financially. And Patrizia says that she imagines if she were able to tell Maurizo that she loved him. His answer would be to say he does not feel the same way. Their relationship was not Gucci, as the saying goes. As the obsession with true crime continues to be profitable, a movie is being made about this story. Oscar-nominated actress Lady Gaga has been tapped to play Patrizia. Ridley Scott has been tasked with producing and directing the film. It has been reported that things with the movie will move fast because the production company wants to capitalize on the 25th anniversary of the murder."
Medium.com,Arts & Entertainment,Carolyn Blanton: The Other Colorado Cannibal,True Crime,https://medium.com/@delanirbartlette/carolyn-blanton-the-other-colorado-cannibal-adaa97892d0f?source=topic_page---------18------------------1," Late 1993. Alamosa, Colorado: Friends of 51-year-old artist Peter Michael Green reported him missing. No one had seen him since Nov. 11, and they were worried. But an initial search had turned up nothing. Then, in early 1994, his friends made a gruesome discovery: in a locker in Green’s home, wrapped in a blanket, was his bullet-riddled torso. The gunshots were from a .25-caliber handgun. Now a murder investigation, the search for the rest of Green’s remains kicked into high gear. In a remote area far away from his home, police discovered his head. Two questions remained: where was the rest of him, and who did this to him? The answer to both questions came two days later, in the form of an anonymous tip: someone reported what they thought were human bones in a dumpster at a local apartment complex. Sure enough, the bones were from human legs, stripped of their flesh. Sheriff’s Captain Les Sharff would later testify, “The flesh and the meat were off the legs. They had been totally cut away from the bones themselves, from the ankle up.” The apartment complex, coincidentally, was where Green’s ex-girlfriend, Carolyn Gloria Blanton, lived. On Jan. 16, 1994, Police got a warrant to search her apartment. What they found was almost too gruesome to be believed. In Blanton’s apartment, they found human body parts — later identified as belonging to Green — pickled in jars. They also found a hatchet, knives, forceps, a homemade silencer, and a .25-caliber pistol. They also found a large pot filled with stew on the stove. Nearby was a bowl containing some of the same stew. The main ingredient: bite-sized chunks of Green’s flesh. Blanton was arrested and charged with first-degree murder for killing, dismembering, and cannibalizing Green. Blanton pled innocent by reason of insanity, and the judge halted the trial in 1997 after doctors declared her mentally unfit to stand trial. The judge ordered her to be committed indefinitely to the Colorado Mental Health Institute in Pueblo. But her story doesn’t end there. Under a psychiatrists care and with regular medication, her mental health seemed to improve, and in 1999, she changed her name to Jane Lynn Woodry. Over time, she was able to win more freedom within the institution. Then in 2005, thanks to a controversial decision, she was allowed to move into an apartment off the state hospital campus. Conditions for her release included holding a job, attending Alcoholics Anonymous meetings, receiving regular injections to treat her schizophrenia, and meeting with her case manager three times a week. Woodry’s psychiatrist said that when she is on medication, she is not dangerous to herself or others. Woodry said that she was “deeply ashamed” of what she had done and claimed, “The person who killed Peter Green is not me.” With this decision, Woody is now one of a very rare kind of criminal: a cannibal who walks free."
Medium.com,Arts & Entertainment,The Disappearance of Tricia Reitler and Many Others,True Crime,https://medium.com/@kympasqualini/the-disappearance-of-tricia-reitler-and-many-others-41817bf8d4e2?source=topic_page---------19------------------1," In March 1993, Tricia Lynn Reitler, 19, was a freshman psychology major at Indiana Wesleyan University in Marion, Indiana. Teachers described Tricia as a beautiful and brilliant student with a high-grade point average. Her future was bright until . . . she vanished without a trace. The Disappearance During the early evening of Tricia’s disappearance on March 29, 1993, she was writing a term paper and decided to take a short break to walk to Marsh Supermarket, approximately half a mile from the university campus. According to investigators, while at the store, she purchased a root beer and a magazine, leaving the store to return to her dormitory in Bowman Hall. She never made it back. Her disappearance has been a jigsaw puzzle that has kept investigators baffled for 26 years. After extensive searches, police discovered Tricia’s bloodstained jeans, shirt, and shoes in a field near Seybold Pool and the Center Elementary School. Also, police found small droplets of blood on an earring on the sidewalk about a quarter-mile between the store and the campus. Tricia was a runner. In fact, she had taken two runs that unseasonably warm Monday in March. Her father, Garry Reitler, believes her flexibility and fitness contributed to the difficulty the canine tracking dogs had. During the search, her scent was all over the place in the area where the abduction had occurred. One More Day Tricia’s disappearance resulted in parents without a daughter, siblings growing up never knowing their sibling, and a town still looking for answers 26 years later. Still, many questions remain. “It’s unbelievable, I mean you walk around kind of like you are in a daze,” said Donna Reitler, Tricia’s mother. Donna has spent decades coping by carrying on for her husband and other three children. But moving on hasn’t been easy because she feared “moving on” meant leaving Tricia behind and she just couldn’t do that. Donna told the Chronicle-Tribune, “You tell yourself, ‘Oh, just one more day. Just one more day,’ and here you are 26 years later.” Both parents have coped differently, but have managed to keep their marriage together, defying all odds. “Somebody says they saw her, or they found something,” said Garry. “It’s a struggle but as a father, you have to go out and look, you have to exhaust all of those leads.” Garry has often worked alongside law enforcement in the search for his daughter. Their daughter has appeared on CNN, C-SPAN, Dateline, even The Jerry Springer Show. People have written books and even a movie made for television but that doesn’t matter to Garry and Donna — they just need answers. Law Enforcement’s Frustrations “It’s a case that’s been worked by multiple agencies for years. It’s still difficult, there’s no doubt about that,” retired Marion Police Detective Jay Kay. “I’ve always tried to stay positive. I’ve always believed sooner or later; the answers will come forward.” Though the investigation may seem at a standstill, according to Marion County Deputy Chief Stephen Dorsey as of March 2019, police are reviewing new DNA samples in the case. Dorsey says police want to put Tricia’s abductor in prison, but also want to find Tricia to ensure she is returned to her family where she belongs. It’s something Donna and Garry admit they need too. “Still this whole thing of going over and over different scenarios that could have happened or maybe we didn’t think of this or maybe we should have gone here or this or that; like I said that does not stop,” Donna said. “To be able to bring her home and put her to rest; it’s not going to change the outcome. Tricia will still be gone, but I think for our family we will be able to move on to a certain degree.” The Reitler’s and police have followed up on hundreds of leads over the years and one person keeps coming up. “We’ve had a number of suspects over the years, one being Larry Hall, however, we don’t have any evidence that puts Larry into the mix of Tricia being missing,” said Dep. Chief Stephen Dorsey of Marion Police Department. A Serial Killer? Larry DeWayne Hall is currently serving a life sentence at a medium-security federal psychiatric prison in North Carolina for the 1993 abduction of Jessica Roach, 15, near Georgetown, Illinois, a short distance from the Indiana border. Her body was later found in the fall of 1993, in a cornfield near Perrysville, Indiana. Jessica Roach Jessica was last seen at approximately 3:30 p.m. on September 20, 1993, riding her bicycle near her home in Georgetown. Hall was never charged with Roach’s murder because police could not pinpoint where she was killed. According to federal court records, Hall signed a written confession that he kidnapped and killed Jessica Roach, but he has since recanted. Some believe Hall is responsible for killing up to 40 women and girls. Christopher Hawley Martin, author of Urges: A Chronicle of Serial Killer Larry Hall describes Hall as being bullied as a child and as a juvenile bedwetter. Martin writes that Hall traveled the country in his van as a Civil War reenactment buff. Raised in a big house on a cemetery in Wabash, Indiana, identical twins Larry Hall and Gary Hall’s father was the sexton (gravedigger) at the cemetery. Both brothers were Civil War reenactors who kept to themselves, traveling to many states in pursuit of their pastime. During the research for his book, Martin began traveling the country and researched disappearances and unsolved murders of women around each of the Civil War reenactment event that Hall was known to have ventured. The picture that emerged was frightening — there were many. Martin began corresponding with Hall in prison and was able to obtain information on other missing and murdered girls. Laura Depies Laura Jean Depies, 20, worked a shift at Graffiti store at Fox River Mall in Appleton, Wisconsin. At approximately 10:00 p.m., Laura and a co-worker locked the store and walked to their cars in the mall parking lot. Depies was going to her boyfriend’s home and headed east on College Avenue in her 1984 Volkswagen Rabbit. She pulled into the Town of Menasha parking complex (now Fox Crossing) and parked. Her friends can remember hearing her pull in, but she never arrived at her boyfriend’s apartment. Once they realized time had elapsed, they immediately went outside and started searching while calling the police. The only physical evidence found at the scene was Laura’s drinking cup left on the hood of her car. Hall told Martin he stalked mall parking lots, plazas and stores looking for victims. Hall then claimed he spotted Laura Depies at a store and followed her to the apartment parking lot where she was chloroformed and abducted. He then assaulted and killed her at a remote location, claiming he dumped her body in a wooded area. According to Fox 8 News, during the investigation of Jessica Roach’s murder, police found notes in Hall’s van that said “Lori” and “Fox River.” Investigators then concluded that Hall attended a Civil War Reenactment in Kaukauna the weekend before Depies vanished. Hall has never been charged with the potential abduction and murder of Depies because there is a lack of physical evidence to support his confession. Due to red-tape, Wisconsin law enforcement has been unable to get Hall to Wisconsin to show them where he claims to have dumped Laura’s body. Mark Depies, Laura’s father, doesn’t believe Hall. “I’m not buying that much at all,” Depies said. “especially without a body or anything to go on other than he confessed.” However, Menasha Police Department have said Hall knows things about the abduction only the killer and police would know. “The unfortunate thing is I only have memories of her first 20 years,” Laura’s mother Mary Wegner told ABC News. “I don’t know that you can ever really have closure . . . there are still some loose ends that I feel need to be followed up, including finding the remains of my daughter.” Paulette Webster Martin decided to question Hall about the abduction of Paulette Webster missing from Chester, Ill., pm on September 2, 1988. Hall claimed Paulette was taken from the main east/west roads through Chester which is where she was, in fact, walking home from her friend’s house at approximately 11:00 p.m. He also claims to have picked Paulette up near a mobile home park, which again Martin found was true. Hall then said he took Paulette to a remote location where she was kept and sexually assaulted for several hours. Hall said he either threw her in the Mississippi River or buried her. Letters from Jail In the letter to Martin, Hall goes also claims there are several girls buried in the Mark Twain forest in Missouri. This information has led some to believe he may have abducted Stacy McCall, Suzanne Streeter, and Streeter’s mother Sherrill Levitt. Known as the Springfield Three, they were all abducted from their home on June 7, 1992, in Springfield, Missouri. Halls claims to have begun murdering young girls and women in the summer of his high school graduation in 1981. While Hall’s stories and admissions are compelling, law enforcement is still at a standstill without any of the bodies to pursue any murder charges. Thomas Lauth of Lauth Investigations International headquartered in Indianapolis, Indiana, is a 25-year veteran in the field of missing persons and private investigator who believes there is some credence to Hall’s claims, however, he also points out there are other serial killers out there too. “The FBI estimates as many as 50 serial killers operating in the United States at any given time,” said Lauth. “When we are talking that serial killers can average 30–40 victims during their lifetime (if not more), that is not a small number of victims when combined.” Meanwhile, the parents of Tricia Reitler, Laura Depies, Paulette Webster and the many others Hall has admitted to abducting wait through heart-wrenching and never-ending days for answers that will enable them to finally bring their daughters home."
Medium.com,Arts & Entertainment,Bear Brooks Murder Victims Finally Identified — True Crime,True Crime,https://medium.com/true-crime-addiction/bear-brooks-murder-victims-finally-identified-true-crime-821687960058?source=topic_page---------20------------------1," The Bear Brooks Victims case was unresolved until 2019, when the last three victims were identified. A hunter out in the woods near Bear Brook State Park in Allenstown, New Hampshire, made a grizzly discovery. He found a 55-gallon drum tipped over, with human remains inside. Two bodies would be recovered, an adult woman and a small girl. A search of missing persons going back to the 70s came up empty. New Hampshire State Police got a lead in 1986. Missing persons report for Grace Reapp and her 5-year-old daughter. After getting their dental records and comparing them with the bodies from Bear Brook State Park, they did not have a match. Composites of the bodies were sent to the Northeast United States, and into Canada. Several other leads came in about women who left the area with their children, but in each case, they were able to track down the women to another part of the country. In 2000 the case was assigned to a new New Hampshire state trooper. He went back to the scene to get a feel for the area the drum was found and stumbled across another 55-gallon drum with human remains. Two bodies would be pulled from this drum as well, both young females under the age of five. Running DNA, they found out that the two new victims were related to the adult female they found in 1985. Over the years, as DNA testing improves, state troopers have continued to have testing on the unsolved case. In 2013 they were able to prove that the little girl found in 1985 is not biologically related to any of the other victims. January 2017 they got a DNA match, the little girl found in 1985 was the daughter of Robert Evans, real name Terry Peder Rasmussen."
Medium.com,Arts & Entertainment,The Ruthless Murder of Elizabeth Short,True Crime,https://medium.com/@hlemonroe/the-ruthless-murder-of-elizabeth-short-e2291ea59490?source=topic_page---------21------------------1," E
lizabeth Short was born on July 29,1924, to Cleo and Phoebe Mae Short in Hyde Park, Massachusetts. Cleo and Phoebe lived at 115 Salem Street in Medford, Massachusetts. She was the couple’s third of five daughters, and her family called her “Betty.” Elizabeth grew up to be an exotic beauty with striking blue eyes and black hair that contrasted her porcelain skin. She was vivacious and flirty. Elizabeth attended Medford High School until June of 1940 when she moved to Hollywood in hopes of becoming an actress. Cleo and Phoebe became estranged around 1940; the Federal census shows Phoebe as head of household that year. Rumors that Cleo faked his own suicide and abandoned his family are entirely unsubstantiated. In fact, Elizabeth’s father left money in a trust to help his Phoebe care for their girls before he moved to Vallejo, California, in 1943. Elizabeth wrote a letter to her father asking him to send money so she could live with him in California. She made it to Vallejo, but her relationship with Cleo was strained. He wanted his daughter to stay home nights. But Elizabeth drifted south to Los Angeles and was arrested for underage drinking. After the arrest, Cleo kicked Elizabeth out, and she returned to Medford. In 1944, Elizabeth experienced respiratory problems brought on by asthma and bronchitis. Her doctor advised her to move to a warmer climate during the harsh Massachusetts winters. Elizabeth moved to Florida and met Major Matt Gordon Jr. Elizabeth and Michael frequently exchanged letters and before long, the two fell in love. Matt purchased a wedding ring and planned to marry Elizabeth. Tragically, Matt died in an airplane crash over India on August 10, 1945. Elizabeth kept a telegram in her scrapbook from Matt’s mother, who offered her condolences to the would-be bride. A
fter the death of her fiance, Elizabeth returned to Los Angeles. While she hoped to become a movie star, she never worked in the film industry. Some say Elizabeth posed nude still shots, but no such images have surfaced. No one is certain how Elizabeth got money, but she always ate and paid rent to whomever she happened to owe it. She lived at various Los Angeles hotels and apartments with different friends. Elizabeth possessed a black-book containing the names of 75 men. It is safe to assume she “dated for dinner.” Not an uncommon practice in 1940s Los Angeles. Between May and October of 1946, Elizabeth lived in Hollywood with Mark Hansen, who owned the Florentine Gardens Night Club, and his girlfriend, Ann Toth. Ann promised to use her connections to get Elizabeth movie extra work. The living arrangement didn’t last long. By November 13, 1946, Elizabeth moved to room 501 of the Chancellor Apartments, located at 1842 N. Cherokee in Los Angeles. By December, she decided to take a greyhound bus south to San Diego. Dorothy French spotted Elizabeth sitting alone in an all-night movie theater called The Aztec. Dorothy, who worked there as a cashier, felt sorry for Elizabeth and brought her home to stay for a couple of nights. Elizabeth crashed on her couch for a month. Elizabeth’s failure to contribute to the French household became a point of contention. Even when her ex-boyfriend, Gordon Fickling, wired her $100, she didn’t give a penny of it to Dorothy. Beth claimed she was looking for work, and even wrote home to tell her mother she had a job — neither of which was true. What’s worse, Elizabeth was seeing a married man named Robert “Red” Manley. Elizabeth developed feelings for Red. Red, on the other hand, was only using Elizabeth to test his affection for his wife. E
lizabeth needed a ride back to L.A. to a job interview Red helped her get. Red thought if he took her, and nothing sexual happened, he still loved his wife. If he and Elizabeth took their month-long relationship to the next level, he would leave his wife and new baby to pursue other women. Red and Elizabeth went to a bar and spent the night at a hotel. Nothing happened between the two. Beth and Red arrived in Los Angeles on January 9, and he drove her to a bus station to check her luggage. Red, the gentleman he was, wouldn’t leave Elizabeth alone in that neighborhood. She asked him to drive her to the Biltmore Hotel, where she would meet her sister. This was another lie on Elizabeth’s part; her sister was in Oakland. Red waited with Elizabeth in the hotel lobby and left at 6:30 PM. Elizabeth walked down Olive Street, likely on her way to the nearby Crown Grill, where she may meet an acquaintance. But Elizabeth never made it to her intended destination and was never seen alive again. J
anuary 10, 1947, Mrs. Betty Bersinger and her daughter Anna were walking down Norton Avenue. It was a brisk morning, just after 10:00 AM, when beth saw something a foot or so away from the sidewalk. She thought it was a broken store mannequin. When she looked closer, she saw the horrible truth. It was the naked body of a woman, and she was severed in half. The terrified woman ran with her child to the closest house that, thankfully, had a telephone. Los Angeles Examiner reporter Will Fowler heard the call come over the radio. He was two blocks away with photographer Felix Paegel. It was hard to miss the pale, bloodless corpse lying in the weeds. Before long, reporters and law enforcement swarmed the area. Officers Frank Perkins and Will Fitzgerald arrived on the scene and were horrified by what they saw. The dead woman was cleaned, shampooed, and her skin sheet-white. Her killer severed through her torso. She was posed with her arms over her head. It took 56 minutes to learn the dead woman’s name. Her fingerprints matched that of a girl who arrested for underage drinking back in ’43. Her name was Elizabeth Short. Los Angeles County coroner Frederick Newbarr performed an autopsy of Elizabeth’s body on January 16, 1947. He noted that she had ligature marks on her wrists and ankles, suggesting she was bound. The killer cut tissue out of her right breast, left arm, and the left side of her chest. There was evidence of blunt force trauma to Elizabeth’s head. She may have been raped. These injuries did not kill Elizabeth but told her story of a torturous and slow death. She died when the murderer slashed the corners of her mouth into a grotesque smile that extended to each ear. After Elizabeth died, the killer bisected her using a procedure taught in 1930s medical schools called a hemicorporectomy. This is an extremely complicated procedure that requires the separation of the lumbar spine at the space between the second and third lumbar vertebrae. Once she was cut in two and drained of blood, she was placed in a cooler. This was not the work of some out of control maniac, wildly hacking away at his victim; the killer had specialized training in hemicorporectomy. The guilty man had to be a doctor, mortician, or even a butcher with plenty of experience. LAPD Captain John Donahoe assigned Detectives Harry Hansen and Finnis Brown to lead the investigation and prevent this monster from killing again. The police formed an alliance with William Randolph Hearst, owner of the Herald-Express. His reporters diligently sought information regarding Elizabeth’s final hours — where she was and who she was with. They promised to continue their efforts on the contingency that LAPD granted their paper exclusives. Reporter Wayne Sutton was tasked with locating Elizabeth’s mother, which he did. He knew he could pry information from Phoebe Short that would help him sell papers, and that if he told her the tragic news, she would be too grief-stricken to gather her thoughts. Instead, the reporter said that her daughter had won a beauty pageant and asked her to tell him everything she could about Elizabeth. After he got what he needed, he told Phoebe the horrible truth. The tips started rolling in as soon as the paper printed the story. One tipster reported that Elizabeth kept photographs in a trunk that had gone missing. Reporters located it at the Greyhound station where Red had her check it after their San Diego trip. The trunk was full of photographs that The Herald-Express promptly printed and referred to her as The Black Dahlia for the first time. The life of Elizabeth Short was practically erased by the death of the Black Dahlia. T
he police believed the intimate nature of Elizabeth’s injuries were a sign of a personal vendetta. They were passionate injuries, which suggested she knew her killer. The criminal displayed her corpse, posed as if to humiliate her in death. They looked at every man Elizabeth had contact with. The Examiner received a call from a man claiming to be Elizabeth Short’s killer on January 24. He expressed that he was displeased with the way the story was reported. To prove his claims, the caller offered to send Elizabeth’s property to The Examiner. The next day, the paper received a package and a letter comprised of clipped magazine letters collaged together. Inside were Elizabeth’s birth certificate and other personal effects, including an address book with “Mark Hansen,” Elizabeth’s former roommate, written on the cover. For this reason, police added Mark to their list of suspects. Logically, if Mark were the killer, he likely would not call and admit it, promise to send proof, and then send his own name."

Patrick Kearney is easily one of the most deplorable serial killers of the twentieth century. Kearney would lure young boys and men- ages five to twenty eight- into his car. He would then murder his victims, sexually assault their decomposing bodies and dismember and scatter their body parts along freeways in California. These unspeakable acts earned him the moniker “The Trash Bag Killer”."
Medium.com,Arts & Entertainment,Where is Rachel Cooke?,True Crime,https://medium.com/@kympasqualini/where-is-rachel-cooke-c091fdb2c50c?source=topic_page---------23------------------1," Rachel Cooke, 19, was visiting her parents in Georgetown, Texas, during winter break from college. No one would know that would be her last trip home. On January 10, 2002, at approximately 9:30 a.m., Rachel went out for her four-mile daily run and was last seen only 200 yards away from her family’s home. Somewhere within that short distance, the beautiful and vivacious young student with a smile that could light up the vast plains of Texas vanished. Northlake is a quiet place, about 45 minutes from Austin, where streets are named after Native American tribes and the only people there are residents and visitors. The houses are all set back with expansive drives on several acres of property, and the serenity is never disturbed by strangers. The house located at 224 Navajo Trail was the Cooke family’s dream home, and they loved its tranquility and spaciousness. Robert and Janet Cooke raised Rachel and her little sister JoAnn there while Janet taught English at a nearby high school. Robert was a long-time software engineer for IBM and commuted daily to Austin. Robert came from a large and very close-knit family in Texas, so his family regularly gathered at the 3-acre property for holidays, where they had big barbeques and reminisced. Times were good. The Disappearance But this idyllic life came to an end on Thursday, January 10, a day that started out like any other. Robert and Janet left early for work, and their youngest daughter, JoAnn, went to her classes at a local high school. Enjoying her winter break as a freshman at Mesa Junior College San Diego, Rachel decided to stay home. When the family left that morning, Rachel was asleep on the living room sofa, enjoying her last several days of vacation. While in Texas, Rachel had plans to attend her cousin’s wedding on January 12, then head back to California to meet up with her boyfriend, Greg. That Thursday, Robert did not hear from Rachel, who always found a reason to call him, which he found strange in retrospect. Robert arrived home at approximately 5:00 p.m. and Rachel was still not there, having had no contact with anyone in the family the entire day. He really wasn’t concerned at first, thinking maybe Rachel was with her friend Shannon, who she had plans with that evening. Robert and Janet thought maybe her friend had come by and picked her up early. But after some time went by, Robert decided to get in touch with Shannon. He called Wildfire, a local restaurant where Rachel sometimes worked while visiting. To the worried father’s relief, they told him that, indeed, Rachel had worked a shift that evening. However, when morning came and there was still no sign of Rachel, Robert called the restaurant again, only to find out it was another Rachel that had worked the previous night’s shift. A sinking feeling overcame him. Upon hearing the news, Janet immediately drove to the local hospital to find out if Rachel or any unidentified females had been checked in. Meanwhile, Robert drove the four-mile route Rachel normally took during her runs. “I drove the jogging route because we had figured out that the only things that were missing were her running clothes and yellow Walkman,” Robert said. Sheriff & Volunteer Response At 2:00 p.m. on Friday, Robert and Janet went to the Williamson County Sheriff’s Office to make a missing person report. They sat and described what the accomplished cross-country runner was wearing when she vanished along the quiet roads within the subdivision. Police determined that Rachel spoke to her boyfriend Greg at 9:15 a.m., then left for her run mid-morning. A neighbor recalls backing down his drive and seeing Rachel running by at approximately 11:00 a.m. An elderly couple that was walking in the neighborhood saw her, along with another gentleman who was working on a property down the street from Rachel’s home. The sheriff’s search began the following day with help from hundreds of volunteers, but it only lasted until Monday. Robert and Janet then brought in Texas Equusearch, a volunteer search and rescue organization that provides assistance to families of missing persons throughout the country. After the initial search efforts concluded, Robert continued to run searches on weekends. “We carried on for nine months, but at some point, we thought we’ve done our best,” Robert told the Guardian. “If they took her 12 miles, there is no reason why they wouldn’t take her 15 miles. We could search the entire state of Texas and still not find her.” Jump forward to May 10, 2019: On Rachel’s 37th birthday billboards were erected throughout Texas offering a $100,000 reward for any information about the whereabouts of Rachel. The Roller Coaster Robert and Janet have had to travel a lonely road with many hills and valleys — one that never seems to end. Robert, a soft-spoken man who was more an introvert, had to learn very fast how to be extroverted, always speaking with controlled emotion while telling his story repeatedly to media to raise awareness of his daughter’s disappearance. Since the searching stopped, Robert dedicated his life to telling his daughter’s story. In 2004, he began working on a first-ever initiative with the National Center for Missing Adults providing 2-day training seminars to law enforcement throughout the country. The search for his daughter became bigger than he, wanting to help others avoid the same frustrations he faced in the aftermath of his precious daughter’s disappearance. Robert and Janet never stopped. The Cookes, along with their daughter JoAnn appeared on the John Walsh Show and talked to media any opportunity they had. The day Rachel vanished, became an anniversary of candlelit services, balloon releases, and even letting white doves fly into the sky. “She was supposed to hang out with her father in the afternoon. He was going to take off work early and they were going to go shopping,” said Sgt. Brinkmann. “She had a wedding she was getting ready for.” Rachel’s disappearance easily became the most famous missing person’s case in Central Texas. Advice to Other Parents “I know someone took Rachel,” Robert says. “I don’t know exactly where they took her, but I know she is probably not alive. I know that. We faced that a long time ago.” The Cookes advise relatives to act fast, not waiting for 24-hours to make a police report. “When an adult goes missing it can be hard to get the attention of the police,” Robert said. “We thought there was a 24-hour waiting period before a missing person report could be filed. It turns out that is a myth.” Real-life is far from what we watch on glitzy television shows, but Robert hired an ex-FBI profiler who told him to voluntarily take a polygraph test. Robert remembers that advice and urges family members to try to rule themselves out as suspects as early as possible. “While polygraphs are not admissible in court, if you volunteer the test, it can help move their attention on,” said Robert. “It’s an awful thing, but the families are always considered suspects in a missing person case.” Dealing With the Loss It’s a desperate way of living when a loved one goes missing, unable to go backward, unable to move forward, stuck in the ambiguity of it all. Robert and Janet got divorced which is common for parents of missing children. Janet was twice admitted into a psychiatric hospital where she was treated for Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD). Robert dealt with his pain in different ways: dedicating his life to finding Rachel, even at the expense of his health. JoAnn finished high school and became a student at the University of Texas. They all eventually both moved out of their home in the Northlake subdivision where their dreams resided. Missing person expert, Thomas Lauth, CEO of Lauth Investigations International has been a private investigator for over 25 years. “Sadly, divorce is common when such a horrific trauma occurs in someone’s life,” said Lauth. “Even siblings are overlooked and suffer when the focus of a parent is on their missing child.” Lauth has worked with missing person’s families and conducted hundreds of private investigations over the years. “They have had to keep hope to even function while Rachel Cooke has been missing,” Lauth says. “That is an almost impossible feat when faced with an ambiguous loss that is one of the most traumatic of human experiences.” Would a Body Provide Relief? Since Rachel vanished, eight bodies have been found in or around the Cooke’s home in Williamson County. Each time they have had to wait for DNA results. “You don’t want to get your hopes up. You must be ready for that phone call,” Robert said. “Anytime they find human remains . . . it’s really bad.” One unidentified body was found only nine miles from their home. The Cooke’s agree that was the worst one to wait for. Would a body provide relief? “There’s no answer. Part of me wants to find her no matter what,” Robert said. “Another part hopes she is alive.” Parents of missing children of any age suffer the “not knowing” if their loved one is alive and preparing for the worst. The search consumes their energy while they attempt to survive on a reserve. While the pain of ambiguity can steal your health, one pledge always stays the same. Sadly, I must report that Robert Cooke passed away at the age of 59, on November 5, 2014, in Austin. While he may never know what happened to his daughter Rachel, he made a promise he would never stop looking for her, and he kept that promise."
Medium.com,Arts & Entertainment,The Phantom Killer of History,True Crime,https://medium.com/the-partnered-pen/the-phantom-killer-of-history-56f9aca47c4b?source=topic_page---------24------------------1," “B
ack in the day, we didn’t have to deal with these kinds of problems!” Some elderly people will exclaim when confronted with how to use the internet or when a new scam pops up. And while their statement is correct, they forgo the fact that solving murders in the past was also much harder. That is one of the reasons that the Texarkana serial killer was never found. Or saying never “convicted” is a much more accurate way of describing what happened. It was a winter night, after Valentine’s Day. James Hollis and Mary Jeanne Larey were spending some time on what was then known as a lovers’ lane. A flashlight was shined in their eyes and they were forced out of the car at gunpoint. The stranger forced Hollis to strip off his clothes, and then beat him with the flashlight. After telling Larey to run away, he chased her, and once he caught her, he raped her. Today, a DNA test could be done on his semen to find the killer, but since this happened in 1946, that was not an option. The attacker would escape. Hollis and Larey would describe the assailant as a white man, six-foot-tall, and someone who wore a hood over his face. Texarkana was a small town, so this should have been enough to find a lead, but the police were stumped and asked the town for help. More than 200 leads came in, but none of them helped find the person responsible. The first two victims were lucky (so to speak and in relation to the other victims) because they lived. Richard Griffin and Polly Ann Moore are the first known murder victims of the Phantom Killer. This name was assigned to him by the police. Griffin and Moore were found in a secluded area on another lovers’ lane. A driver saw the car as they passed by and thought it was two lovers who had fallen asleep in one another’s arms. But something about the scene seemed odd, and they stopped. Griffin was found on his knees, head in his hands, pockets turned out. Moore was sprawled on the backseat of the car. Both were fully clothed. Blood was found outside of the vehicle, which led the police to believe that they had been killed while out of the car and then placed back inside. Like with Griffin and Moore, the next two victims would be found dead completely clothed. Though with Betty Jo Booker and Paul Martin, their bodies were found two miles apart. Griffin would be found having been shot four times, once through the nose. Booker was shot twice, and the killer put her right hand in the pocket of her overcoat for some reason. At this point, the town was gripped in fear. Parents began warning their teens about staying out late and being in secluded areas. It was an excellent argument for abstinence. The Phantom Killer’s final attack would be on Virgil and Katie Starks. Virgil would end up being killed, but Katie was able to escape, though she was shot. A neighbor helped her get to the hospital, and she tried to give clues to the police, but they did not help. Outside of catching the killer red-handed, what would have helped? Some will say a confession. , there were a ton of confessions from people with no knowledge of the situation. Police combed through every admission, but nothing struck them as being true. The town of Texarkana seemed to enjoy having their own version of Jack the Ripper, even as they lived in fear of the serial killer striking again. Then one woman’s testimony about her husband seemed to strike a chord with investigators. The wife of Youell Swinney swore that he had confessed to the attacks to her. Police listened to her intently, as she had some specific details of the murders that had not been made public. Swinney was arrested on an unrelated car theft charge and the killings stopped. As the police began to build a case against him, his wife stopped talking and wouldn’t agree to testify. The case fell apart, but Swinney was convicted of car theft and sentenced to life in prison. No other murders occurred after that. Some have theorized that the mysterious wife was the actual murderer, and the testimony against her husband was a ruse to shift the blame from her. The biggest hole in that is Hollis and Larey identified a man as the one who attacked them. It is possible that husband and wife worked together in a Macbethian way. Yet, it is unlikely that this case will ever have a resolution, much like Jack the Ripper in London."

Medium.com,Arts & Entertainment,The Baffling Murder of Nora Fuller,True Crime,https://medium.com/@hlemonroe/the-baffling-murder-of-nora-fuller-fc9b20534fad?source=topic_page---------29------------------1," Eleanor Maude Fuller, known to friends and family as “Nora,” was an American girl born in China around 1886. The daughter of Wilfred and Alice Fuller, Nora had three siblings: an older brother named Louis, a younger sister named Sybil, and a baby brother called Wilfrid. The family made their home at 1747 Fulton Street in San Francisco, California. In January of 1902, Nora’s life was taken at just 15-years-old. That fact alone is tragic enough. The circumstances surrounding the child’s murder are baffling. Mr. and Mrs. Fuller struggled financially and had become estranged. Nora wanted to ease her mother’s s burden, so she quit school and sought employment. Nora responded to an ad in the San Francisco Chronicle that read, “Wanted — Young white girl to take care of baby; good home and good wages.” She was ecstatic to receive the following post: “Miss Fuller: In answer to yours in response to my advertisement, kindly call at the Popular Restaurant, 55 Geary Street, and inquire for Mr. John Bennett, at 1 o’clock. If you can’t come at 1, come at 6. — John Bennett.” Nora left for that meeting around 5 PM on January 11, 1902. Approximately an hour later, Nora phoned home. Her brother Louis answered. Nora’s voice quaked as she told him she was in Mr. Bennett’s home at 1500 Geary Street, and he wanted her to start working right away. Lewis relayed the message to their mother, who suggested that Nora come home. Her new job could wait until Monday. The voice on the other end said, “Alright,” and abruptly hung up. That was the last time anyone heard Nora’s voice; she never returned home. Little did she know, the ad and subsequent post cared were just bait. It was all a ruse to lure a girl like Nora into the snare of a madman. Lewis went to a meeting at the local Masonic Temple after the call with his sister. He returned around 11 PM, to find his mother worried and in tears. Nora was gone. Lewis ran to the Popular Restaurants, but it was closed for the evening. He went to the Bennett address Nora gave, but it wasn’t a residence at all — it was an empty lot. Lewis asked around, but no one had seen Nora. He contacted the police on Sunday, January 12. Detective Coleman was assigned to the case, and did everything he could to locate her or a Mr. John Bennett, but came up empty. Detective Coleman spoke with F.W. Krone, owner of the Popular Restaurant. Mr. Krone knew who John Bennet was. He frequented Krone’s restaurant, and always ordered a porterhouse steak. Only, he never ate anything except the tenderloin portion. Staff nicknamed the patron, “Tenderloin,” although he told Krone his name was John Bennett. The evening Nora went missing, “Tenderloin” came to the restaurant. Before ordering the usual meal, he asked the waiter to send anyone who might be looking for him to his table. Around 6 PM, John Bennett finished his meal and left. Krone told the detective he knew nothing further about the gentleman. No one asked for him that night, and he was positive he didn’t see Nora. Detective Coleman took down Mr. Krone’s description of the man. The John Bennett he knew appeared between 35 and 40 years old, with broad shoulders and a muscular build. He stood about 5’11” tall, had fair skin, and a red mustache. He said he was studying to become a minister, and sometimes wore clerical clothing. Krone added that he “didn’t seem fit for the calling.” As for Nora, she regularly attended the Methodist Episcopal Church. She enjoyed working at the church’s day school and had no known beau to suspect. Nearly a month went by with absolutely no sign of Nora Fuller. On February 8, rent on a two-bedroom rental property located at 2211 Sutter Street, San Francisco, went into arrears. The owners sent Inspector and Collector H.E. Dean to the house. He found the house eerily silent. Upon entry, he noted the bottom floor was absent of furniture. Upstairs, he encountered a locked bedroom. He unlocked the door and entered the room. The shades were drawn, and the room was dark, save a sliver of light that peaked in from between the blinds and window sill. As his eyes adjusted, Dean made out a brightly colored garment resting on the floor. His gut told him something was terribly wrong, and he rushed to find a police officer. Dean located Officer Gill and they returned to the rental. The pair walked into the bedroom. A bed and a chair served as the only furnishings in the entire home. Articles of Women’s clothing were strewn around. On the bed, wrapped in brand new sheets that had never been washed and a few quilts, was the naked and decomposing body of a girl that Officer Gill suspected was Nora Fuller. Her brother Lewis would later confirm this fact when he identified her at the morgue; Nora had been murdered. Nothing much remained in the way of evidence other than a discarded cigar end, a bottle of whiskey, and a girl who had been dead for at least ten days. Downstairs, the police found letters addressed to someone named C.B. Hawkins.

Coroner Thomas Leland ruled it death by strangulation. Her clothing had been cut from her body, and she had been raped. The Chronicle reported that Nora was “unmistakably violated.” Dr. Charles Morgan examined Nora’s stomach contents. He found no evidence to suggest Nora was poisoned, and there weren’t any signs of drug use. The lining of her stomach was slightly inflamed. Dr. Morgan explained that she likely drank from the whiskey bottle, and since she was a non-drinker, it irritated her stomach. Nora ate an apple in the hours leading up to her death. Nora’s best friend, Madge Graham, stated that John Bennett was an older man who was courting Nora. Madge claimed the lovers frequently spoke over the telephone and met secretly. According to Madge, who only spoke out after the girl’s death, John Bennett dressed like a gentleman and had plenty of money. However, Bennett disappeared from Nora’s life about three weeks before her death. Madge said she didn’t know where Bennett lived. What is clear, is that Madge Graham lived at 2088 Sutter Street only 150 yards from the house where Nora died. The rental home was managed by Umbsen & Company. Clerk C. H. Lahanier witnessed their renter sign a lease under the name C.B. Hawkins — the same name on the letters found at the crime scene. The description Lahanier gave of Hawkins was identical to the description Mr. Krone gave of John Bennett, removing all doubt that Bennett, Hawkins, and the murderer were one and the same man. Before moving in, Hawkins asked Lahaneir to remove the “rubbish” from the unit, and gave his address as Golden West Hotel. However, clerk Edward Petrie had no record of any guest by the name C.B. Hawkins. Although a man of that name had mail sent there. Just four days before Nora vanished. Hawkins purchased a cheap bed and bedding from a local furniture salesman, Mr. Schnell. Mr. Schnell described the physical appearance of his customer, and his description was identical to the other two. Larry Gillen delivered the furniture to the address. He added that the man seemed nervous. A neighbor recalled seeing a woman glance out of the window in the weeks before Nora died. Aside from that, no one came or left. The city was left with a description of an anonymous man. A palpable terror reigned over San Francisco, the likes of which would not be seen again until the Zodiac killings in the 1960s. They demanded an arrest. A list of suspects emerged."

If he didn’t have to shoot, then why else did he? Yoshihiro Hattori was born in Nagoya, Japan, and came to the US in 1992 as part of the American Field Service student exchange program. He was 16 years old and was placed with a family in Baton Rouge, Louisiana. Yoshihiro had been in the US for a couple of months when he got invited to a Halloween party for Japanese Exchange students. He went with his homestay brother Webb Haymaker. Yoshihiro dressed up like John Travolta in Saturday Night Fever, wearing a white tuxedo. The party was in East Baton Rouge, and they got address mixed up. They arrived at the house they thought was having the party. The whole front yard and windows were covered in Halloween decorations. They thought they were in the right place. Yoshihiro and Webb walked up to the front door and rang the bell. No one answered at first. Then they heard someone call out from the side of the house. It was Bonnie Peairs. She lived there with her husband Rodney 30. When Bonnie opened the door and called out, she first saw Webb standing a few yards from the house. He was wearing a neck brace because of a recent injury, and he was covered in bandages as part of his Halloween costume. Bonnie said that Webb walked towards her, and she panicked. She slammed the door shut and yelled for her husband Rodney, to get his gun. Webb now assumed he and his friend had gotten the wrong address. Yoshihiro and Webb started walking back to the car when Rodney Peairs opened the side door holding a .44 Magnum revolver. Yoshihiro thought that it was a prank, “We’re here for the party.” Peairs aimed the gun at him and yelled, “Freeze!” Webb now saw the firearm, and didn’t think it was a prank, and yelled for Yoshihiro to run. But in all the commotion, Yoshihiro didn’t hear him correctly. Still thinking it was just a Halloween prank, and maybe because Yoshihiro wasn’t wearing his corrective lenses, he didn’t see quite as clearly. Yoshihiro continued walking towards the house. Yoshihiro was about 5 feet in front of Peairs when the gun fired. Only one shot was fired, but it landed squarely in the chest of Yoshihiro. Webb ran to the next-door house begging for help. The homeowner came back with him, where they tried to help Yoshihiro, who was bleeding profusely. The police arrived shortly after the shooting, where the Peairs still refused to come back out of the house. Bonnie could be heard screaming “go away” to her neighbor, who asked her to come help with the injured student. The shot ripped through the upper and lower lobes of Yoshihiro’s left lung, exiting through the 7th rib. He died in the ambulance on the way to the hospital. The night of the shooting, police initially took the Peairs in for questioning but released them. Saying Rodney Peairs had been “within his rights in shooting the trespasser.” The Louisiana Governor Edwin Edwards thought differently and pushed for the case to go to trial. During the trial, Peairs took the stand in his defense. “It was a person, coming from behind the car, moving real fast. At that point, I pointed the gun and hollered, ‘Freeze!’ The person kept coming toward me, moving very erratically. At that time, I hollered for him to stop. He didn’t; he kept moving forward. I remember him laughing. I was scared to death. This person was not gonna stop, he was gonna do harm to me.” Peairs testified that he shot Hattori once in the chest when the youth was about 5 feet away. “I felt I had no choice,” he said. “I’m very sorry that any of this ever happened.” The District Attorney Doug Moreau argued this wasn’t the case. He told how Peairs was 6 feet 2 inches and armed, while Yoshihiro was unarmed and very slight stature weighing only 130 pounds. Yoshihiro was not a threat, not even if he was walking towards the house. Peairs had several options, he could have shot in the air to scare the young men away, or he could have just went inside and locked the door and called the police. Which he never called the police, him or his wife. The two boys had been walking away before he went outside with the gun; it was reasonable to assume they were going to leave if Peairs would have stayed inside. A police detective who talked with Peairs that night said that he admitted that he made a mistake in shooting the boy, that his wife had worked him up by yelling to get his gun. “Boy, I messed up; I made a mistake.” The defense tried to blame his wife, saying she panicked, yelling for him to get his gun. By the time he got to the door, he was in fight mode. Bonnie Peairs had this to say for herself, “There was no thinking involved. I wish I could have thought. If I could have just thought.” Or if she would have just closed the door and called the police. It would seem to most people I imagine that this was a case that would render a guilty verdict, even for manslaughter. Instead, the jury voted not guilty and sent Peairs home. A civil jury thought otherwise and found Rodney Peairs guilty and ordered him to pay $650,000 in damages. His insurance company paid $100,000, and Peairs is responsible for paying the rest. His family used the money to establish two charities in their son’s name. One charity helps children who want to visit Japan and the other fund’s organizations that lobby for gun control."

iami suited the Devil. He arrived in Magic City in the 1960s on the lips of Caribbean exiles, who believed that evil spirits and demons invade the weak of heart. Among the pink-colored homes of Miami’s Cuban district, Little Havana, children played among the residues of dark rituals — little piles of cigar stubs, apples and severed chickens’ heads. By 1973, the year “The Exorcist” horrified theatergoers, it appeared the Devil had decided to settle down, like so many retirees, in Florida. In 1974, according to the Sarasota-Tribune, Miami’s Jackson Memorial Hospital treated 700 demonic possessions a month. That year, a 9-year-old girl stood up in a nearby church and said, “I am satan” in a voice that wasn’t hers. Then, just before Halloween in 1979, emergency dispatchers answered a chilling 9-1-1 call from a local school. A riot had broken out at the Miami Aerospace Academy, a private military school in Little Havana, where screaming students were said to be “possessed by spirits.” This was no trick-or-treat prank. One teenager was unconscious; others injured. Kids had smashed windows and ripped doors from their hinges. Police and firefighters who raced to the scene found hundreds of hysterical high schoolers fleeing the building as if it were ablaze. The Devil, it seemed, was to blame. When television crews joined the fray, witnesses blamed a Ouija board, while others spoke of “Bloody Mary” — a parlor game believed to conjure spirits. Then, as if by magic, the school’s owner appeared to address the media. Evaristo Marina, 48, who called himself “El General,” ran his fingers through his red hair, and dispersed the reporters with his disarming smile. But the story was already out. “Some students say it was demons,” wrote the Associated Press, in a report that covered front pages across the nation. “Miami School Hysteria Linked to Ouija Board,” cried the New York Times. Now the Devil was headline news. The bizarre and unsettling events that unfolded 40 years ago this month, on October 25, 1979, have been described by scholars as “one of the most bizarre chapters in the history of American education.” Many questions remain. What possessed the students? Was the Devil truly at large in the Sunshine State, among the bikinis and rollerskating retirees of South Beach? Now, for the first time, former staff and students have revealed how violence, black magic, an exile obsessed with glory, and teenaged murder created America’s high school from hell. Evaristo Marina believed he was born to lead men. He was brought into this world in 1930, in the Cuban beach resort of Caibarién, known as the White Town for its pale sand. Marina studied law at the University of Havana, where, according to George Navarini, a former student who knew him well, he clashed with a rival student named Fidel Castro. “Many times Marina and Castro would have these long-winded debates about Marxism,” Navarini said. After Marina graduated, he caught the eye of Cuba’s strongman president, Fulgencio Batista, who named Marina the General Director of Public Order. Still in his early 20s, handsome with piercing blue eyes, Marina found himself in control of nightclubs, casinos and police. Then disaster struck. Castro had since created a revolutionary group that had overthrown Batista’s government, and put a price on Marina’s head, Navarini said. He fled to America in 1959 with a plan to rise to power. “He had the ambition that comes with someone who lost something,” Navarini said, “There is no more ardent collector of baseball cards than someone who once had the cards and lost them in a fire.” Like many immigrants, Marina discovered his experiences counted for little in the Estados Unidos. He found work as a busboy, and later waited tables at Miami’s fashionable Biltmore Hotel. There, he served dinner to other refugee Cuban politicians, known as the Cuban Rotary Club of Exiles. When his shift ended, he would take off his apron and join them. The 25-year-old waiter boasted he would one day be Miami’s mayor. But the highest position he could find was coaching soccer at the Florida Air Academy in Melbourne. The school was associated with the Army’s Junior Reserve Officers’ Training Corps. It gave Marina an idea. He saw an opportunity for a new type of school. One that would blend Cuban discipline with the values of the American military. First he needed money. Stoked with the fire of immigrant hustle, Marina started a small beverage company, Iron Beer Soft Drinks, likely based on a popular Cuban soda of the same name. Then he needed legitimacy. Marina joined the Civil Air Patrol — an auxiliary of the United States Air Force — and rose to lieutenant colonel. He also found love. In 1959 he married a woman he met in Miami. In 1965 they named their son Evaristo Jr. In 1968 Marina sold his beverage company and used the profits to open his academy. In a crowded marketplace of military-styled schools, he named his “Aerospace Academy,” conjuring images of spaceships and astronauts, then so wildly popular in America. He marketed the school to traditional, Hispanic parents. “I believe in the command authority,” Marina said with a slight lisp: “I do not drink. I have never been drunk in my life. I do not smoke.” His only vice was a hunger for power. Marina tampered with his Civil Air Patrol uniform, creating a fetishized version with fancier epaulettes. In the mirror, his spit-and-polish appearance and general’s hat recalled his old mentor, Cuba’s president, Batista. That was the moment “El General” was born. Marina even tried out his own political catchphrase: “What I say is what I do.” Marina named his teachers Colonels and Majors, and dressed his “cadets” in Air Force blue. Behind the towering school gates, he marched them across the yard in camouflage fatigues and melon-sized helmets. Inside, students from kindergarten to 12th grade learned “reading enrichment and remedial mathematics.” Boys and girls were educated separately. Marina pulled out of formation any boy with hair “too long for my taste,” and sent them to the school’s barbershop for a buzz cut. “Girls look good with long hair,” he conceded. Attendance was slow at first. Sergio Capablanca, an early enrollee, recalled that his mother couldn’t afford the $65 monthly tuition. He said Marina paid for his first week with a wad of bills from his own pocket. Another early enrollee, Roger Romaelle, said he thrived at the school, quickly becoming fluent in Spanish. “We also learned a lot about the history of Cuba,” he said. Virtually every minute of the students’ time was dictated by a schedule, starting with a flag-raising ceremony at 8:30 a.m. Marina took some teens straight from juvenile detention, giving them false identities, lest any parents learn of their crimes. Enrollments skyrocketed as the school gained a reputation for straightening out bad teenagers. “A lot of the children, they didn’t have fathers,” explained Romaelle. Soon, the Academy was overwhelmed with students, some paying $6,000 a year. Flush with cash, Marina purchased a 1.3-acre property opposite Miami High School, for nearly $1 million. The new campus boasted a two-story classroom building, an office building and an Olympic-sized pool. Marina hired a film crew to shoot a commercial that played at cinemas across South America. Wealthy families flew their children to board at the Academy, filling the school’s three dormitories. By 1971, Marina commanded over 1,000 students. Boys outnumbered girls three-to-one."
Medium.com,Arts & Entertainment,The Man Who Killed Halloween — True Crime,True Crime,https://medium.com/true-crime-addiction/the-man-who-killed-halloween-true-crime-ea83e1cd8091?source=topic_page---------33------------------1," Halloween night 1974 parent’s worst fears came true and sparked a nationwide panic for years to come. Halloween night Ronald O’Bryan and neighbor Jim Bates took their children out trick-or-treating. O’Bryan was the one to walk the children up to each door, with Bates staying back on the sidewalk. One of the houses they stopped at, no one answered the door. The children eager to keep moving, ran off to the next house. O’Bryan caught up to the group a few minutes later, holding five large pixy stix straws, about 20 inches long. He said someone finally opened the door and handed those to him for the kids. He gave each of the kids one pixy stix and then gave the fifth to a boy he recognized from church. Not long after this, it started to rain, so they called it a night and returned home. O’Bryan told his kids they could each pick one piece of candy to eat before bed. His son Timothy wanted to try the giant pixy stix but had a hard time opening it. He asked his dad for help. Timothy ate a little of the sugary powder but said it tasted bitter. His dad gave him some kool-aid to wash it down with before sending him to bed. It wasn’t long though, until Timothy was in the bathroom throwing up, then he started to convulse. His dad held him as they waited for the ambulance to arrive. Timothy died in the ambulance on the way to the hospital, less than an hour after eating the candy. Believing they were dealing with tainted candy, local parents were bringing all of their children’s candy into the police station. After an autopsy on Timothy, they found a lethal dose of potassium cyanide in his system. They ran the contents of the pixy stix he ate and found the contaminated source. Officials worked quickly to find the other pixy stix before anyone ate them. They had gotten the ones back from the O’Bryans and Bates, but they needed to get the last candy stick from the boy O’Bryan handed it too. When they arrived at his house, his parents started to freak out. They searched their son’s bag of candy, but the pixy stix was not in it. Their son was upstairs, still asleep. His mother ran up to his room and found him clutching the candy. It appeared he tried to open it, but was unable to and fell asleep. All of the candy tested positive for potassium cyanide. The lab determined that someone had cut off the tops and filled about two inches worth of the poison in each candy. Then they resealed the tops with heavy-duty staples. Timothy’s pixy stix contained enough cyanide to kill two adults. The other contaminated sticks had enough to kill 3–4 adults in each candy. A few days after Timothy was buried, the O’Bryan’s insurance agent called the police. He felt that things weren’t right, and someone needed to know. The insurance agent said that O’Bryan’s wife didn’t know about the insurance policies that her husband had taken out on their children. The polices that he had taken out right before Halloween. When police initially talked with O’Bryan, he claimed he didn’t remember which house he had gotten the pixy stix from that night. Which made the cops suspicious since it was his neighborhood, and they had only gone to 2 streets trick-or-treating before the rain started. Officers went to all the homes on both streets, and none of the residents had given out that candy. Which matched with the candy they had gotten from trick-or-treaters in that neighborhood. Police then requested O’Bryan walk with them on the streets, and see if he could remember which house gave him the candy. After the third trip around, investigators were losing their patience. Finally, O’Bryan took them to the house that he got the candy from on Halloween. He told the story again, how the occupants only opened the door a crack and handed out the candy. He claims the arm was hairy, but he gave nothing else to go on. It was quickly learned that the owner of the home was an air traffic controller, and he had not gotten home until 11 pm on Halloween night. He had over 200 people that could verify his alibi. His wife and daughter had been home that evening but ran out of candy before the O’Bryan’s reached their door. That’s why the lights were out, and no one answered the knocks. The police soon discovered that the O’Bryan’s were in a lot of financial debt, over $100,000. But at the same time, he had been telling co-workers at Texas State Optical that he was about to come into a large sum of money. O’Bryan was not the most stable of men. In 10 years, he had held over 21 jobs. And all of his co-workers thought he was about to be fired from his current job. Outside of work, things were crumbling around the O’Bryan’s. Their car was about to be repossessed, and their home was in foreclosure. 1
When talking with O’Bryan’s co-workers, one of them told police that O’Bryan had asked them a now discerning question. O’Bryan had asked if just anyone could purchase potassium cyanide. 2
Which matched with what a professor said at the Harris County Community College, where O’Bryan was taking classes, he asked his teacher how much poison would it take to kill specific sized animals. 3
A local witness came forward saying O’Bryan came into his workplace right before Halloween, a wholesale chemical store, asking to buy cyanide. O’Bryan was told the smallest amount he could purchase was 5 pounds, so he left without buying. A search of the O’Bryan home was conducted. The investigators found pieces of pixy stix tops, along with a pocket knife that had traces of the plastic and candy on the blade. After hearing from the insurance agent, the police searched all the policies that were on the O’Bryan children. In January 1974, two policies were taken out on the children, for $10,000. Then a month before Halloween, he took out $20,000 additional on each child. And days before Timothy died, another $20,000 policy was taken out on the children. That would be a total of $50,000 on each child, or $100,000 if they both ate the candy. The day after Halloween, when his son died, O’Bryan called the insurance company asking for his money. Ronald Clark O’Bryan was arrested on November 5, 1974. He was indicted on one count of capital murder and four counts of attempted murder. He pled not guilty to all charges. The trial started on May 5, 1975, in Houston, Texas. Where O’Bryan still claimed he was innocent. Assistant District Attorney on the case, Mike Hinton, “We were all shocked that someone could kill their own son, their own flesh and blood, for a lousy . . . $50,000 life insurance policy.” It only took the jury 46 minutes to convict Ronald O’Bryan of murder, and only 71 minutes to agree on the death sentence. In prison, inmates referred to O’Bryan as the “Candy Man” and not in a good way. As a child killer, O’Bryan was one of the lowest in the social hierarchy of prison. He appealed his case several times, going as far as the Supreme Court. But all appeals were rejected. Ronald Clark O’Bryan died by lethal injection in March 1984. But he didn’t leave this world without trying to garner some last-minute pity. What is about to transpire in a few moments is wrong! However, we as human beings do make mistakes and errors. This execution is one of those wrongs, yet doesn’t mean our whole system of justice is wrong. Therefore, I would forgive all who have taken part in any way in my death. Also, to anyone I have offended in any way during my 39 years, I pray and ask your forgiveness, just as I forgive anyone who offended me in any way. And I pray and ask God’s forgiveness for all of us respectively as human beings. To my loved ones, I extend my undying love. To those close to me, know in your hearts I love you one and all. God bless you all and may God’s best blessings be always yours. Ronald C. O’Bryan P.S. During my time here, I have been treated well by all T.D.C. personnel."

The holiday incorporates traditions dating back to the ancient Celts, as well as newer and uniquely American practices. One of the newest of these American practices, dating back to the 1980s, is the “safe trick-or-treat” or “trunk or treat,” where churches, shopping malls, and other community organizations host Halloween events where kids can come and get their candy in a supposedly safe environment. In addition, many local police departments set up places where trick-or-treat candy can be X-rayed or otherwise inspected. The assumption behind these events is that trick-or-treat candy from the neighbors might be poisoned, contain illegal drugs, or have razor blades hidden inside. But where did this fear come from? Several places, but one particularly tragic case is what may have started it all."

Now, the social justice part of this story is another post. As a writer, I had another tangent that I went off on: in popular culture, how have unsolved murders manifested in books, movies and music? Here are some of the more interesting cases I found. A young perfume shop employee’s body is found in the Seine and the story becomes a sensation. Le Chevalier C. Auguste Dupin and his assistant investigate the murder of Marie Rogêt and infer that she was killed by a sailor and then dragged off to be dumped in the river. At least that was Edgar Allan Poe’s take on the 1841 murder of Mary Cecilia Rogers. Known as the Beautiful Cigar Girl to male clientele at a local tobacco shop, her body was found floating in the Hudson River. Her murder received national attention and was further sensationalized by details of her past, including an alleged elopement with a naval officer, a supposed abortion, and the subsequent suicide of her fiancé Daniel Payne during the inquest. The 1842 poem, “The Mystery of Marie Rogêt” by Edgar Allan Poe was possibly the first time a real crime was turned into a story. In March 1922, Andreas and Cäzilia Gruber, their daughter, Viktoria, her children, Josef and Cäzilia, and the family housekeeper, Maria, were massacred on their farm in Hinterkaifeck, Bavaria. Two-year-old Josef and the housekeeper were murdered in the house while the rest of the family was killed in the barn. The history of the family as well as the events surrounding the massacre were disturbing. For instance, there was recently eaten food that was found at the scene, which was discovered four days after the family was killed. While modern technology helped them to narrow the suspect list down to one likely killer, the case is still considered unsolved because the name of the now-deceased killer was not publicly released out of respect for living family members. The 2009 German movie Hinter Kaifeck is a fantasy movie was inspired by the massacre. On August 22, 1997, the badly decomposed body of an African American female was found near the Highway 101 ramp, at Petaluma Boulevard in Santa Rosa, California. Three days later, police get an anonymous call that the body may be that of 12-year-old Georgia Lee Moses, who had disappeared from her home on August 13. The funny part is no one reported the girl missing. She was last seen with an older, taller man, between 25 and 30 years old. Georgia Lee had dropped out of school to take care of her disabled mother, 7-year-old sister, and her mother’s 50-year-old boyfriend. The murder of Georgia Lee Moses bore similarities to the murder of another Petaluma girl, Polly Klaas, whose case garnered national attention and a subsequent conviction. More than twenty years later, Georgia Lee’s heartbreaking disappearance and death remain unsolved, and it was the inspiration behind Tom Wait’s haunting 1999 ballad, Georgia Lee from his Grammy-winning album Mule Variations. On December 6 1991, the I Can’t Believe It’s Yogurt shop in Austin was set afire. Firefighters fought to put it out and found the gagged and assaulted bodies of 13-year-old Amy Ayers, 17-year-old Jennifer Harbison, 15-year-old Sarah Harbison, and 17-year-old Eliza Thomas. Jennifer and Eliza were yogurt shop employees. Amy and Sarah were sleeping over the Hardison house and planned to get a ride with Jennifer. Police suspect it was started off as a robbery and became a case of arson as a cover up. Over 50 people confessed to the murders. The suspects who were convicted had those overturned due to false confessions and exonerating DNA evidence, which wasn’t available at the time. Will Scheff lead singer of the indie rock band Okkervil River was inspired by the broadcast of the trial when he penned the 2002 ballad Westfall. On a vacant lot on January 15, 1947, Betty Bersinger walked with her three-year-old daughter in Leimert Park, Los Angeles, when they happened upon what she thought was a discarded store mannequin. As she got closer, what she saw prompted her to rush to a nearby house to call the police. The mysterious murder, mutilation, and dismemberment of 22-year-old Elizabeth Short, an aspiring actress, was unlike anything the world had seen outside of war. The list of suspects seemed long, and those falsely claiming to have killed the young woman only made things more muddled. She was nicknamed The Black Dahlia by the press because she loved sheer black clothes and was fond of the 1946 movie, The Blue Dahlia, about the murder of an unfaithful wife. It remains one of the most famous unsolved cases to date and has been fictionalized many times, including in the popular series American Horror Story with Mena Suvari portraying Short. Wade Walker, the leader of the Drapes, falls in love with Allison Vernon-Smith, a pretty-girl Square. What ensues is a teen musical romance, from writer and director John Waters, that would become a cult classic. Set in Baltimore, Maryland in 1954, Cry Baby was loosely based on the worldwide media surrounding the murder of 14-year-old Carolyn Wasilewski. She was found on a railway line with the name “Paul” written on her right thigh. Waters, a Baltimore native, was only eight at the time of the murder and was already fascinated with the Drape subculture of the time. He remembered how the media framed Wasilewski’s murder around the negative aspects of her identity as a girl who liked to date drapes. Her unsolved case is still known as a Baltimore legend. The Wirschaftwunder, also known as the Miracle on the Rhine, described the rapid development of West German and Austrian economies after World War II. But in 1957, scandal rocked the country. High-class escort Rosemarie Nitribitt, just 24, was found dead. Born to humble beginnings, Maria Rosalia Auguste Nitribitt began working as a prostitute during her teenage years. In an effort to bring in a better sort of clientele, she began her own transformation, which attracted more elite customers that brought her higher income, high-priced cars, and enough money to buy her own home outright. Nitribitt’s three-day-old strangled body was discovered in her luxury apartment in Frankfurt on November 1, 1957. Heinz Pohlmann was tried and acquitted of her murder due to the police’s inability to determine her exact time of death. The fictional 1958 German film The Girl Rosemarie was based on her murder case and won the 1959 Golden Globe for Best Foreign-Language Film. At 2:30 am on June 17, 1966, two black men entered the Lafayette Bar in Paterson, New Jersey, killing the bartender and two customers. A third customer survived, and along with other witnesses were able to give police some details about the perpetrators. Police eventually arrested middleweight champion boxer Rubin “Hurricane” Carter and his friend, John Artis, and they were convicted during the 1967 trial. In 1975 Bob Dylan recorded the song Hurricane, which harnessed popular support for Carter and become a gold certified hit for the folk artist. In 1985, Carter’s conviction was overturned, because his conviction was, “based on racism rather than reason, and concealment rather than disclosure.” In 1999, Carter’s story was turned into an award-winning film starring Denzel Washington. While the officer who investigated the case maintains he got the right men, the Lafayette Bar deaths remain unsolved. At a lakefront property in Cleveland, a man sleeping on the daybed hears his wife’s screams in the middle of the night. He gets up, goes to her, and is knocked unconscious by someone in the bedroom. He awakens and chases the intruder but is knocked out again. When he wakes up, he’s half-submerged in a lake. This was the story of Dr. Sam Sheppard, who was tried on Oct 18 1954 for the bludgeoning death of his wife Marilyn back in July of the same year. The case became a salacious sensation even before the trial. Dr. Sheppard was convicted and sentenced to life, but his sentence overturned 10 years later due to bias. Shepherd’s life and medical career would never recover and he died in 1970. The case remained unsolved, and later, DNA, which was not available at the time, showed that there was blood from a third person on the scene, corroborating that part of Dr. Sheppard’s story. But the case remains unsolved. This murder was the inspiration for many works. Some have speculated that the 1993 Harrison Ford movie “The Fugitive” was loosely based on the Sam Sheppard case. Those associated with the movie denied that, but this case was the inspiration for the 1970 film, The Lawyer. A man in a room that’s locked from the inside is murdered… how? That was the question that puzzled the police and the public back in 1920.Joseph B. Elwell was a bridge player, tutor, and writer. Having learned and loved the game since childhood, his obsession with the game became a lucrative endeavor when he married a socially connected woman named Helen Derby, whose cousin, Richard, married the youngest daughter of Theodore Roosevelt. With access to affluent students and gambling opportunities, he became wealthy. He also developed a reputation for being a womanizer, much to the embarrassment of his wife. He and Helen were negotiating their divorce when he was shot in the head in a locked room at home. The sensational case has never been solved and a few years later, it became the inspiration for best-selling author S. S. Van Dine’s The Benson Murder Case the first Philo Vance detective novel, which became a Paramount Pictures movie starring William Powell. Originally published on AuthorPalessa.com.

Medium.com,Arts & Entertainment,The Unsolved Villisca Ax Murders,True Crime,https://medium.com/@hlemonroe/the-unsolved-villisca-ax-murders-176168187a76?source=topic_page---------37------------------1," Josiah Moore and his wife Sarah, were a fortunate couple. They had a modest house at 508 E. 2nd Street in the sleepy community of Villisca, Iowa. They were well-liked and felt safe. They had four healthy, beautiful, and kind children who made their house a home. Namely, Herman Montgomery — age 12, Mary Katherine — age 10, Arthur Boyd — age 7, and Paul Vernon — who was just 5. The Moore family attended Presbyterian Church faithfully. On June 9, 1912, they took their children to an end of year Sunday school program, the Children’s Day Service, that Sarah co-directed. Each of the Moore children participated in the production. The entire family stayed after for a social, including neighbor children Lena and Ina Stillinger — ages 12 and 8, respectively. After a church social, the Moore family walked home with the Stillinger girls who they had invited to spend the night. They left around 9:30 PM, and the church was just three blocks from their house on 2nd street. The children had cookies and milk before bedtime. What happened next, would shake the innocence off of Villisca forever. June 10, 1912, started as usual for the Moore family neighbor, Mary Peckham. She did her laundry and began to hang clothes out to dry at around 6:00 AM before it got too hot. By 7:30, she noticed something odd. The Moore house was unusually quiet. Mary assumed her neighbors were asleep. When she tried to wake them by knocking, they didn’t stir. Being neighborly, she let the Moore’s chickens out and checked on their livestock before asking Josiah’s brother Ross Moore to look in on the family. Ross telephoned Ed Selley, Josiah’s employee, and asked him if he had any insight as to why the house was so quiet. Ed called around to check if they were with family, and they weren’t. He decided to go to the home to check on the horses and make sure all was well inside. Ross arrived on the scene just as Ed was entering the barn. Ross located a house key, unlocked the front door, and went inside. Nothing looked out of place until he entered the room just beyond the parlor, where he saw sheets covered with blood. He ran back outside and told Mary that something terrible happened, and asked her to get Marshal Hank Horton. When Hank reached the Moore home, he entered along with Mary, Ross, Ed, and Harry Moore — another brother of Josiah. In the room near the parlor, wrapped in bloody sheets, lay the bodies of both Lena and Ina Stillinger. Upstairs they found the Josiah and Sarah, both deceased in their blood-soaked beds. Down the hall in the children’s room were the bodies of the four Moore children in an equally grisly scene. Hank remarked that a murder occurred in every bed. Marshal Hank ascertained that the killer had left the scene. He immediately went to the office of Dr. J Clark Cooper and said, “Come with me… Joe Moore and all his family were murdered in bed.” By the time the pair returned, the townsfolk had begun gathering at the Moore home, including Reverend Wesley J Ewing of the Presbyterian Church. Dr. Cooper first saw a tiny arm sticking out from the bloody bedclothes. He lifted the covers and exposed the body attached to it, and another body cowering at the back of the bed. He realized he was looking at the bodies of two children, but didn’t recognize the young Stillinger sisters. They were mutilated beyond all recognition. A kerosine lamp sat on the floor near the foot of the bed. The Moore’s ax rested against the wall and was partially wiped clean. Dr. Cooper checked the second floor, accompanied by three men. First, he entered the master bedroom. A lamp sat out of place at the foot of the bed, just as in the previous room. Dr. Cooper pulled back the blankets and saw Mr. and Mrs. Moore, both dead with bludgeoned faces. He next headed for the children’s room, where all of the Moore children lay lifeless in an equally gory scene. Dr. Cooper didn’t touch the bodies. He noted that the blood dried and stiffened the fabric of the sheets and pillows. The brain matter that splattered onto the beds and walls was gelatinous by that time. He estimated it took five or six hours for that to happen after the initial injuries. The killings, then, occurred between 12 and 5:00 AM. Edward Landers, a nearby visitor, testified that around 11:00 PM, he heard yelling, “…like one boy hooting for another.” Ed Selley stopped a second doctor, Dr. Frank Spalding Williams, on the street and requested he come to the home. He was the first to actually examine the bodies. The victims’ faces were beaten in. The murderer struck with such frenzy, he damaged the ceiling above Josiah and Sarah’s bed with each ax swing. Yet, he took care that the victims’ faces, mirrors, and windows in the house were covered. Strangely, the killer left a 4lb slab of pork next to the murder weapon. In the kitchen, a half-eaten plate of food sat on the dining table next to a bowl of blood-tinged water and yet another slab of pork. Could this have been the work of a butcher? Dr. Williams noted that the younger sister, Ina, had an ax wound to the skull, whereas all of the others were bludgeoned. The killer covered her head with a boy’s gray coat. The older sister, Lena, was perhaps the only victim who woke during the attack. Blood patterns suggest that she moved after the first blow. Her blood-free underclothes were at some point placed beneath the bed. During the inquest, Dr. Williams stated that sexual assault couldn’t be ruled in or out. The coroner, Dr. Linquist, arrived at 9:00 AM. He assembled a coroner’s jury late that afternoon, but didn’t enter the crime scene for several hours. The district attorney didn’t release the bodies to the undertaker until well after 10 PM. The community of Villisca lost its innocence that night. Residents once felt safe enough to leave doors unlocked, were now looking at their neighbors through a lens of suspicion. Three theories, in particular, might hold water. William “Blackie” Mansfield was the prime suspect, as far as the Burns Detective Agency and Detective James Newton Wilkerson were concerned. Mansfield had many aliases — George Worley, or Jack Turnbaugh, for instance. Wilkerson suggests Mansfield was a serial killer and cocaine addict. Mansfield, formerly of Blue Island Illinois, was implicated in the ax murders of his wife, her parents, and his own infant just two years after the Villisca incident. Wilkerson also believed he committed two other ax murders in Paola, Kansas, and Aurora, Colorado, four days before the death of the Moore household. In each murder, the mirrors were covered, and a kerosine lamp left at the end of the bed. Also, the other crimes included a bloody washbowl on the kitchen table. Although the science of fingerprinting was in its infancy, Mansfield knew his prints were on file at Leavenworth, and all of the crime scenes appeared to be wiped clean of prints. Detective Wilkerson had insurmountable evidence against Mansfield, who was arrested in 1916 for the crimes. However, Mansfield provided a solid alibi; he was in Illinois when murder visited Villisca and proved it through payroll records. He was cleared of all charges and awarded $2,225 in a suit he brought against Wilkerson."
Medium.com,Arts & Entertainment,The Murder That Inspired Hardy’s ‘Tess of the d’Urbervilles’,True Crime,https://medium.com/@tudorscribe/the-murder-that-inspired-hardys-tess-of-the-d-urbervilles-f132e6f77845?source=topic_page---------38------------------1," In Victorian England a woman was hanged for killing her husband In Thomas Hardy’s novel Tess of the d’Urbervilles, the title character possesses the kind of beauty that draws a certain sort of attention: “A small minority, mainly strangers, would look long at her in casually passing by, and grow momentarily fascinated by her freshness, and wonder if they would ever see her again: but to almost everybody she was a fine and picturesque country girl, and nothing more.” But that attention leads to tragedy for Tess, who, after being abused and mistreated by the man whom she lives with, finally murders him. At the end of the novel, Tess is hanged in the “city of Wintoncester, that fine old city.” The reader is spared the details of this execution, only being told that a black flag slowly moves up the staff after the execution is finished. It was otherwise for Thomas Hardy, author of Tess of the d’Urbervilles, who when he was 16 years old witnessed the public hanging of a woman charged with murdering her husband. Martha Brown became the last woman to be hanged in Dorset when in 1856, aged 44, she was found guilty of murdering her violent husband after he had beaten her with a whip during an argument. Elizabeth Martha Brown was a servant, an ordinary woman who married a younger man, John Brown, a fellow servant. But she had a little saved, for it was said that he married her for her money as well as for her looks. She was quite attractive. After Martha discovered him in bed with another woman, they quarreled, he beat her, and she retaliated by hitting him in the head with an ax. Afterward, she insisted that his head wound was caused by a horse kicking him. Martha was found guilty at trial, and the sentence of hanging was mandatory. There was some sympathy for the abuse she’d suffered, but the Home Secretary refused to mitigate the death sentence because she persisted with her horse story. In fact, in her cell, after being condemned, Martha admitted her guilt. She said in her confession: “I was much enraged, and in an ungovernable passion, on being so abused and struck, I directly seized a hatchet which was lying close to where I sat, and which I had been using to break coal with to keep up the fire and keep his supper warm, and with it (the hatchet) I struck him several violent blows on the head. I could not say how many.” But apparently, this admission came too late for her death sentence to be changed. Several thousand people witnessed her hanging. “She was incredibly brave in the face of death,” according to capitalpunishmentuk.org. At the time, a newspaper writer said, “On her way to the scaffold her demeanour was extraordinary. The attendants on either side were entirely overcome, whilst she bore her awful position with the greatest resignation and composure.” Martha Brown is one of 47 people who’ve been buried at Dorchester Prison in Dorset. The jail was closed in 2013, and the property sold for development of houses. In 2017, news broke that bodies were buried there. The developer nonetheless wanted to build more than 100 houses over the remains of dead prisoners until writer and director Julian Fellowes of Downton Abbey and Gosford Park intervened. Fellowes wrote to the Bishop of Salisbury urging the church to “do the decent thing” and take care of all the bodies buried at the prison. In late March 2018, ecclesiastical authorities “ruled the bodies will be interred in a common grave at nearby Poundbury Cemetery, with a suitable service of Christian committal.” Fellowes, who is the president of the Hardy Society, says he would like Martha Brown’s remains to be identified with DNA obtained from a living descendant, and then buried in the village church where Thomas Hardy’s heart is interred. The Bishop of Salisbury has given developer City and Country consent to remove bodies buried on consecrated land at HMP Dorchester. But so far Martha Brown’s remains have not been singled out. A spokesman for the Diocese of Salisbury said any recovered bodies would be given “a proper Christian reinternment” at Poundbury Cemetery. Witnessing the hanging of Martha Brown had a profound impact on Hardy. Seventy years later, in a letter, it was still with him, and he admitted to feeling shame over his presence in the crowd. Hardy wrote: “I remember what a fine figure she showed against the sky as she hung in the misty rain, and how the tight black silk set off her shape as she wheeled half-round and back.” Hardy was struggling with challenges as a teenager. He was an outstanding student, but his family didn’t have the money for a university education. His formal education ended at sixteen, when he became apprenticed to a local architect. Nonetheless, he was writing novels by the time he was 25. Tess of the d’Urbervilles was Hardy’s second to last novel, published in 1891. Some consider Tess his masterpiece, but he had a difficult time having it published because Tess was a “fallen woman” depicted with sympathy. There were censorship issues to overcome. Hardy refused to back down and gave the novel the subtitle “A Pure Woman Faithfully Presented” so no one could ever doubt his intent and his feelings."
Medium.com,Arts & Entertainment,The Innocent Serial Killer,True Crime,https://medium.com/the-partnered-pen/the-innocent-serial-killer-455ce312bfd2?source=topic_page---------39------------------1," Each country has a serial killer that terrorized the neighborhoods in which they lived. None of the other serial killers ignited as much fear as “The Sydney Mutilator.” Over the course of about three years, men would walk through the town in fear, hoping they could reach their destination safely with their genitals intact. Of course, Australia’s “first true serial killer” would be even more sadistic and evil than others. The heat must bake the evil in more down there. William MacDonald took the task of bringing the devil to Earth in human form to heart. But there is more to his story. Was he a villain or a victim? MacDonald enlisted in the army at the tender age of 19. This was 1943 during the height of World War II. He was reluctant to make friends with fellow soldiers, which made it difficult for anyone to get a read on him. Until one night, in which MacDonald alleges that he was raped by a corporal. After initially saying he was traumatized by the event, he later admitted he liked it. This event seems to be the beginning of the series of atrocities he would commit later in life.In 1947, MacDonald was discharged from the army. He was diagnosed with schizophrenia. He was committed to a mental asylum for a while and treated with electroconvulsive therapy. It did not work or perhaps it worked a little too well.In either case, MacDonald was freed from the institution and began moving around. He moved to Canada in 1949, then to Australia in 1955. After he arrived, he was promptly arrested for touching a Detective’s genitals in a public restroom. He was placed on parole for this transgression. After parole, MacDonald began his trek to Sydney. On the way, he stopped in Brisbane in 1960. One fateful night, he drank with Amos Hurst. Each man tried to drink the other under the table. They took the drinking back to Hurst’s house. When Hurst was nice and drunk, MacDonald began to strangle him. Blood began to pour out of Hurst’s mouth, which is when MacDonald hit him. The punch was what ultimately killed Hurst. MacDonald tucked his victim into bed and waited for the police to come to arrest him. They never did. Hurst’s death was initially ruled an accident. The murders of Alfred Greenfield and Ernest Cobbin were similar in nature. MacDonald encountered both men in the public toilets. They drank beers before MacDonald stabbed them. The biggest difference in the murders were where they happened. Greenfield happened in Green Park, and Cobbin happened in Moore Park. In both cases, the men’s genitals were cut off after they were stabbed. The news of the murders started to spread and the public reacted with fear. The two murders set off off panic within the city of Sydney. Homeless men began fighting to get shelter. One reporter said: ‘It’s difficult now to imagine the level of panic in the city… Homeless men were fighting to get into hostels.” Victim number four proved to be quite difficult to kill. Even after stabbing Frank McLean a few times, the man kept living. A young family walked on the scene, and MacDonald hid away in the woods nearby. When they went to call the police, MacDonald finished the job. The penis was severed and put in a bag. The murderer disappeared into the night. Because the mutilation was so precise that police believed this was the work of a surgeon. Their theory allowed MacDonald to escape to Concorde. He also changed his name to Alan Brennan. Patrick Hackett had just been released from prison. He had been convicted of theft and other charges. On the night of his release, he met MacDonald. They went back to MacDonald’s new residence for a purported fun. After some drinks, Hackett fell asleep. Fatal mistake. MacDonald began stabbing his new victim. He cut into Hackett’s hand and tried to sever it. The victim woke up and tried to fight back, cutting MacDonald’s hand. This upset MacDonald and he renewed his attack more vigorously. Hackett died. His blood soaked into the floors. Allegedly, MacDonald went and told the ER doctor he had hurt himself while working. After getting his wounds cleaned and stitched up, he went back to his place and moved the body downstairs. Then fearing the police would be on their way soon, MacDonald fled and disappeared into the night. “I thought you were dead!” One former coworker said to MacDonald after seeing him for the first time in a while. A shocked MacDonald ran away after screaming, “leave me alone.” What happened? Police misidentified the dead body in the basement as Allan Brennan. That’s right, the police said that Hackett was MacDonald’s pseudonym. There has never been a reason given as to why this happened, almost as if it’s just one of those things. MacDonald went back to Brisbane and then to Melbourne. Another of his coworkers was suspicious of him and called the police. They did a quick check and brought him into the station for questioning. MacDonald said he had an ‘irresistible urge to kill’ because of the rape he suffered at the hands of his corporal all those years ago. He was sent to Long Bay Hospital until he was able to stand trial. Eventually, he did stand trial and was convicted of the murders, thanks to his confession. Justice McClemens sentenced MacDonald to life in prison. Once the most feared man in Australia, when it came time for parole, MacDonald refused it. Allegedly, he told guards he was too scared to be on the outside after all of his time in jail. This after defense lawyers argued that he heard voices taunting him to kill. After more than 59 years behind bars, MacDonald fell ill. He was taken to the Prince of Wales wing of the prison hospital. While no diagnosis was given, it has been reported the former “Mutilator” was in severe pain. As he succumbed to father death, he had instructions that he wanted to be resuscitated but prison doctors failed to comply with the order. Some call it poetic justice, others cry that it was an injustice. For MacDonald, it was another chapter in his life. Another point for people to debate whether he was a villain or a victim."

Really, all you have to do is turn on the news to realize that. I often find myself saying, “I just don’t get it,” and I’m glad I don’t get it. I figure that’s part of what makes me a normal person … or at least a stable one. But there is something about the Delphi Murders that chills me to the bone. I think it’s the evidence in the case, the audio and video recordings, that make it such a haunting case for me. Those things will be what eventually helps to solve the murders, but they are chilling nonetheless. Then there’s the setting of the crimes. I love walking in nature. Years ago, I used to go for nature walks alone in a local wildlife preserve. It was my chance to think, pray, and clear my head. That ended when, several years ago, a young woman was raped, beaten, set on fire, and left to die in that same wildlife preserve. Until that day, my greatest fear in the woods was walking face-first into a spider web. But the woods, I found out, can be a dangerous place."

Joan Rabel and Goldyne Pizer sat in a parked car outside the Fabiano home. They were watching, waiting for the lights to go out, so they could make their move. As the lights turned off throughout the house, then lastly, in the master bedroom, Rabel told Pizer, “All right, go do it.” Pizer got out of the car dressed in jeans, a khaki coat, red gloves, and heavy makeup that she covered up with a domino mask. She walked straight to the Fabiano door and rang the bell. Peter and Betty Fabiano had already gotten into bed. When they heard the doorbell, Peter got up to answer, thinking it was a trick-or-treater. “It’s a little late for this, isn’t it?” He asked as he opened the door. “No.” Is all Pizer said as she raised a brown bag. Both of her hands were holding something inside the bag, out of sight of Peter. She pulled the trigger, and it was clear what she was holding. The sound of the bullet being fired rang through the street, the bag exploded, and Peter fell where he stood in the doorway. Pizer didn’t wait to see if Peter was dead, or if anyone had seen her. She ran back to the car where Rabel was waiting. As Pizer got in, Rabel leaned over and kissed her, saying, “Thank you.” The two women left and quickly burned the clothes they were wearing in case they contained any trace evidence. Afterwards, they returned the getaway car to the friend they had borrowed from earlier that day. When the two women had completed their mission, Rabel said to Pizer. “Forget you ever knew me.” Then they went their separate ways. The next day Pizer realized that she still had the murder weapon, a Smith & Wesson .38. And she had no idea what to do with it. So she went to a Downtown LA department store. There she rented a locker and left the gun. Betty had heard the shot go off and ran downstairs to check on her husband, Peter. She found him lying on the floor, unconscious. He had been shot once. The bullet entered his chest just below his heart. Peter was rushed by ambulance to a nearby hospital, but he never regained consciousness. Betty had to be sedated for days after the shooting, unable to help the police in their search. Finally, after Betty was able to compose herself, she spoke with the police. She told them that she heard two voices coming from downstairs, a man, and someone that sounded like a man pretending to be a woman. The first thought was that this was a gang shooting. LA was suffering from gang problems, even back in the 50s. Peter had been charged years before with bookmaking in the 40s before he moved to California. But since being in the sunshine state, he had opened a string of hair salons and had stayed clean, so they didn’t think his murder was gang-related after all. When questioned about who would want to harm her husband, Betty said she could only think of one person, Joan Rabel. Betty said that Rabel was a friend of the family; she didn’t elaborate at first about her and Rabel’s relationship. As the weeks went by and the police ran out of suspects to question, it started to look like it might go cold. Then they caught a break. A gun had been found in a downtown department store, and after a ballistics test, it matched the bullet fired into Peter Fabiano. A search of the weapon showed it was registered to a Goldyne Pizer, a lab assistant at the Children’s Hospital. And no one that had even been on the police’s radar in connection to the Fabiano’s. On November 12, Pizer was arrested. In the interrogation room, she confessed to everything, telling police that it was all Rabel’s idea. Rabel had coerced her into killing Peter; she didn’t even know the man. Police had interviewed Rabel several times, but she claimed to know nothing about the murder. Now they got an arrest warrant, and Rabel got a lawyer. Meanwhile, Pizer was telling everything. “She told me that Mr. Fabiano was a vile, evil man — a man who destroyed everything around him,” Pizer told authorities. “She told me that he mistreated his wife and that he was dealing narcotics.” The murder weapon, she said, had been bought with money Rabel had given her. Pizer told how they had been planning the murder for weeks. The two of them had driven by the Fabiano’s home before, and Rabel had pointed out Peter to her, so she would recognize him when the time came. Peter and Betty Fabiano had met in the late ’40s in New York. Peter had gotten out of the marines and was driving a truck, and Betty was a pretty divorcee with two children. They married. They moved to Los Angeles in 1956, where they opened two beauty salons. Peter hired Joan Rabel to work in one of the shops, and this is how she came into their lives. Even as the Fabiano’s life looked to be coming together, their marriage was falling apart. Betty needed space and moved out of the family home and went to stay with Rabel. At the time, people closest saw that the two women were romantically involved and called it “abnormal.” LA has always been a progressive city, but this was the 50’s and progressiveness only went so far. After a while, Betty decided she wanted to work on her marriage and left Rabel to go back to Peter and her life. Peter had found out about the relationship, and those close to him said he had felt threatened by it. Peter was threatened so much that when he and Betty talked about working on their marriage, she vowed never to have contact with Rabel again. Soon after Betty went back to Peter, Rabel realized that her girlfriend was serious about fixing her marriage. Knowing she had lost Betty is when Rabel found Pizer. And started selling her on how horrible of a man Peter Fabiano was, and that he had to die. Rabel never elaborated on why she wanted Peter dead. Was it because she wanted to punish Betty? Or did she think with Peter gone, Betty would come back to her? Before their trial started in December, both women had to meet with three psychiatrists. The courts seemed to believe that their choice of sexual partners might make them unfit to stand trial. Pizer was just as open with the psychiatrist as she had been with the police. “I had no motive, personally. Whatever motive I had was to please Joan. I was always easily influenced. I have been impressionable and always trusting.” The psychiatrist who had met with Pizer wrote this in his notes. “The only thought she had was that she had saved her friend, Joan Rabel, from an evil person.” When their trial started, both Pizer and Rabel pleaded not guilty, Pizer, because of insanity. Pizer took the stand in her defense and openly cried when she described to the jury what she had done that Halloween night. People were shocked that Rabel was all smiles during the trial. It appeared that she thought the whole thing was a production, and everyone was there to see her. Initially, they had both been charged with first-degree murder, but through a plea deal, it was reduced to second-degree murder. Each woman was sentenced to 5 years to life in prison. Both women were eventually released. This murder was so much more than just a woman pulling the trigger on a man. There was a marriage and an affair, both fighting to win. I feel there was manipulation by more than one of the parties, and it led directly to the death that Halloween night. I also think mental issues were going on, though they had nothing to do with sexuality. I think the root of the problem was a universal one, when people need to be loved so badly, they’ll do anything to attain it. The lack of love causes a lot of problems in the world. This story is just one example."
Medium.com,Arts & Entertainment,Famous Serial Killers — The Shoe Fetish Slayer Jerome Brudos,True Crime,https://medium.com/the-full-time-writer/famous-serial-killers-the-shoe-fetish-slayer-jerome-brudos-2c381437f3d8?source=topic_page---------43------------------1," Jerome Brudos was born on 31 January 1939 in a small town in South Dacota. He had an older brother. When he was little, his parents often moved with him. He had an extremely disturbing relationship with his mother. She would have preferred to have a daughter and let little Jerome feel that she rejected him. She forced him to put on girls’ clothes to humiliate him. But his mother’s vicious excesses made it impossible for him to assume his own gender identity. At the age of five, he found a pair of high-heeled shoes on a dump. He took them home with him and tried them on. When his mother caught him with it, she beat him up terribly and burned the shoes. So Brudos grew up with an irrepressible hatred for his mother and years had the desire to take revenge on her one day. He kept his shoe fetish and continued to live it out. Among other things, he stole shoes from his primary school teacher, and as he grew up, he kept taking shoes, but also underwear from women in the neighborhood. This fetish was accompanied by increasingly intense fantasies of violence against women. He also began to put these fantasies into practice early in his teenage years. So he stalked some women first until he went over to knocking down some of them or choking them to unconsciousness before stealing their shoes and clothes. At seventeen, he forced a woman with a knife to undress. Then he photographed the naked woman. He was then sent to a psychiatric hospital for nine months, where the doctors diagnosed him with schizophrenia. He then managed to graduate from high school and join the army. There, however, he was released after a short time when his bizarre tendencies were discovered. Finally, Buros married and became the father of two children. He had his young wife entirely under his control. She did everything he told her. So she was not allowed to leave the house without asking permission. He also forced her to wear high heels all the time. She was also forbidden to enter the basement and attic. Friends and acquaintances interviewed later described Brudos as a caring family man who neither smoked nor drank. In 1968, when Jerome Buros was already married and father of two, he committed his first murder. He now lived in Portland with his small family. A young woman knocked on his door. She had simply been wrong about the house, but this mistake had sealed her fate. Buros dragged her into the house, drove her into the garage of the home, and strangled her. Then he dressed her in stolen high heels and underwear. Finally, he cut off a foot from her, which he kept in his freezer, along with the pumps in which the foot was still stuck. He disposed of the body in a nearby river. Brudos attacked his next victim while completely wrapped in women’s clothes. He also brought this victim to his garage, where he forced her to put on his collection of stolen underwear and shoes. He photographed them, raped, and strangled them several times. Finally, he hanged her. Even after her death, he had sex with her lifeless body again. As the climax of the gruesome ritual, he cut off the body’s breasts. This unfortunate sacrifice also ended in the river in which Brudos had already disposed of the first corpse. The third victim fell into Brudos’s hands when a twenty-three-year-old woman near Salem had a car breakdown. Brudos stopped and offered her help. When she got into the car with him, he strangled her and had sex with the body on the spot. He then took her to his garage, where he hung her up. He raped the body over and over again for several days and photographed it again and again. He also cut off a breast from this victim before finally disposing of it in the river. This time he threw away the foot of the first victim along with the new body. The foot was now decayed and no longer useful to Jerome Brudos. Victim number four ended up like the first three in his garage. This time, however, he refrained from severing a breast. Instead, he inserted a power cord into her body and tried to make her “jump,” according to later statements. But that didn’t work to his regret. After this fourth murder, Brudos tried it on a few other women but had no more success. One of his kidnappings became Brudos’ downfall. A woman he had tried to strangle contacted the police. After the description of the incident, the police were convinced that the perpetrator had to be the long-sought Shoe Fetish Slayer. The woman had contact with Brudos before the crime and therefore had his telephone number. The police got the woman to arrange another meeting with her tormentor. They had to catch him red-handed to have something on him. The woman agreed and contacted Brudos. When he agreed to a meeting, the police sent a female officer to the meeting as a decoy so as not to endanger the witness. He was arrested when he arrived at the meeting place. His house and garage were searched. There, the police found numerous pieces of evidence that heavily burdened Brudos. Most ambiguous were the numerous photos found in his improvised photo lab in his garage. On them were his victims — first still alive, then later in various stages of decay. Based on the overwhelming evidence, Brudos confessed a total of four murders. In court, however, only three murders and several assaults could be proved against him, since one of his victims was missing every trace. Also, photos of her were not found in his collection. Brudos was sentenced to life camp imprisonment. During his time in prison, Brudos had been abused again and again by fellow prisoners and once even raped anally with an object. He died in prison in 2006. Sources https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tPbrHFq8s1w https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jerome_Brudos Read also: do you want more of this?

Medium.com,Arts & Entertainment,The Zombie Hunter: Trial Started for Arizona’s Real-Life Serial Killer,True Crime,https://medium.com/@kympasqualini/the-zombie-hunter-trial-started-for-arizonas-real-life-serial-killer-637ef6514e9b?source=topic_page---------44------------------1," Known by his friends as the “Zombie Hunter,” Bryan Patrick Miller, 46, began his death penalty trial on October 14, 2019, in Phoenix, Ariz. Charged with the 1992 and 1993 murders of Angela Brosso and Melanie Bernas, investigators wonder if there could there be more victims. Miller was arrested at his North Phoenix home on January 13, 2015, ending a search for a killer that haunted the Valley for more than two decades. The Victims Angela Brosso, 22, grew up in Camp Hill, Pa., outside of Harrisburg. Friends and family describe her as “happy go lucky” and fearless. “She was a force,” her mother Linda told E.J. Montini, a columnist at the Arizona Republic. “One of the things her father said about her was that she changed the nature of a room when she entered it. And it’s true, you know? She really did.” She was a shy little girl who always wore dresses, with long blonde hair her mom would put in buns, pigtails and French braids. Her mom called her Angie. Angela was an adventurer and an animal lover. In high school, Angela worked at Kentucky Friend Chicken and would spend everything she made on her guinea pigs and bunnies. During a careers-day program in high school, Angela saw a presentation from a representative at DeVry Institute and enrolled in their school in Newark, N.J. for two years. She then transferred to the DeVry in Los Angeles and graduated with honors. Shortly thereafter, Angela accepted a job at Syntellect, a Phoenix electronics company and moved to North Phoenix where she resided with her boyfriend at an apartment complex located at I-17 and Cactus Avenue. Angela would be nearly 50 now, had gone out for an afternoon bicycle ride in late 1992, along a bike path that snakes through the city along the Arizona Canal. Her nude and mutilated torso was found in a dirt field near her apartment complex. Her head discovered several days later, about a mile from her home, floating in a canal grate near Metro Center. With Phoenix Police Department’s best working her case, it would come to haunt them throughout the years. “Every homicide is a tragedy, but I can honestly say this was one of the most horrific murders to ever occur in the history of this city,” now-retired Detective Leo Speliopoulos told the Arizona Republic. Though Speliopoulos has never said what evidence was collected at the scene, he has clearly stated what wasn’t found: No witness, no description of a suspect, no weapons, no belongings, and no bike. Ten months after Angela Brosso’s murder, the body of Melanie Bernas was found floating in the Arizona Canal not far from where Angela’s body had been found. Melanie Bernas was a junior at Arcadia High school and described as the “girl next door” with dreams of becoming a doctor. She was an achiever who had visits with Pepperdine University and the University of California-Berkeley scheduled just weeks after her death. Her friend Daphne Marcus told the Arizona Republic that she grew up just up the street from Melanie and would ride bikes, have sleepovers, and jump on Melanie’s trampoline growing up. Melanie was found near I-17 and Dunlap on September 21, 1993. She had been stabbed several times; a turquoise bodysuit lay nearby. Her mountain bike — missing to this day. Police later linked the two murders. To snare the perpetrator, police entered the DNA profile collected at the scene into the Federal Bureau of Investigation’s Combined DNA Index System (CODIS) — and waited. Police followed hundreds of tips over the years, even placing street signs along the path near where the bodies were found. Local reporters worked for years on stories to remind the public the murders were still unsolved. Police revisited the case over and over throughout the years, accumulating enough files to justify its own cabinet. Police enlisted the help of the Vidocq Society, an organization consisting of forensic experts who dedicate their time to solving cold cases to develop a profile of the man who would likely be their killer. Analyzing the cases, Vidocq predicted the man would still be living in the general area of the murders and would have committed precursor crimes. A man who possibly acted out fantasies and set fires. Vidocq detectives also said it was possible police had crossed paths with the individual earlier in the investigation. When police circumnavigated the case files, they found Miller who, as a juvenile, had been arrested in the stabbing of a woman at Paradise Valley Mall in 1990. A precursor event that supported Vidocq’s predictions. Miller told police he stabbed the woman because she reminded him of his mother. Throughout the years Miller had avoided detection by police because his DNA profile had not been entered into CODIS, the national DNA database that cross-references DNA samples from crime scenes with convicted felons. Phoenix Police Sergeant Trent Crump said Miller had been interviewed when the murders occurred, but there was no physical evidence tying him to the case. In the weeks before the arrest, police had been surveilling Miller and, using a ruse, collected his DNA. Crump would not say what kind of ruse was used but admitted that it is relatively simple to obtain DNA from items people discard. Who is Bryan Patrick Miller? Bryan Patrick Miller is described as quiet by his landlady but went on to say he wasn’t a good tenant and rarely paid his rent on time. She explained the reason she didn’t kick him out was because of her affection for Miller’s 15-year-old daughter, Sarah. Other renters described him as a shy and a not “quite normal” young man who would dress up in Cosplay, who drove an old decommissioned police car with lights on top and prominent sticker on the trunk reading Zombie Hunter. Miller marketed himself as the Zombie Hunter on Facebook and other social media platforms, offering to make appearances at zombie walks and comic bookstores. Miller’s Facebook photographs feature the macabre and reflect a wide range of hobbies to include the fantasy subculture, steampunk, and Comic-Con. On another popular website called DeviantArt, artists can upload their work and share it with the public. Like Facebook, fans of the art site would “like” the photographs. Miller chose to like some of the most frightening images consisting of women who were decapitated or horrifically mutilated. Miller lived with his daughter Sarah and was a member of the Mennonite Church. Ironically, Mennonites are non-violent and tend to oppose violence and war. Court records indicate Miller had petitioned for full custody of his daughter in 2008, claiming Sarah was suffering from health problems living with her mother who Miller claimed was homeless and unemployed. The Arrest On January 14, 2015, over 25 years after the gruesome murders of Melanie Bernas and Angela Brosso, police arrested Miller, 42 at the time, as a suspect after getting a DNA match using genealogy software. According to court documents, Miller denied involvement in the murders but had no explanation of how his DNA matched the profile found on the victims. Miller told police that he lived near the bike path and admitted to frequently biking the path. Police say they are not ruling out the potential that Miller could be connected to other Valley murders. Crump said Miller had moved to Hawaii and Washington prior to returning to Phoenix. Phoenix investigators are continuing to work with other state agencies analyzing unsolved murders for any connections. Crump told the Arizona Republic that it would be “very unusual” if Brosso was Miller’s first victim and Bernas his last. When police made the arrest at Miller’s home on Ninth Street and Mountain View Road, one could see officers carrying out numerous boxes of items and even a bicycle. When investigating the scene, police described Miller as a classic hoarder. “Floor to ceiling, it was packed with all sorts of junk — boxes to paper to furniture — I can’t even tell you what wasn’t in there,” said Crump. Are There More Victims? Reports obtained by ABC 15, revealed Miller’s own mother called Phoenix Police out of the blue to tell them her son had a strange obsession with Angela Brosso’s case over the years. Miller’s ex-wife also made claims there may be more victims. In 2015, police released new details in the case that all but confirm those suspicions. Brandy Myers Brandy Myers, 13, vanished on May 26, 1992, while knocking on neighborhood doors raising money for her school’s book club. She just so happened to live in the same neighborhood as Miller. Brandy’s sister Kristin Thelen describes her sister as having diminished mental capacity and very trusting. “So, we walked by him every single day. We had no idea we were living by this monster,” said Thelen. “He lived three blocks from my house and one block from our school.” Police now believe Miller’s house was the last door Brandy knocked on. “I will tell you that he is a very strong investigative lead in the investigation,” said Crump. In fact, Phoenix police filed a first-degree murder charge against Miller in the disappearance of Brandy. However, the county attorney declined prosecution, stating there was “no likelihood of conviction.” Miller’s ex-wife Amy’s interviews with police revealed that Miller had confessed to Brandy’s murder decades ago saying, “He grabbed her and dragged her into the house,” Amy told Crime Watch Daily. “At the time I truly believed he was just making up the story.” Thelen recalls the day Brandy disappeared. “I was supposed to go with her,” said Thelen. “He pulled her into the house, killed her, dismembered her, and threw her body out in the trash,” said Thelen. Thelen is calling for Miller to confess to the crime. Brandy’s body has never been found and Phoenix Police say the investigation is ongoing. Adrienne Salinas On June 15, 2013, Adrienne Salinas, 19, was walking to a local gas station to get a cab. Somewhere between her apartment and the station only a quarter-mile away, she vanished. Adrienne was living in Tempe, Ariz., and attending community college. Her friends talk about her smile and how she was soft-spoken, describing her as one of the sweetest and nicest people they have ever met. Out on her own for the first time, she lived with two roommates. She also had a job but had been unable to work after suffering from Valley Fever and undergoing lung surgery. The night she disappeared; Adrienne had left a party that she attended with several friends. That evening, police received a 911 dispatch call reporting a car driving erratically on First Street and had just hit a curb and had two flat tires. The vehicle plate matched Adrienne’s vehicle. Adrienne had abandoned her car just a few blocks from her apartment. She sent a text to her boyfriend at 4:43 a.m. that she was coming over. Ten minutes later, she called for a cab. By 5:07 a.m. she either turned her phone off or it went dead and so did her trail. On August 6, Adrienne’s body was found in a wash in Apache Junction near the Superstition Mountains, 30 miles away from where she was last seen. There had been a storm with 6 feet of rushing water going through a wash. When the water receded, her remains were found. DNA confirmed is was Adrienne but in the medical examiner report, it doesn’t mention her head or hands, stating the remains were mummified, mostly just bones. Many questioned if she had been decapitated. After learning about Adrienne’s condition, Keene Azariah went to Tempe Police and suggested they look at his friend Bryan Patrick Miller. Azariah claimed he and Miller had attended a party together a mile away from Adrienne’s apartment on the same weekend she vanished. Her body was also found close to where Miller regularly participated in Steampunk and Cosplay activities. “If you consider that he’s under investigation for murder and he’s a mile away from our case, it’s definitely on our radar,” said Detective Akey of Tempe Police Department. “He’s under investigation for this case, yes. Another person we would like to have a conversation with.” Tempe Police say the murder of Adrienne is an ongoing investigation. Shannon Aumuck Shannon Aumuck, 16, resembled Brandy Myers and vanished when she ran away from a group home not far from Brandy Myers North Phoenix neighborhood. She was never reported missing. Her body was found on May 27, 1992, in the north valley and remained unidentified until 2011. She had been buried as a Jane Doe at Twin Buttes Cemetery in Tempe until her body was exhumed on March 22. Shannon was classified as a “throwaway child” who lived her life in foster care under Child Protection Services (CPS). She was a chronic runaway who had behavioral problems and contact with police constantly. According to police, between 1989 and 1991 it was reported she ran away at least 40 times. Shannon’s birth has been a result of a sexual assault to a 16-year old mother and adopted out to a family who lived in Flagstaff and later moved to Scottsdale. Because of Shannon’s out of control behavior they gave her back to CPS when she was 12. Her body had been found in a trash pile by an ATV rider in the rural area of 26th Street and Deer Valley Road. “She was tossed aside in death as she was in life,” Detective Stuart Somershoe told the East Valley Tribune. Somershoe and his colleague Will Anderson took over the case in late 2010. They soon found Shannon’s birth mother still lived in the Valley and collected a DNA profile from her. The two then began reviewing 1,600 reports on runaways between 1991 and 1994 hoping to identify the girl which eventually led to an unidentified girl buried in the Tempe cemetery. Shannon’s cause of death was strangulation. Police continue to investigate Shannon’s murder and hope they can provide answers for both Brandy and Shannon’s families. “Nobody who dies should ever go as unidentified,” Somershoe said. “Everybody has a mother; everybody has a brother. The good news is that we have identified her. The bad news is we still have a child murderer on the loose.”"

Unfortunately for three young girls, they didn’t receive the care they should have. Halloween night 1977 in Lawton, Oklahoma. When 19-month-old Nima Louise Carter’s parents put her down to bed that night, they didn’t notice anything strange in her room. Little Nima started to cry after they left the room, but as a lot of parents were back then, they let her cry it out. The next morning all they would find was an empty crib. The nursery room window was still locked, and there were no broken windows or unlocked doors in the rest of the house. Investigators first on the scene wondered if the kidnapper had already been in the house? Possibly the suspect was hiding in the closet when the family went to bed the night before. As the days passed and Nima wasn’t found, the investigators doubted it was a sexual predator, or they would have probably found the body. So they circled back to those closest to Nima. Her parents were both interrogated and given a polygraph test, which they both passed."
Medium.com,Arts & Entertainment,Jim Jones and the Jonestown Massacre,True Crime,https://medium.com/@delanirbartlette/jim-jones-and-the-jonestown-massacre-2c5ae2dbff15?source=topic_page---------46------------------1," Forty-one years ago, nearly 1,000 men, women, and children lost their lives — most of them, by their own hands — in a remote village hidden in the jungles of Guyana. Until the terrorist attacks of 9/11, it was the largest loss of American civilians in a single, non-natural event: the mass murder/suicide of the members of Jim Jones’ Peoples Temple in Jonestown, Guyana. For many, the event is seared into our national memory. The mere mention of the name “Jonestown” sends a dark shiver down the spine. We still say someone “drank the Kool-Aid” when they’ve been brainwashed or willingly duped. Yet it started with the best of intentions. Jones was a Born Cult Leader Born in the small town of Crete, Indiana, Jones had a troubled childhood — by all accounts, his father was an unemployed, neglectful alcoholic, while his mother worked outside the home to support the family. This dynamic left young Jones alone most of the time. Classmates and friends described him as “weird,” saying “something was ‘off’” about him. They say he was obsessed with religion and death, often holding funerals for animals in his barn. It was rumored that he once killed a cat with a knife, then held a funeral for it. As a result, he was not exactly the most popular kid in Crete. As an outcast himself, he developed a great deal of sympathy for African-Americans, who he felt endured similar treatment to his. His passion for racial equality would be the hallmark of his entire career. He eventually found a home in the Pentecostal Church and began preaching to the other kids in town. But his zealotry — and shunning of “sinful” ways like drinking and dancing — turned many off. Yet he was a good student and a talented public speaker. He was also a voracious reader who studied Joseph Stalin, Karl Marx, Mao Zedong, Mahatma Gandhi, and Adolf Hitler. He graduated high school early and entered Indiana University, where he met Marceline, whom he married a year later. Over the years, they had one biological son and adopted seven more children of various races. Jones referred to them as his “rainbow family.” To support his family, he went door to door selling pet monkeys and traveling on the revival circuit until, in 1952, Jones got a job as a student pastor at the Somerset Methodist Church in a poor, predominantly white neighborhood in Indianapolis. By the following year, Jones had made a reputation for himself in the state as a healer and evangelist. However, he ran into conflict early on. Jones wanted to hold racially integrated services, but the church did not agree, so Jones struck out on his own. Jim Jones Founds His Own Church Jones held a large religious convention in Indianapolis in 1956, and with the proceeds, formed his own church. The church went through some name changes before it became known as the Peoples Temple. To help build his following, he bought time on a local AM radio station to air his sermons. He also became more well-known for his racially progressive views. In 1960, Indianapolis Mayor Charles Boswell appointed Jones director of the Human Rights Commission. Ignoring the mayor’s advice to keep a low profile, Jones was an outspoken activist for civil rights, even going so far as to set up sting operations to catch restaurants refusing to serve African-Americans. He was immensely popular with Indianapolis’ African-American community, but many whites and white-owned businesses were critical of him. He faced harassment and death threats — though there is some question as to how many of these were actually instigated by Jones himself. Once again, Jones needed to move to greener pastures. The Peoples Temple Moves West After a brief stay in Brazil to scope out a potential safe relocation site in the event of nuclear war (and study Brazilian syncretic religions), he returned to his failing congregation in Indiana. In 1965, predicting that nuclear war was imminent, he convinced more than 100 of his church members to move to a new “socialist Eden” in Redwood Valley, near Ukiah in northern California. The membership increased dramatically as Jones bought Greyhound buses and took them on cross-country tours. He would preach his “apostolic socialism” and promise his listeners a home, a job, and a bed. He also convinced many senior citizens to sell their homes and give the money to the church in exchange for being taken care of. Faced with the prospect of ending up in indifferent or even abusive nursing homes, many seniors accepted this deal, and were in fact quite well cared-for by the Peoples Temple. The Seeds of a Cult Services at the Peoples Temple were raucous and soulful, much like those at African-American churches. They went on for hours, starting with lots of singing and dancing. Like Hitler, Jones would wait until the crowd was sufficiently worked up before taking the stage. There he would deliver animated sermons, prophesy, and conduct (staged) faith healings. The transformation from progressive spiritual congregation to suicide cult happened slowly. As one former member put it, “Jones took us to the edge of what was acceptable, then over that line.” Over the course of several years, he had moved the line so far that nothing was unacceptable. The able-bodied who followed Jones back to California did indeed have jobs waiting for them. Between the farm, administrative duties, and other tasks, members found themselves working sometimes 20 hours a day. People were made to feel guilty if they slept too much, so most were exhausted and suffering from chronic sleep-deprivation — a situation ripe for brainwashing. In addition, anyone who worked an outside job was expected to hand over their entire paycheck to the church. They were given a meager allowance, but were, for the most part, taken care of: trips to the doctor, new shoes, and other needs were paid for by the church. Troubling teachings started coming down from the pulpit: Jones began preaching that sexual relationships, and even nuclear families, were “selfish.” He, and other members of the congregation, would work to break up families, since the church was the only “family” and Jones was supposed to be “the father of all.” And while he would shame and punish members for having sexual relations, he was having sex with nearly everyone in the congregation, male and female. He claimed he was the “only true heterosexual” on earth, and that anyone who showed interest in sex was simply overcompensating. Paranoia also began to take root. People were encouraged to report others — including parents, spouses, and friends — for any infraction. More and more, members began to feel they couldn’t talk to anyone for fear of being reported. And it was in Ukiah that Jones administered his first test of loyalty: having the congregation drink punch, then informing them that it had been poisoned. It wasn’t, of course, but it gave Jones the first foothold on the ladder that would lead to the events in Jonestown. The Peoples Temple Expansion By 1974, Jones saw that the Peoples Temple had expanded as far as it could in Ukiah. He took his congregation to San Francisco (and also opened branches in San Fernando and Los Angeles). There, Jones and his church got involved in politics. When a local activist group needed support for some action — a march or demonstration — Jones would bus in hundreds of Peoples Temple members to support them. Their support likely won George Moscone the governorship, so in thanks, Moscone appointed Jones chair of the San Francisco Housing Authority Commission. During this time, Jones enjoyed quite a successful political life, hobnobbing with First Lady Roslyn Carter, vice presidential candidate Walter Mondale, state assemblymen, the vice governor, and even noted activist Angela Davis. But behind closed doors, the church’s activities began taking a darker turn. As a “family,” the church handled its own discipline. People began to be called up to the altar for things as minor as sneaking off, owning personal “luxuries,” or having sex. The punishments went from slapping and spanking to beatings and torture, using boards and electrical shocks. One woman was made to strip naked and be publicly humiliated. Families turned on each other — one former member said “it was like the Gestapo.” Anyone who tried to leave faced death threats. At the same time, Jones’ paranoia was growing, as was his drug use — by this time, he was taking a wide range of drugs, including both barbiturates and amphetamines. He was constantly claiming the Peoples Temple was under attack by the US government. At one point the Peoples Temple’s house of worship was burned down by an unknown arsonist and had to be rebuilt. So in 1975, Jones and several members went to Guyana to find a place, he thought, “to practice, free of the oppression and racism of the US.” Meanwhile, a few defectors managed to escape and went to the media. Reporter Marshall Kilduff was going to run an expose in New West Magazine. Jones managed to get advance notice of Kilduff’s piece, and after unsuccessfully trying to get the magazine to kill the story, flew his supporters out to Jonestown six hours before the story hit the stands. Jonestown Officially called “The Peoples Temple Agricultural Project,” Jonestown was carved out of the middle of the Guyanese jungle, miles away from any towns or roads. The one radio to communicate with the outside world was tightly controlled by Jones. Armed guards were stationed along the perimeter. Members were made to work long hours in hot temperatures with little food. In such an isolated setting, Jones’ drug use became more obvious. He ranted incoherently, stumbled, and slurred his words. He broadcast his voice over loudspeakers 24 hours a day, indoctrinating everyone that they were under siege. He claimed he was under attack by the CIA, that he had been cursed by a defector, and there were bugging devices planted in the trees. Sometimes Jones would administer tests over the subjects he broadcasted. Failure was met with beatings. Any complaint or criticism of Jones or Jonestown would be reported on by informers, and followed by beatings, extra work, withholding of food, drugging, and even torture. Expressing a desire to leave was one of the worst things a member could do — second only to an actual escape attempt. Not that escape was possible. Even if someone could make it past the armed guards, there were hundreds of miles of thick jungle between Jonestown and Georgetown. Besides, as soon as people arrived in Jonestown, they surrendered their passports and money to the church for “safekeeping.” The Peoples Temple Agricultural Project was a nearly perfectly designed prison. Following Jones’ paranoid rants about being under attack by the US government, the members of Jonestown began rehearsing “revolutionary suicide,” or mass suicide as a political protest. Back in the US, concerned family members were agitating for someone to investigate the Peoples Temple for human rights abuses against its members. They embarked on letter-writing campaigns and finally got Rep. Leo Ryan (D-Calif.) to agree to check out the situation. After much back-and-forth, Jones finally agreed to let Ryan and his group (aides, journalists, and some family members of Jones’ followers) come to Jonestown. In preparation, he drilled his followers on what to say. When the outsiders arrived, Jonestown put on a great show of happiness and unity. Jones, while less paranoid than usual, was still a rambling, drug-addled mess, but overall, everyone seemed happy and content. Except for the two people who managed to slip notes to the journalists, begging them to help them escape. When confronted with the notes, Jones claimed the writers were “playing games” and begged the reporters to just leave him and his followers alone. That night, more people came forward asking the congressman to help them leave. Jones claimed that the people were free to go, but not much later, someone attacked Ryan with a knife. Thankfully, Ryan wasn’t hurt seriously. Realizing things were not as happy as they appeared, Ryan and his group immediately gathered their things and left Jonestown for the nearby airstrip at Port Kaituma. At the last minute, Larry Layton joined the group, claiming he was also leaving. Other defectors were immediately suspicious of him. As soon as they arrived at the airstrip, a tractor pulling a trailer full of armed men arrived. The men opened fire. Inside one of the planes, Layton also drew a gun and began firing. Congressman Ryan, along with NBC reporter Don Harris, NBC cameraman Bob Brown, San Francisco Examiner photographer Greg Robinson, and Temple member Patricia Parks were killed. Several other members of the party were wounded. Meanwhile, back at Jonestown, Jones called everyone to the pavilion where he claimed he could see the future: that the plane with the congressman will crash out of the sky, he said, the Peoples Temple will be blamed, and they will be attacked and tortured. The only way out, he argued, was through revolutionary suicide. One woman tried to talk him out of it, but he didn’t budge. Nurses mixed the punch — likely a mixture of Kool-Aid and Flav-R-Aid — with cyanide and sedatives. They started with the children, administering the poison using oral syringes. As people begin convulsing and dying around him, Jones continued to talk, urging them to hurry, to stop being afraid and die with dignity. Not everyone drank the poison willingly, though. Some were held down and forced to drink it. Some were injected with it. Others were simply shot. In all, 918 people died at Jonestown on Nov. 18, 1978. Jones is among those who didn’t drink the punch. He died of a bullet wound below his right ear. Whether it was self-inflicted or from one of his followers (or defectors) remains a mystery."

In doing so, he killed not just one girl, but the spirit of Halloween. Halloween night 1973, 9-year-old Lisa French wanted to wear a butterfly costume, but her mother convinced her to wear something a bit warmer for the Fond du lac, Wisconsin weather. Lisa ended up dressing like a hobo. After eating dinner, she ran out of the door and started to trick-or-treat. She made plans to meet up with her friend and go to the Pumpkin Place, a safe area some of the parents had put together for the children. But her friend had gotten in trouble and wasn’t allowed to go. Lisa was left to go out alone. She only made it to three houses that night. The first two, a teacher and a classmate home’s, gave her candy and sent her on her way. The third held more sinister motives. Gerald Miles Turner Jr, would open that third door for Lisa and invite her inside. Turner used to share a duplex with Lisa’s family, so she knew him quite well. When he lived next door, she was fond of talking with him. So nothing would have seemed strange for him to invite her inside that night. After he had Lisa inside, he took her back to his bedroom, where he sexually assaulted her. He claimed that at some point, he realized she wasn’t breathing and tried to resuscitate her. But his girlfriend came home and interrupted him. So he put socks on his hands and moved Lisa’s body into the master bathroom to deal with later. He went out wrapped in a bathrobe, telling his girlfriend he didn’t feel well. While she was there, he kept returning to the bedroom, was he revisiting Lisa’s body? His girlfriend ended up leaving again to go to her mother’s. After she left is when Turner put Lisa’s body in a trash bag and her belongings in another. He took both bags a few miles out of town and dumped them in a field."
Medium.com,Arts & Entertainment,The Disturbing Death of Sylvia Likens,True Crime,https://medium.com/@hlemonroe/the-disturbing-death-of-sylvia-likens-ba64ec62d345?source=topic_page---------48------------------1," How mob mentality led to the torture-murder of an Indiana teen This article discusses child abuse, torture, sexual abuse, and murder in sometimes graphic detail. Sylvia Marie Likens, born on January 3, 1949, was the third child of Lester and Elizabeth Likens. She had four siblings, an older set of twins, Dianna and Daniel, and a younger set of twins, Jenny and Benny. Sylvia was sweet sixteen in 1965. She loved rollerskating and the Beatles. Sylvia had long, wavy, brown hair and a bright smile despite missing a front tooth due to an accident with her brother. Her family called her “Cookie.” Sylvia cared for her little sister Jenny, who had a limp leg due to Polio. She enjoyed spending her babysitting money on trips to the skating rink with Jenny. Sylvia fastened one skate to Jenny’s sturdy foot and held her hand so she could skate with the other kids. In 1965, Sylvia met Paula and Stephanie Baniszewski at Arsenal Technical High School. On June 3, 1965, Sylvia’s mother was arrested for shoplifting. Lester sold concessions at carnivals and usually took the boys with him, but could not bring his daughters. Since the Likens and Baniszewski girls got along, Lester decided to send Sylvia and Jenny to live with Gertrude. He agreed to pay $20 each week for their board and care. Gertrude promised to care for the girls as if they were her own. Gertrude Baniszewski (née Von Fossan) was born on September 19, 1928. She married John Stephan Baniszewski at 16 years old. The couple had four children together. John became physically violent toward Gertrude, and she divorced him in ten years. Weeks later, she married Edward Guthrie. He, too, turned out to be abusive, and they divorced within months. Gertrude remarried her first husband, had two more children and divorced for the 2nd time. Next, Gertrude met 22-year-old Dennis Lee Wright, and the unwed couple had one son together, Dennis Jr, in 1965. Dennis abandoned Gertrude and the baby. She filed a paternity suit against him, though she never saw a penny. By 1965, Gertrude was a haggard, chain-smoking, single mom of seven living in squalor at 3850 East New York Street in Indianapolis, Indiana, for $55 a month. Initially, the Baniszewski family treated Sylvia and Jenny kindly, as promised. The Likens and Baniszewski girls spent time singing popular songs and gossipping about boys. The Baniszewski home was the kind neighborhood children would come and go from as they pleased. They could get away with things their parents wouldn’t allow. Smoking, drinking, even raunchy sex talk happened before Gertrude’s eyes. Gertrude’s 13th pregnancy had just ended in her 6th miscarriage. She was tired and looked twice her 31 years. To add to her full plate, 17-year-old was pregnant by a married man. Sylvia and Jenny shared a bedroom with 11-year-old Marie, 10-year-old Shirley, and 8-year-old Jimmy Baniszewski. The room had one mattress on the floor that five children took turns sleeping in. Regretfully, Lester Likens never stepped foot in the home of the woman they hired to care for their daughters. If they had, they would have noticed there weren’t enough beds. The house had a hotplate where the stove should have been. Gertrude was in no position to take in children. Gertrude was suffering for money. Without the weekly $20, she had no way to feed all nine children and still pay rent. She was glad Mr. Likens paid $20 upfront. But when the future payments arrived late, or not at all, she became enraged. The Likens sisters became the object of Gertrude’s contempt. After the first late payment, she dragged Jenny up the stairs and whipped her with a leather belt. “Well, I took care of you two bitches for a week for nothing!” she growled. The money arrived in the mail the day after the first spanking. Sylvia and Jenny’s parents came a few days later and gave another advanced payment. The sisters said nothing of the beating. When Gertrude learned that Sylvia was recycling pop bottles for cash, she cut loose on her with a quarter-inch wooden paddle. She hit her repeatedly across the back and head. When Gertrude became weak due to chronic bronchitis, she handed the paddle to Paula. The abuse increased in frequency and severity. Gertrude may have felt sorry for Jenny due to her fragility, because by August of 1965, Gertrude concentrated her outbursts on Sylvia. Sylvia admitted she had a boyfriend in California. Gertrude was disgusted and so was her daughter Paula who repeatedly kicked Sylvia in her vaginal area and accused her of being pregnant. Not only was she subjected to beatings, but Gertrude also started abusing Sylvia with food. Sylvia began to forage for food in dumpsters. When Gertrude caught Sylvia, she, Paula, and a neighbor child named Randy Lepper forced her to eat a hot dog loaded with copious amounts of condiments, and spices. When Sylvia threw up, the trio made her eat the vomit. The girls returned to school in the fall, which pleased their father. Gertrude accused Sylvia of spreading rumors that Paula and Stephanie were prostitutes. Gertrude admonished the girls in front of her own children and their friends. Stephanie’s 15-year-old boyfriend, Coy Hubbard, attacked Sylvia in response. Stephanie snickered as Gertrude taunted Sylvia by calling her filthy names. Gertrude accused Sylvia of steeling gym clothes. As punishment, she burnt her fingertips with a lit match, while screaming that she hated Sylvia and how she was ruining her life. Somehow, the subject turned to Sylvia’s alleged promiscuity. “You should never do anything with a boy until you are married,” Gertrude cautioned. Sylvia replied she hadn’t, which only infuriated Gertrude. “You should never…!” Gertrude shrieked as she kicked Sylvia’s pubic area repeatedly. Kicking Sylvia did not satiate Gertrude. She made Sylvia strip naked and insert a glass cola bottle into her vagina while her child accomplices watched and laughed. Sylvia’s parents checked on their daughters on October 5. Again, they kept their secret, afraid of making it worse. As abusers do, Gertrude banned them from seeing their sister, Dianna, who lived nearby. Gertrude alienated them from anyone who cared. Paula once held the door open and dared Sylvia to “Get away, and stay away.” Sylvia had nowhere to go. Sylvia’s last day of school was October 6, the day after her parents’ visit. Gertrude told the school Sylvia had no interest in going and pretended to be concerned. In reality, Gertrude banned Sylvia to the cold basement. Coy became one of Sylvia’s primary attackers. He enjoyed body slamming Sylvia forcefully onto the concrete basement, and tying her up for days at Gertrude’s urging. Kids from the school visited the residence and participated in Sylvia’s torture. Gertrude, the ringleader, coached them step by step. Nothing was off-limits. If the children wanted to practice judo, Gertrude had them practice on Sylvia. Some kids put cigarettes out on Sylvia’s skin to hear her cry. Gertrude would bathe Sylvia in scalding hot water until her skin blistered. Paula once beat Sylvia’s face until she broke her wrist. Doctors put a cast on her arm while Paula bragged about exactly how she broke it. When she got home, she continued to hit Sylvia with her cast. Gertrude used a needle to carve the letter “I” into the flesh of Sylvia’s abdomen. Unable to finish the full statement, she encouraged her 15-year-old neighbor Richard Hobbs to complete the task. “I am a prostitute and proud of it,” he etched on her belly. Gertrude helped him spell “prostitute.” At Gertrude’s request, Richard heated a metal hook and attempted to brand the letter “S” on Sylvia’s chest, but instead branded her with the number “3.” Gertrude’s justified it by saying Sylvia branded her child, and now she branded Sylvia. “What are you going to do now? You can’t get married now,” Gertrude taunted. Sylvia whimpered, “I guess there’s nothing I can do.” Coy returned and tied Sylvia up in the basement, where he slammed her frail body into the wall over and over. Gertrude finally broke Sylvia’s spirit. “Jenny,” she consoled her baby sister, “I know you don’t want me to die. But I’m going to die. I can tell.” Her voice was weak and trembling. The beatings made Sylvia incontinent. Sylvia started to lose control of her limbs too. Gertrude knew Sylvia was taking a turn for the worse, so she permitted Sylvia to sleep on the mattress in the upstairs bedroom. After giving her a lukewarm bath, she condemned her back to the basement and forced her to write a letter: “To Mr. and Mrs. Likens: I went with a gang of boys in the middle of the night. And they said that they would pay me I would give them something so I got in the car and they all got what they wanted . . . and when they got finished they beat me up and left sores on my face and all over my body. And they also put on my stomach, I am a prostitute and proud of it. I have done just about everything that I could do just to make Gertie mad and cause [sic] Gertie more money than she’s got. I’ve tore up a new mattress and peaed [sic] on it. I have also cost Gertie doctor bills that she really can’t pay and made Gertie a nervous wreck and all her kids . . .” That night, Sylvia heard Gertrude and her children making plans to dump her in the woods. In a last-ditch effort, Sylvia tried to run. But Gertrude caught Sylvia, dragged her inside, and attempted to feed her toast. Sylvia didn’t have the strength to eat. Gertrude struck her face with a curtain rod. Her son, John, returned her to the basement. John tied Sylvia’s wrists to the basement railing. Her toes barely touched the ground. Gertrude shoved crackers into Sylvia’s parched mouth. Sylvia told her she wasn’t hungry and suggested she feed them to the dog. Gertrude then punched Sylvia in her belly. John force-fed her the contents of baby Denny’s diaper as well as her own feces. October 25, Gertrude, Cody, and John beat Sylvia until she lost consciousness when Gertrude stomped on her head. When she came to, she gathered up enough strength to bang on the basement floor and walls, hoping someone would help her. No one came. On the morning of October 26, 1965, Gertrude and Stephanie bathed Sylvia. During her bath, Sylvia stopped breathing. The Baniszewskis were terrified. Not because they cared, because they would be caught. Stephanie tried unsuccessfully to revive her with CPR. Gertrude placed Sylvia’s broken body back on the mattress and instructed Richard to call the cops. Gertrude handed the police Sylvia’s letter. She told them Sylvia ran away recently and returned injured, clutching the note. Gertrude feigned grief and claimed she was “doctoring” Sylvia. The officers rounded the hall corner to find Sylvia’s emaciated form lying lifeless on that soiled mattress. Deputy Coroner Arthur Kebel noted that Sylvia’s lips were practically chewed through. All ten of her fingernails were bent backward and broken. She had hundreds of wounds on her skin, all of them in different stages of healing, suggesting on-going trauma. Dr. Charles Ellis performed the autopsy. The cause of death was Torture. The police asked Jenny what happened, and she parrotted what Gertrude said, but added, “You get me out of here, and I will tell you everything.” Gertrude was convicted of first-degree murder. Paula was convicted of second-degree murder. They each received a life sentence, but after a 2nd trial, Paula pled down to manslaughter and was released two years later. Gertrude was paroled in 1985. She claimed she had no memory of her actions. She died four years later of lung cancer. If there is a devil in hell, he is currently roasting the old bat over hot coals. Paula moved to Iowa, where she secured a new identity and a job at an elementary school. Stephanie married, had several children, and became a school teacher. Richard Hobbs, Coy Hubbard and Gertrude’s son John, were convicted of manslaughter. All received 2–21 year prison terms of which they served two years. Richard died of cancer at age 21. Baby Denny was adopted into a new family, as was the daughter Paula was pregnant with during the crime. Jenny Likens married and had children of her own. She lived long enough to read Gertrude’s obituary, which she mailed to her mother with a letter that read, “Some good news. Damn old Gertrude died. Ha ha ha! I am happy about that.” The death of Sylvia Likens continues to haunt Indianapolis as the worst crime ever committed in the state. Prosecutor Leroy New said it best: “This case has never had it’s equal. It is the most vicious thing, the most hideous thing, Indiana has ever seen.” The house sat empty for decades before it was leveled. It is now a church parking lot. A memorial dedicated to Sylvia’s memory stands in Willard Park, where Sylvia used to play.

Medium.com,Arts & Entertainment,Barron Freeman,True Crime,https://medium.com/a-murder-runs-through-it/barron-freeman-66d0afd274c5?source=topic_page---------49------------------1," When Barron Freeman awoke on March 3, 2009, there was no reason in the world for him to think it would be the last day of his life. Just two weeks and one day shy of his 30th wedding anniversary, Barron Freeman was at home in Albuquerque, New Mexico, busy at work while his wife was on a long-planned trip to Maui with family and friends. Their son, who was then a young adult, was at home in Albuquerque with his father. At the time of his death, Barron Freeman was the president and owner of Equipment Specialties Company, an enterprise he ran largely from an office in his home. His business was in its 26th year of operation, and by all accounts it had been, and continued to be, successful. In addition to himself, he employed and worked with several other people, including someone he had counted as a friend for over 20 years, Donald “Woody” Hovland. Up until he murdered his friend, Barron Freeman, on the front steps of Barron’s home, Donald Hovland, gun enthusiast and hunter, lead an unremarkable life. Named after his father, Donald Elwood Hovland, Jr. was born July 22, 1944, in Montgomery, Alabama. In 1959, he lived in Nebraska and was issued a social security number. He shows up again in official records in 1970 when he marries in Topeka, Kansas. In 1983, there is a record of a subsequent marriage in Bernalillo County, New Mexico, and while this extremely modest trail of his life does, to some degree, track his movement from the south to the southwest of the United States, it does little to explain how he ended up killing someone in cold blood — someone who thought of him as a friend. The unremarkable nature of Donald Hovland’s life continued such that a search of the Albuquerque Journal turns up no mention of him except for the circumstances surrounding his own death and that of Barron Freeman, but in one article that details the search for Donald Hovland, after he murdered his friend, there is this interesting tidbit: Hovland’s body was found lying in tall grass along the Rio Grande after investigators, acting on a tip, searched the area. The person making the tip or how they happened to have the tip to make is something that never comes to light, but it is evidence that somewhere, somebody knew at least a small something about Donald Hovland that never otherwise saw the light of day. If the story is about Donald Hovland, then the event that sets this story in motion is one that we, the reader and amateur investigator never see, but probably begins with a letter from the United States Internal Revenue Service advising Donald Hovland that they will be garnishing his wages and/or payments to his business to collect unpaid taxes. But in my telling, this story is about Barron Freeman, so the story doesn’t begin until he opens the door to his friend, someone he has trusted for over twenty years, with no idea that when this encounter is over, it will turn out that his trust was completely misplaced. On that fateful Tuesday afternoon in March when Donald “Woody” Hovland arrived at his door, there is no indication that Barron felt afraid or had any indication that Hovland was up to no good. Even when Barron told his son that he was going to “step outside to talk” to Woody, he didn’t express any discernible distress. It’s possible that Barron had received his own letter from the IRS seeking to garnish Freeman’s payments to Donald Hovland, and he wanted to spare his friend the embarrassment of Freeman’s son learning what Freeman already knew — that Hovland had gotten himself into a financial mess by not paying his taxes. Whatever Barron Freeman was thinking, he did not communicate any fear to his son, and his son, having grown up knowing Hovland, would have had no reason to think that the long time family friend had been transformed into a madman who was about to“snap.” It isn’t known what propelled Donald Hovland to murder his friend in cold blood, but shortly after he and Barron stepped out the front door of Barron’s home, and shot Barron in the head. Unwilling to face the consequences of his actions, he ran off, and despite law enforcement going after him almost immediately, he managed to elude them. The murder on the front doorstep of Barron Freeman’s was not done by a stranger breaking in under covering of darkness and killing a man he didn’t know. This was a premeditated act by a “friend” done in broad daylight. While some reports describe Freeman and Hovland has having “started a business together,” the details seem a little more nuanced. In another report, the business relationship is described as follows: Freeman took care of sales and the business end of Equipment Specialties Inc., which he operated out of his home while Hovland, who worked as a subcontractor, was primarily responsible for production, shipping and receiving. If this bit of reporting is accurate, then Hovland was a subcontractor working for Freeman’s business, and it would have been Hovland’s responsibility to make sure that all of the taxes on his income were paid The hunt for Donald Hovland began within minutes of his murdering Barron Freeman, but he managed to elude law enforcement completely. While the details of Donald Hovland’s escape and eventual suicide were never completely determined, in retrospect, it seems he drove to his home, parked his vehicle, and then set out into the Bosque and walked to the spot where he killed himself. Located at the corner of Paseo del Norte and Wyoming Boulevard, NE in Albuquerque, Gate of Heaven is where Barron Freeman now rests. It is unnerving when you lose a loved one in a violent and unexpected way, but both Barron Freeman’s wife and son have moved forward, doing much of what he is no longer here to do, and in that way his life, and his life’s work, continue. My hope for both of them and everyone else affected by his loss is that they have each found a way to memorialize Barron Freeman in their daily lives, and in that way, bring the best parts of him and his life forward in their own."

But those killers who seek out victims for no other reason then, to watch the life leave them, are especially sick. April 22, 1983, investigators dug up property owned by Richard Biegenwald’s mother in Staten Island. Two bodies would be found. One was of 17-year-old Maria Ciallella, who had disappeared on Halloween night 1982. Maria Ciallella had asked her father for some money around 6:30 pm and said she would be back in a little while. She left wearing her white fur jacket, beige slacks, a denim vest, and tinted glasses. Around 12:20 that night, she was spotted walking towards her house, by a Point Pleasant patrolman. He had been answering a call at the time and came back less than 10 minutes later to give her a ride home. But she was gone. Prosecutor Alexander D Lehrer, “It is believed that Richard Biegenwald was on Route 88 that fateful evening when Maria met her death.” “There is no motive, in my opinion, for this senseless killing, other than that which I attributed to the other killing of Anna Olesiewicz,” Lehrer said at a press conference, “that of wanting to see someone die.” Medical examiner Dr. Elliot Gross positively identified Maria’s body. He used dental charts to make the ID. An examination of the body revealed two bullets from the victim’s head. They were sent out for ballistic testing, to match them to the other victims, and guns owned by Biegenwald. Maria’s cause of death was gunshot wounds to the head. After she was killed, her body was cut into three large sections and placed in trash bags before being buried. What wasn’t in the bags, were Maria’s clothes and personal effects. It’s unknown if the killer disposed of them separately, or kept them as trophies."
Medium.com,Arts & Entertainment,A Tale of Two Murdered Girls 30 Miles and a World Apart,True Crime,https://medium.com/@Phaylen/a-tale-of-two-murdered-girls-30-miles-and-a-world-apart-1b2a4f5b3df5?source=topic_page---------52------------------1," She was a beautiful girl. Pale, milky skin, sun-kissed hair that fell across her narrow shoulders in perfect form and a bright unassuming smile that most would envy. One of her classmates described her as “One of the most kindhearted and nicest people I knew.” On July 19th, 2016 while riding her bike home after a visit with her boyfriend along a remote country road in the small Ohio farm town of Delta, Sierah Joughin vanished. Immediately, the entire town sprang into action to find the missing girl, described as a promising college student loved by many. She was reported missing at 11 p.m on Tuesday the 19th and an organized search was dispatched by 3 a.m. Wednesday morning. Within 24 hours,the local- then national- media centralized their focus on Joughin’s startling disappearance that quickly gripped the entire nation. A 100,000 reward was posted for any information leading to her safe return. The police held live televised press conferences alongside the family to appeal to the public for assistance. The FBI issued a statewide call for help. Along with hundreds of volunteers they combed the rural area she had last been seen in before discovering her bicycle, abandoned in a nearby cornfield. By that Friday, Fulton County Police arrested James Worley in connection with Joughin’s abduction. Worley, who lived in the area, had been convicted sixteen years prior for kidnapping another woman on a bicycle. Shortly afterward, the mystery would come to a tragic end with the discovery of Joughin’s remains. Along with the family, friends and university, the nation altogether mourned. James Worley was discovered to have been her abductor and her murderer. He was found guilty at his trial on March 28, 2018 of seventeen charges, including aggravated murder. Since the horrific events that unfolded that July summer over 3 years ago the legacy of Joughin has been carried on by her loved ones and community. As a result of Joughin’s untimely death, a law was created and named for her. Sierah’s Law passed unanimously in 2018 and would establish a registry of violent offenders in the state of Ohio. Her family established a Scholarship fund from the $45,000 in donations received via a GoFundMe campaign in pursuit of their search efforts. A non-profit organization called “Justice For Sierah” was formed which holds an annual “Spirit of Sierah” marathon race in her birthplace of Sylvania, Ohio. This year, the Oxygen network devoted an episode of their series “Buried in the Backyard” to the murder of Joughin. It wasn’t an entire year since Sierah’s disappearance when, on February 8th of 2017, just 30 miles east of Delta in the city of Toledo, Jojo Striker, a young, black transgender girl who had just turned 23 was discovered murdered in a vacant garage by a single gunshot wound to the torso. Police and the media initially reported her death by misgendering her and dead-naming her in their reporting. For the sake of full disclosure, I lived locally at the time and upon seeing the evening news where her death had been reported, I noted that the photo they used was a direct contradiction to the pronouns and names they used. It as clear that Jojo presented female. I addressed this with the local media, and I watched as that effort to correct their reporting fetched more media attention- but that attention suddenly shifted the focus onto her mistreatment and away from her murder. One story began; “For police, it seemed like any other homicide. The body of a 23-year old victim was found in a vacant garage last Wednesday; the person was first listed as an unidentified black male by police and eventually identified as *********. (I have redacted her birth name.) But the case soon took a twist when it was reported that Striker identified as Jojo Striker — a transgender woman.” The reports of Jojo’s murder took an even darker turn when her Mother, Shanda Striker, confessed in an interview with local television station WTOL that Police had encouraged her not to make any further inquiry into Jojo’s murder. “The police told us to leave it alone but that will never happen because I will always search for my son’s killer.” -Shanda Striker Ms. Striker admitted that she didn’t know proper pronoun usage and that her child was her baby, boy or girl. She hadn’t yet fully adjusted her language and in the turmoil surrounding the loss easily misspoke. From that point onward, Jojo Striker’s murder was only reported by the LGBT themed press around the country, and her name became part of a heartbreaking tableau of black trans women assigned numbers as the media counted their deaths. Striker was was the third black trans woman murdered in 2017. Most of them unsolved. A GoFundMe was set up by local LGBT advocacy organization Equality Toledo, which raised just over $4,000 to cover Striker’s funeral expenses. In what few statements that have been made by Toledo police with respect to the murder and whether or not it was a hate crime, their trajectory has been less on promoting an investigation and more on remarking on a “criminal history.” In a brief interview with NBC 24 news, they reported; “I’m not sure how (Striker) identified, but that will certainly be something we’re looking into to see if that had something to do with the motive or not,” said Lt. Joe Heffernan. He adds that TPD is also looking for clues within Striker’s criminal past, which included soliciting charges and an active warrant for robbery. Less than a week after the discovery of her body, Toledo Police declared they had no leads, no suspects and no motive. Instead, they told local reporters that anyone with information could call a crime-stoppers number. Striker’s family has been offered no consolation from officials or closure. Today, there has been no further investigation or public comments from authorities on Striker’s death although the greater LGBT community has paid tribute to her memory during Transgender Day of Remembrance. These two tragedies cannot be compared in their horrendous nature nor can the grief experienced by their respective loved ones. For a long time I debated on whether or not to write this story. I didn’t want readers to think I was minimizing one loss and elevating another in its place. I was afraid someone might presume it was cruel comparison of events where there is none to be had. I was concerned it would be viewed as a remark on the families, the unspeakable circumstances they’ve endured, lacking in respect to them or a petty ‘whatabout-ism.’ However, I must confess that they can be measured against one another, but only in the response from the greater public and authorities involved. In the case of Sierah Joughin, authorities involved were swift to act, thorough in their investigation and they were effective in seeking justice. In contrast, the authorities responsible for investigating JoJo Striker’s murder instructed her Mother to “Leave it alone” and there has been no visible effort to find her killer. “Leave it alone.” That has sat with me for three years, now. Those words seemed to slip by most in the media and perhaps that is why there has been a lack of any information or perceived effort on behalf of Striker’s local police. It has been accepted without question… because it was expected. It is hard not to draw a parallel between two young women with a future that had been stolen and the disparity in the investment of authorities to deliver them justice, equally."

Medium.com,Arts & Entertainment,The Life and Death of Eleanor Dumont,True Crime,https://medium.com/@hlemonroe/the-life-and-death-of-eleanor-dumont-d30b2a340b1?source=topic_page---------55------------------1," The forgotten tale of America’s first female Blackjack dealer Eleanor Alphonsine Dumont, born around 1829, made a living as one of the first professional female blackjack dealers in the United States. For the better part of three decades, she made her way across the western frontier in mining towns such as Deadwood, South Dakota to Bodie, California. How she came to the west is shrouded in mystery. She hardly used her actual name, Simone Jules, and was likely born in New Orleans of Creole heritage. She burst on to the San Francisco gambling scene when she was 21 years old in the year 1849. She was exotically beautiful with deep, dark, eyes, and piles of natural curls perfectly coifed on the top of her head. She was petite, French-or at least a committed Francophile-and always dressed to the nines. She quickly built a reputation as a skilled, or lucky, 21 player and secured a job as a dealer at the Bella Union in San Francisco. Unlike many women of that time and place, Eleanor was dignified and reserved. When the men at her table behaved bawdily, Eleanor acted unruffled. Suspected of card sharping, Eleanor was relieved of her duties at the Bella Union. By this time, Eleanor had earned a large chunk of money and decided to take it to Nevada City, California. In 1854, Eleanor stepped off the stage dressed in her best finery and checked into the Fepp’s Hotel as Madame Eleanor Dumont.She spent her first days promenading up and down Broad Street, peering into the windows of vacant buildings. The locals whispered their best guesses as to why this fancy lady spent her days walking and peering into windows. “There’s got to be some bad in a girl with all her charms, who seems to have nothing to do but strut up and down Main Street,” remarked one of the few women in town. The townsfolk would soon come to know, Eleanor Dumont did have better things to do. She delivered a handbill to Edwin G Waite, the editor of the Nevada Daily Transcript, announcing the grand opening of her new gambling saloon, “Vingt-et-Un.” Eleanor intended to run a high-class establishment. Her primary rule, no women allowed. Eleanor would greet her guest with a coy smile and ask in a French accent, “Will you play, monsieur?” Eleanor required her patrons to dress in their best attire. She wouldn’t permit a man to swear in her presence or tell crass jokes. Eleanor served free champagne to her players. She celebrated with them if they won and grieved with them when they lost. Vingt-et-Un was a tremendous success. Although Faro was the game of the day, miners were quick to try 21 as long as Eleanor was dealing. Local miners considered it a high privilege to play with a woman as sophisticated and charming as Eleanor. Although many men tried, none were able to seduce her. She was a virtuous woman who was quick to remind folks hers was not that kind of establishment. 1859, Eleanor met entrepreneur and gambler, David Tobin. The two opened a second saloon called Dumont’s Place, where they offered other games, like Faro. Dumont’s place saw success, but Nevada City did not. As the rush for gold slowed, and miners began to move, Eleanor decided her time there was through. Eleanor knew she was getting a little long in the tooth, and beguiling men to her table would only get harder. She decided to try her hand at a new game: ranching. She purchased her ranch in Carson City, NV, but realized she was over her head. Eleanor met a man named Jack McKnight, and she fell head over heels for him. Unfortunately, she didn’t have the same intuition for a lover as she did for cards. Jack turned out to be a conman. He swindled her out of her money and sold the ranch out from underneath her. Eleanor was indignant. She loaded a double-barrel shotgun and set out to settle the score. She shot him square in the chest and killed him. Although she was suspected of the crime, no one arrested her. Broke, alone, and with no prospects, Eleanor set off for the next great boom-town. She roamed nomadically through the northern hemisphere. Eleanor trekked north to British Columbia. She forced a steamboat carrying smallpox to dock elsewhere at gunpoint in Fort Benton, Montana. Also in Fort Montana, Eleanor gained a new sobriquet, Madame Mustache. Eleanor poured a glass of milk for a patron who lost his money at her 21 table-as she often did. As an insult, he referred to her as Madame Mustache, and it stuck. Eleanor, once smooth-faced and beautiful, developed a pronounced line of hair on her upper lip. She added prostitution to her skill set as the madam of a brothel in Fort Benton as well as Bannack, Montana. As a madam, Eleanor expected her ladies to appear refined. Eleanor had them dress in their fanciest garb, and parade them up and down streets in a carriage while women covered the eyes of their children and clutched their pearls. Eleanor left Montana in favor of the western coast. The new name arrived ahead of her to Bodie, California, in 1878. Bodie, the undoubted wildest town in Eastern California, expected a youthful, chic woman to step out when the stage pulled up. Instead, they had Madame Mustache, a woman of almost 50 years who grew weary and haggard from a life on the road. Journalists had a field day writing of her careworn appearance. Out of vanity or pride, Eleanor conducted herself as if she were the freshest-faced woman ever to grace the Magnolia Saloon, where she continued to work the tables. The Madame switched her champagne for whiskey. She stopped caring about how her patrons dressed or behaved. She did convince a friend to lend her $300 for a bankroll, which she lost before the night ended. Eleanor was despondent. She could deal with losing her looks, but now her knack for dealing cards betrayed her for the first and last time. Madame Mustache walked into the darkness with a bottle of red wine, and a fatal dose of morphine. Shepards found her dead body just outside of Bodie on September 8, 1879. Her head rested on a stone, and a suicide note lay next to her. Madame Mustache was a gambler, and she played the hand she dealt her as a woman in a man’s world. Single women simply didn’t survive long in the western frontier. Most married out of the lifestyle, and some went down with it. Eleanor died as she lived, on her terms. She didn’t give away that she was depressed enough to end her life. There were clues, but none that anyone would have recognized in 1879. Today we know that as much as 25% of people with a gambling addiction will attempt suicide. Eleanor also exhibited subtle signs of depression. She lost interest in things that once thrilled her, such as entertaining men and behaving in a demure and sophisticated manner. The gentlemen that at one time were drawn to her exotic beauty began calling her Madame Mustache. She also lost a large amount of money and likely felt hopeless. The lady who once only drank champagne switched to drowning her sorrows in whiskey. Eleanor lost her entire bankroll on her last night; she may have experienced slowed thinking as a symptom of depression. All of these circumstances suggested that Eleanor was in danger. Unfortunately, no one connected these changes to the fact that she would soon end her life. Although no one can diagnose Eleanor posthumously, she exhibited symptoms of Major Depressive disorder as outlined by the Mayo Clinic website. If you or someone you know shows symptoms of depression, please seek the help of a professional. In the United States, please call the National Suicide Prevention Hotline at 1–800–273–8255.

Medium.com,Arts & Entertainment,Springfield 3: Best Friends and Mother Missing in Missouri,True Crime,https://medium.com/@kympasqualini/springfield-3-best-friends-and-mother-missing-in-missouri-ec1c792ad6d3?source=topic_page---------59------------------1," On June 7, 1992, Stacy McCall, 18, Suzanne ‘Suzie’ Streeter,19, and Suzie’s mother Sherrill Levitt, 46, vanished from Levitt’s home in an area of the 1700 block of E. Delmar Street in Springfield, Missouri. The three women’s disappearances have haunted the families and remained a mystery for over two decades. The Disappearance Stacy and Suzie had just graduated from Kickapoo High School on Saturday, June 6, 1992. The two young women had been at a graduation party at another friend’s home at approximately 2:00 a.m. on June 7. Initially, the pair had planned to spend the night at a hotel, then at a friend’s home in Battlefield but left because the house was crowded with out of town guests. They departed in their own separate vehicles and headed to Suzie’s home to spend the night with her mother Sherrill. It is believed the two young women arrived at Sherrill’s home at approximately 2:15 a.m. and had planned to go to White Water Amusement Park the following afternoon. After Suzie and Stacy arrived at the residence, the trail follows twists and turns into the darkness of the unknown. The last contact Sherrill had with anyone was at approximately 11:15 p.m. on the evening of June 6, 1992, when she had talked to a friend about refinishing and painting a dresser. Sherrill had been a single mother, described as being very close to her daughter and a successful hairdresser at a local salon. The following afternoon, friends went to Sherrill’s home to meet Suzie and Stacy as planned, then head to the amusement park but no one answered the door. The friends observed the women’s vehicles parked in the driveway and noticed the porch light still illuminated but the glass globe covering the bulb had been broken and there was shattered glass on the front porch. The friends cleaned up the glass on the porch and proceeded to enter the home through the unlocked front door, not realizing they were entering a crime scene. Confusion Sets In At first, friends thought maybe the women had gone for a walk. Later that day when the three women failed to arrive back at the home, a friend called Stacy’s mother, Janis McCall. Janis had not known Stacy had spent the night at Suzie’s home thinking she would be staying in Battlefield overnight. Stacy had last talked to her mother the night before when she called at about 10:30 p.m. on June 6, informing Janis she would be staying in Battlefield. After receiving the call from one of the girl’s friends that had been to the home, Stacy’s mother went to Sherrill’s home and later called the police to report the three missing. When investigators arrived, they did not observe any sign of foul play or a struggle within the home. In fact, all of the women’s personal belongings including keys, makeup, purses, and clothing, were still inside the residence. The family dog, a Yorkie named Cinnamon, was anxiously running around inside the home and police noted the blinds inside the home were apart as if someone had been peeking through looking outside during the night. It appeared Sherrill had been in bed watching television, her glasses, and book on the nightstand, and cigarettes along with her lighter still in the home. Aside from the shattered globe on the porch, the glass discarded before it was determined it could have been a key piece of evidence, no additional evidence was found at the home that indicated foul play. Several searches of the surrounding area turned up nothing. It seemed like the three women had simply vaporized. Following the women’s disappearances, police followed up on leads, interviewed individuals who had attended the party the previous evening, as well as relatives, friends, even boyfriends. One witness reported seeing a green Dodge van in the area but police were unable to identify the vehicle or owner. Several callers provided tips indicating the women may be buried at a local hospital parking structure prior to a concrete pour. Even Suzie’s older brother, Bart Streeter, has remained on the list of suspects. The story appeared on several national TV shows including Unsolved Mysteries, 48 Hours and America’s Most Wanted (AMW). A male tipster called into AMW on New Year’s Eve in 1993 but disconnected when the operator attempted to patch the call through to Springfield Police Department. Investigators believe the individual had intimate knowledge of the circumstances surrounding the three women’s disappearance. A Possible Lead Early on, Robert Craig Cox was a person of interest in the case. Cox had served time in Florida on death row for the murder of 19-year-old Sharon Zellers. The Florida Supreme Court later overturned the conviction due to insufficient evidence tying him to the scene. Cox was arrested again in California for a kidnapping that had occurred in 1985. After his release, Cox returned to his hometown of Springfield, Missouri after serving time in connection to the kidnapping. Janis McCall told news reporters she had knowledge Cox had been working on the underground cable near Sherrill’s home at the time of the three women’s disappearances. Leaving Missouri, Cox traveled to Texas where police interrogated him about a kidnapping in Plano, Texas. Eventually, Cox was arrested in Texas and sentenced to a Texas prison for aggravated robbery. While incarcerated in Texas, Cox told a grand jury in 1994, he had been with his girlfriend the evening the women disappeared. Despite the girlfriend later coming forward and recanting her initial story, corroborating Cox’s claims in 1995, the grand jury disbands in January 1995. Later Robert Keyes, a Springfield New Leader reporter claims Cox told him he knew the women were murdered, buried in Springfield and would never be found. Cox remains in prison and not eligible for release until 2025. An estimated 5,200 leads later — nothing. Will They Dig? Former Springfield Sergeant Mark Webb who reportedly provided information to Kathee Baird, a crime reporter at the Ozark Sentinel, that brought to light what some feel could be the key to solving the case. In 2002, law enforcement received a tip that led back to the unidentified green van spotted in the area of Levitt’s home the evening the women vanished. The caller indicated two men who had been working for a local concrete company at the time the women disappeared drove a green van. The caller told police the two men buried the women’s bodies on a farm in Webster County. After a two-week search of the property, items found at the scene and results of the search warrant were sealed. Kathee Baird took a personal interest in the case and began an independent investigation that led her to a parking garage at Cox South Hospital that had been under construction in 1992. The hospital is only five minutes from Suzi and Sherrill’s home. Now Chief of Bolivar Police Department, Mark Webb confirmed during his time as a lead investigator at Springfield Police tips were in fact received early on directing them to the hospital-parking garage but not thought to be credible. Baird contacted Rick Norland in 2006 and asked if he would assist by scouring the area with ground-penetrating radar. Norland is an expert who assisted New York City authorities following the atrocities of September 11, 2001. Norland reported to AOL news he did, in fact, find three anomalies that are consistent with grave-sites approximately 3 feet below the surface of the concrete. Norland recommended that a core sample be obtained from the area by drilling a hole to submerge a camera or device and positively determine what the anomalies are. Despite Baird and Norland sharing findings and recommendations with police, a spokesperson for Springfield Police said it was not worth the thousands of dollars it would take to verify. Baird then offered to cover the cost to drill a core sample but the police spokesperson responded their own expert had concluded Norland’s findings were not credible. Experts in the field of ground penetration disagree with the police spokesperson and agree instead with Norland’s findings. When asked if an independent team would be permitted to access the area to obtain a core sample, media relations at the hospital issued an email indicating this was an issue for the Springfield Police but would cooperate with the investigation. Even if the parking garage is not the final resting place of the three missing women, one must ask how the cost of coring an area of concrete could possibly be more of a concern that providing an answer to a family waiting over 25-years for any information to end a nightmare most cannot even begin to comprehend. Mother’s Nightmare Continues for Decades Stacy’s mother, Janis McCall has never given up hope she will find her daughter alive. Like other parents who search for their missing child, giving up hope is not an option. Following her daughter’s disappearance, Janis founded One Missing Link, a nonprofit organization that helps other families search for their missing loved ones. Recalling the last time she saw her daughter, Janis said, “The last thing I said to Stacy was that I love her, thank goodness!” Janis said Stacy said she loved them and promised to call later. After the graduation, they had taken pictures and had asked Stacy if she wanted to eat her graduation cake but Stacy declined and said, “Don’t cut it until I get back tomorrow!” When a loved one is missing, family members suffer incredible turmoil in the aftermath of the disappearance. They replay the last time they saw their loved one, what they could have said, what they should have said. Is their loved one suffering? Are they injured and in a hospital? Is someone keeping them? Do they need to be rescued? The mind takes on a life of its own constantly revisiting its last minutes of contact. Experts agree ambiguous loss is the most traumatic psychological experience a person can endure while existing in what seems a never-ending life of limbo. In the meantime, this incredibly courageous mother with the strength of an entire lion pride continues searching for her beloved daughter. To Janis, if there is even a small chance her daughter Stacy McCall, Suzie Streeter and Sherrill Levitt are still alive, giving up is never an option. Janis told Discovery ID, “If there is one-tenth, one-hundredth of one percent of a chance I can find her — I want that — I want to find her. I want her to know how very much she means to us.” One can look into this mother’s eyes and never fully comprehend what the last two decades have been like. When I asked Janis if there was anything she wished she would have said to Stacy the last night she saw her, Janis says, “I wish I had told her she couldn’t go anywhere that night but that is a little unrealistic. If I had only known what I know now.”"
