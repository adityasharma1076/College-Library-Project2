Medium.com,Innovation & Tech,How to analyse a usability test,UX,https://medium.com/@rickdzekman/how-to-analyse-a-usability-test-e432cec93725?source=topic_page---------0------------------1," There are many different reasons for testing an experience, such as: Your reason for testing will shape your research objectives. Your research objectives will, in turn, determine how you analyse your user test. I discuss this further in my article on setting research objectives and mapping assumptions for user research. Because the reason for the user test ultimate influences your analysis it would require a deep dive for each type of user test. For this article I am going to focus exclusively on testing for usability issues. You may have a specific reason to suspect usability problems (e.g. based on analytics, customer feedback, or a recent redesign). Or you may simply want to conduct an open-ended exploration of the user experience. Whatever your motivation for testing you will be limited in how much time you can spend testing everything. In preparing for your user test, you should already have a general sense of the tasks that your users typically complete. You can learn what these tasks are through other research (e.g. observations, diary studies, user interviews, user tests). For this article I will assume that you know the tasks in advance. Once we know what tasks we want to test we reach a fork in the road: Either way, you will want to list the possible tasks in your test plan. That way if you go with option (1) you can ask participants to circle back to a task even if it’s not part of their process. Sometimes even if you take option (2) you might need to keep the scenarios fairly generic (for example: “Imagine you want to buy a new phone on a monthly plan” without specifying which phone or which plan). In either case having a list of tasks means that even if your participants won’t naturally complete every task you can ask them to do so for the sake of the test. A Hierarchical Task Analysis can be useful here. You want to separate out tasks related to the experience (e.g. searching for a product on a store) from the actual tasks your users need (e.g. purchase a product that they need). It’s important that you understand the coverage of your user test to know what parts of the experience have not been tested. An open-ended user test has one key advantage: your research participants are more likely to behave “naturally”, using the interface as they normally would. But the more open-ended your test plan, the higher your chance of running into these issues: On the other hand having a scenario based user test can lead to “unnatural” behaviour which can mean: It’s important to keep these considerations in mind when writing your test plan. The tasks that you cover (and the way that you cover them) will affect the research notes that you capture and ultimately your analysis. User testing is one of those times where a transcript is not as useful as well structured notes. Though if you are taking notes you should still try to capture what participants say verbatim. If you use a transcript you may be tempted to use a 3rd party transcription service. For a user test this can be problematic because the scribes aren’t likely to include observations. These might be simple observations like what page/section/screen a user is on or more interaction related such as what users click or tap on (or fail to click or tap on). In this screenshot, we see an example of usability testing notes captured using our Evolve Research App. Rather than a transcript, you take notes against the relevant task in the mod-guide. In this example the notes are for usability testing a car hire website. This is effective because the process of hiring a car follows a short and consistent process. Another approach would be to take notes based on which screen the user is on. This could be useful for an app or website where a particular task may span multiple screens, especially if multiple tasks can reference the same screen. Note: It’s important to be flexible. You might have structured your notes around tasks but find that participants jump back and forth between screens. This would make it hard to give recommendations per-screen. On the other hand you may structure your notes per screen but find that usability issues are related to the task rather than the capabilities of the screen. Either way the advantage of taking structured notes is that it greatly simplifies your analysis. The fastest (and most effective) approach is usually to structure your analysis the same way that you structured the notes. So if the notes are structured around tasks you should create an affinity map for each task. If the notes are per screen (or page) you should have an affinity map for each screen. In this screenshot we can see the need to be flexible with how we approach our analysis. Each participant has notes against “Task 1: Find a car to hire” but that task was split over 2 pages: search and search results. In this case it was more effective to split the analysis to each screen to make it easier to spot trends between participants. This is also useful because we likely want to report on the usability issues on a per-screen basis. The most important thing to keep in mind is don’t do your affinity mapping on a per-participant basis. Instead you should review each task/screen one by one across participants. If you go through every participant one-by-one then the notes from one participant will no longer be salient when you look at the same section for the next participant. A first step for finding usability issues is to group notes very broadly. In the screenshot above there are comments from multiple participants about filters. If you find that there are too many notes in one theme then you can consider splitting them further. Your first pass of the analysis should simply involve putting all of the related notes together. So if there are comments or observations about filters they all go into one theme. Note: It’s alright for some issues or observations to apply to only one participant. We’re dealing with small sample sizes. That one participant may represent a significant portion of your user base. You need to use your judgement about the significance of the issue based on HOW it affects the participant’s experience. Complete every task, screen, or section for every participant before moving on to the next part of the analysis. In fact it can help to leave some time between doing your first pass of the analysis and looking for findings. Personally I’ve found that a good nights sleep helps me approach the analysis with the best headspace. But don’t wait too long between grouping notes into themes and identifying research findings! Human memory is fragile. You may find that you need to spend more time reviewing your themes if you wait too long to finish your analysis. This is where the value of a deep analysis starts to come in. You may be tempted to simply take notes about usability issues as you watch the test (or the recording). And that fast analysis approach is great if you are testing a small number of tasks with very few participants. But even then you might miss the bigger picture. Once you have an overview of the experience across each task it’s time to start drawing conclusions. In my article on analysis methods for user interviews I mentioned that we need to find a balance between rigour and speed. We deal with sample sizes that are too small to make confident predictions based on the number of participants that experience usability issues. Instead we need to combine evidence from multiple pieces of research together with our judgement to reach suitable conclusions. For example: if filters on a page are easy to miss we may recommend that we change the design so that users are more likely to find them. But suppose most users are easily able to find what they are looking for even though they can’t find the filters. In that case we have to think about the potential consequences of making one part of the design more visually prominent (e.g. it may break the visual hierarchy of the page and actually make it harder to use). When working with small sample sizes most of our insights (and recommendations) will be based on assumptions. Rather than conducting randomised controlled trials for every design change we can just iterate quickly. With quick iteration we can work out if a previous design change had an undesirable outcome in future usability tests. Obviously the approach of fast analysis based on assumptions won’t work in every scenario. You need to be a lot more rigorous if you are working with hazardous materials, dangerous machinery, healthcare, or any other area that has a direct impact on the wellbeing of others. For some research findings you may be able to come up with a recommendation on the spot. For others you may need to spend some time thinking about it before you can work out what to do. However at this stage of the analysis you should not be making detailed design recommendations unless they are incredibly obvious. It’s better to keep your recommendations at a high level — things to consider evaluating rather than designs that definitively need to change. It’s worth doing a pass over each of the findings and writing recommendations or reviewing your on-the-spot recommendations from before. It may also be worth noting the severity of the finding and the scale of the recommendation. Especially if you’re in an agile environment it might be worth coming up with smaller scale fixes to particularly significant issue. In the UX world we constantly have to strike a balance between research rigour and product development speed. While you spend time deciding whether or not fix a usability issue you have users out there experiencing that very issue. On the other hand you don’t want to miss an issue because you failed to do a proper analysis — or worse do a shallow analysis and make a bad recommendation that causes more problems down the line. The method we propose tries to strike that balance. Here is a summary: With this approach you can add some rigour to your usability analysis while still moving at a fast pace. It won’t be as quick as making snap judgments while you take your notes but it will be more robust. Want to use Evolve to analyse your usability tests?

is right around the corner, which means more React apps are coming to the market. It is prime time to learn new UX tactics to stay ahead of the curve, and keep your app competing with the best!
Today we will be looking at some of the tactics that the top players of the industry are using. Placeholder content, micro-interactions, loading screen strategies, smooth fades & transitions. There is much room for improvement in each of our applications. Let’s see how we can implement these tactics in React and keep our users engaged. Loading screens are a good place to start our journey for improving the feel of our applications. In the example above we are fetching data from three separate API’s before displaying the welcome screen. In the “before” loading screen, we are leaving the user in the dark. Whatever processes are running in the background are completely hidden from the user. In the “after” loading screen, we show the user what’s going on behind the scenes, then give a positive confirmation when each process finishes. The user feels they are part of the process, and it feels good. Instead of using the classic react-loading or react-spinners libraries, try spicing up your loading animations with the powerful react-lottie package. You can head over to lottiefiles.com and pick from a selection of thousands of user-submitted animations to use in place of the boring spinner icon. Once you find an animation you like, you can open it in lottiefiles’ full blown editor. Here you can edit every layer, playback-speed, dimensions, background-color, and more, all inside of the browser! For a step by step guide of how to implement these loading tactics with code examples, you can refer to this in-depth article. Let’s take a look at the before and after in the example above. In the “before” example, we have a simple loader animation having us wait for some mysterious content. Then unexpectedly throws us some cards when it is done loading. In the “after” example, notice the smooth gradient moving across the placeholder cards, indicating to the user that we are loading some content for them here, and then gracefully fading the results into their designated slots. The page should always look and feel structurally sound. An important takeaway from this strategy is the structure of the page before and after loading. The placeholder content ensures the page is always holding consistent dimensions, both before and after loading the content in. If we opt to use a simple loader, the page will potentially have to resize itself to fit the content after it loads in. Luckily Danilo Woznica has built two tremendously useful tools to design and implement these placeholders in React:
React-Content-Loader and Create-Content-Loader Create-Content-Loader is a tool to help us generate a placeholder component, and it comes with some useful presets such as the Instagram layout, Facebook layout, code placeholder, etc. Almost every platform you come across nowadays has implemented this tactic, you should too! For a step by step guide on how to implement this in your app with code examples, check out this article. Our applications are always moving from screen to screen, constantly throwing data at the user. How we can handle these transitions in the most elegant and beautiful manor? Let’s take a look at the “before” and “after” example above. In the “before” example, the welcome screen immediately pops up, no animation, no transition, just sitting there. Ugly. Then we click on our inbox and get a rigid transition straight to some messages. I don’t really enjoy using this person’s application, it just feels basic. On the other hand, when looking at the “after” example, try to pay attention to this first milliseconds of the GIF. The present pops open with an exciting short animation, then the welcome text and button fade in from the bottom of the screen. Smooth. Once I click the inbox, the messages elegantly fade in to view, sliding into their places one by one. Nice. Thanks to a useful library, react-fade-in, you don’t have to deal with any CSS. You simply wrap ANY component with a <FadeIn> tag, and it will automatically animate each child, one by one. You can also just wrap the parent with <FadeIn> and it will animate everything as one block. The <FadeIn> component can take two props: delay Default: 50. Delay between each child's animation in milliseconds. transitionDuration Default: 400. Duration of each child's animation in milliseconds. This small, simple addition will help upgrade your application’s user experience. This tactic can be used to fade in text, images, lists, and any other React component you can think of. You can even wrap your entire app in a <FadeIn>! For a step by step guide on how to implement this tactic in your app with code examples, please refer to this article. Medium holds the perfect example of an improved user experience. Pressing it is an instant dopamine release. Confetti, bright glowing animations, a sharp vibrate when pressed on mobile, this clap button is fun to interact with. These micro-interactions are an instant way to get users to fall in love with your application. Let’s take a look at the before and after example above. The before example simply indicates that it was pressed with a color change. Bland, but gets the job done. The after example immediately gives you an attractive green outer-glow when you hover over the button, teasing you into pressing it. Once pressed, you get a blast of confetti and a bright green indicator that fades up smoothly, an ultimately seducing interaction that forces you to give it a couple more clicks. The before example isn’t necessarily bad… and it gets the job done… but I had fun clicking the other clap button. So ask yourself, is your app fun to use? If you would like to implement this component in React, you can use the react-clap-button library by KikoBeats. This library is customizable, meaning you can switch out the icon, change the color scheme, and manipulate the counting mechanism. The quickest way to get up and running with micro-interactions is by using this small but incredible library, react-rewards. Whether you need a burst of confetti, a parade of emojis, or a groovy shape animation, implementation of this highly customizable library is as easy as wrapping any component with the <Reward> tag. A step by step guide on how to implement micro-interactions in your React app with code examples can be found here. There are certain apps you come across that give you a good feeling, you have fun interacting with them and will therefore come back for more action. Look for ways to do this in your app, it is both fun and holds more utility than it may seem. It can be as simple as an interactive clap button, it can be as subtle as perfect fades and transitions, or it can be as explosive as confetti and emojis. Find what works for your context.

When I first started out in the industry not that long ago, I found myself a bit disappointed that most business decision makers did not seem to value UX and similar design/research work as much as I was led to believe from educational resources. But even now after a few years working on many different projects, it seems that it’s actually quite rare for the average organization to truly understand and trust in user-centered design. Level 6 on the maturity scale states “By stage 6, usability is no longer a magic potion that’s sprinkled over the user interface at the last minute” which is something I have only seen a small handful of very successful organizations achieve. While it’s clear that design teams from companies like Google, Apple, Shopify, IBM, Salesforce (and many more) have been able to successfully integrate the design process and cement the value of user-research, not every team has the resources to do the same. This does not mean doom and gloom for the myriads of designers out there working at companies at a lower level of the maturity scale. If anything it signifies there are plenty of opportunities out there. Luckily, thought leadership in the field has managed to shift most organizations past the first stage of “Hostility Toward Usability”. At the second stage “Developer-Centered User Experience” most teams don’t have someone in a formal design role. Therefore where most organizations fall is the third stage, “Skunkworks User Experience”. This stage is where the ball gets rolling and we start to see the value of the design process. The difference a handful of user tests and research initiatives can make is very impactful at this stage. Many designers will find themselves in a role where they may be the only designer on a team and tasked with shouldering the entire burden of the user experience. Not only must they push for more design buy-in, but they also need to continuously prove the correlation between user research and measurable business objectives. At this level the phrase “this is the best we can do with the resources we have” is heard often, because despite good intentions, the lack of buy-in, time or resources will result in compromises to the usability of a product due to technical, financial and time constraints. A designer in this situation treads the fine line between defending the user’s needs and a project’s resources. Is it worth it to push the MVP delivery date back by 3 months to include a better custom search experience when a slightly less usable one suffices? The jump from stage 3 to 4 is probably one of the biggest ones where there just needs to be enough buy-in to establish a fledgling design process. The opportunities to really grab on to an internal thought leadership role exists between these stages where effective documentation, communication skills and delivery of results can really help advance the skills of a designer and the priorities of an organization."

Even the most brilliantly coded apps can fall short of their potential without intuitive aesthetic design.
Medium.com,Innovation & Tech,How to Break into User Research,UX,https://uxdesign.cc/how-to-break-into-user-research-932ce8ef47a0?source=topic_page---------11------------------1," One of the number one questions I get every week are people asking me how to break into the field of user research from another role or right after graduating. I speak with people from all different disciplines, some closer to user research, such as marketing, psychology or design, and others further away, such as accountants or writers. One thing I love about user research is that the skills you need to break into a field are about relating to and empathizing with humans. For me, it has been one of the most rewarding jobs I could ever have imagined. Through user research, I can have a positive impact on both users and team members. Another great thing? I genuinely believe most people can become great user researchers, without paying loads of money for a degree or certificate. To prove this, here is my story of how I broke into this field and some tips to go with it. Getting into user research was one of the least straight-forward paths I have taken, and that is often the case for most people breaking into this field. There is no one magic course to take or one perfect path that will guarantee you an entry into any user research job. It is one of the more difficult specialties to get into because of the indirect pathway, especially when even the entry-level jobs seem to have a mountain of requirements. A lot of my students ask if they should go back to school to get a Masters. With this degree, there will be a higher chance of them getting noticed. Most of the time, I would, quite honestly, say no. The only exception is if the degree encompasses other interests and potential career paths. For example, one of my students is potentially interested in becoming a user researcher, but also might end up in policy research. In this case, it might make sense for him to pursue this degree. Aside from that case, I would argue that it is not necessary to go back to school to get into user research. I was able to get into user research through an internship in New York City. I had just finished my MA degree in psychology (yes, I know I said you don’t need a higher degree to get a job, but wait for it), and decided I didn’t want to continue with pursuing my Ph.D. Instead, I wanted to join the world of user research. My MA degree was in clinical psychology and came with some knowledge of statistics. The role I finally received was as a user research intern, with a qualitative focus, at a tech company. I had never worked at a tech company before, and let me tell you, my Master’s degree could never have prepared me for the experience. I took a few different steps when I started looking at and applying to different UX research positions. Below is (what I remember) of my crazy process of diving into this unknown world: Practicing user research is an essential part of creating a portfolio and getting “experience.” Yes, I honestly look back on those pieces now and laugh, BUT, I got an internship, and a few other interviews because of those small projects. I put in a lot of amount of effort into three case studies, and it helped me when I went to apply and interview. They weren’t perfect, not even close, but they showed initiative and my passion for learning and being a part of this field. What else do you want for an intern or junior role? I have some final thoughts on why a degree won’t help you as a user researcher. The most critical and best way to learn user research is to be in an environment with user research. It is absorbed by practice, not by theory. Unfortunately, at this moment, user research is not being taught this way anywhere. There may be aspects of this in an MA program, but I believe the best thing you can do for yourself is to get into an environment in which you are learning user research through doing and observing. MA programs will give you a theory to work off of, but the practical experience isn’t there. I prefer aspiring researchers to spend two years trying to get into an apprenticeship or internship than spend two years learning, and then try to get into an entry-level research position.

Medium.com,Innovation & Tech,First-Time Facilitator,UX,https://uxdesign.cc/first-time-facilitator-435b3220a5da?source=topic_page---------17------------------1," Back in September, I had the opportunity to plan and facilitate my very first design sprint at Passport Inc. Like any growing product team, Passport had never conducted a process like this before. So after much campaigning and convincing everyone from product directors to product managers; I was able to gain enough buy-in to get one scheduled for our Enforcement product. For those that might not know, a design sprint is a structured, decision-making process typically consisting of a team of 8 people. The team spends about a week working through activities of understanding the problem, sketching, prototyping, and ultimately user-testing a final solution. Design sprints allow teams to quickly validate their assumptions while avoiding wasted time building the wrong solution. If you’d like to know more about design sprint there are plenty of great resources out there including this and that. I was originally exposed to design sprints at a previous company where I quickly realized the value in this process and became eager to bring this style of design thinking to Passport. So when the opportunity arose, I began researching everything there is to know about facilitating design sprints. As many do, I started with Jake Knapp’s Sprint book, I studied AJ&Smarts revised sprint process (Design Sprint 2.0); I read every design sprint article and watched every how-to video I could find on the subject. With the support of my team, I partnered up with the Enforcement product manager and we started planning. We decided on a slightly abbreviated timeline as this pilot design sprint didn’t require a full week’s worth of everyone’s time. We brainstormed, we sketched, we prototyped and we user-tested. We found ourselves obsessed with the problem we were solving and learned even more from watching users interact with our solution. After 4 days worth of sprinting, we were exhausted and ready for a beer. It’s safe to say that those involved in the design sprint immediately realized the value of this process, which in my eyes made the sprint a complete success. But after sharing our learnings with the rest of the product team, it was evident that not everyone was confident in this process just yet… Without going into too much detail there are some internal constraints that make fully adopting design sprints difficult. This is partially due to our agile engineering timelines but I see it as though I haven’t properly conveyed the value of design sprint. While I strongly believe in the benefits design sprints could have on our products I continue to explore new ways and opportunities of showcasing their business value to appeal to those within Passport."
Medium.com,Innovation & Tech,What to expect in a UX writing interview,UX,https://uxdesign.cc/what-to-expect-in-a-ux-writing-interview-582fcfc6dd70?source=topic_page---------18------------------1," UX writing is a relatively new profession as far as titles go, which can cause some confusion from both parties when it comes to the job interview. Not quite a copywriter, not quite a technical writer, but not quite a UX designer, a UX writer finds themselves floating somewhere between those roles. I’ve been through enough UX writing interview loops now (which can also be called a UX content strategist, or UX copywriter, depending on the company), to know what to expect. Like most interviews, especially for a tech company, the interview loops are long, tiring, and often challenge your mental stamina as much as your aptitude. The industry is finally circling back and correcting errors the early design teams made by omitting copy from the overall design process. In Yuval Keshtcher’s podcast “Writers in Tech” Ep 3, Jared Spool states that in the early days when user guides and products went from analog to digital, technical writers were forgotten, lost in the shuffle along the way. In other words, companies are starting to see the real value of copy, whether it be a well thought out CTA, or a series of introductory screens to increase user engagement, the copy is just as important as the design. Most of us in the UX writing field have come from some sort of writing background, whether it’s from copywriting, content writing, or technical writing. The biggest difference that I’ve seen from UX writing interview loops as opposed to copywriting, is being able to explain your decisions in a design way of thinking. To put it another way, it’s best to think of UX writing as a design position, instead of a writing position. For example, in a recent copywriting interview I had, the company asked me to explain how I came up with my copy for a brochure I wrote. My answer (in a nutshell) was that I looked at some competitors to see how they phrased it, thought about the right words to use considering our brand, and kept editing it until it just “felt right”. That answer would not play out well in a UX writing gig (trust me, I know from first-hand experience). Designers will want to know not only how, but why you arrived at the copy you did. Intuition isn’t as coveted in UX, as much as user research, data, and testing, is. Figure out how and why you arrived at your decisions and you’ll already be ahead of the pack. It’s pretty standard as far as the format. You’ll be asked to do at least one initial phone interview, a writing test, and then usually a half day of interview loops with various members from the company, as well as an on-site presentation of your work. These interview loops will typically consist of: Product and UX designers will typically want to know about your experience working with other designers in previous roles, as well as your take on UX research and design thinking. Other writers will want to know more about your process, your previous writing experience, and how well you might fit with the team. Just when you thought you could escape into an introverted, writing focused role, the industry says “Ha! I got you!” and decides to throw you for an all-day interview loop which includes a slide presentation on your work. It’s tough, it’s nerve-racking, and most of all, it requires a lot of work. In almost every case, they ask you to showcase 2–3 examples of your favorite portfolio pieces, as well as the take-home writing project they gave you before the interview. As mentioned in the previous section, you’ll be asked to not only go over your work, but explain how you arrived at certain copy decisions, as well as some other random questions like: Unfortunately, us UX writers are held to a higher standard of visual presentation (almost as much as UX designers), so I’d suggest staying away from cheesy Powerpoint templates. If designing isn’t your strong suit, go with a simple, clear white and black presentation and leave plenty of white space. Not in theory, but in reality, yes. Not only will you likely be interviewing with UX/UI designers, but your design decisions will be crucial in helping the company find out if you’re the right fit. After all, I strongly believe UX writing is a form of UX design. As a UX writer,you’ll be working on UI’s that will be seen by a lot of people, and you’ll only have seconds of their attention at a time. So understanding some basic design skills is necessary in my opinion, and exactly why I wrote this article about transitioning to more of a design-centric content approach. The good news is that if I can do it, anyone can. Learn Sketch, Adobe XD, or Figma if for nothing else, to show that you can work within the same tools as a UX designer. It will help your career and boost your visual design chops in the process. Yes, and to be clear, you should be prepared to do some work for free. This means working on take home writing projects that will test your design and writing skills, and are designed to see how well (and how fast) you can come up with copy. It typically consists of a project spec that asks you to provide copy on some mock-up UI’s. This might sound easy on the surface, but is usually anything but. The mock-ups are typically bland on purpose, so you’ll need to use some creative firepower to give it some life, meaning you’ll likely have to spend many hours work on the design, as well as the copy.

Oh, and every employer will say something like “Oh, but don’t spend more than 10 hours working on this”.
Yeah, right.
10 hours is nothing in writing…it takes me almost 10 hours to load up my laptop some days, which is only a slight exaggeration.

Writing professionals know that words don’t just come to mind that easily, and we often spend many hours, sometimes days, just trying to get the copy to sound correct. So I say spend as much time as you need to get it right. I can only speak to my personal experience, but I think it’s always a good idea to know and ask how much a company values your position, and copy/content in general. Too often, writers are still thought of as an afterthought in the design process, even though the research proves its impact, and it’s our job to change that perception. A company that already values copy is one you probably will find a lot of success in. It’s a good time to be a writer, if you’re prepared and are up for the task, the opportunities are right there for the taking."

Medium.com,Innovation & Tech,Looking at Disney’s theme parks through the lens of a UX designer,UX,https://uxdesign.cc/looking-at-disneys-theme-parks-through-the-lens-of-a-ux-designer-34d37adab54?source=topic_page---------21------------------1," Recently, I went on a vacation to Orlando to celebrate a birthday, a half marathon, and my love for all things Disney. When I was there, I was blown away by how much thought and attention to detail Disney had put into its theme parks. Going with my father, my wife, and our friends got me thinking about how different people perceive the same experience. Looking at Disney’s theme parks through the lens of a UX Designer, I noticed a lot of things that inspired me to be a better designer. Language plays a huge role in a user’s experience. With our words, we create definitions, communicate rules, and express empathy. Depending on how we use them, words are also a great opportunity to develop the narrative of the worlds we create. A great example this in action is Mickey’s PhilharMagic Concert, where viewers attend an opera that Mickey conducts. Essentially, it’s just a 3D film, but Disney never breaks its narrative––instead, they take every opportunity to stick to their theme, even when communicating rules for their experience. Users are given 3D glasses to watch the show, but Disney refuses to call them 3D glasses, instead referring to them as “Opera Glasses.” They intentionally deviate from a common naming convention of something viewers are used to, in order to keep their narrative cohesive and tell their story. Attention to detail is a huge part of designing a cohesive experience. If an experience lacks detail, it loses its form, becoming weaker and hampering the user’s experience. (*small spoiler*) At the end of the PhilharMagic concert, Donald crashes through a wall of the theater into the next room. In that room is a gift shop, and in the center of it, there is a statue of Donald wrapped up in musical instruments. Disney takes their story one step further by integrating the conclusion of the show into their set design, building a cohesive narrative for the user and recalling the concert viewers just saw. Whenever you create something, you have the opportunity to connect each element and stitch together a world for your users. The more touch points that sell your world to the user, the more immersive the world you create is. In Galaxy’s Edge, the new Star Wars component of Hollywood Studios, this idea is taken to the max––all of the cast members never break character, helping reinforce the idea that you are actively participating in a story. While I was buying a glass of Blue Milk, the cashier mentioned it would cost “credits” instead of dollars. When I presented my credit card, he told me to use his “droid” (credit card machine) to buy the drink. When I swiped my card and the machine processed the order slowly, he said that his “droid had been malfunctioning all day because it was an older model.” In the blink of an eye, the crew member effortlessly turned a mundane transaction (that was semi-frustrating even) into an opportunity to build upon the theme Disney created, fully committing to the world. Lenticular Design is a concept I learned about from Mark Rosewater, a prominent game designer who leads design for Magic: the Gathering, a popular trading card game. Mark uses the term to describe the way he designs experiences for different types of players, illustrating the way he makes cards that people look at differently depending on their experience with the game. Mark introduces a lot of great concepts in the article (and you should really read it, especially if you like games), but one of the major takeaways is this: “The motive behind lenticular design is that we want to find ways to add complexity to enhance the game for the more-experienced players without increasing the difficulty for the less-experienced ones.” How does this concept come into play at a theme park? Well, Disney does this by enabling choice and designing different levels of participation for its users within the systems it creates. For example, Disney has recently introduced a system where users can reserve rides in advance called FastPass. Essentially, people can make reservations for the rides they want to go on before getting to the park. FastPass is a simple concept to understand, but within this system exists a lot of nuance. Rides can be scheduled up to two months in advance depending on the tickets you purchase, some rides are premium and can only be reserved if it’s the only one of its type you reserved that day, and if you use all of your passes early in the day, you can get more. To the novice, they see FastPass as a way to skip the line when they are at the park. To the expert, they see a system they can use to plan out their day and adjust their wait times on the fly. The system is lenticular, designed in a way that has simple rules but complex interactions, or what I like to call “emergent complexity.” So many different types of people come to Disney theme parks. Children, adults, families, couples, newlyweds, and more all choose Disney as a vacation destination, and as a result, Disney has to design with each of them in mind. One way Disney thinks of its users is by giving first time visitors a special welcome pin. By having this pin, these users signal to all cast members that they are new to the park, which allows the cast to proactively provide them with special assistance if needed and gives the cast a chance to go out of its way to leave a strong first impression. On the opposite end of the spectrum, you have the superfan––the user that goes deep on an experience, that has a great wealth of knowledge and love for a property or brand. Disney caters to these enthusiasts in many ways, from building your own Star Wars droid souvenir at Galaxy’s Edge, to making your own lightsaber, to taking photos with the characters from its various worlds. But Disney takes the superfan concept to the next level with Club 33. Club 33 is a set of private clubs located in different Disney theme parks. The entrances are hiding in plain sight, and can only be accessed if you’re a member. Being a member (or a guest, if you’re lucky enough to know someone) grants you access to unique and exclusive resort experiences, such as entrance to secret jazz clubs or private viewings of original animation cells of Disney films. Disney has gone so far that it caters to the superfans of more than just its various worlds–– it caters to superfans of Disney itself. According to Wikipedia, corporate members pay an initiation fee of $40,000, and individual members pay $25,000 in addition to annual dues, which are about $12,000 (seriously, if you’re a member, let’s hang out). Agency is a powerful thing to give to your users — by enabling choice, you can let your users make decisions to cater the experience to their wants and needs. The more agency you provide your users, the more they start to craft their own narrative within your product. This process invests them further into the experience and lets them walk away with their own story — which they will be eager to share with other. At Disney, a family of four will seek out different experiences than a honeymoon couple. There might be some overlap between their goals and constraints, but even if each of those groups go to the same attractions, they will have a different set of stories by the end of the day. Disney provides multiple pathways to move through its theme parks, the ability to prioritize various sections depending on which rides you reserve in advance, and a multitude of things to do at each attraction, depending on your preferences and expertise. Disney enables these choices for users by providing them with options and arming them with information. Through the Disney app, users can learn about upcoming shows, manage their schedules, make restaurant reservations, and see real time data about line waits. All these options allow users to make decisions and craft their own stories at the park. In Buzz Lightyear’s Space Ranger Spin, the concept of agency is taken to the extreme. Users are tasked with shooting as many aliens as they can during the ride, and have the ability to aim their guns, turn their ship, and focus on the targets they choose are the most important. In this way, the user crafts their own experience and walks away with a score that is uniquely their own. It’s easy to think that when people talk about UX, they mean the digital screens that a person interacts with––how something looks, the visual effects that occur when you start clicking around the screen, and all of the digital components that go into it. But true UX, a “user experience,” is more than that––it’s the summation of the points of interaction a person has with the thing that you create. That “thing” could be a screen, or a digital product, but it also could be a board game, or a coffee machine, or even a theme park. The principles outlined above all factor into a user’s experience, and each one impact the way a user perceives what someone creates. At Disney, these things don’t exist in a vacuum — they are integrated and interwoven together in a brilliant set of values that extend to each touch point people have when they attend a Disney theme park. There’s a good reason why going to Disney is magical––it’s because, at every level, they’ve thought about the user’s experience."

You’re not sure that this feature will work without broader changes to the product. However, no one has asked you to design a new feature and a sweeping overhaul of the product. In fact, when you’ve pitched broader changes alongside a feature design in the past, your stakeholders expressed skepticism and dismissed your proposal as scope creep. Still, you can’t help but feel that these broader changes are sometimes necessary — even if you’ve been having trouble convincing your stakeholders to see things your way. At Stack Overflow, I’ve often grappled with the question of when and how designers should advocate for more holistic design changes (and therefore, larger scope).

Product owners and UX professionals collaborate to understand, balance, and prioritize user needs and business needs. Product Manager HQ provides a great summary of product and UX roles: Product owners and UX professionals need to build strong relationships and combine their expertise and experience to produce the best possible products. When it comes to deeply understanding user needs, prioritizing them against business needs, and adapting the product accordingly, some product owners are uninvolved, some are over-involved, and some are able to strike a nice balance. As a UX professional, I’ve worked with many product owners. Over time, I’ve developed some strategies for working effectively with each flavor of product owner. I once worked with a product owner who was not familiar with UX design or research. He wasn’t sure how I could help him or how best to partner with me. He even seemed a bit threatened and fearful of me challenging his decisions and authority. Teach them about UX research and design. Encourage them to get more involved. One product owner I’ve worked with really cares about his product and wants to control it end-to-end. While he has good intentions, he can get too in the weeds and will even challenge the UX team’s expertise. For example, once, after several rounds of user feedback, we made specific design and terminology changes to aid comprehension, but later he asked engineering to remove these changes. Additionally, he joined some client calls and latched onto feedback that supported his hypotheses, but disregarded any feedback that contradicted him. Provide an overview or refresher of the research and design process. Set up meetings to regularly review and discuss the designs. Encourage them to participate in research sessions. Push them to cite clients’ feedback. I worked with a product owner who was excellent at balancing his partnership and involvement with the UX team. He saw us as a true partner to understand client needs, influence product design and direction, and design the product to solve user problems. He attended all research sessions and discussed key things we heard right after each session. Then, at the end of a study, we discussed the overall feedback we heard and what our next steps and action items would be. He provided a product blueprint for us, but not step-by-step instructions. Additionally, he stopped by to discuss any questions in person, which was often faster and more effective than Slack or email. Keep them involved and informed. Express your appreciation for your partnership and praise them. Keep up the good work."

Atomic design is Brad Frost’s methodology for building design systems. The idea is that we can take the basic building blocks of living things and give our UI a hierarchical structure based on it. Brad Frost defines five main stages of UI components: Atoms are the simplest form of UI, consisting of things like headers, labels, input fields, buttons, etc. Molecules are a combination of atoms that form more complex pieces of our UI, such as a search field with a submit button. Organisms build on top of molecules and orchestrate larger parts of the UI. This can include a list of products, a header, forms, etc. Organisms can even include other organisms. Templates are where our pages start to come together, giving context to all of our organisms and molecules by giving them a unified purpose. For example, a template for a contact page will have organisms for headers and forms, and molecules for text fields and navigation bars. Pages, as the name implies, is our final page with all its content. The difference between pages and templates is that templates don’t provide any content."

Although it deals mainly not with serving the customer but selling, it involves matching their needs with your product. Also, it usually gets better conversions and comes with additional benefits as well. It can set a common goal for your company, something easy to refer to when you have doubts on which feature to develop and much more. A value proposition promises value you’ll deliver. It gives the primary reason a prospect should buy from you. It defines the first step of telling users what you offer. Your landing page offers the most trivial example of using the value proposition, but it can appear anywhere you need to convince your customer quickly: in an advertisement, the App Store, whatever. Example App Store We can easily confuse the value proposition with other marketing related tools. Most commonly we mistake it for a single sentence, like a slogan or tagline: “Just do it” Although Nike’s tagline expresses some values about the product (in its simplicity), it mainly aims for memorability. A value proposition involves more. You need to answer the following questions. It may sound trivial to answer, but landing pages often lack it. Do you offer a service or an app? For businesses or regular customers? Imagine someone comes out of the blue with no background knowledge or context. Will they understand what you do in five seconds? I love Slack and use it daily for my work, but I don’t think their site fulfills this purpose. It has nice people in nice images and a dreamy headline: “Imagine what you’ll accomplish together”. These could apply to any kind of service or product. However, they can afford to play to emotion and only show people as illustration above the fold, as their target audience already knows them. Trello has the same target audience as Slack, and they answer this question better. I know they offer a productivity tool I can use collaboratively. The secondary headline explains this deeper with boards, lists and cards I can use. They illustrate this less abstractly. This question extends from the first, and it deals with good targeting. Maybe I understand your product or service at a glance, but why would I care? What relevance has it got to my life? How can it make my life easier? WordPress does a really good job targeting their customers. These people need a website but don’t have time, so they want a quick solution. The third question helps distinguish you from your competitors. Maybe you can clearly define what your product does. Maybe you can also target your customers’ pain points successfully. But why choose your solution instead of the dozens of other products like it? Have you got a cheaper, faster, more effective, etc solution? Stand apart from your competitors! Show customers what makes you different and give them a reason to buy from you. Firefox doesn’t shy away from knocking the competitors. “Uses 30% less memory than Chrome” seems too direct, but it certainly works. Waze can differentiate itself without direct comparison by simply emphasizing its distinctive feature: real-time help from other drivers. You have five to fifteen seconds to answer these questions because the customer spends that much time deciding whether to use your service/product. We can answer these questions quickly in many ways. On a landing page, these elements do it the easiest: Make the first thing your customer reads short and informative but catchy at the same time. Grabbing their attention, the secondary headline lets you explain your offer more specifically. Images communicate much faster than words. Show the product, the hero shot or an image reinforcing your main message. Thousand words etc. List the key benefits or features in three bullet points or smaller sections. You could simply come up with sentences and test them. If you are looking for a more practical approach or the words don’t come easy, use the following framework. As always, think with your user’s head. But if you really want to do a good job, do user interviews. Why? To reach them, speak their language and answer their real problems. During the interviews, get answers to these questions: This kind of typical questions during a user interview help find the value proposition: – Can you guide me through the steps the last time you wanted to book a flight?
– Do you remember any particular painful points during this process? Ask open questions, pay attention and look for patterns. Once you have the necessary background knowledge, start organizing your insights. We typically use the Value Proposition Canvas. In a nutshell, this tool lets you focus on the most important jobs, pains and gains of your customer, and prioritize them. The results can work as the building blocks of your final value proposition. It works in conjunction with the Business Model Canvas developed by Strategyzer. The Value Proposition Canvas has two sides. On the right, we have a customer profile. It helps clarify your understanding of the main customer segment. On the left, we have the Value Map. This helps describe how you intend to create value for that customer. Your job here is to find the fit between the two. The pain relievers on the left should reflect on the collected pains of the customer on the right side and so on. Organizing your insights with this framework can give you ideas for your value proposition. At this point you should have some ideas on how to present your offer to customers. Maybe you have several good ones and can’t decide which you should go on with. This actually presents a good opportunity: Finding the best value proposition involves an iterative process which you can always fine tune. Change the copy, illustration, hierarchy of values or emphasize something else. No matter what you change, test it somehow. We can test the value proposition in several ways. Here, I’ll show two of our favorites. The PPC ads function of Facebook presents a perfect way to test ideas quickly. The split-test function works perfectly for A/B testing. Play with the segments and set a limit for the budget. In the end you get a clear, quantified result. A/B testing has its own rules. . As mentioned, you have five to fifteen seconds to convince the customer to buy your product or service. We can actually simulate this situation. With this straightforward method, show the landing page to the test participant for five seconds, then hide it and ask what they remember. This perfectly tests whether customers clearly get your messeage."
Medium.com,Innovation & Tech,Fast Food as Design Standard,UX,https://medium.com/swlh/fast-food-as-design-standard-6de97819b431?source=topic_page---------31------------------1," Have you ever wondered why fast-food restaurants such as In-n-out, Chick-Fil-A, and Whataburger have been able to be so profitable and consistently deliver the same great end-to-end experience to their customers? It’s because they have figured out a small and simple-to-read menu that offers the customer a fast way to order what they want. You’re probably wondering why I’m talking about ordering fast-food in a post about product design… It’s a simple but powerful idea: many complex design problems have already been solved in the physical world. Great design should be pleasing to interact with and near-invisible because it’s easy to navigate. Designing a great user experience at Wise (a digital bank for small businesses) presented an interesting challenge and opportunity. How do we avoid overly-complex forms and screens while providing a rich set of features that are fast and easy to use? Overly complex forms are the death of great user experience, so naturally, there are a number of viable solutions out there. Solutions which include clean visual treatment, increased whitespace, chatbots, and the reduction of necessary fields to a bare minimum. However, the core of the problem is still there… forms are tough to navigate and can feel slow and overwhelming. So when we were presented with the problem of designing an intuitive onboarding experience for our banking service we wanted to do something different! Of course, we first started by reducing all the required fields as much as possible. For example, instead of asking applicants to select their incorporation state from a list of 50 states, we just pull it from the formation document submitted to help reduce the necessary steps. However, we quickly realized that even the “bare minimum” was way too much to unleash onto a user no matter how well we structured the information. So after some consideration, we went back to the drawing board and started looking at real-world solutions to this problem of information overload. We started thinking about processes in the real world that require you to answer a bunch of questions before you get the result. Maybe it had something to do with the fact that it was around lunchtime, but it didn’t take long before one of us remembered the last time they were at In-n-Out and ordered a customized burger and the simple experience they had: We realized that this was, in fact, a pattern spanning across all successful restaurants. They had found a way to reduce information overload by only having a handful of meals on their menu and allowing customers to change them based on applicable options to the menu item. So we thought to ourselves: “Why should digital product design be any different? Users want a fast and easy way to complete their everyday tasks, and not be overloaded with 50 different irrelevant options on a menu.” This eventually led us to come up with our Hamburger or Hotdog design pattern. It’s simple: what would you like today, a hamburger or hotdog..? Open a bank account for a business with multiple owners or a single owner? We decided that the best way to navigate users through the complex forms that are required to open a business checking account was by offering them bite-sized and straightforward choices that take them down a customized path for their needs. It looks something like this: The high-level questions are simple but definitive and lead the applicant down a contextualized path for their specific needs — there is no irrelevant information cluttering up the User Interface anymore. Based on previous answers from the user we ask the more specific questions, which enables us to create a truly customized on-boarding experience that offers helpful and relevant content such as FAQs and tips in a stationary panel on the right side of the screen. Switching to this approach not only made it a lot easier for applicants, but it also enabled our Customer Success team to provide the right resources and answers right away. Because we separated the application flow into bite-sized pieces we were able to implement accurate screen event tracking through Intercom, which lets us know where, and why, the applicant is stuck. Now we are able to offer help without asking a ton of questions to diagnose the issue — saving ourselves and our applicants valuable time. Since moving to the fast-food inspired design standard we have seen a significant decrease in the time it takes users to submit their applications, as well as an increase in success rate!"
Medium.com,Innovation & Tech,"Why some designs look messy, and others don’t",UX,https://uxdesign.cc/why-some-designs-look-messy-and-others-dont-1755b8ce22ff?source=topic_page---------32------------------1," Humans like boxes. We love boxes so much that they are central to both our visual and conceptual world. Stereotypes, music or art genres, religious or political views — all of them are boxes, or at least attempts to put stuff into them. But also in the physical world, 2D or 3D, we love boxes. Here’s a neat little trick to show you what I mean: ask anyone to draw a circle on a piece of paper. Then ask them to draw something to contain the circle they drew. Guess what? Most people will draw a box around the circle. This is remarkable, because a triangle, a hexagon, a wiggly-ass diamond, or even another circle would have sufficed just fine. But no: we like boxes. To put stuff into, stack them, align them, and stuff our attics or garages with them. Boxes feel solid because they are. In three dimensional space, a box is made up of six 2D boxes. Parabox. They’re almost like magic. Now, before you get ahead of me: no — the ‘box’ is not the mystery design-rule I’m talking about. But boxes do have something to do with it; otherwise, I wouldn’t bore you with this introduction. Let’s get to it. A two-dimensional box is made up of four lines. And, as we’ve seen with the circle, we are tempted to visualize boxes around everything we perceive in 2D space — e.g., UI and visual design. This is very apparent in the act of wireframing and rough prototyping: we conjure op a composition of wired boxes that represent the entire user interface, and this works remarkably well. Yes, I made that up myself. It’s not super catchy, I know. Let’s stay on-topic. The four strokes making up a box end at each intersection. But in our unconsciousness, every one of those lines draws out an imaginary line much further, through the entirety of your design. Like this: This also applies to a circle, or any other shape, like this: Every object draws these four lines through your design, regardless of their shape. This goes for rounded buttons, weirdly masked images, paragraphs of text, giant headings, social media icons — everything. An easy way to see how this works is by simply drawing three shapes onto a plane. The shapes interact, even if they are quite far apart from each other. The reason for this is that, regardless of the distance between the objects, the imaginary lines of them do collide somewhere on the canvas. This is the most fundamental rule when it comes to composition. It is how you handle the sum of all of these lines that makes your design look either cluttered or clean. I call this The Extendabox rule because it has more ring to it than “the four-line rule” and it makes sense: you extend the lines of boxes. Well, not really. A grid works the other way around: you define a set of columns, gutters, and rows to make up certain sections of your design, and you then position all of your objects onto that grid. While this works to keep your design clean, it can be limiting to your creativity, and your design might come off as dull or uninspired. It is for this treason that I once was a grid hater. I believed that I was a wild horse, meant to roam free and be unconfined. Grids posed a threat to this eternal goal of mine. I and my creativity should never be tamed. Until they were tamed, in a way. Acknowledging all of the invisible lines that go through your design helps you create better interfaces. Now, you might be tempted to assume that, based on the Extendabox-rule, everything should go into a grid. Not so much. Some things should go into a grid, but a grid should — in my opinion — be a result of all of your Extendaboxes, not the other way around. What I like to do is approach a design gridless, and then as I progress, a logical structure resembling a grid will appear slowly. The next step is to align certain things that were already nearly aligned in the first place. If the extended lines of one object are only a few pixels or mm away from the lines of another object, you merge them. Taking out these small inconsistencies and weird gaps can suddenly bring calm to your design because you are significantly limiting the number of lines, making the composition easier to comprehend. The sketch above shows what I mean, roughly. I started by sketching a basic layout, without a grid. This allows you to play around with the composition without being too confined. Then, when you’re somewhat okay with where you’re going, you try to minimize the number of orange areas, which are areas where the extended lines nearly touch. You can keep repeating this process — it’s iterative. Every time you move an object, other line collisions or gaps appear. It’s up to you to decide when to stop, but generally, you will quickly come to a point where removing even more gaps will make your design look generic and dull. Right before that point, you stop. Things like this are great to read about, but you won’t grow unless you practice. Luckily, in this case, practicing is easy. A great place to start is to dissect existing designs. Head over to Awwwards, for instance, and look at award-winning websites. Then just visualize all of the boxes and apply the Extendabox-rule: extend their lines and see a grid appear. This way you’ll be able to really understand what the designer went through getting to that specific end result. If you want to take things further, take screenshots and draw onto them, or try to recreate a website UI you love out of only boxes and lines. In a geeky way, that can actually be a fun and relaxing experience. Once you start mastering this rule, you will be able to create clean but bespoke UI designs in far less time than you do now, because you’re taking the guesswork out, and instead you take on a pragmatic approach to layout and composition."

last week’s news: DeepMind announced that their sophisticated AlphaStar AI is now better than 99.8% of all human players in the Blizzard Entertainment game StarCraft II. The news was published on 30 October in Nature. Robot uprising, anyone? It’s two decades into the 21st century already, but the much-predicted robot apocalypse never happened. Still, the subject of artificial intelligence and its potential is exciting and agitating people’s minds. Look at the movie industry, and I’m not talking about “Space Odyssey 2001”. Consider the last five years: there’s “Ex Machina”, “Blade Runner 2049”, “Alita: Battle Angel”, and ok, “Avengers: Age of Ultron”. Dozens of other movies broached the subject of AI and its possibilities with “Terminator: Dark Fate” currently in theaters. And it’s not all about movies. For example, people are wondering whether there will be an AI in the hyped upcoming “Cyberpunk 2077” video game. They say that sci-fi has been experiencing a crisis for some time, but as you can see, the theme of AI is very much alive. And the culture is a mirror to society. AI is everywhere. Siri and Alexa are simple examples of how AI-powered technology has become a part of our daily lives. But there’s also AI design in social media, smartphone cameras, in managing home energy usage. I don’t even have to go far to illustrate my point. I’m writing this article in Google Docs with Grammarly installed. It’s a digital writing tool using artificial intelligence. Mind you, I turn it off while working, otherwise, it’s too distracting. But it’s useful to have texts proofread, it catches dumb moments and typos, provides a selection of synonyms, etc. And there are a lot of more sophisticated tools for writers than Grammarly. But what does AI mean for UX? Let’s find out what is the current state of AI in UX, how it might be useful for the stronger UX, and whether AI can substitute designers altogether. The possibilities of AI and machine learning in UX design is one of the hottest trends for 2020. Recently the UX research platform UserZoom conducted a survey where they found out that 80% of UX executives believe that UX design and AI are the future of user experience. This figure was only 66% last year. A lot of organizations are already participating in this competition. They want to make the UX of their products more intuitive with the help of AI technology. Last year Narrative Science and the National Business Research Institute made a survey on the subject of artificial intelligence in the Enterprise. Almost two-thirds of companies reported that they’d already made AI part of their businesses. This is twice as much as in 2016. In a different study, 61% of marketers said that AI is a crucial aspect of their business strategy in general. I see why this is happening. Soon, users will be satisfied only by this degree of user experience. And UX design is all about making people’s experiences with digital products more straightforward. It should remove the hitches that make the user-brand connection more difficult. Effortless UX design equals user-friendliness. AI is just the right tool for using personalized behavioral information to drive up conversions. As a result, companies get to know their clients better and people are more likely to engage. On top of that, a brand’s profits rely on effective customer engagement. So what are the examples of AI usage in the world of UX? Customers are becoming more demanding. They are no longer satisfied with nice-looking UI, colorful animations and smooth user flow. These are the things that they expect to have, not something fresh and exciting. People want more. Today we like to feel that their communication with brands is personal. Only when they have a feeling of personal communication, are they ready to express their loyalty and choose one brand among others. The most significant advantage AI can give is improved personalization. It uses the data collected by the system to tailor the site to the needs of the user like tailoring a suit. 73% of Internet users are extremely annoyed when showed irrelevant content. AI allows demonstrating to each user the interface that he needs. It means that users will see only those tabs, menu items, applications, etc. that they need. Clients enjoy interacting with the site more, which increases sales. And here’s a thought that can seem unexpected: AI creates more profound human connections between people. Ironically, the reality is that artificial intelligence helps to humanize brands and make them more approachable. Among the companies that use personalization to its full extent is Netflix. There are too many movies and TV shows there to choose from. Users need a little push in the right direction. According to Netflix, 75% of their views come solely from personalized recommendations. Netflix’s recommendation algorithm is one of the most powerful and complex examples of mathematics you can experience every day without even knowing it’s where. Google produces personalized search results that depend on many factors like user location, search history, demographics, and interests. For example, if you do a search for “pizza restaurant” your search results would vary considerably from mine. Google’s Youtube tracks viewing history and offers recommendations that are personalized to each user’s viewing habits. If we go deeper into what AI cand do for UX, we’ll discover that AI has the potential to generate an advanced personalized messaging system. Future users will settle for nothing less than messages personalized according to their concerns and problems. Including AI interactive ads that are already being developed. Chatbots are great for providing efficient customer service and advertising new products and services. Many large companies are using chatbots as a part of their business strategies. You can order food and taxi, arrange flights, and get recommendations for anything you can think of, including applications acting as personal fitness coaches. In a report by Gartner, it’s stated that 85% of customer interaction will be handled without human agents by 2021. Yet, a report by Forbes reveals that people are 80% less likely to make a buy if they sense that they communicate with an unempathetic robot. That is why more and more businesses are requesting for chatbots that possess a sense of empathy, advanced interactiveness, and the ability to turn users’ emotions into data and then perform sentiment analysis. The solution is to recognize the target audience, identify with them and their issues, and help resolve them. The most enjoyable part is that with chatbot marketing you can get as creative as you want. There’s an amusing story of a UX designer Steph Hay who helped create the first gender-neutral AI assistant in banking. Eno chatbot is so good, people want to marry it. Chatbots that can perform sentiment analysis are even creating new jobs. Chinese market analysis company QYReports estimates the AI sentiment analysis market to increase by 21% every year from 2019 to 2025. Facebook in its turn struggles not to lag behind Amazon and Apple and has been working on a voice assistant to compete with Alexa and Siri. The news is they could use it on the company’s Portal video chat smart speakers. These days, people have several possibilities of creating a website. You can base it on a template, use web design tools like Webflow, or order a custom-made design by a team of professionals. Artificial design intelligence or ADI is trying to change the idea behind web design with AI experiments. In 2016, the web development platform Wix revealed its ADI tool to automatically create a customizable homepage for personal or corporate needs. Besides Wix, several other platforms use AI in web design on a more superior level: AiDA from Bookmark and Sacha from Firedrop. Then again, there’s an infamous example of the Grid, a web design tool that was intended to be the first single window in AI web design. It made a sensational debut, but in reality, it never met its exaggerated promises. The websites its artificial intelligence software made were inflexible, with less capability than was promised, and plainly said, not so great in terms of aesthetics. The Grid company sent its last public tweet on December 10th, 2017. In March 2019 all customer websites are taken down, and thegrid.ai, where customers sites were hosted, ceased to be functional. Machines aren’t capable to match professional web designers yet, and they never really will. Anything more complex than a little brochure site, and the difference is staggering. So, designers have no real reason to get worried about their job security being compromised by this type of service. Web design made by AI robots: Web design made by humans: UX design is a creative job, but even UX designers cannot do whatever they want. They must be aware of the latest trends, meet the current market demand, and use new tools to stay successful in today’s competitive world. All in all, swift technological progress has inspired a whole new generation of UX designers. They rely on new tech to make UX more user-centered and all-round more efficient. For example, they use prototyping tools. A prototyping tool lets designers see in advance the outcome of their work without having to finish the whole project and with less time spent on the job. Just a few sketches are needed. AI system quickly moves ideas from rough sketches to real life. The most famous cases are Airbnb and Uizard. They designed AI systems that can recognize hand-drawn parts and pass them into the code. It simplifies the development process and gives more time to concentrate on more important aspects. The top 5 prototyping tools for UI/UX designers are: However, AI and its capabilities in UX are not all that it’s cracked up to be just yet. Humans often have unrealistic expectations from artificial intelligence, while in reality, it’s still in its nascent stage of development. AI use in applications is great, but you have to tell it exactly what to do and to develop it using feedback. Once you tune it to its performance, only then can it become effective. A great example is self-driving cars. Many people believe that, because it’s a machine, it should be 100% effective and reduce car accidents rate to 0%. In fact, the first thing we should strive at is making the accident rate of AI-driven cars the same as human drivers’ and then try to develop the situation further. Steady progress, as with everything else. Microsoft is already testing a smartphone-based AI system for driving license tests in India. Their claim that replacing human driving instructors with AI technology is possible, but is it though? Take a couple of minutes to appreciate a great job The Washington Post did to interactively illustrate how autonomous cars work in reality. Spoilers: not so great. AI systems still have a long way ahead of them. They are able to provide personalized solutions to an extent but they still can’t offer human-degree customer service. People are somewhat wary of robots, the lack of desirable empathy can be annoying, and machines don’t have the common sense you’d expect from humans. Machines can teach themselves, but still, they are not capable of thinking on their own. But then again, maybe they shouldn’t. AI’s purpose is to help and assist people with their tasks to make their lives easier and more productive. Which brings us to the conclusion and the point I’ve decided to leave for the last. The possibility of designers to be replaced by robots. It may all sound like a sci-fi movie, but the actual truth is that AI strengthens the UX in ways that can’t be compared to any other technology or marketing strategy. It can make a brand-user interaction far more personal, get and use highly-valuable data, free humans from simple tasks and much more. It’s useful. But what if it’s too useful — more than it’s comfortable for us humans? It looks like every few months or so a report alerts us about the future where lots of people will lose their jobs because of artificial intelligence. To pick one, an Oxford University study prophesied that half of the jobs in the US could be automated by 2033. But if we take a glance at history, we’ll see that it’s not so doom-and-gloom as it may seem. Another study based on an analysis of 170 million job postings from 2010–2017 states that as technology reduces the cost of some tasks, the value of the remaining tasks increases. Any profession that needs a high level of creativity, innovative thinking, and experience isn’t likely to disappear in your lifetime. AI is far from providing all the said skills. A considerable part of any person’s work isn’t creative. Sometimes professionals spend a lot of time performing less imaginative and more mundane tasks that machines are able to perform in a fraction of the time. Here’s where AI can prove effective. The thing is not making people redundant, but to free them to spend more time on the artistic, beautiful and fun bits of their jobs. In words of Burton Rast, UX Lead at Google, “When the tractor was invented, the farmers got scared out of their minds — it seemed to be robbing them of their work. There’s no need in following the fears. You just need to look more for advantages rather than disadvantages in the new technology, and the fear will disappear by itself. Any new technology devalues existing professions and at the same time offers new ones in return. We can’t even imagine what specialists will be in demand in a hundred years.”"
