is a theme of recent high-profile, tech IPOs that founders keep control of their company through the use of share classes even after they go public. The list of companies that have floated with privileged voting power for their founders is long. Facebook, Snap and Lyft all went public with their founders still retaining control. Is this practice fair?"

Medium.com,Industry,Will Venture Capital Vetting Change After WeWork’s Failed IPO?,Venture Capital,https://medium.com/swlh/will-venture-capital-vetting-change-after-weworks-failed-ipo-86d00e97bbf1?source=topic_page---------4------------------1," WeWork’s failed IPO is certainly one of the biggest business debacles of 2019. It can be argued that the company would have had a difficult road to reach profitability, even if the series of events that led to the failed IPO had never happened. In an odd way, the failure of the company to deliver upon its large-scale vision early on is a good thing for most investors (i.e. anyone who was thinking about buying the stock post-IPO). Still, it’s scary to think that the world’s largest venture capital groups — the ones with the most money, time, and resources on the line — didn’t see the red flags until it was too late. SoftBank (now majority shareholder at 80%), J.P. Morgan Chase & Co, T. Rowe Price Associates, Wellington Management, Goldman Sachs Group, the Harvard Corp., and Benchmark all bought into WeWork’s vision. WeWork isn’t the first company to make mistakes and cancel an IPO. Nonetheless, the buildup about the company’s potential and the quickness of its decline are unparalleled among unicorn companies. For better or worse, startups looking for seed funding to Series E and beyond should know that WeWork’s failures have already begun to influence the world of venture capital. Let’s be real. WeWork’s valuation was largely based on hype, not potential. There is a key difference. The hype of WeWork wasn’t based on what it could offer people in the near future. Rather, it was based on what it could offer if the company underwent a complete metamorphosis. The best example of this is the company’s pivot from WeWork to The We Company. The high valuation was based on the ability to become a real estate conglomerate and much more, not just a company offering office space rentals. Sure, the company had opened a grade school, two apartment buildings, and three fitness centres. However, it’s important to see that these were and still are largely experimental business verticals. It’s possible that the company could have expanded The We Company ecosystem to more cities, similar to how it did with WeWork offices. Brand recognition can be hard to quantify, but business leaders wildly overestimated anyway. Just because The We Company can expand its ecosystem, but that doesn’t mean that brand recognition gained from WeWork somehow equates to a large customer base in other verticals. One of the biggest takeaways from evaluating The We Company’s business model is that the company was spreading itself too thin. By trying to make a play at multiple business verticals at once, WeWork was neglecting how it could optimize its most established vertical: office rentals. Many successful businesses have been around for a long time because they focus on a single niche. This doesn’t mean there isn’t room for some innovation. For example, international restaurant chains often optimize their menus based on what people like to eat in a particular country or region. At the end of the day, people still recognize the brand and generally know what to expect. Unless the occupancy rate at WeWork offices is close to 100% in every location, there should have been a greater focus on how to attract more entrepreneurs, freelancers, and larger companies. If the company knew that this business model was doomed to fail, it should have made the pivot to other verticals long before starting the groundwork for an IPO. Billions of dollars in losses are all too common among startups today. Uber, Peloton, and WeWork are just a few examples. It’s always been common practice for startups to raise capital before profitability. However, the number of years to reach profitability appears to be getting drastically higher. — Amazon was founded in July 1994 and reported its first quarterly profit in 2001. — Google was founded in September 1998 and became profitable in 2001. — Facebook was founded in February 2004. In September 2009, it turned cash flow positive for the first time. — Uber was founded in March 2009 and is still not profitable at the end of 2019. — Peloton was founded in February 2012 and is still not profitable at the end of 2019. — WeWork was founded sometime in 2010 but is still not profitable at the end of 2019. Notice the difference? Do venture capital groups have to wonder what has caused the shift away from well-known startups being able to reach profitability within ten years? Is it caused by an over-reliance on a high growth mentality that doesn’t focus enough on profits? Is it just that the ideas, business models, and technology of new startups are too untested to predict if or when profitability can be reached? In July 2019, news outlets reported that CEO and Co-founder Adam Neumann cashed out more than $700 million through a mix of stock sales and debt. Neumann’s ability to cash out early was a selfish decision that started WeWork’s decline. This brings into question whether VCs should add legally-bounding requirements for when founders can cash out on equity. While troubling, it didn’t completely derail the company’s IPO plans. The problem was that this wasn’t enough for Neumann. Resigning on September 24, he received an approved compensation package worth nearly $1.7 billion. As part of the deal, SoftBank went from a 29% shareholder to an 80% shareholder. In November 2019, former WeWork employee Natalie Sojkatook filed a proposed class-action lawsuit against Neumann. Smaller shareholders who didn’t have the option to cash out early like Neumann saw the company’s value plummet by 87%. On November 8, 2019, WeWork announced plans to divest all non-core businesses and cut jobs. Medina Bardhi, Neumann’s former chief of staff, is also suing him for pregnancy discrimination. The fate of the company is mostly unknown. Can the company ever recover under the majority leadership of SoftBank? How will the court rule on Neumann’s discounted stock sale to SoftBank? Will WeWork be forced to close offices that are further away from profitability? Does the vision of a true multi-vertical ecosystem fade away? Throwing money at a company just because of a grandiose vision or belief in its founders isn’t a real strategy. WeWork’s story presents a message to all venture capital groups about the importance of getting back to valuing companies based on fundamentals, not fairy tales."

To begin to value a fintech business, one must first assess the following characteristics about the company and its market: What are the types of valuation calculations that can be used for fintech companies? In my first article, I went through the process of how to value a startup in the fintech space and provided insight into what creates “value”, which in turn translates into valuation. We also saw that valuation is an art form during the early stage of a fintech company’s lifecycle and, as it progresses towards a stable business model and starts generating cash, it increasingly becomes a scientific exercise based on the visibility into cash flow generated by the company. To continue this theme, I will look at how the same principles are applied to a real-life situation of company valuation. This will be referenced to the different principles enumerated before, including looking at the various parameters that determine value creation, comparing funding milestones with theoretical models and, finally, delving into a futuristic view of how to value a company. To make this appear more tangible, I will be valuing TransferWise (TW), the UK-based fintech company that started out to disrupt the global cross-border money transfer market which, according to them, was opaqueand charged high fees to customers. The company started in January 2011, has built a robust stream of business, has 4 million customers, handles transfers worth over $4 billion per month, and was most recently valued at USD $1.6 billion. To start with, let’s look at how TW scores on the various parameters listed in my first article as some of the key parameters that determine the valuation of a fintech startup. TW is clearly solving a problem of simple and easy money transfers across the world. Traditionally, banks and MTOs have enjoyed monopolies on this business and have charged huge fees to customers, running as high as 7–8% at times. TransferWise’s solution is a simple, seamless service that allows customers to easily transfer money at a low and transparent cost using their mobile phones. Its services are already available in 49 countries (over 75% of the world’s GDP) within a timespan of just 7–8 years, served by just 11 offices. This reflects the power of a new age technology platform business, which can build global reach in a short span of time. The simplicity of the offering and constant innovation around new use cases such as borderless accounts and TransferWise business demonstrates the business’ desire to change paradigms of the payments industry and build new product offerings around where it sees gaps in its customers’ journeys. As per TransferWise’s annual report, it’s invested less than $5 million in physical assets, including property, plant, and equipment. This is minuscule compared to the global reach and TAM that it serves across the world and illustrates the point. Any other global bank, in the past, with this kind of reach would have made capex investments worth millions (probably billions) of dollars. TransferWise almost doubled revenues (+100%) from around $85 million in 2017 to around $152 million in 2018. During the same time, its fixed expenses went up from about $60 million to approximately $88 million, an increase of about 45%. This reflects how the overall operational costs can be dramatically reduced as the scale of operations grows further. Even as per TransferWise’s own “mission zero,” it is striving hard to bring down fees to 0.0% (or as close to zero as possible) and has already reached 0.3% on some routes. This is only possible through increasing customers, increasing volumes and, hence, continuously lowering per-unit costs of operation. TransferWise has been clear from inception about its revenue model, with a very transparent pricing model of up-front fees that aren’t camouflaged under exchange rates. It has also been very clear about not cross-subsidizing any currency routes and, hence, charges fees based on the specific costs of each currency route. This appears to be working, as TransferWise has been profitable for the second year running in 2018. TransferWise has been very active in building product cross-sells, starting from a simple cross border peer-to-peer transfer to multi-currency debit cards to borderless accounts and business accounts for SME clients. A business model that encourages cross-selling and increased wallet share inevitably leads to higher LTV, TW is also now building institutional partnerships with banks like Monzo (UK) and BPCE (France). Such initiatives will help it grow its client base quicker. The table below, sourced from Crunchbase, summarizes the various funding amounts raised by TransferWise from its inception up until 2018. As is evident, this table correlates very well with the lifecycle table that I discussed previously, highlighting the various stages of evolution of TW. It is important to note that TW actually made a profit in both 2017 and 2018 and has thus already started generating cash flow from operations. This fact is very well correlated by the fact that the latest funding round that took place on November 18 is actually a debt round, reflecting the fact that the business has already started generating positive and much more predictable cash flows from its business. We will start by identifying the size of the total available market (TAM). From this, we will determine the serviceable addressable market (SAM) based on the products/geographies available with TW. After this, we will make some assessments about serviceable obtainable market share (SOM) based on how much the market can reasonably be captured by TW. These will give us the first two variables that we will use in the valuation exercise: Overall market size and TW’s likely market share. First, let’s try and understand the industry and its total available market size. TransferWise’s primary market is global cross-border money transfer. As per an Accenture Report, based on WTO data, global cross border payments can be seen to be growing from approximately $21.78 trillion (retail $1.95 trillion and corporate $19.83 trillion) in 2016 to $30.20 trillion in 2022. Retail payments are growing much faster at 10% CAGR as compared to corporate ones (5% CAGR). As per a Mckinsey report (2018), the structure of the market is split four ways between C2C (6% average fee), C2B (3.5% average fee), B2C (1.5% average fee), and B2B (0.1% average fee). The four different segments can broadly be summed up in the following manner: C2C — Peer to peer payments that include worker remittances sent home and family remittances, such as education expenses. As per a World Bank report, worker remittances were at a level of $679 billion in 2018. I have applied a factor of +33% to forecast and project a total C2C market size. This 33% refers to the “‘non worker remittance’ C2C transfers.” C2B — This primarily includes families paying for tuition fees (both academic and professional) and any other goods/services purchases made by individuals from institutions (excluding credit/debit card payments). These two segments add up to the total retail payments growth as shown in Accenture/WTO data above. B2C — These include corporate payments to freelancers (which by a number of reports are growing very fastand any other transactions/eCommerce return related payments. I have assumed these to be 15% of the total corporate payments. The higher fee number here is due to the possible beneficiary deductions (lucrative “bene deduct” fees, per the banking industry parlance) that are made by banks/payment companies from the recipients of the payments. B2B — These are regular business-related payments between corporates. Now applying all these pieces of information above, I have projected the overall volumes of the different segments of the global cross border remittances (shown below). The estimated market size in 2018 is $24 trillion, with revenues of about approximately $180 billion. As shared above, based on the Mckinsey report, the average fee levels are at 6%, 3.5%, 1.5%, and 0.1% respectively for the four customer segments. TransferWise’s average fee in the current year ranges from 0.3% to 0.6%, and hence, we will take an average number of 0.5% of volumes as the fee income for 2018. TransferWise had total annual volumes of around $50 billion in 2008 based on average monthly volumes of around $4 billion. Based on this, its market share in the C2C category comes to about 5%. Since it has recently started operations in the B2B business, we will assume a 0% market share for the other segments in 2018. Looking at a few comparable companies in the global payments industry, the range is between 12.9x (ADS) to 32.8x (PayPal). Based on the TW business model, I am tempted to apply an EBITDA multiple of 20x; however, for the sake of being conservative, I will use a multiple of 15x. Looking at EBITDA margin comparables for TransferWise, the numbers range vastly, as shown below. The (positive) range is between 13.2% (Euronet) and 62.9% (Visa). Based on these numbers, a conservative number for this category of companies appears to be 20%. Now that we have determined a few key parameters, we can start building out various scenarios for valuing TransferWise. As has been explained before, the DCF-based approach is one of the most commonly used and can give very good results provided we have the right kind of detailed data. However, I am not doing a detailed exercise using DCF here, since going to details of DCF is not the objective of this article. In addition, this article is being written based solely on publicly available information. Hence, a DCF-based valuation would have to use many estimates and assumptions which will be prone to errors. In a real investor engagement, they would have access to the data room of the company alongside detailed discussions with the senior management, all of which will provide accurate inputs for a DCF model. TransferWise reported monthly volumes of around $4 billion in 2018 and has taken a key position amongst money transfer companies in several markets including the USA, UK, Australia, and Western Europe (TW market position). The table below shows how TW revenues have risen sharply since 2016, relative to its peers. Even if we take this growth rate to slow down slightly, it is clear that it is gaining market share, and I project its volumes to grow at a steady rate of $2 billion (notional transactions) per month every year for the next five years. A simple comparison across various digital money transfer services shows that the average price charged by various online money transfer agents is in the range of 1–3%. In terms of what TW can charge, I will use its current rate of 0.25% and assume that it will progressively increase to a steady state rate of 1%. To simplify the exercise, this rate assumes the revenues are made across all of the products that it has (or will add). Similarly, as the marketplace effect kicks in and the volume efficiencies continue to rise, I have assumed that EBIT margins will grow to an industry average of 20%. The table below gives an output accounting all the above parameters: Based on this approach, we get an enterprise value of $5 billion in 2023, based on a stabilized EBITDA of 20% and EV/LTM EBITDA multiple of 15x, as estimated in the earlier part of this section. It is also important to test this in the context of the overall market size, which comes to just 2.5% of the total market size ($168 billion), which does not appear to be too excessive or unreasonable. This cross-validation supports the fact that this valuation approach doesn’t produce an outlier or unrealistic valuation. In my personal judgment, this number of $5 billion appears to be very conservative, and actual valuation should be higher than this. However, the important point is that this approach helps us reach a reasonably comfortable conclusion that TW valuation could be greater than $5 billion by 2023. Let’s use another approach where we first look at the different segments of the cross border payments market to make some judgments about winnable market share and revenues. Firstly, here are my projections of TW’s future market shares per business segment: Market shares are projected from a current market share of about 6% in C2C and the inroads it has started making into C2B and B2C/B2B segments via its new offerings of debit cards and borderless account. The next table shows how these market shares will correspond to revenues projected across for the next five years. Looking at the above numbers, we can see that TW will have revenues of about $3.4 billion by 2023 and an EBITDA of $0.68 billion, which will give it a valuation of about $10.2 billion (15x EBITDA). This does appear quite heady, but we must keep in mind that we have already diluted the average fee levels further to 0.5% from 1% in the previous section. However, we have been a bit liberal toward business growth volumes across all segments. This also ties in with the lower fee levels, since a lower fee would facilitate a more competitive situation for TW and allow it to gain higher market share. It appears that a more competitive situation with higher market share is more beneficial for TW as compared to a higher fee level and lower market share. In this valuation method, we will take the overall market size (TAM as assessed above), take three different scenarios each for TW market share across segments and prevalent fee levels, and arrive at the respective revenue and EBITDA and valuation numbers. The three different scenarios defined are as follows: All three scenarios’ TAM estimates are summarized as below: TW’s current focus and value proposition are more valuable for retail customers — thus, I am using the two retail customer segments only (C2B and C2C) for the valuation in order to be conservative and obtain a base case valuation for TW. The three scenarios’ market shares per business unit are summarized below: Finally, if we then apply the fee assumptions, we can plug in the numbers to arrive at valuation estimates for the three scenarios: Valuation: We arrive at EBITDA numbers ranging from $0.4 billion to $0.9 billion — by applying the EBITDA multiple of 15x (as used previously), we get valuations ranging between $6.4 billion to $13.9 billion. Attaching a probability weighting to each scenario gives us a probability-weighted valuation of $11.1 billion. Now, to reiterate, this estimation hasn’t added the following: The different methods used above have given us a valuation ranging from $5 billion to almost $14 billion. For those of you who were hoping to see one single value, I hope that you don’t feel disappointed. But, as I mentioned before, while the valuation exercise does become more scientific by the late stage of a fintech startup (as we’ve seen here), in the end, the final valuation is again a factor amongst other variables. This consists of the collective judgment and return expectations of the investment team, the bargaining power between the investor and the investee, the stage of business growth, and the potential of the business to continue growing aggressively in the future. What the above exercise does point out to me is that TransferWise is doing a great job of disrupting the cross-border money transfer market and is likely to have a valuation, at a minimum, in the range of $5–7 billion in future rounds. I hope that you have enjoyed reading this as much as I have enjoyed researching and writing for this article. Please get in touch through the comments section if you have any feedback."
Medium.com,Industry,How to value a fintech startup,Venture Capital,https://medium.com/swlh/how-to-value-a-fintech-startup-974a8f0c52f9?source=topic_page---------7------------------1," Fintech is a popular contemporary buzzword and many of its products touch our lives every day. A fintech simply refers to a company that operates in the financial services sector and leverages the power of technology to simplify, automate, and improve the delivery of financial services to end customers. Further, they can be classified into various sub-sectors including payments, investment management, crowdfunding, lending and borrowing, insurance, cross border remittances, and so on based on the specific segment that they are trying to service. There were over 12,000 fintechs operating globally as of January 2019 (Crunchbase Dec 2018), who since 2013 have amassed total funding resources of well in excess of US$100 billion. In terms of the number of fintech startups, the US is the most active country, with India and the UK following. According to KPMG, global investment activity in fintechs exceeded $30 billion across 450 deals that took place in the first half of 2018 alone. The area that I would like to focus on with fintech is how its startups are valued. This interests me due to the following points: These are some of the issues that I am going to try and address in this article. First, let me highlight some of the traditional valuation models that are conventionally used while valuing companies. These methods include: Most valuation exercises use the multiple method to arrive at the valuation of a company and then use different approaches to arrive at ranged estimates, before choosing a number that matches their overall strategic, business, competitive, and return requirements. One thing to note is that the above approaches are typically useful for mature, stable businesses with relatively predictable cash flows and established business models. Whichever approach is used, they are all the same in just trying to estimate an outflow and future expected cash flows with an expected range of IRR. However, when one looks at the current crop of fintech startups, all of these principles look difficult to apply due to them having completely unpredictable or even negative cash flows, rapidly changing pivoting business models, and in most cases, negligible physical assets. Now let’s be more specific and look at the valuation of financial sector companies. We can broadly divide the finance industry into various sub-sectors as described below. Each has certain nuances that affect how valuation can be applied to their specific business models. Modern global banks are typically aggregations of commercial banking, investment banking, wealth management, and advisory services. Focusing on the “traditional bank”, a conventional commercial bank would be valued on parameters like net interest margins, return on assets, EPS, and comparable PE multiples. The first two parameters measure the efficiency of the bank and how efficiently capital is being deployed, while the other two are measuring returns that accrue to shareholders, taking into account the capital structure and the expected growth in earnings. These approaches primarily take into account the business model of a bank, which basically runs on the spread between deposit and loan rates while managing defaults and maintaining an efficient capital structure. Asset management companies (AMCs) are typically valued as a percentage of AUM that measures an AMC’s ability to generate cash flow based on the total size of funds that it has under its management. This can vary based on the underlying asset class breakup of equity vs fixed income, fee structures and so on. Another popular measure is to look at market capitalization to AUM, which aims to correlate growth in income potential with the size of the fund, based upon an underlying assumption that AMCs with very high AUMs will not be able to grow income as fast as smaller ones. Other variables to keep in mind while valuing AMCs are: An insurance company would typically be measured on common parameters such as return on equity. A good surrogate for value companies in the public markets would be price to book value, which will reflect the relative valuation of companies across markets. More specifically, some of the relevant factors for valuing insurance companies would be as follow. Premium growth in the market/company. How fast is the company’s premium income growing? Is it gaining market share? Is the underlying market saturated, or growing? Naturally in a market where insurance is still gaining popularity, the former will likely have a higher potential for growth. Similarly, a new company is likely to have a higher potential to grow as compared to an existing market leader. Returns consistency. In the case of insurance companies, the payout ratio is not a clearly predictable ratio and can be volatile. Hence one measure that we look at when valuing an insurance company is the consistency of its income to ascertain whether over longer periods it makes consistent returns. Other comprehensive income (investment income). An insurance company’s income comprises of premium income and investment income earned from its investments, hence OCI is a measure that shows the level of returns from its investment portfolio and forms one of the two key sources of income. Conceptually it would appear that WM firms are akin to AMCs and their valuation would be correlated with AUMs, revenue and fee rates. However, their business models are different to pure mutual funds, whos setups are more institutional and standardized. Fund managers do add value, but their investments are more process oriented to support large AUMs driven by standardized and regulated products, with a mass-market sales approach. In comparison, wealth management firms are more boutique-y and are comparatively less regulated, thus the value that investment managers add is customized to the risk appetite of clients. Also, in the case of sales, relationships are key, with loyal clients investing based on their personal trust, comfort, and relationship with a manager. Hence, valuing a WM firm is a more detailed and complex task that needs to go into a number of variables. So when valuing a WM, one would have to add the impact of these variables in the valuation model before arriving at a final number. When we come to valuing fintechs, the key differences between conventional businesses and early businesses are mainly in terms of: All these variables give insights into the kind of TAM available, and the subsequent revenues that the fintech can generate. Below are some of the key variables that go into qualitatively assessing the potential of a new generation fintech, as compared to the traditional financial sector companies that I described above. Let’s take a detailed look at some of these variables The foremost variable is the nature of the problem that is getting solved by the company, whether it’s a disruptive solution to a major problem or just an incremental improvement in an existing solution that may not affect the incumbents in a big way. Using Fintech as an example, Transferwise has grown to a valuation of $1.6bn, due in part to it changing the paradigms of money transfer. If it had followed the status quo of analog brokering based on FX and payment cost, then it’s most likely that it would not be as successful as it is now. The nature of some businesses makes them easily scalable across large geographies. For example, in the past, banks or mutual fund companies would need an extensive infrastructure of offices, branches, distributors, and agents to be able to reach and service their customers. With new age mobile-enabled fintechs, they are accessible to a client across the legal geography that they operate in and hence can rapidly scale up business. This allows them to cover a very large TAM within a relatively short time frame hence. For example, digital bank fintech Revolut was launched in 2015 and already has over 3 million customers and is available in over 120 countries. This is definitely larger than the number of countries served by most large international banks which have been in existence for over 100 years. As fintechs innovate there are new use cases that are enabled with the help of technology, which can potentially expand their market. A simple example could be a drastic reduction in cash balances that customers keep, as fintechs enable low-value P2P payments. This, in turn, is likely to increase idle balances kept with the fintech, as compared to traditional bank accounts. A real example in the fintech world is from wallet startups like Paytm using P2P transactions for enabling low-value payments to settle transactions amongst friends, splitting bills and making payments to small businesses. Typically such startups have business models that leverage the power of networks and are themselves very lean, with much lower infrastructure and setup costs. These costs can reduce as the size of the business grows and customers may benefit from this. For example, Uber doesn’t own any cabs or doesn’t need to have a huge setup for owning, servicing or maintaining cars. In the fintech world, companies like Revolut, Transferwise, and Paypal have a wide footprint across the world without having the need to open offices in each location. In line with lower infrastructure and manpower, these companies have much lower marginal costs, as the business models are tech-enabled, rather than with transaction-linked high variable cost. This also makes these business models profitability increase exponentially after a certain critical mass that absorbs the fixed cost structure. In the fintech space, one can look at companies like Monzo which have less than one tenth the cost of servicing a retail account as compared to a large traditional bank. Fintechs work on revenue models that leverage the power of a large number of customers and transactions that network effects enable. It’s important to understand what is the revenue model and how are they going to eventually make money, be it directly from the user or indirectly via advertising or data plays. A model that is just based on generating users without a clear understanding of how it will be monetized may not be successful in the long run. Due to the typical platform nature of a Fintech offering, it’s also easy to continuously keep adding features and products to the initial MVP. Cross-selling opportunities become apparent with the benefit of AI-supported insights about consumer behavior and patterns from their use of the tech. This makes it amenable to continuously expand the scope of the offering with relatively small effort. An example of this can be the UK retail bank Monzo which originally started as an online prepaid card service, then a current account and now, lending services. Let’s look at the life cycle of a fintech company and understand each phase. Once an appropriate founding team is formed, the next step is to convert the idea into a prototype product or service. This prototype is typically a very basic version that translates the vision that the founders have into reality and tries to demonstrate and visualize how the new product will solve the problem in a different way. At this stage the idea is typically funded either by bootstrapping, friends and family, or angel/seed investors and could involve a total initial investment of between $50,000–100,000. Post founding, the startup uses money raised to build a simple MVP that is a functional and robust working model that can be tested in the market for acceptability. This is an important step in the evolution of the startup and it may require multiple iterations with its functionalities/features to get the product right, using customer feedback loops. Once success is achieved in this, the startup is now ready to raise the next round of money, once again from the angels, seed funds, or VCs. At this stage, the startup has a valid idea and a successful MVP that now needs to be launched in the market to build customer traction. The startup will likely raise the next round of growth capital which could range from $250,000–2 million and can come in multiple tranches based on meeting agreed on milestones. Once the company achieves rapid product adaptation and its evident that the customer acceptance is strong and the product will likely scale up, it’s time to now scale up the business, build a robust organizational structure, hire bigger teams and build formal structures. This is the stage at which the company will raise Series A funding, where most early angels/seed funds will likely exit and VCs will increase exposure. Conceptually, the startup has now graduated to a lower risk state and hence there is a switch in the class of investors based on risk-reward expectations. From here on it’s a stage of rapid growth which will lead to multiple rounds of VC/PE funding and fuel a rapid growth of functionalities, geographies, team sizes and even potential acquisition of competitors or synergistic companies in the entire ecosystem. This will go on until the company’s rapid growth path stabilizes to a more predictable growth path, which will ultimately result in the company launching a public offering (IPO) and an exit for all the remaining investors. All of this can broadly be summed by the following infographic: Unlike the traditional financial services business valuation methods described earlier, Fintech, like most startups, has specific approaches that are used for appraising investments. In scorecard valuations, you first start with estimating an average valuation for similar companies and then asses the target company to this based on a range of parameters. These weightings are applied judgmentally based on the investors’ assessment of relative importance (all of them add up to 100%), with the total rating quotient being applied to the average industry valuation for an indicative mark. A quick and easy method to value a startup, based on the expected revenue reaching at least $20 million. That being the case, the startup is evaluated based on five parameters: soundness of idea, founding team, having a product prototype, existing customers and existing sales volume (however small maybe). Based on the attractiveness of each of the above variables, a maximum valuation of $0.5m is applied to each, ensuring that the total pre-money valuation has a maximum cap of $ 2 million. This method approaches valuation from a much broader perspective and considers a selection of 12 parameters. Each of the parameters then rated on a 5 point scale (from +2 to -2), multiplied by a factor of $250,000 and then summed up to give the total indicative valuation. Like in the case of a mature business, if a startup being acquired has the technology or team setup that will take time and money to build, one can use replacement value, or cost-to-duplicate as a benchmark for valuing the company. While this is conceptually similar to the replacement cost method in case of mature companies, the difference here is that the focus is on the broad setup and technology team, rather than physical assets or production capacities. In this case, the investor typically works backward, by looking at the returns that he is expecting on his investment, based on the exit value estimation of an attractive startup. Let’s say if his return expectations are 15x and he expects the exit valuation of the startup to be $15m, then the present post-money valuation of the startup is calculated by: Exit valuation/Return Multiple = $15M/15x = $1M This would be the current post-money valuation of the company, so if $250,000 is being invested for 25% of the company, then the pre-money valuation of the company would come to $750,000. In addition, there are a few other methods which have been explained above but are primarily used in case of mature companies, I have listed them below for your convenience. We can see that at the early stage of the valuation of a fintech is more an ‘art form’ based on vision, market size, promise, dreams, and subjective judgment. As it progresses through its life, it then increasingly becomes more scientific and data based on market share, revenue and cash flows. Ultimately, it is the potential cash flow that determines the value of a startup, all the above methods can be taken as routes towards calculating this simple concept and the resultant ROI that the investment will generate. These methods are all various surrogates that basically try to calculate the cash generation capability of the business in the long term. I will continue to explore these concepts in a future article, by applying the above principles to value Transferwise, the UK based cross border money transfer company that has disrupted the cross border money transfer space.

Medium.com,Industry,Lunchclub’s Hayley Leibson shares the 6-step approach she used to raise a $4 million seed…,Venture Capital,https://medium.com/marketfit-rho/lunchclubs-hayley-leibson-shares-the-6-step-approach-she-used-to-raise-a-4-million-seed-dfc5c52056fe?source=topic_page---------8------------------1," If you’re a professional living in one of these eight cities — San Francisco, Los Angeles, New York, Boston, Austin, Seattle, London or Toronto — you’ve likely heard of Lunchclub, an AI powered networking platform that has attracted droves of users. Networking is an often frustrating and awkward experience: Cold Linkedin DM’s go unreturned, and casual conversations at industry events can be hard to turn into real connections. To change that, Lunchclub’s platform is built to facilitate one-on-one interaction. Users are matched based on their goals and professional aspirations, introduced over an email, and given a suggestion for a time and place to grab lunch. Hayley Leibson, co-founder and COO of Lunchclub, first discovered the platform in May 2018, while speaking on a panel at the UC Berkeley Haas School of Business. “Immediately after the panel, I signed up for Lunchclub with the goal of meeting other women entrepreneurs,” Leibson, who has a background as a founder, community builder and a product marketer, tells MarketFit @ Rho, the official blog of Rho Business Banking. “I tried the product and I couldn’t believe how well it worked,” she says. “Lunchclub had been making a profound impact on the lives of the people I met. They just couldn’t believe the results of connections being made. I met women that were able to get their first angel and VC checks through Lunchclub, people who had found a technical co-founder through Lunchclub.” Leibson soon met Vladimir Novakovski and Scott Wu, the creators of Lunchclub, and began working on the product with them at South Park Commons, the co-working space founded by Ruchi Sanghvi. Leibson officially joined as the third co-founder on January 1, 2019. By that time, Lunchclub’s growth was undeniable: “We were having incredible growth, as well as fantastic metrics around retention and the quality of matches being made; We receive feedback from people after every interaction. So all of our metrics — traction and growth — were great,” Leibson says. Lunchclub had raised a small amount of funding through friends, family, and South Park Commons, but the founders decided it was time to raise a seed round in the spring of 2019. The fundraising efforts by Novakovski, Wu and Leibson were a success: In September, Lunchclub closed a $4 million seed round led by Andreessen Horowitz. When approaching fundraising, Leibson adopted a simple mindset: Make a plan, and execute. In fact, she suggests all founders implement a systematic strategy when considering raising a seed round, and break the process down into six steps. 1. Evaluate your business
“The first step is deciding if raising money is right for you,” Leibson says. “Once you’ve raised capital there truly is no going back.” Devoting significant time to the question of whether or not venture capital is a good fit for your business is the first priority, she says. To do that, she recommends thinking through this question: “How big is your idea?” “You should really be putting this into perspective,” she says. “A great person who did this for me was Michael Seibel of Y Combinator. He laid it out in a way that I thought really makes sense.” “Basically, he said if your company ends up making a billion dollars after eight years, the VC partner that has been with you for those eight years until your company actually makes that billion dollars, really only gets $5 to $10 million. And that’s for eight years of work. That’s not an outcome they really want. These VCs want a $10 to $100 billion dollar outcome. So that’s the most important thing: Do you believe your business could have that kind of outcome?” The second question you should ask is, “Can you see yourself being 100 percent dedicated to this idea, and being obsessed with making your vision a reality for the next 10 years of your life?” Leibson says. “That’s just because starting a company is so extremely difficult.” Leibson quotes Linkedin founder Reid Hoffman with a laugh: “Starting a company is like jumping off a cliff and assembling a plane on the way down.” 2. Make three lists
If you decide that raising capital is right for you, the next step is to get in touch with the people in your network who could help. “How I did this, and how I would recommend other people do this, is to make three lists,” she says. “First, list people you currently know that you can turn to for advice and insight. These could be other founders, and usually founders have more founder friends. Second, make a list of dream investors. These could be dream angels or VCs you want to work with, and start heavily researching those people. Once you come up with that list, I would recommend you immediately start following and interacting with those people on Twitter. Third, make a list of the people who can introduce you to your dream list.” For introductions, look for founders in your dream investors’ portfolio, she advises: “Introductions from founders are the best way to get a call or a meeting with an angel or VC.” But if you don’t know anyone, don’t let it stop you. “I wouldn’t be discouraged if you don’t know anybody that can introduce you. If you can’t get a warm introduction, then definitely send cold outreach,” she says. “You’d be really surprised by how many people will respond, especially in Silicon Valley. Michael Seibel will respond to every email he receives from a founder.” 3. Hone your pitch
Next, you need to get your pitch in top-notch shape. “I would suggest meeting with a bunch of founders or VC’s that know you, but that you wouldn’t actually approach for money. Ask for their perspective, input, and advice on your pitch,” Leibson says. “And maybe these people can make introductions for you.” “Really ask for critical feedback, and then just keep practicing, and practicing, and practicing with these folks.” (If you’re curious about Lunchclub’s pitch, Leibson shared the deck her team used with Business Insider.) 4. Schedule the meetings “I recommend contacting everybody on your list who can make introductions for you, and then do the work for them. Write a blurb about who you are and the company you’re building, and ask for an introduction to be sent by a specific date and time,” Leibson says. You want to make it as easy as possible to pass on your information, she explains. “I receive a lot of inbound emails from founders that are like, ‘Hey, can you make this intro for me?’ But they don’t include more than that. Then I have to do a bunch of work to write a blurb about who they are, and their company. It makes people much more willing and excited to introduce you when you’ve done that work.” Remember to include a deadline, because founders are busy people, she adds. And, think about the timing when you’re arranging introductions. “I would highly recommend making sure all introductions go out at the same time and schedule all of your meetings within a short time period,” she says. “I recommend carving out a few weeks where you’re going to schedule all your meetings.” If investors ask for your deck during this process, Leibson suggests sending a redacted version. “The goal of every interaction, whether it be email or phone, is to get to that next step, the in-person meeting. That’s where you can really show your excitement for what you’re building, and get them excited to join,” she says. 5. Have the meetings and follow up
It’s time to shine. The fifth step is to have the meetings with potential investors, and follow up. “At this point you’ve practiced a million times, you’re solid,” Leibson says. “So you have the pitch meetings, and then if there is anything that comes out of those — if they want more information or data on certain things — you follow up super quickly and and try to get to that next step with them. Or, quickly find out if they’re not interested, and then move on to someone else.” 6. Close the deal
“If you’re lucky maybe you’ve gotten more than one term sheet from investors, or maybe one term sheet,” Leibson says. “Now it’s time to do due diligence, so calling founders who’ve worked with them before. I would say talk to two different types of people in their portfolio: People that have companies that failed or have had a really difficult time, and ask, ‘What was it like to work with those VCs or angels during that time?’ And also talking to people that had success, and see what that experience was like.” You’ll also need to do your homework, and research the details in the term sheet. Run it by fellow founders, friends, legal counsel, and company advisors to make sure you understand the full agreement. When it comes to choosing an investor, Leibson’s advice is to consider the nature of your business, and look for an investor with core competencies in that area. “I think it totally depends on your company and what you’re trying to build,” she says. For Lunchclub, the strategy worked. In addition to Andreessen Horowitz, Lunchclub investors include Quora’s co-founder, the Robinhood co-founders, and Flexport’s co-founders, according to TechCrunch. A last tip from Leibson? Women entrepreneurs should not be daunted by this process. “I hear this a lot from women, that they’re just so discouraged,” she says. While dismal statistics like this one — only 2 percent of venture capital went to women last year — are often touted in the media, “it seems very obvious and clear that women have more than two percent of good ideas,” she adds. “Ignoring and not focusing at all on those statistics” is Leibson’s №1 piece of advice for women fundraising. “Just be laser focused on what you’re building, and how that will make the world a better place.” Want more insights from Rho Business Banking?

Medium.com,Industry,Haitian Entrepreneur’s Tough Upbringing Is Driving The Investment Thesis Behind His New VC Fund,Venture Capital,https://medium.com/swlh/haitian-entrepreneurs-tough-upbringing-is-driving-the-investment-thesis-behind-his-new-vc-fund-ceb7067a1142?source=topic_page---------9------------------1," Daniel Rossignol is no stranger to adversity. He was born in Haiti, the poorest country in the Western Hemisphere. His mother died of childbirth and because he had older siblings, there wasn’t a lot of food to go around. At a young age, he found himself practically on his death bed due to malnourishment — his hair had turned red and he had been reduced to skin and bones. Luckily, a church took pity on him and literally pumped him full of peanut butter to return him to normal health, which is crucial for kids that hope to get adopted. A family in Central Maine eventually took him in, and while the worst might have been behind him, he still had a long way to go: There was growing up in the mostly white Central Maine, struggling to land an internship in venture capital after college, raising a family at a young age and overcoming the barriers that come with being a black man in the predominantly white Silicon Valley. Now, a successful serial entrepreneur with multiple exits, and on the cusp of launching his own micro fund called Octane Venture Labs, Rossignol is ready to invest in entrepreneurs who, like him, may have had the odds stacked against them. “There is this idea of being underestimated,” he told me during an interview. “We look for very underestimated people. It’s not a race thing; it's not a religion thing and it’s not a political view. Is it hard for you to get the capital that you think you need and do you think there are reasons for why it is hard? If I think those reasons are unjustifiable then I want to help you.” In college, Rossignol met a girl that he would eventually chase to Toronto. When the two married, he was left in the situation of starting a small family in his early 20s, and in desperate need of a job. He applied for a venture capital internship at Bright Spark Ventures. He didn’t get it. But no was not an option. Rossignol reached out to the managing partner and said, “Listen, I need this.” The company assigned him to one of their portfolio companies called iStopOver. You may have never heard of it, but it was one of Airbnb’s first competitors. After three months, Bright Spark offered Rossignol a job. But that would be too easy —no, the Dalhousie University alumni wanted to build something. He left Bright Spark and joined the IT startup Geminare early in its lifecycle. When the company recognized that there was a great opportunity for international expansion in Latin America, Rossignol raised his hand without hesitation and jumped on a plane. For the next few years, he worked in countries including Jamaica, Colombia, Costa Rica, and Honduras. Before he was 30, he had worked in six different countries. As the company was building momentum with channel partners on the West Coast, Rossignol and the CEO of Geminare decided it was time to move out to California, specifically Silicon Valley. The Valley is not exactly a welcoming place for a Haitian-American entrepreneur. There’s tons of data regarding the lack of diversity in the valley, but here are a few recent data points to illustrate: The data above was from studies conducted in 2018. So needless to say, when Rossignol was just getting started, the lack of diversity was even more evident than it is today. “When you are black and you are in tech you often times get bucketed into specific roles like as the sales guy or the customer service guy. Some if it is forced on you,” he said. “But when you come in and you are the tech guy or the head of product, that sounds weird. There are not a lot of exits for black entrepreneurs, which makes it hard to be a black founder because there is this pattern recognition the valley looks for. I don’t believe in it but it exists.” For instance, according to Rossignol, while venture capitalists say they are looking for startup founders that are willing to put it all on the line, he questions whether that is really true. “They want to see that you went to an ivy league school and that you come from a family where if this all fails you can go back and still eat and pay for your rent,” he said, adding that the trend is completely ridiculous when you consider all of the unicorns started by immigrants. “VC’s, whether they will tell you or not, are looking for that. They want to make sure there are some fail-safes.” Although it wasn’t easy when first starting out, Rossignol’s hard work and willingness to fail again and again would eventually pay dividends. He has worked at or served as an advisor for 15 different companies, according to his LinkedIn profile. Three of those, Rentlytics, iStopOver and AdsOnFeet, exited as a result of acquisitions. Rossignol knew that after Rentlytics was acquired by RealPage (NASDQ: RP), he was probably done working a traditional job for a while, so the question became, what’s next? Due to his previous exit at Rentlytics, Rossignol had many lucrative job opportunities he could have taken. But he wanted to spend more time with his family and also wanted to try something new. He could have pursued the traditional VC route, but again not his style. So, he decided to plunge into the difficult process or raising the first fund and giving back to the many entrepreneurs that are underestimated. The first thing he did was make his home base in Providence, Rhode Island. Providence is a growing startup hub, but if it sounds like a weird place to set up shop for a VC fund, that’s because it is. The city is home to only a handful of traditional VC funds and perhaps the greatest source of frustration among entrepreneurs in Providence is the lack of traditional funding outlets within their ecosystem, leaving many left to bootstrap. Rossignol does not deny that bootstrapping is becoming more effective but says it is still extremely difficult when you consider the cost of living in many startup hubs. Octane could raise up to $10 million by 2020. Initial commitments from limited partners are already coming out of Silicon Valley, San Diego, and Providence. The fund will be a technology first, sector agnostic venture firm. Rossignol’s goal is to figure out why there is a gap between great funding opportunities and actual funding. “When you see so much deal flow, that’s one thing, but when you see so much deal flow not getting the attention, that’s another thing,” he said. “I am trying to unpack why all the available talent is outweighing the available capital and it seemed to me it was just this underestimated reason.” Venture capitalists are leveling up. The traditional players are raising larger funds; there is more commitment to limited partners and the bigger funds are really trying to chase unicorns, making the rise of nano and micro VC funds more critical than ever before. Ultimately, Rossignol is sick of hearing that 90 percent of startups fail. He argues that the number is skewed because the ecosystem is ignoring a ton of entrepreneurs. Rossignol believes that if entrepreneurs had more access to capital, that ratio might go down to a 70/30 split. “I want entrepreneurs to understand that I’m in it with them for the long haul,” he said. “I get their pain; I get how hard it is and I want them to get value. That’s what Octane is all about.” Want more stories about venture capital and startups? Subscribe to my newsletter to get them all in your inbox."

aising early stage venture capital has never been easier and yet I watch so many entrepreneurs struggle . Less than 1% of startups ever raise a dime from institutional investors. The venture capital game is all about pattern matching and to be clear I’m not talking about patterns like race or gender. Ironically it is perhaps the best time in history be a non-traditional founder. Venture firms are under tremendous pressure from politicians, limited partners, and the media to fund startups led by people of color and/or women. Gen Z is the most diverse generation and should benefit greatly from this shift. The good news is that anyone, even white, male, cis-gender founders, with a great business can raise capital. Without making a judgement regarding pattern matching, to have a chance of raising capital you can’t really afford to be different. If you are, you really are doing it all wrong. It doesn’t have to be this way. Arthur Freed once said, “Don’t try to be different. Just be good. Good is different enough.” In the late nineties I began thinking about raising capital for a startup idea I had been working on for quite some time. My father was the CEO of an ATM switch startup in Silicon Valley that had just been acquired, giving him a front row seat to what would become known as the Dot-Com era. He encouraged me to get started, but he never told me how hard it was going to be. I began putting my startup idea on paper and eventually made my way to Silicon Valley to try my hand at raising venture capital. I had no idea what I was doing and as it turns out I was doing it all wrong. I bought a few books about raising venture capital, but thinking back on it, I’m pretty sure the people who wrote those books had never raised any money themselves. Blogging was just starting to be a thing, but very few VCs had blogs. I was learning as I went and it was painful and humiliating. I was turned down by almost a hundred VCs before I figured out what I needed to do to close a round. Here are a few of the lessons I learned along the way. Founders are generally iconoclasts and that trait can sometimes convince them that they’re always right. I suffer from this particular affliction so much that at one point in my career I sought help from a professional. In an effort to stop ‘being right’ I began taking detailed notes whenever I met with a venture capital firm. I’d document their questions, concerns, and suggestions in what is now a dusty library of Moleskine notebooks. After a complete review of my notes I could attest that my model didn’t survive a single meeting. VCs offer a lot of suggestions and as a result of the insights I received from each investor meeting I routinely transformed our business model. If you’re struggling to raise capital it is time to question everything. Interestingly, the changes I routinely made to my investment pitch and business model were designed to fit the patterns each venture capitalist revealed to me. Their questions, comments, and concerns provided a very clear roadmap to reach the ‘right’ answers to their various questions. It took me a long time to begin decrypting their directives, but once I did my meetings started to become a lot more productive. Today most successful venture capitalists maintain blogs and social media accounts that provide founders with very detailed explanations of the patterns they’re looking for. I would recommend creating a reading list and read their blogs every morning. Most will reveal how to get in their door and how to overcome several of their first few hurdles. Here are a few of the patterns I’ve been able to match over the years. First, selecting the right securities lawyer is a lot more important than you might assume. More than a few times investors asked me who my lawyer was and eventually I realized that there was a right answer. Most experienced investors don’t want to deal with a lawyer that isn’t experienced with early stage financings. That being said it is important to realize that most of the good startup lawyers also represent most of the good investors. Before engaging a lawyer I would recommend that you determine how many startup clients he has represented. I would ensure that the firm has done at least twelve financings in the last year. Get a few independent referrals from the startup community. You’d be surprised by the number of finanicings that fail as a result of poor representation. My advice once again is not to be different, hire the startup lawyer that everyone else is hiring. There are a million ways to set up your company and your first financing. Once again my advice is not to be different. Is your lawyer suggesting that you incorporate in Nevada? Organize as an LLC? Did they recommend raising money using a SAFE note? All of these decisions might be right for your startup, but they’re not what investors are looking for. The safe answer is to organize your company as a Delaware C-Corp and raise capital in either a convertible note or in a priced preferred stock round. Again, don’t be creative here as you want to look like everyone else. Next you should think about what your team looks like. Are you all business people? Marketing? Sales? Are you planning to outsource your software development? You better start looking for a few technical co-founders. Venture capitalists want at least half of the team to be technical and they don’t want you to outsource your development to China or India — they want you to own that part of your business. Finally, does your startup conform to a current investment theme? Venture capitalists have investment themes and those themes change regularly. If you are trying to raise money for a business using last year’s theme you’re going to struggle. I could go on and on revealing the patterns that investors are looking for, but you can do it yourself by reading their blogs.
