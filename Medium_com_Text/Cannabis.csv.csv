Medium.com,Life,There Is Almost No Evidence That Cannabis Will Improve Mental Health Conditions,Cannabis,https://medium.com/@jbrandonlowry/cannabis-and-mental-health-3724d0e352f4?source=topic_page---------0------------------1," Disorders of negative affect, such as depression and anxiety, are among the most common psychiatric illnesses in the United States. According to the Anxiety and Depression Association of America, 40 million adults are affected by anxiety disorders. Not surprisingly, anti-depressants are some of the most frequently prescribed medications in the US. While these drugs undoubtedly help many manage their conditions, they are not without side effects, and often lose efficacy over time, leading the depressed and anxious to turn to other sources of relief. Increasingly, this takes the form of medical marijuana. A 2016 survey revealed that 58% of medical cannabis consumers in Washington state did so for anxiety relief. Similar numbers were obtained for those seeking to ease their depression. In a separate survey, 12.7% of respondents said they were using cannabis in place of their prescription anti-depressants. Clearly, there is a demand for alternatives, and a belief that marijuana can help. Unfortunately, there is very little research to suggest that cannabis is effective for this purpose. In fact, there’s a troubling paucity of trustworthy clinical research on this subject, as demonstrated by a new study published in The Lancet Psychiatry. In this paper, the authors examine the evidence showing either a positive or negative effect of cannabis on six different mental disorders. What they found shows just how far we still have to go in investigating the potential of medical marijuana. Rather than perform new research on this subject, the authors of this paper used a technique called meta-analysis. The strength of any scientific finding comes from repeated measurements and replication by multiple research groups. The goal of a meta-analysis, then, is to synthesize every piece of research in an attempt to generate a consensus. However, this goes beyond simply reading a bunch of papers to see if the results are similar or not. Meta-analysis uses statistical methods to directly combine the results from each paper and treat them all as a single result. When done correctly, the conclusions drawn from meta-analyses are stronger than those from any single study alone. Citing the increasing popularity of cannabis use for mental disorders, the authors chose six conditions to focus on: Depression, Anxiety, ADHD, Tourette Syndrome, PTSD, and Psychosis. Then they scoured databases of scientific literature searching for any papers mentioning cannabis and any one of these conditions. From there, they filtered out their results based on pre-determined criteria, keeping only the most relevant pieces of evidence. In particular, they focused on Randomized Controlled Trials (RCTs), the so-called “gold standard” in medical research. Using their systematic approach, the authors were able to filter through thousands of research articles and narrow their focus to a much more manageable eighty-three. The final step in the process was to evaluate each of the remaining papers and grade the strength of the evidence. Under their scheme, an RCT is initially rated as “high quality”, and then downgraded to “moderate”, “low”, or “very low” as befit the situation. With all of their data collected and graded, they grouped the papers together based on the condition being studied and analyzed the results. Unfortunately, after all that work collecting, evaluating, and synthesizing the best available clinical research, they found very few positive results. I should point out that “positive” in this case only means “proof of effect”, and not that the results are “good”. For Depression, ADHD, and Tourette Syndrome, there was no evidence that cannabinoids had any effect whatsoever. However, the evidence for these conclusions were all rated either “low” or “very low” due to methodological flaws. The other results are summarized below: A combination of pharmaceutical grade THC and CBD was found to alleviate symptoms of anxiety better than a placebo. However, the size of effect was quite small, and the evidence is graded as “very low quality”. This is because none of the studies used for this analysis were examining anxiety directly. Rather, these were studies done on patients with chronic conditions that happened to keep track of anxiety symptoms. There was also a lot of inconsistency across studies, and some did such a poor job of reporting their results that they had to be thrown out of the analysis. There was slightly better evidence for studying CBD on its own. A pair of RCTs studied the effect of pharmaceutical grade CBD on those with social anxiety, and found that it had no effect when compared to placebo. The authors found only one RCT looking at the effect of cannabinoids on PTSD. While there was no evidence that THC-CBD could lessen the intensity of episodes or make them go away, it did show a reduction in nightmares and “improved global functioning”. Unfortunately, this evidence was graded “low” due to inconsistent, imprecise results. To understand these results, we first need a little context. The symptoms of psychosis are separated into two types, Positive and Negative. In this case, Positive refers to abnormal symptoms that occur as part of the disease. This includes hallucinations, delusions, and scattered thinking. Negative symptoms are normal behaviors that are absent due to disease, such as a lack of pleasure, reduced motivation, or reduced spontaneous speech. One RCT investigated the use of a combination of THC-CBD to treat psychosis. There was no change in the Positive symptoms (compared to placebo), but a significant worsening of the Negative symptoms. Further, the researchers found a strong negative effect on cognitive functioning after cannabinoid treatment. CBD on its own did not effect either the Positive or Negative symptoms, but it did significantly improve “global functioning”. The authors also looked at whether or not those taking cannabinoids were more likely to suffer from side effects. Taking THC led to significantly more side effects and to more people dropping out of studies than placebo. However, when compared to other active drugs, there was no measurable difference. Further, this evidence was graded “low to moderate”, as most of the participants in these studies did not have mental disorders. The biggest takeaway from all of this is just how little we know when it comes to using cannabinoids to treat mental health disorders. To quote the authors: “To our knowledge, this is the most comprehensive systematic review and meta-analysis examining the available evidence for medicinal cannabinoids in treating mental disorders and symptoms. There is a notable absence of high-quality evidence where mental disorders are the primary target of treatment[…]” To put it another way, there is almost no evidence that cannabinoids can treat mental health disorders. Now, this does not mean that cannabis can’t treat them. Absence of evidence is not evidence of absence. But given that so many are turning to cannabis and cannabinoids for mental health reasons, we need to understand this much better, and sooner rather than later. Highlighting this gap in our knowledge is important for several reasons. First, it’s possible that people are putting themselves at risk with little or no chance of reward. Every drug comes with side effects. Often these are negligible, or at the very least they are worth suffering in order to make the original issue go away. But in the case of cannabis and mental disorders, there’s evidence for negative side effects with little or no benefit. Further, cannabis can exacerbate certain conditions, as we saw with the patients with psychosis. This paper demonstrates how little we actually know, and might help sway some people to choose a different path. This lack of knowledge also impacts policy decisions. Without federal legalization, each state is left to choose which conditions qualify a patient for medical marijuana. As of now, 29 states allow doctors to authorize medical marijuana use for the treatment of PTSD, 8 for the treatment of Tourette, and only 1 for anxiety. Clearly, these decisions were not made based on the strength of the science. It’s impossible to know what harm, if any, will come as a result of these decisions… but that’s exactly my point. We are acting blindly on this issue. Finally, it arms people against dubious claims. Illegality leads to a lack of regulation. As it stands, there is very little oversight as to what claims can be made in advertising and selling marijuana. Therefore, it’s on the consumer to be educated and understand the risks and rewards before trying a new drug. By making it clear just how little we truly know, consumers can more effectively gauge the messages their receiving and make informed decisions."

Medium.com,Life,The Impact of Marijuana Legalization on Traffic Deaths: A Synthetic Control Approach,Cannabis,https://towardsdatascience.com/the-impact-of-marijuana-legalization-on-traffic-deaths-a-synthetic-control-approach-420a36c5e8eb?source=topic_page---------4------------------1," With the rise of marijuana legalization, there has also been rising questions regarding the potential impact on traffic deaths and collisions. Here, we will perform an analysis using Synthetic Control Method (SCM) to determine the impact marijuana legalization had on driving fatalities. So far, 11 states have voted to legalize recreational marijuana. Some of the states are still awaiting full legislation to be implemented or legalized too recently to collect adequate data on. With this in mind, we have several states that can be analyzed: For this analysis, we will be using the fatality rate used by the NHTSA: fatalities per 100 million miles driven. To start, we can see the rate of fatalities per 100 million miles traveled for all 4 states since legalization of marijuana was enacted. Fatality rates increased in three out of four states — the exception being Alaska. However, it is more difficult to identify if there is a causal relationship between these variables. To determine that will take a more rigorous analysis. For simplicity, I will only analyze Colorado and Washington (the first two states to legalize recreational marijuana). Both of these states legalized marijuana in early 2014 and provide us with the longest period to analyze. The method of establishing causality here is the Synthetic Control Method. Before we proceed any further, we should clear up some terminology that will be used. An “intervention” or “treatment” is the event to which we are studying the impact of (in this case, recreational marijuana legalization). A “treated group” refers to the group which underwent the intervention. For this analysis, it is the states of Colorado and Washington. Predictor variables are variables that are able to impact the dependent variable. From here, we are able to explain what a synthetic control is. A synthetic control can be used to analyze the impact of an intervention on a dependent variable (traffic fatality rates in this case). Since it is unlikely that we can find a state with very similar characteristics (predictors) to that of Colorado or Washington that also experienced similar pre-intervention fatality rate trends, we can instead take weights of many different states to form one that is artificially constructed to be similar. This is a synthetic control. To construct this, we will follow a simplified version of the process described in McClelland & Gault (2017). One example of this approach comes from Abadie, Diamond, and Hainmueller (2010), which produced the following synthetic control for analyzing tobacco sales in California: Using this approach, they were able to estimate how much California’s new law reduced tobacco sales. In the process, they popularized the SCM for use in future research. We will apply the same approach to estimate the impacts of marijuana legalization on the traffic fatality rate in our selected states. To conduct this analysis, I will be using the gsynth package for R. Identify Predictors of the Dependent Variable In attempting to keep this analysis manageable, I will attempt to compare Colorado and Washington to states that are demographically similar in a couple of ways. The first demographic of interest is age. Research has shown that risk of fatal crashes is fairly low and stable during the ages of 30–70. Risk increases with drivers below 30 and above the age of 70. Therefore, our variables must account for the fact that we are interested in the tails of the age distribution — using a median or average likely wouldn’t be appropriate because they are concerned more with the center. Therefore, our two age variables predictors will be: Due to the bins used from my data source, people 0–18 are grouped together. Therefore, I chose to ignore this age group. This bin was also imperfect, but is hopefully close enough to the 70+ range for which we have evidence that risks of fatal crashes increases. Our second demographic of interest is the male-to-female ratio of the population. Gender has been shown to have signification differences in traffic fatalities. Our variable for this is simple: Data for these variables is collected from the US Census Bureau from 2008 to 2017. Although there are many other relevant aspects of demographics that could be included, we will leave our model at this. Identify Possible Donor States to Synthesize the Control State At this stage, we must filter our pool of potential donor states. I exclude several states because they also legalized marijuana during the period we have data for. Alaska, Oregon, Massachusetts, and Nevada are removed as possible donor states because they also experienced marijuana legalization during at least part of the relevant period. Puerto Rico is also not included. Selecting Predictor Weights In selecting predictor weights, there are several potential choices. The first is to select weights subjectively. The second (and traditional) method is to choose the weights that minimize the Mean Percentage Squared Error (MPSE). The third option is to use cross-validation. In this analysis, we will use the cross-validation method (where the data is split into a training set and a validation set). However, results were very similar to using the traditional method. An advantage of the gsynth package is that it is able to handle multiple treated units. So in entering this function, I set both Colorado and Washington as treated units from 2014 to 2017 (the date of our most recent data). The other advantage is that with bootstrapped standard errors, we are able to obtain p-values for our results (which many SCM studies do not include). We can see raw fatality rate for all states in the sample below: The dark area represents the post-treatment period, with the red lines highlighting Colorado and Washington post-intervention. The function automatically selects the best model, which in our case has an MPSE of 0.19%. A plot of our results looks like this: In the pre-intervention period, we are able to see our synthetic state generally tracks our treated states (though ideally we would like to see a longer period pre-intervention to better validate our synthetic control). The dark region represents the period after the intervention (the legalization of marijuana). The plot shows an increase in the treated regions relative to our synthetic control, which is suggestive of an impact. We are also able to view this plot to show the gaps between the synthetic and treated regions. The year marking zero on the x-axis is the intervention year. The zero on the y-axis represents when our treated group and synthetic control are exactly aligned. The shaded area represents a 95% confidence region. The plot shows the an increase in the fatality rate of our treated group relative to our synthetic control. However, this model yields an estimated p-value of 0.274 — which would not pass statistical significance tests used in academic studies (generally 0.05 or lower). This analysis provides weak evidence that early states which legalized recreational marijuana saw an increase in traffic fatality rates that could be attributed to marijuana. However, these results aren’t strong enough to conclude marijuana had any impact on fatality rates. Additionally, significant limitations in this analysis could also limit the reliability of the conclusions (see the Limitations section below). Indeed, past literature on the subject has been mixed. Two papers (here and here) use control states and the synthetic control method respectively, but arrive at somewhat different conclusions (that marijuana was not responsible for the increase). An IIHS study estimated marijuana legalization increased car crashes by 6% (though this study simply compared legalized states to neighboring states, and it measured car crashes as opposed to fatalities). Given the conflicting results, it’s likely best to leave conclusions as ambiguous until more evidence can be collected. While some evidence points to increases in fatalities, proving causation has been more difficult. The approach used here was in many ways limited. Further analysis could include other states that have enacted marijuana legalization to increase the sample size. Additionally, you could further attempt to validate these results by conducting a placebo test (though the validity of this method has been questioned by some papers in recent years). I chose to forgo this step since our model returns a p-value instead. Another limitation is the method by which I constructed my synthetic control. I used basic demographic variables; however, more rigorous papers have used road characteristics, alcohol or drug usage, various economic indicators, among other variables. At least one paper narrowed down fatalities to those specifically linked to marijuana. This likely means this analysis — as much more simplistic — is less reliable in its conclusions. Lastly, a sensitivity analysis could also be performed to ensure the robustness of results."

This is visible in North America more than anywhere else, where more and more states are legalising both medical and recreational cannabis, but also in Europe, with a sizeable population with a real need for medical cannabis. In both regions, we are seeing exploding interest in CBD products, also derived from the cannabis plant. A new industry like this represents an economic opportunity that is unheard of. Best of all, cannabis doesn’t care about geography or professional background. Businesses can be successful in any location. They can also be led by and employ people with different sets of skills. It’s not only a new market, but also an important source of jobs that could help reintegrate into the labour market those that lost out to outsourced manufacturing. A massive opportunity for jobs and entrepreneurship It’s hard to get accurate figures about the impact of the cannabis industry on jobs. Governments are not officially collecting statistics, as the legal status of the plant and of the industry are still not completely figured out. But some private actors have provided insight and, so far, it’s clear the potential is massive. In the US alone, it is believed that by early 2019 there were 211,000 people employed by the cannabis industry. An additional 40,000 are expected to be added by 2020, according to New Frontier Data, a market research firm for the cannabis industry. Recruitment platform ZipRecruiter reports that, in 2017, job postings for the cannabis industry had increased by 445%, by far surpassing other growing areas like tech (254%) and healthcare (70%). These numbers are impressive, but they could be overshadowed in only a few years. Market research firm Nielsen forecasts the industry to grow by a multiple of five between 2018 and 2025. Over to our side of the pond, Brightfield Group estimates the CBD market in Europe will grow to four times its size between 2018 and 2023. Local and open Cannabis has the potential to create a large number of jobs that can be taken up by those who have traditionally been the losers in the current labour market. Cannabis is creating demand for new jobs requiring a range of skills. This new labour is also relatively easy to get into coming from other industries, regardless of personal or professional background. There is an enormous opportunity here for both the public and private sector. But they need to be proactive. Governments have the chance to, with the proper incentives, create high quality, green jobs in areas where the outsourcing of labour hit hardest. Entrepreneurs also have the chance to become involved in a growing, meaningful industry. The challenges to opening up a cannabis business are not monumental. The industry is open and welcoming. Despite the complex science behind it, cannabis is a botanical product, and requires little processing to turn into oils, edibles and others. Cannabis can be grown pretty much anywhere and the cannabis plant does not require many resources to grow. The industry, although already sizeable, is still at its infancy. There are no huge companies yet to have created an unsurpassable moat. No one has a monopoly on the market nor access to critical knowledge that gives them any unfair advantage. Even in British Columbia, California or Colorado, some of the ‘meccas of cannabis’, where I have spent much of my time in the last few years, the lack of proper regulation and knowledge in this industry leaves plenty of room in the market for hard-working people with good ethics. There is room to compete! This lack of widespread knowledge and transparent, robust regulations, although not ideal, can be an opportunity for those willing to plan in a smart way and put in the hard work. Good research and an entrepreneurial spirit will be definitely needed to start a company in cannabis. Government bureaucracies often themselves don’t understand how to deal with cannabis. It is then the business owners and leaders that have to, based on their knowledge of existing laws, tell them how things are. Navigating these challenges will be a deterrent for many, which makes cannabis great for those who do have the extra motivation and work ethic to enter the market. Truly meaningful jobs The best thing about the cannabis industry is that it’s not just for profit. It’s also not a simple assembly-line job that has people doing monotonous tasks simply for the profit of a company, as most manufacturing jobs are. It’s a natural, ecological product that benefits people, many of them with health issues. We’ve received amazing feedback on the therapeutic effects of CBD — something that has made an impression on us on a human level. It’s something that motivates us to continue doing great work for our clients. The nature of the cannabis industry will force anyone starting a business to reflect on the good they are helping to bring about, it’s inevitable. And that can be a driving force for new cannabis entrepreneurs. Cannabis provides real benefits to people that need this natural product. Its uses go beyond wellness too. Hemp can be used for a wide variety of things, and is known for being a much more sustainable product than its alternatives in the textile or construction industries. Cannabis jobs will not create pollution and will be more sustainable and green. In other words, getting involvement in the cannabis industry has a good chance to have a positive environmental impact. Cannabis is inclusive of all people. It has the unique potential, as a new industry, and right from the start, recruit from any demographics, class, religion or gender. We need to fill many positions requiring different skills. Final thoughts As always, a lot will depend on the ability of authorities to produce clear legal frameworks. Until then, this creates an added incentive for entrepreneurs who want to be early in the market. It’s obvious there is appetite from consumers. Beyond just caring about tax revenues, governments should also consider the benefits the cannabis industry can bring to depressed, former manufacturing regions, and the opportunities it presents to segments of the population that have been disadvantaged in the labour market. With guidance and incentives, the cannabis industry could provide a green alternative towards a more inclusive, sustainable and meaningful growth."
Medium.com,Life,Medical Cannabis,Cannabis,https://medium.com/@lukewiese/medical-cannabis-fc4ab43f44bb?source=topic_page---------10------------------1," Oftentimes with issues like medical marijuana, people don’t think about it’s meaning until they’re affected (and have to use it themselves) in some way. People who never even naturally cared about the issue of legalizing cannabis for medical purposes are beginning to now as the cannabis issue is brought to the front and center of political conversations repeatedly as we head into another American election year. As more and more people learn about the benefits of medical marijuana, and then actually decide to care enough to vote yes, legalization has swept the country. The legalization of marijuana isn’t a new concept. Using cannabis for its’ medical benefits dates back as far as 4000 BCE, when it was considered an important antidepressant and sedative. To say that the idea of using cannabis in a medical environment is far fetched would be a bold assumption. Patients in more than half of states in the US are granted the ability and option to receive government approved THC oils to combat various physical symptoms and ailments. Anything from lack of appetite to discomfort and pain are easily treated with cannabis, and if the patient’s desire is to stay off prescription pills, medical cannabis is an easy way to accomplish that. As opiate addiction continues to be a major problem in America, the use of cannabis has become a reasonable and popular alternative, and in states that medical marijuana been implemented, opiate overdose rates have decreased. (Here’s one of many articles where this is evidenced)."
Medium.com,Life,Can Eating Cannabis Edibles Make You Lazy?,Cannabis,https://medium.com/the-soul-tribe/can-eating-cannabis-edibles-make-you-a-lazy-person-cb0da3dd740?source=topic_page---------11------------------1," There are those days when you just don’t feel like doing anything — except lie on the couch and binge-watch on Netflix. Well, that’s not necessarily a bad thing. Laziness is okay unless it becomes persistent. The chronic lack of motivation for any physical activity can be the result of many mental and physiological conditions: from just plain exhaustion to the mutation of SLC35D3 or the “couch potato gene.” While your propensity to sit and yawn all day may not always be your fault, a recent study on mice suggests another surprising reason: Eating cannabis-infused edibles. This is not the first time laziness has been attributed to the consumption of food. Aside from weight gain, studies have also shown that eating highly processed food, and a diet high on sugar can cause lack of motivation or diet-induced laziness. Unhealthy food choices cause not only obesity and a slew of other physical and mental conditions, but also kill productivity. In a separate study, chronic marijuana users have been found to have low dopamine levels. The neurotransmitter dopamine plays a vital role in motivation and reward, which helps people to “get up and go.” Long-term stoners, especially those who started smoking at a young age, were found to produce less dopamine — thus, causing lethargy and a low drive to pursue interests. Studies on the effects of cannabis and poor diet on motivation give us clues on the behavioral and physiological effects of edibles. Cannabis edibles are various food preparations infused with marijuana. Simply called an edible, such food products contain cannabinoids, primarily THC (tetrahydrocannabinol). Edibles are becoming a popular way to consume the drug as it is more discreet compared to smoking, and also much easier to procure. Common food products include “space cakes” — cookies, brownies, pastries, and any baked goods prepared with cannabis butter. Candies, chocolates, and gummy bears are also popular. Cannabis-infused drinks are usually referred to as a “liquid edible” or “drinkable.” Edibles are popular in countries and US states that have legalized marijuana, or permit its medical use. While the effects of smoking marijuana are felt within minutes, edibles can take up to three hours. It takes longer because the food needs to be digested and processed by the liver before making its way into the bloodstream. The amount of THC present in edibles is difficult to measure, often inaccurate or unknown. It is possible to consume a large amount of the drug since it takes a longer time for the user to feel its effects — often thinking that the drug is not working. The symptoms of marijuana overdose due to dangerous levels of THC in the blood include extreme anxiety, panic attacks, high blood pressure, chest pain, and seizures. Researchers from Indiana University turned to mice for answers due to the ethical barriers of conducting THC studies on human subjects. During the study, the researchers offered THC-infused dough to male and female mice. The idea was to simulate human consumption by allowing the mice to consume the “space dough” voluntarily, the same way humans would take the drug. The space dough was made from the usual ingredients of a commercial edible: flour, sugar, salt, and THC. What the researchers found: The mice have become less active — there was a decrease in body temperature and locomotor activity in both sexes. But, the effects were more pronounced in male mice. Cannabis edibles still pose health risks from adverse reactions due to potential overdose. More research is required to study the long-term health consequences of edibles, especially on the way people think and behave. For now, the results are in: cannabis-infused products have the potential to reduce physical activity, with marked effects in males. While the research was conducted on mice, future investigations on human subjects would hopefully provide better clarity and insights."
Medium.com,Life,Hemp Bathing,Cannabis,https://medium.com/@nataliebehring/hemp-bathing-1050f9bee41?source=topic_page---------12------------------1," A black SUV carrying a car full of middle aged opioid addicts pulled into a 40 acre, wind swept hemp farm in Delta, Utah. Four men tumbled out of the car like puppies at the dog park. With unbridled joy they proceeded to prance from plant to plant gently cradling the buds in their hands to sniff, taking selfies, giggling without a care in the world. The Japanese have a word, “Shinrin-yoku”, which has been translated popularly as “forest bathing, ” or spending time in the forest in a mindful way as a benefit to one’s body and mind. The spectacle of these grown men skipping amongst rows of ripe hemp could easily be called ”hemp-bathing”. The men came to the farm to help with the harvest. 2019 is the first year hemp has been legal to farm here, this was the first crop ever. The farmer was in need of workers. Shane Ericksen, the founder of the Men’s Tribal House, a home in Salt Lake City for men in recovery where CBD and medical marijuana are used to combat drug addictions saw an opportunity. The CBD slated to be extracted from the hemp was contracted to be used in a medicinal lotion he produces. So, he organized some of the men in the house to assist with the harvest. Utah is the number one state for Opioid deaths, an estimated six people perish from prescription overdoses every week. In a response to this as well as his own experiences, Ericksen founded a recovery home and recently acquired a house that used to belong to a massive polygamist family. The many bedrooms, bathrooms, 4 kitchens, multiple dining rooms make it ideal to house a large number of people. Some of the men living in the home take CBD as well a medical THC to get their lives back on track. In Utah, that means getting a letter from a medical professional. Dr Angela Loving, who works with addicts recommends THC when patients are hesitant to use suboxone or sublocade, which are also technically addictive. Loving attributes the success of THC “Its the head-change that they are looking for, the high without being on the hard stuff,” adding “It seems to me that most substance abuse clients often are trying to self medicate for something: pain, anxiety, depression, bipolar, whatever it may be. The great thing about THC is that is helps with those diagnoses but also provides them with a reason not to use other substances.” Ericksen started using cannabis to combat an opioid addiction five years ago. He says he immediately noticed a difference with other methods. “It helped me get over the withdrawal symptoms much quicker than any other time I had quit opiates before. Then I started to notice that with daily cannabis use I didn’t have the cravings. I got off pain pills all together and it was such a great part of my routine. But for years I thought I was just crazy, I was doing it in secret, I was a little bit ashamed of it.” In November. 2018, The Utah Medical Cannabis Act was passed, making medical use less shameful as well as legal. Additionally, the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints, which boasts many members in Utah has come out supporting the medical use of cannabis. In an official statement the church revealed, “We respect the wise counsel of the medical doctors of Utah. The public interest is best served when all new drugs designed to relieve suffering and illness and the procedures by which they are made available to the public undergo the scrutiny of medical scientists and official approval bodies.” At group meetings in the house, Ericksen says they discuss the virtues of cannabis use in meetings and agree that it has a remarkable power. He says, “On those days when life if just too fricken’ much, you’re going to relapse, you reach for the cannabis, and that moment, the moment you use the medical marijuana, the last thing you want to do is go get high. You don’t want to go find meth or crack. You don’t want to go drink. You don’t want to isolate. You want to become part of the group. You want you assimilate. You want to come home. You want to sleep in your own bed.” Perched in a rickety old folding chair, David Turpin, 61, sat methodically turning and trimming freshly harvested buds with a pair of gummed up garden shears. A chorus of snips punctuated the the dusty barn air while a thin version of Spirit in the Sky played from a tinny bluetooth speaker. Turpin has been at the House for for three months and says he has successfully been using cannabis to suppress addictions to other drugs. When he was 37, he underwent a quadruple bypass and subsequently became addicted to pain pills. His doctor prescribed Lortab 10 which contains the opiate hydrocodone, of which he took 8 tablets a day, for 20 years. At 57 another doctor slashed his prescription to 60 pills a month. He says he had the choice of turning to heroin or meth to navigate the pain. He picked meth. Today, he’s on a daily regimen of 500mg full spectrum CBD as well as lotion made by Erickson. Back pain has been a chronic problem for Turpin, acquired from a long career in construction, lifting heavy loads, that began when he was just 15. “I swear to it, hell yeah, anybody that’s older and has doctors like I used to have, putting me on different pills all the time, so many…” his voice trailed off as he grabbed a heavy branch from little green pile of weed. Ericksen says the harvest was therapeutic for the Tribal House men, “They all felt like they were giving back, helping to spread good medicine, to help other people in recovery. They had good associations and felt like their work was important and valuable.” Some of men set up a tent amongst the rows of hemp and Charlie Wall, set a sleeping bag down in between two bushy ripe plants, their boughs heavy with juicy colas where he slept under the stars."
Medium.com,Life,Evolution of the endocannabinoid system,Cannabis,https://medium.com/@wayne.haythorn/evolution-of-the-endocannabinoid-system-bdecff1d9826?source=topic_page---------13------------------1," How can medical marijuana work for so many different conditions? Marijuana activates a mechanism in us called the endocannabinoid system, first described in 2011 by scientists from Hebrew University. They wrote: ”Changes in endocannabinoid levels and/or CB2 receptor expressions have been reported in almost all diseases affecting humans, ranging from cardiovascular, gastrointestinal, liver, kidney, neurodegenerative, psychiatric, bone, skin, autoimmune, lung disorders to pain and cancer” They went on to say: “modulating CB2 receptor activity holds tremendous therapeutic potential in these pathologies.” Marijuana is being used to treat an astonishing variety of problems, from acne to cancer. While political interference has prevented clinical trials, a mountain of evidence shows the promise of cannabis medicine. For traumatic brain injury, hospital records show that the mortality rate dropped by 80%, if the patient had THC metabolites in their blood. A similar reduction in mortality was found for pancreatitis: ”The [cannabis exposed] group had significantly lower inpatient mortality compared with the non-cannabis group (odds ratio 0.17, 95% confidence interval, 0.06–0.53). The cannabis exposed patients also had less kidney injury, less cardiovascular shock, fewer incidents of acute respiratory distress, less gut paralysis, less need for tube feeding, shorter length of stay and lower inflation adjusted charges. So the kidneys, heart, lungs, gut, and stomach all did better, if the patient tested positive for marijuana. How is this possible? How can one group of medicines help with problems as diverse as brain injury and pancreatitis, let alone “almost all diseases affecting humans”? The answer that Pacher and Mechoulam gave is that cannabis activates a body-wide protective system. Although plant cannabinoids are not chemically related to the body’s own, endogenous cannabinoids, they twist themselves into similar shapes, so they can imitate our animal “endocannabinoids” for receptor transmission purposes. Endocannabinoids are an ancient chemistry that evolved in nerve cells as part of the response to certain kinds of stress. This protective response had its power extended twice, with the CB1 and CB2 receptors. So this is a simple story of three steps — the cell chemistry, then CB1, and CB2. Of course, step 1 — cell chemistry — represents maybe 300 million years of evolution. Actually, it’s not a step at all, it’s just our earliest hazy snapshot, from 555 million years ago. That’s the age of the oldest fossil that’s clearly bilateral like us — clearly not round like a jellyfish. The endocannabinoid system was well developed by that time. The way we think about this system is somewhat backward, because its parts were discovered in the opposite order to how they evolved. The plant chemicals were discovered first. They led us to the receptors they bind to, which led to the body’s own signaling chemicals. So “cannabinoids” are defined as any chemicals that activate the CB1 and CB2 receptors. But our animal cannabinoids do a lot more than that, and their other functions are much older. The endocannabinoids were important players in cell chemistry long before CB1 and CB2 evolved. We share this cell-level use of cannabinoids with the jellyfish. Jellyfish have nerves, with synapses like ours. Their nerves use cannabinoids like ours, but they don’t have CB1 and CB2 receptors. So by looking at what we have in common with them, we can see the oldest parts of our endocannabinoid system. This base layer is mostly intracellular. Endocannabinoids were used within nerves to manage their problems with oxidation and inflammation. Nerves have big problems with both of these. Oxidative damage is a special issue for nerves, for two reasons. First, they run hot. The brain is 2% of the body by weight but uses 20% of its energy. As if that wasn’t enough, the main excitatory neurotransmitter, glutamate, interferes with oxidation management. Glutamate is a signal that can kill the receiver. Inflammation is the second problem. It causes nerves to send a false signal, so we get phantom pain. Even worse, inflammation leads to cell death, and the nervous system is so interconnected that if a few nerves in your neck get pinched and inflamed, you can lose the use of your arm. In evolutionary terms, that makes you meat for the crows. Other cells can just die but nerves have to be protected. Endocannabinoids are produced in response to both inflammation and oxidative stress. The chemical reaction that creates them is triggered when calcium levels rise, and both inflammation and oxidative stress cause calcium to rise. If calcium gets too high, mitochondria will kill the cell. Endocannabinoids have direct chemical effects and they act as a broadcast signal, that says “if calcium doesn’t come down, we’re all dead”. As chemicals, endocannabinoids compete for a precursor with prostaglandins, the main drivers of inflammation. They can be converted to prostaglandins to increase inflammation.They inhibit production of inflammatory hitmen like TNF-alpha and interfere with production of amyloid-beta. As intracellular signals, they stabilize mitochondria, protect against oxidation, close calcium channels, and manage ion channels involved in things like sensing heat, pain, and nausea. We inherit all this from the common ancestor of jellyfish and kings. In the years since our ancestral line diverged from the cnidarians, the signaling function has steadily expanded. For example, vertebrates have PPAR receptors, located around the cell nucleus. They manage genes involved in things like reproduction, metabolism, and programmed cell death. After a brain injury, cannabinoids can cause the growth of new nerves by stimulating PPAR receptors. These ancient and more modern intracellular effects explain why a lot of cannabis medicine does not rely on CB1 and CB2 (acne , arthritis, …). The activist Debbie Wilson calls this the “cellular healing layer”. CB1 evolved just before the first vertebrate, and appears in all vertebrates that have been tested. CB1 is a very powerful receptor that can affect nerves and their health in many ways. More importantly, it changes the structure of the nervous system. CB1 recognizes cannabinoids outside the cell, so when a cell produces cannabinoids, its neighbors can notice and respond. This allows a cooperative response to the stresses that cause cannabinoid release. In particular, when a vertebrate nerve gets too many glutamate messages, it produces cannabinoids. These are recognized by CB1 receptors upstream, on the nerves that are sending the glutamate, and they become less active. CB1 can also inhibit the release of all the other neurotransmitters — serotonin, dopamine, acetylcholine and the rest. In this prototypical case, CB1 signaling and glutamate signaling go in opposite directions — cannabinoids are “retrograde transmitters”. The mathematics of neural networks tells us that this kind of feedback is necessary for effective learning in a neural net. With CB1, individual nerves can reconfigure the neural net to protect themselves, which allows for a larger and more flexible nervous system. A case can be made that CB1 has been critical for the development of the brain itself. Insects and jellyfish don’t have CB1 receptors. Their nerves are quite similar to ours, in fact, cannabinoids are the only neurotransmitters that we have and insects don’t. Over hundreds of millions of years, no bug or jellyfish or worm has evolved anything close to the vertebrate brain. Only one invertebrate, the octopus, has anything comparable. The large nervous system belongs almost exclusively to the animals that have CB1. There were many genetic advances in the early days of vertebrate evolution. CB1 is not the only thing going on, but CB1 plays a critical role. It is the primary brake on runaway glutamate signaling. If you have brakes you can drive a bigger truck. Each animal has a gene that codes for its version of CB1. Shortly before our ancestors crawled onto land, a “gene duplication event” occurred, and a fish was born with an extra copy, CB2. Variations of CB2 are found in some fish and all of the four-limbed land animals. While CB1 can only express itself on nerves and a few related cell types, CB2 receptors are found throughout the body. Their role in the immune system is particularly important. In general, when CB2 receptors on immune cells are stimulated, the cell slows down and reduces inflammatory signaling. CB2 puts a brake on runaway immune process, similar to what CB1 does for the nervous system. CB2 receptors take on different functions in other parts of the body. They have different effects in different tissues, but their behavior is consistent because the signals — the endocannabinoids— are produced in response to inflammation or oxidative stress. The receptor’s job then, is to mobilize an appropriate response to stress in a neighbor. So in the bones, stimulating CB2 causes the bone to grow stronger, but in a tumor, stimulating CB2 can trigger programmed cell death. Growth and death are very different effects. What they have in common is they are both appropriate responses to stress among neighboring cells. Given this history, the broad reach of cannabis medicine should not be a surprise. The endocannabinoid system has been involved in cell protection for 600 to 800 million years. Everything about you that is different from a sponge evolved with endocannabinoids doing inflammation and oxidation control.
With CB1 and CB2, the endocannabinoids became a channel for communication between cells. This system has developed so that by now it manages communication between brain regions, tissues and whole organs. At human conception, when the sperm meets the egg, the new cell immediately releases cannabinoids, deactivating other sperm and helping prevent multiple fertilization. Additional cannabinoid signaling negotiates the gamete’s journey to the uterus and implantation on the uterine wall. When you were a single cell, you relied on cannabinoid signaling to navigate your world."
Medium.com,Life,Is Canada New Legal Framework Regulating Cannabis Use Too Restrictive? Some Expert Think So.,Cannabis,https://medium.com/@strategicoutlook/is-canada-new-legal-framework-regulating-cannabis-use-too-restrictive-some-expert-think-so-bb2062a1e6a0?source=topic_page---------14------------------1," The legalization of cannabis in Canada is seen as one of the most progressive public policies in Canadian history. The move has been celebrated as a means of promoting public health, reducing crime, and “bringing a multi-billion-dollar industry from the black market into the legal one”. Canada became the second country to legalize the recreational use of cannabis behind Uruguay. Since legalization, the federal government has promised to adopt a ‘strict’ public health-focused model of production, and sale that emphasizes minimizing harm. Such as the risks of contamination or unknown potency associated with drugs sold in the illicit markets. The government also wants to ensure criminals groups are not profiting from cannabis legalization and reduce the burden on the criminal justice system. The Cannabis Act, also known as Bill- C46, is the federal legislation regulating the cannabis industry. Some experts such as civil liberties groups, scholars, criminal and constitutional lawyers have express concerns about how restrictive the new legislation is. Abby Deshman of the Canadian Civil Liberties Association (CCLA) says, “we’re legalizing the industry, but criminalizing a lot of the aspects around the use of cannabis,”. In Ontario for example, only cannabis purchased from the official recognize cannabis store is considered legal. Anyone caught in possession of cannabis not purchased from the Ontario Cannabis Store (OCS) is considered legal and could potentially face a fine or a criminal charge. Some legal experts believe too much attention and discussions are around legalization, but the focus should be on the impact the policies are going to have on certain communities. Speaking to some of Toronto’s top criminal lawyers for this article, they point to the fact that the government rushed to put the legislation together. The fact is you have a patchwork of provincial, territorial, and municipal laws and by-laws that interact with the federal criminal laws, which make it difficult for the average Canadian to understand what everything means. Under the Cannabis Act, each province and territory is responsible for setting its own rules for how cannabis can be sold, where stores can be located, and how stores must be operated. Provinces and territories may also set additional restrictions they feel are necessary. For instance, the federal legislation sets the age limit for purchasing cannabis at 18, however in Ontario, the age limit is 19, In Quebec and Alberta, it is 18. As I noted above, one of the key reasons the government chose to legalize cannabis was that the old legal framework was not serving its intended policy objective. At the time of legalization, the government said, “the old approach to cannabis did not work. It let criminals and organized crime profit while failing to keep cannabis out of the hands of Canadian youth. In many cases, it has been easier for our kids to buy cannabis than cigarettes”. However, Michael Smith a constitutional lawyer and sociologist professor, from the University of Toronto, believes the new legal framework might be counterproductive to the government objectives. Legalization has also raised questions about what to do with Canadians with criminal records for minor possession. It is estimated, more than 250,000 Canadian have a criminal record related to minor cannabis infractions. Several experts have expressed their concerns with the lack of action taking by the federal government to expunge individuals’ records. Akwasi Owusu-Bempah, a professor at the University of Toronto says “Canadian celebrating cannabis legalization should be cautioned, “unless both the federal regulations and various provincial legislation provide avenues for inclusion and a means of repairing the harms caused by Canada’s war on drugs. We need to make sure that everyone has the opportunity to participate in this growing economy, while also working to improve the lives of people criminalized for activities that will no longer be illegal”. Canadians convicted for simple possession, face difficulties finding work, traveling, and difficulties during vulnerable sector searches if they want to work with children or vulnerable adults. While former cops who advocated for harsh sentences for minor possession of cannabis are cashing in on legalization, such as former Toronto police chief Julian Fantino. Fantino was fiercely opposed to cannabis legalization and once said “legalizing cannabis is like legalizing murder”. He is now the Chief Executive for Aleafia, a Concord Ontario-based company that produces cannabis. The government has proposed Bill-C-93, which will amend the Criminal Records Act, and allow anyone convicted of less than 30 grams of cannabis to file a formal application to get a pardon. However, this is a long and tedious process explained by Annamaria Enenajor, a Toronto-based lawyer directing the national Cannabis Amnesty campaign. She says “automatically expunging the records for those convicted of low-level cannabis crimes is a far better policy than putting the onus on the person to apply for such relief. Legal experts say the government has taking the right steps forward but there’s still a long way to go. Jack Lloyd, a Toronto-based lawyer specializing in these cases, offered his analysis, “Out of the 250,000 Canadian convicted for minor cannabis infraction, 80,000 are eligible for this pardon program. That is great. Any day the government says we are going to remove the stigma from 80,000 victims of the drug war, that is a great day. But they could be doing a lot more to help communities that have been impacted negatively, especially if they have now admitted that simple possession was a wrong-headed law, to begin with”. So Far only 44 pardons have been granted out of a total of 71 people who have applied. The process is very cumbersome and bureaucratic, says Toronto lawyer Caryma Sa’d. Another area of concern is the type of power the Cannabis Act gives to police officers. As it stands, the Act gives any police officer with reasonable probable grounds who believes there is cannabis illegally in a vehicle to — without a search warrant and at any time — search the entire vehicle and any person found in the vehicle. The overhaul of the Criminal Code also saw the government introduced new impaired driving laws related to cannabis use. Under Canada’s new drug-impaired driving laws, drivers are prohibited from having blood THC levels of two and five nanograms per milliliter. If drivers are found, they are liable for a fine of up to $1,000, while drivers with over five nanograms face a minimum $1,000 fine and up to 10 years in prison for a first offence. However, a new study from the University of British Columbia (UBC) says the new law on cannabis-impaired driving penalties may be too strict. Researchers found no link between low levels of THC, the psychoactive chemical in pot, and car crashes”. Lead investigator for the research Dr. Jeffrey Brubacher says, “THC does not appear to be associated with an increased risk of crashing”. Criminal defense and constitutional lawyers are also concern about the new legislation. A group of prominent criminal defence lawyers have brought the matter to the attention of the federal government, by signing a letter asking the government to remove parts of the proposed regulation in bill C-46 that would make it a criminal offence for people found to have more than two nanograms of THC in a milliliter of their blood within two hours of driving. Lawyers say the proposal would disproportionately affect people who consume the drug for medical purposes and is contrary to s. 7 of the Charter. Caryma Sa’d, one of the letter’s signatory’s say’s there are a lot of flaws in the legislation,” I wouldn’t be surprised to see constitutional challenges.” The legalization of cannabis has brought excitement to many Canadians around the country, however, questions remain"

When examining a terpene profile at a dispensary, here are five good ones to track. Even those with a casual understanding of cannabis these days know indica vs. sativa. Less casual is the knowledge that it’s the presence of myrcene that determines exactly which category a plant will fall under — anything over .5 % myrcene is considered an indica. Myrcene can also be found in wild thyme, mangoes, lemongrass, cardamom, and hops and thus has a musky, earthy scent. Myrcene has a boiling point between 331 to 334 °F, so even people who vaporize their bud at lower temperatures should be able to consistently feel the relaxing, sedating effects. β Caryophyllene is the only terpene known to interact with the body’s endocannabinoid system as if it was a cannabinoid using the CB2 receptor. It also vaporizes at low temperature of 245 °F, which will give most users access to the anti-inflammatory effects associated with this terpene. It’s also highly associated with anti-anxiety effects of cannabis, so it’s a great one to check for if that’s what you’re looking to cannabis to help manage. Its presence can bring a peppery smell to cannabis, as this terpene can also be found in cloves, cinnamon, and pepper. This terpene is found quite abundantly in pine. It also vaporizes at a low temperature of 314°F and it’s widely associated with the bronchodilation effects of cannabis. It can also act as a stimulant and an AChE inhibitor. It’s also found in rosemary and basil and has a wide variety of positive effects, including pain relief. Limonene smells citrusy, and is found in — you guessed it — citrus! It also vaporizes low, at 350 °F, and is associated with anti-anxiety effects, along with some anti-depressant effects. It’s also used for its anti-inflammation properties. It’s also widely regarded for its ability to assist in stress relief. For me, strains high in limonene aren’t the best to seek out before bedtime, but your mileage may vary. Linalool is perhaps the most fun one on this list to say. Flower has to be exposed to temperatures higher than 388 °F to unlock this terpene, but if you are looking for relief from pain or insomnia, this terpene is your friend. Linalool has a wonderful, floral scent and is found in lavender. It’s also been known to have anti-depressant properties, and if you’ve ever turned to a lavender-scented candle or bath to relax — a strain high in linalool would also do the trick!

His opponent, Dr. Peter Grinspoon, is a physician in favor of medical marijuana. The topic of the debate was Berenson’s argument that legalization of cannabis will lead to an increase in violent crime and homicide. I was pretty pumped about this debate going into it, and while there weren’t quite the fireworks I had anticipated, it definitely had its tense moments. There’s a lot going on in this debate that I want to talk about. Too much for a single, coherent piece.

Medium.com,Life,"For Cannabis, Strain names don’t matter; Terpenes do.",Cannabis,https://medium.com/cannabis-explorations/for-cannabis-strain-names-dont-matter-terpenes-do-44976f6a3a4d?source=topic_page---------20------------------1," I love a good strain name. I’ve bought so many grams based on a good name alone. What geek could resist Doctor Who? How could one pass up “Key Lime Pie” when about to bake the same confection? But what’s in that name? Even a preliminary web search will show you not much, despite what many may tell you. Strain names do start to take on more meaning is when you couple them with the farm or producer’s name, which is where you can expect more consistency in product. In other words, until the entire cannabis genome is mapped and all of our product is consistently tested — don’t expect GG#4 to be the same across a state or across the country. Think about how variable plants are, how you can have two nearly identical houseplants in the same space that grow completely different ways — and you can begin to understand why strain names don’t have consistency industry-wide. There are certainly many reasons that people would love to give you to follow a strain name, just ask anyone working in an effort to store and categorize information on cannabis — be that Leafly or at the state level. Given the variability that has been in strain names, and even the loss of some of cannabis’ genetics — it’s pretty vital that the consumer understand that these names should be taken with a bit of skepticism. What can be helpful in consumers hoping to get a consistent experience is linking the strain name with the farm name — it is far more likely to have consistency in a strain at a single farm, than even across a state. If you are looking to ensure that you get a similar experience from bowl to bowl (or are looking to avoid certain effects like paranoia, or boost others like energy), then the best thing to use would be the terpene profile of the plant. Many dispensaries are beginning to carry this information, but it’s also vital for customers to know that the profiling may not have been performed on the batch that you are about to consume, but on a genetically related plant. Additionally, I suspect that, hopefully, once cannabis is removed from Schedule 1 and we are able to study its medicinal uses more depth, that we will begin to understand more and more about how it can affect us, and will add more terpenes to our list. As more and more people are driven from the broken US healthcare system and towards having their health in their own hands, that there will be an even greater need for consistency in strains and their effects. As cannabis is legalized for recreational uses in more and more states, more consumers will be looking for a reliable way to get the effects they are seeking. After all, the reason that people do drugs is because drugs work. The best way currently to ensure consistency of product, especially if you are looking for medicinal uses of cannabis, is to explore terpene profiles while journaling experiences to determine what works best for you."

Medium.com,Life,"What to Know About Men, Marijuana, and Miscarriage",Cannabis,https://elemental.medium.com/what-to-know-about-men-marijuana-and-miscarriage-6c7f59dd321c?source=topic_page---------22------------------1," ew research suggests that men who use marijuana more than once a week prior to conception have double the risk of a partner’s pregnancy ending in miscarriage compared to men who use marijuana less than once a week or not at all. So does this mean that men who toke are to blame for miscarriage, or that they should stop smoking altogether if they’re trying to get pregnant? Not necessarily. The data, presented at the American Society for Reproductive Medicine conference last week, comes from the ongoing Pregnancy Study Online (PRESTO) at Boston University. The researchers surveyed men and women who were trying to get pregnant on numerous aspects of health and behavior, and then followed the women during their efforts to conceive and throughout the pregnancy. “Our main goal is to look at lifestyle and environmental factors that can affect fertility and also miscarriage,” says Elizabeth Hatch, a professor of epidemiology at Boston University and a co-investigator on PRESTO. She says that while they initially focused on female factors related to miscarriage, they’ve started to look at men’s health as more studies have come out suggesting that exposures affecting sperm could also impact pregnancy outcomes. The new research focused exclusively on cannabis use, dividing the men into three groups based on their responses to the initial survey: those who used cannabis more than once a week, less than once a week, or not at all. Out of the 1,535 couples enrolled in the study, 292 of the pregnancies (17.5%) resulted in miscarriage. The researchers then calculated whether the father’s marijuana use was linked to the pregnancy outcome. They discovered there was no difference between men who didn’t use marijuana and those who used it less than once a week, but the men who used marijuana more than once a week had double the risk miscarriage. The researchers can’t definitively say that higher marijuana use resulted in the miscarriages — there could be another variable that increased those couples’ risk, for example. “What does this research mean for me if I’m a man wanting to conceive?” says John Mitchell, an assistant professor in the department of psychiatry and behavioral sciences at Duke University, who was not part of the study. “It might be good to play it safe and take a conservative approach and abstain from using. I wouldn’t say quitting for the rest of your life, necessarily, but quitting for some period of time.” Before you toss your stash, though — especially if your marijuana is medical — there are a few things to keep in mind."

If this had happened a year ago, I’d have been crestfallen. I have entries on over 30 different cartridges I vaped, as for a while it was exclusively what i used. Since smoking is pretty much out for me — I fought like hell to quit a 20 year smoking habit — I am very grateful for dry herb vaping. It gives many of the advantages of cartridges, without anything additive to the cannabis. I understand why people use cartridges — the convenience and stealth factor are both huge. I find that dry herb vaping can offer those advantages as well along with a couple of other perks. Lung Health I feel far better after dry herb vaping than I do after smoking or vaping a cartridge (and, though I love how dabs affect me, my ‘I was a 20 year smoker lungs’ sincerely do not care for dabs). Control over quality of product While I can’t tell you everything about a bud that I’m about to load up (while I know a lot about local farms, I may not be savvy enough yet to know what chemicals which uses, etc.), I can definitely tell what it is. I can’t say the same for the oil that is in cartridges — or in the atomizers that help them work. While cartridges can make claims about what strains they contain and the quality of the bud therein, I can be more certain of what I’m packing into my dry herb vape. For those of us with ‘control issues’ this is a pretty big deal. I can see where cartridge-style cannabis will still be huge for many medical users, the risks of unknown additives may plague many, especially those with allergies / sensitivities. Stealth Much like cartridges, dry herb vaping is stealthy. Gone are the days where my clothes smell of burnt cannabis. AVB! Unforgettable to me is the first time I ate the after-vaped bud. I think it’s one of the few times I told Mr. THC I was ‘too high’ to do something, and believe me — he was confused. After vaped bud has already been decarboxylated by the very process of you enjoying it — and there’s even a subreddit dedicated to its uses. I prefer to water cure mine to eliminate the more burned flavor of it but trust me, it’s easy enough to mask. Tuning in Terpenes We all love terpenes, right? I’ll be putting together my own easy to use chart soon, I’m certain, but here’s a good one-sheet that shows you the terpene, its effects, and the temperature you need to vape at to feel them! Drawbacks and Living with ‘em. Price. One of the biggest drawbacks to entry into dry herb vaping is the price point, especially when compared to the price points of bowls, joints, or even pens — is price. Absolutely these little beasts are expensive, but based on my ability to smell and breathe — I’d say they are worth it. One of my constant companions has been this sweet little Fury 2, and you can find it for $109 on puffitup pretty often (and you get an awesome grinder). I’ve paid a lot more than that for a lovely bong that broke in a few weeks time, and my Fury is still going strong. Desktop vaporizer wise I LOVE my Arizer Extreme Q, and i find it to be well worth every penny (it helps I bought it on sale). Ease. It’s really hard to beat cartridges on ease of use — unless you couple a dry herb vaporizer with some appropriately sized dosing caps — then it becomes pretty easy. If you don’t have dosing caps, it’s not as easy as a bowl on-the-go unless you carry a container to help you out with AVB, etc."
Medium.com,Life,"Labs Give Legit Cannabis Clean Bill of Health, But CBD Is”Wild West”",Cannabis,https://medium.com/marijuana-wire/labs-give-legit-cannabis-clean-bill-of-health-but-cbd-is-wild-west-786a3981191f?source=topic_page---------25------------------1," [As reported for The Marijuana Times.] Two leading cannabis testing companies in California are reporting that analysis of a total of 200 different vape devices sold through that state’s dispensaries and other licensed sources turned up no traces of the two principal agents suspected of playing a role in the vaping illness epidemic. The leading suspects — commonly found in illegal or black market vape products — are vitamin E acetate, a thick oil normally used in skin products; and myclobutanil, a fungicide which, when heated above 400 degrees fahrenheit, produces fumes of lung-scorching hydrogen cyanide. According to Josh Wurzer, president and co-founder of Santa Cruz-based SC Laboratories, failure rates for cannabis products tested in his lab have fallen from about 70 percent in 2017—just prior to legalization of recreational use in California—to just 2 percent today. “The number one factor we saw before legalization was myclobutanil. Was it making people sick then? Probably.” The difference between then and this summer’s sudden outbreak of lung illness may be the “green rush” this spring. Long-time growers in California’s Emerald Triangle reported a number of new farms — or grows, in industry parlance — popping up. Many were started by inexperienced cultivators hoping to hit the jackpot that experts and industry leaders were predicting for this year’s crop. Mold and mildew can render an entire grow worthless so, whether due to ignorance or temptation, myclobutanil use likely spiked. Wurzer said his lab has tested the contents of more than a hundred branded vape cartridges available for sale in California and all passed the state standards for the absence of some 60-plus potential contaminants. Batches that fail are required to be reported to state officials, so legitimate producers and marketers police their supply chains. LA-based CannaSafe, believed to be the largest in the industry, also tested more than a hundred commercial vape cartridges, with similar results. The lab was commissioned by NBC News to go a step further and test about a dozen cartridges obtained from the black market. The results were widely reported week before last—every single one was contaminated. All contained myclobutanil, which is considered so dangerous for use on marijuana that it is specifically banned in Canada, and in the states of Washington, Oregon, and Colorado. “I was somewhat disappointed about the results,” says Aaron Riley, Cannasafe’s founder and president. He’d held out hope that some illegal grower somewhere had a conscience and the wisdom to grow clean weed. “I had hoped we would find products that weren’t completely contaminated, but we didn’t.” Riley said the 104 legal vape products his company tested contained no vitamin E acetate or myclobutanil. They also met the label claims for the percentage of THC. Cannasafe produced a 13-page slide deck that includes a side-by-side comparison of findings of tests on a popular brand of vape cartridge—Kingpen—obtained from a dispensary, next to the stats for a counterfeit Kingpen obtained on the black market. The contrast is stark and tells the whole story in a glance. Cannasafe’s Riley says all that testing proves that the regulated market makes it hard for illicit contaminated products to end up on retailer’s shelves. While the immediate danger of inhaling cyanide is clear, the role of vitamin E acetate is less so. It, too, showed up suddenly this spring, widely used in the black market to dilute cannabis oil. According to Wurzer of SC Labs, vitamin E acetate is not meant to be vaped like the carrier oils used in legit vapes. It is heavy and when the heated molecules hit the lungs they adhere and block the exchange of oxygen. Some experts are skeptical that vitamin E is the prime culprit in the sudden outbreak of vaping illness, but it’s still considered by California to be a significant contaminant. Riley worries that there may be another health crisis lurking in the explosive growth in CBD products, which are derived from hemp. Although hemp has little or no psychoactive effect like weed, it is a plant prone to mold and mildew. But there are no regulations or rules requiring the sort of safety testing that THC has to go through to get to the legit market. CBD products are sold just about everywhere. You can buy them online. “And nobody knows what’s really in them. It’s the Wild West,” he says. “Vitamin E acetate is the first dangerous additive in the illicit market to make headlines, but it may not be the last.”"
Medium.com,Life,What Are The Benefits Of Legal Cannabis?,Cannabis,https://medium.com/@admin_12473/what-are-the-benefits-of-legal-cannabis-5aa994f9be1?source=topic_page---------26------------------1," WHY BUYING LEGAL CANNABIS MATTERS Canadians like cannabis. It’s hard to get exact numbers, but Canada is always near the top of indexes that rank countries based on cannabis consumption. The consumer market has existed here for ages, and less than a year ago Canada became the first G7 country to legalize cannabis. Since then, the legal market, although not perfect, has been growing steadily. While it’s no secret that cannabis legalization hasn’t eliminated Canada’s black market, we’d like to take this opportunity to tell you why we think buying legally is important, and why we should support the legal market. Many Canadians have cited supply and price issues as reasons why they continue to turn to illicit cannabis, and there’s no denying that you can find high quality cannabis at low prices, same as you always could. Cannabis legalization is still very new, and if we want to see Canada lead the world in terms of a legal market and legal cannabis products, we should support it in its infancy. That aside, there are numerous reasons why buying legal is personally beneficial for you, the consumer. It’s legal
It may sound silly to point out, but illegal cannabis is still just that, illegal. Purchasing illicit cannabis in small quantities may not be likely to result in serious charges or jail time if you are caught, but why risk it if you can buy legally? Buying legal also helps support and grow the legal market, which benefits all consumers both recreational and medicinal. The black market (many would call it the original market) has existed for so long that it’s only natural that it take time for the legal market to catch up in terms of price and ease of access. Buying legal supports the new market, generates tax revenue, and constantly generates new data that the government, producers, and distributors can use to facilitate what we all want — high quality, low prices, and easy access. A larger and more successful legal market also leads to increased research, more access to information, and more interest in the plant and its potential uses. Now that buying legal is an option, it makes sense to reduce your own risk and to promote the expansion of the legal market. Quality control
One of the major selling points behind legal cannabis is quality and safety control. There are many requirements for producers, such as testing for mould and contaminants, having a defined sanitary program, and quality assurance. There have already been recalls of product found to be mouldy or deemed unfit for sale. While this doesn’t help supply issues, it does point to the fact that oversight is working, and that quality control does serve its purpose. This is particularly important for new consumers who may not know what to look for or how to judge the quality of cannabis. Even seasoned consumers may unknowingly purchase compromised product. Even more important is the quality and safety of product being used for medical purposes. Patients with preexisting symptoms or conditions will be more susceptible to adverse effects from unregulated product. With illicit cannabis there is also no guarantee that you are getting the strain you think you are. Names can easily be changed, and if you are looking for specific strains for specific purposes, you are far better off sourcing from licensed producers. Know what’s in your cannabis
Third party testing also verifies terpene content. Terpenes play an important role in producing effects such as mood enhancement or pain relief (see our article on terpenes for more on this topic). If you are searching out cannabis that can relieve specific symptoms or provide desired recreational effects, knowing the terpene profile is an important piece of information. The chances of illegal producers or dealers knowing this information is far less likely than licensed and regulated producers. Third party testing, and all the information regarding the compounds and terpenes found in different cannabis, will also be important once edibles and concentrates become more prominent in the legal marketplace. It’s harder to tell what you’re getting with products that aren’t dried flower, and you rely more on the honesty or your supplier in such cases. With legally purchased products you are simply more likely to get what you pay for, and to be able to find more specific products with more specific effects. Selection
This brings us to selection. Knowing what terpenes, THC, or CBD levels you’re after doesn’t really matter if you can only choose between a few different strains. We aren’t debating that illicit producers can grow high quality cannabis. They can, and do. Canada’s black market has existed for too long and is too well established to say otherwise. However, there is no question that a legal market and licensed Cannabis Store will provide a greater selection of product, whether we are talking about dried flower, edibles, or other extracts and concentrates. Make sure to check into instaleaf.ca to find strains right for you and the nearest Cannabis Store that has that strain in stock. The Ontario Cannabis Store, for example, currently has 110 strains of dried flower available on their website. 110. There was a time not too long ago when many consumers would have been happy to have just a couple different indicas and sativas to choose from. Yes, it might be more expensive than buying from an illegal source, but there is no dealer on the planet with a hundred strains for you to choose from. Once you start including every other cannabis based product the difference only becomes more pronounced. Looking forward
Canada’s legal cannabis market is young and far from perfect. Measures will have to be taken by the government to ensure that it continues to grow and service Canadian consumers. Quality, safety, price, and supply will likely remain the primary concerns for most customers. Prices may need to be reduced in order to draw more people away from the illegal market, and most industry experts would probably agree that the individual provinces should license more retail locations. In the meantime make sure to download the instaleaf app and find your nearest Cannabis Store anywhere in Canada! As consumers, we should also do our part to help grow the legal market. Canada is the first G7 country to legalize, and that’s something to be proud of. The more we support the legal market, the more likely it is to evolve into what we as consumers want it to be. For now, let’s enjoy the simple fact that we can consume legally, and can openly celebrate the amazing plant that is cannabis."
Medium.com,Life,Judges Are Not Doctors: Why the ACLU Is Challenging a Ban on Medical Marijuana for People on…,Cannabis,https://medium.com/@ACLUPA/judges-are-not-doctors-why-the-aclu-is-challenging-a-ban-on-medical-marijuana-for-people-on-8703ae9feeb9?source=topic_page---------27------------------1," By Sara Rose, Senior Staff Attorney, ACLU of PA Melissa Gass has experienced daily, life-threatening seizures since she developed epilepsy at age 10. Ashley Bennett has endured symptoms of PTSD from repeated childhood trauma, and Andrew Koch has suffered debilitating pain since his hand and vertebrae were crushed in a car accident. Each of them found relief thanks to medical marijuana, and since Pennsylvania passed a law allowing people with their conditions to use the drug, they have been able to use it legally. Medical marijuana has transformed their lives, allowing them to work and care for their children. It has also allowed them to stop taking prescription medicines that made it difficult for them to function or were highly addictive. But the Lebanon County Court of Common Pleas has taken this life-altering remedy away, telling them they can no longer use medical marijuana because they are on probation. The problem with the court’s policy is not just that judges are substituting their opinions for that of patients’ doctors, which is bad enough, but that it disregards the broad protections that the General Assembly provided to medical marijuana patients when it passed the state Medical Marijuana Act. The Act protects medical marijuana patients, as well as their caregivers and doctors, from: arrest, prosecution or penalty in any manner, or denied any right or privilege, including civil penalty or disciplinary action by a Commonwealth licensing board or commission, solely for lawful use of medical marijuana or manufacture or sale or dispensing of medical marijuana, or for any other action taken in accordance with this act. The law clearly protects medical marijuana patients from being denied probation, which is considered a privilege in Pennsylvania. So threatening to revoke a person’s probation if they lawfully use medical marijuana under state law — which is what the Lebanon County court has done — violates the law. That’s why we sued the 52nd Judicial District, which includes the Lebanon County Court of Common Pleas and its probation department, on behalf of Melissa, Ashley, and Andrew, and asked the Commonwealth Court to stop it from enforcing its policy against our clients and all other medical marijuana patients in the county. Under Pennsylvania law, probation conditions must be reasonably related to the rehabilitation of the defendant. If they are not, the condition is illegal and cannot be enforced. There is no basis, either in law or common sense, to deny people medicine that the state has recognized as a legitimate treatment for their medical conditions. In fact, it goes against the goals of rehabilitation, making it more difficult for our clients to work and care for their children. It will also lead people in severe pain, like Andrew, to use far more dangerous and addictive opioid medications, which the court has no policy against. Pennsylvania has set up a comprehensive program that makes it possible for people with serious medical conditions to use a treatment, medical marijuana, that has been proven to alleviate their symptoms without fear of being arrested, denied probation, or losing custody of their children or their jobs. Pennsylvania courts have no authority to prohibit people from using a lawful medication simply because they disagree with the legislature’s decision. Judges are supposed to apply the law, not violate it."

bsessive-compulsive disorder or OCD is a mental disorder that causes a person to feel the need to perform certain routines repeatedly (referred to as “compulsions”), or has certain thoughts repeatedly (obsession). Anxiety or unwanted thoughts result in repetitive behavior that is beyond their control for more than a short period of time. Repetitive hand washing, locking, and unlocking doors several times, and hoarding are all signs of OCD. There is no choice with these actions, the brain tells the person that these actions are necessary, they are compulsory. Sometimes the feeling is that failure to conduct these repetitive actions will result in death. Estimations suggest that OCD affects 1.2% of the UK population. Although there are certain age hot spots it is widespread across all genders and ethnic types. Sometimes, since the symptoms are easily hidden it is difficult to realize that somebody is suffering from this disorder. Traditionally there have been two main types of treatment for this condition: Cognitive brain therapy is a popular treatment for several types of depression, and mental health and social disorders. The treatment at its basic level takes the form of a series of meetings to attempt to rationalize what the trigger or thought mechanisms are that starts the compulsory response. If something is hot, we immediately we pull our hand back. This action is automatic, there is no thought about what the consequences would be if we do not act. It is necessary to find the trigger for a compulsory response, and then attempt to desensitize the brain to the trigger. A cure for fear of flying is to introduce flying to a subject in a controlled way thus showing the fears are unfounded. Medication such as Serotonin Re-uptake Inhibitors (SRI) are commonly used to treat this condition and indeed other forms of depression. However, it is not entirely clear how this form of medication works apart from the fact that it acts to help to correct any imbalance in Serotonin levels. How Serotonin functions is also not completely understood, as it is a part of an exceedingly complex structure. As a part of the neural network, it is a messenger system that allows areas of the brain to communicate. Recalling the act of touching something hot the brain sends a message that forces the rapid movement of the hand to take it out of danger. When the brain fails to communicate correctly the messages can become scrambled or interpreted incorrectly. If serotonin levels are one of the main contributors to inducing OCD than other chemicals that influence the levels could have a positive effect. There is a growing belief that CBD has a positive effect on anxiety and help to raise mood levels. Is it possible the CBD, which is a natural plant-based product influences serotonin? CBD can attach itself to one of the 114 Serotonin receptors and by doing so helps with its regulation. Anandamide is a hormone that also influences anxiety and mood levels. CBD is also able to enhance the production of this hormone whilst also effecting the enzyme that triggers the breakdown of this hormone. Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitors, the traditional medication for OCD has numerous side effects that are less than desirable. Whilst using the medication to decrease anxiety it is potentially creating side effects that would increase anxiety. There is also an increased risk level with older people using this class of medication since it can affect the heart rhythms and interfere with other medications. CBD works by mimicking the body’s natural processes and is a natural plant-based product. Since this natural product works with the brains neural systems, naturally there is far less chance for side effects to develop. Using CBD is now often recommended for various conditions and is available in various formats making application simple. Dosage is particularly important, although there are recommendations, they are yet to be quantified scientifically. A lot of people think more CBD is better, but actually CBD is the opposite. Whatever your body does not need, it flushes out.⁠ When it comes to CBD, there’s no such thing as a one-size-fits-all approach to dosing. It often takes a little while to find your sweet spot, and even then, you may want to periodically adjust your dose to reflect your changing schedule, mood, and environment. CBD has suddenly become popular and there are countless claims about its suitability for treating various conditions. The scientific community is now in the process of a large-scale evaluation of the compound through clinical studies and surveys. There are, however, several case reports from the medical journals showing when they have tried CBD in specific cases, improvement in the patients were observed within two weeks. In some cases, there have been reports of improvement for people who have been resistant to other recognized drug therapy. There have been various trials animals such as monkeys, rats, and dogs that have all displayed positive results. However, trials with other products have shown that a positive animal trial results are not always will it correlate to a similar result with humans."
Medium.com,Life,Vape Ban In Massachusetts,Cannabis,https://medium.com/@marissafratoni/vape-ban-in-massachusetts-bdde2c8217f6?source=topic_page---------30------------------1," On September 24, 2019, the Governor of Massachusetts, Charlie Baker, declared vaping a public health emergency. As a result, he initiated a ban on all vape products, effective immediately until January 25, 2020. The circumstances that lead Governor Baker and the Public Health Council in Massachusetts to this decision have to do with an uptick in illnesses linked with vaping in this country. At the time of this writing, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) reports that 1080 lung injury cases related to the use of vape products (both e-cigarettes and cannabis) have been identified in 48 states and 1 U.S. territory. 18 cases have resulted in death in fifteen states. At this time, what specific chemicals are causing lung injuries remains unknown. There is not one specific chemical that has been linked to the reported illnesses. All patients report the use of vaping products and no consistent evidence of an infectious cause, such as bacteria or virus, has been discovered. Therefore, the suspected cause is a chemical exposure from using vape products. According the the New England Journal of Medicine, the illnesses range from inflammation of lung tissue (pneumonitis, pneumonia) to full on acute respiratory distress (ARDS ) crises. Some of these illnesses require admission into an Intensive Care Unit (ICU) as the patients require constant monitoring and oh, need to be on a respiratory ventilator as their lungs are not capable of breathing properly! Folks, that’s life support! You might be asking yourself what is going on? Why now? Vaping has been around for a while. Why hasn’t there been a public health emergency declared before now? Well, simply put — the people who are struggling with this array of respiratory illnesses have likely been vaping for an extended period. The diseases they are experiencing are likely related to habitual use of vape products. Scroll through social media and you’ll probably see people claiming that these injuries are due to one substance or another, but the fact of the matter is we don’t know what the long-term impacts of inhaling lipids (fat-based molecules), flavoring compounds, dyes, and cutting agents really are…it unfortunately looks like we’re finding out the hard-way, 10–15 years after the e-cigarette made it’s debut on the market. I’m a cannabis patient, my vapes help me! What am I supposed to do? Vaping is one of the most discreet and effective delivery methods for managing symptoms of chronic illness. Unfortunately, the current public health crisis indicates that vaping may not be the safest of delivery methods. So let’s discuss a delivery method that may be a good alternative for patients and consumers who are accustomed to using vape pens and cartridges to relieve symptoms. Flower (dry herb) vaporizers are devices that heat cannabis flower to a temperature prior to combustion that melts the resin glands (trichomes) into a “vapor.” Lack of combustion means reduced or eliminated exposure to smoke, carcinogens, tar, and other irritating chemicals that are simply no good for the lungs. There are a wide-range of devices on the market ranging from portable options that fit into your pocket for medicating discreetly and effectively on the go, or there are desktop vaporizers if discretion is not an issue for you. But wait, there’s more! There is one added benefit to using flower (dry herb) vaporizers. You can save the “spent” flower and use it to make edibles! Yes, that’s right. Flower vaporizers effectively decarboxylate cannabis flower (converts raw THCa to active and available THC for example.) Save those little crispy brown nuggets of goodness for a batch of medicinal brownies, or steep a gram into a cup of hot milk and honey for a high tea. Think of the possibilities and benefits. You can medicate, keep your lungs safe, and enjoy an infused treat later. It comes down to this… We get one body to drive through this life. One body that is designed to serve us quite well when nourished and cared for properly. Sure, genes, environment may play a role in trumping the primary design, but for the most part, we tend to have a lot of room to make good decisions for the purpose of maintaining our health. At this time, vaping doesn’t seem to fall into the good decision category. Like anything else, it’s important to know what you are taking in to your body, whether it be food, water, or substances. At this time, it appears that it may be best to skip vaping. Your lungs will thank you. And you get to stay out of the ICU. Staying out of the ICU is always a good plan.

Medium.com,Life,Is The Weed Business About To Look Like the Coffee Business?,Cannabis,https://marker.medium.com/inside-the-race-to-build-the-starbucks-of-weed-6ebc5aa0eaf4?source=topic_page---------31------------------1," prawled in a tieless suit and sockless oxfords on a chair just off the lobby of the world’s largest marijuana dispensary, J.J. Walker is swiping at his iPhone, trying to locate a two-month-old video of him enjoying a bong hit here in Las Vegas. Bong videos are hardly the stuff of riveting entertainment, particularly in Vegas, where pot is legal and plentiful and restraint is in short supply. At whatever moment Walker had been placing lips to bong glass, surely there were a thousand people within two miles of him inhaling and ingesting pot in just about every form imaginable. In addition to the city’s mostly pot-friendly 2 million residents, Vegas pulls in 42 million visitors a year, about a fifth of whom identify as cannabis users, and a substantial portion come from places where recreational pot isn’t yet legal. Weed, in other words, has become part of the Vegas draw, leaving the smell of it wafting reliably at almost all hours outside casinos, hotels, restaurants, and pretty much everywhere in between. But the video, when Walker finally finds it, proves momentous, even for Vegas standards. For one thing, the bong he’s toking is two stories tall. Its bowl holds a quarter-pound of pot, requiring the assistance of a vacuum cleaner to pull the smoke through the 100 gallons of water in the bong’s reservoir. It also happens to be inside the world’s first and only commercial space designed specifically to be a public place in which to get high. “I just had to try that bong, man,” beams Walker, who commissioned its creation. These new laws would create a legal future in which enjoying weed is as simple as walking into a bar or restaurant and enjoying a glass of chardonnay. Yet firing up that bong — or any marijuana-ingesting device — in any commercial or public space is currently illegal in Vegas. The same reality has been true just about everywhere in the United States, despite the growing legality and acceptance of pot itself. But that picture is about to change, with several states and cities already cautiously opening the door to the so-called social consumption of marijuana. These new laws would permit any adult who purchases cannabis in a specially licensed business to also consume the products right there. In other words, a legal future in which enjoying weed is as simple as walking into a bar or restaurant and enjoying a glass of chardonnay. Currently there are no credible projections of the size of the social-consumption market, but there’s enough relevant math to suggest it will likely be massive. Last year, Americans spent about $100 billion on alcohol in bars and restaurants. They already purchase about $10 billion a year on legal pot, a number that’s expected to triple within three years, given that the legal recreation market is still in only 11 states. (Illegal sales of pot currently account for another $50 billion or so in sales.) Those numbers don’t reflect what will happen to a market that is likely to explode once there are suddenly legal public places to consume it. At the ready are entrepreneurs waiting to pounce. Will the winning retail formula look like a Starbucks, where friends can meet for a toke over lattes and easy listening, or a more boozy atmosphere that has the vibe of an Ace Hotel lounge? Walker, a serial cannabis entrepreneur, is convinced it’s neither. He believes the cerebral, perception-bending nature of the marijuana high calls for a space that’s more like a mind-tweaking, Alice in Wonderland playground for the baked. “Pot is incredibly sensitive to context,” he says. “I see opportunity in that.” Walker’s first crack at this — the one that housed that larger-than-life bong — shut down in July. He and his partner decided to close it so they can double down on a more ambitious version that would place it at the center of a new Vegas retail hub catering to the stoned consumer. On the surface, the whole venture feels slightly too Vegas — all novelty, a paean to mischievous excess. But Walker’s plan for cannabis domination has whiffs of Shultzian ambition — retail environments queued up inside shipping containers, stationed next to a giant loading dock at the side of that pot super-emporium just next to the Vegas Strip, ready to scale as laws change, state by state. “National and local barriers to social consumption are starting to fall,” says Walker, an entrepreneur comfortable surfing ahead of the law. “And we’re going to be ready to pop these up quick wherever that happens.”"
Medium.com,Life,De-Mystifying CBD,Cannabis,https://medium.com/thecbdfriend/de-mystifying-cbd-c43edd630ea1?source=topic_page---------32------------------1," Learn practical and proven facts about CBD, and see if it’s right for you. Hemp has been used for over 4000 years. Some of the first use of the Hemp plant began in China around 2300BC. According to Chinese beliefs, the plant contains the prescription for immortality. The Chinese also used hemp oil to treat Malaria, menstrual problems and fertility. In the 10th century, Native Americans began to use the oil to treat indigestion, and anorexia as well as external wounds and infections, asthma, menstrual pain and more. Until the beginning of the 1900s, the plant fiber was also used to make cloth, sails and ropes. Mostly recently, in 2018, the US Congress passed the Farm Bill. It provides important agricultural and nutritional policy extensions for five years, with the most interesting changes involving the cannabis plant. Hemp is defined in the legislation as the cannabis plant (yes, the same one that produces marijuana) with one key difference: hemp cannot contain more than 0.3 percent of THC (the compound in the plant most commonly associated with getting a person high). In short, hemp can’t get you high. For decades, federal law did not differentiate hemp from other cannabis plants, all of which were effectively made illegal in 1937 under the Marijuana Tax Act and formally made illegal in 1970 under the Controlled Substances Act — the latter banned cannabis of any kind. While the Farm Bill legalizes hemp, it doesn’t create a system in which people can grow it as freely as they can grow tomatoes or basil. This will be a highly regulated crop in the United States for both personal and industrial production. For noting, hemp has been grown in numerous European countries and Australia for over 20 years. CBD, also called Cannabidiol, is just one of 85 different chemical compounds in marijuana plants. CBD Hemp Oil is derived from hemp, or cannabis grown with very little THC (often less than 0.3%). For the sake of this article we will refer to marijuana as cannabis grown for its psychoactive effects, and hemp as cannabis grown for its practical uses as a fiber. Marijuana is marketed for its THC content and hemp is utilized for its CBD content. THC is the psychoactive or intoxicating compound found in cannabis plants whereas, CBD oil is not psychoactive or intoxicating and has shown strong signs of being an effective treatment for a variety of diseases and mental health disorders. Hemp products do NOT contain THC, therefore are not psychoactive. This means that CBD oil does not make one high, so it can be safely used as dietary supplement. Where Can I Get CBD Hemp Oil? Hemp oil is legal in all 50 states, but the production of CBD Hemp Oil is not. CBD oil made from industrialized hemp grown legally is available online from reputable sources. CBD Hemp Oil Health Benefits CBD Oil has been shown to have surprisingly positive effects on a variety of diseases. Some of the health uses, based on university studies, are: ➢ Nausea treatment ➢ Lowered Anxiety ➢ Pain Relief ➢ Improved Mood ➢ Seizure reduction ➢ Reduced Inflammations ➢ More Sound Sleep CBD works by activating the body’s serotonin (anti-depressant effect), vanilloid (pain relief), and adenosine (anti-inflammatory effect) receptors. How quickly you start to feel the results from CBD Oil depends on how it was ingested and your weight. Someone small who ingested the oil in spray form will feel the effects much faster than a larger person ingesting CBD in capsule form. Different Forms of CBD Hemp Oil CBD Hemp Oil can take on many different forms, including liquids, ointments, and sprays, and capsules. Most oils and sprays are used by putting the substance under your tongue. Ointments are used on and absorbed by the skin, and thirdly capsules are ingested. Those who don’t like the taste of sprays or oils can defer to capsules. Capsules are a very convenient way to consume Cannabidiol, however you don’t absorb as much CBD from a capsule as you do from an oil or spray put under your tongue. CBD Oil can help with mood disorders, lower anxiety, and lessen pain caused by inflammation. CBD Hemp Oil Side Effects While not much research has been done yet on the side effects of CBD Oil, whether absorbed, swallowed as a capsule or inhaled through a CBD vape pen, the most commonly side effects reported are digestive issues, such as upset stomach and diarrhea. These side effects are not very common. Purchase Cautions: How do you know if you are getting quality CBD Hemp Oil? Your first clue is usually price. If the price seems too cheap to be true, it probably is. Always purchase from a reputable source. A company that is reputable will back their product and will not risk selling misrepresented items. There are over 2000 CBD stores online at the time this book was created — look for those that have been around for some time. Make sure the products you buy are full spectrum (use the entire plant), CO2 processed (results in best oils), and tested by an independent lab (or two). All products listed should have a COA available or available from the store. While the medicinal effects of Cannabidiol are great, please keep your expectations realistic. All cannabinoids, including CBD, attach themselves to certain receptors in the body to produce their effects. The human body produces certain cannabinoids on its own. It has two receptors for cannabinoids, called CB1 receptors and CB2 receptors. CB1 receptors are found all around the body, but many of them are in the brain. The CB1 receptors in the brain deal with coordination and movement, pain, emotions and mood, thinking, appetite, and memories, among others. THC attaches to these receptors. CB2 receptors are more common in the immune system. They affect inflammation and pain. It used to be thought that CBD acts on these CB2 receptors, but it appears now that CBD does not act on either receptor directly. Instead, it seems to influence the body to use more of its own cannabinoids. CBD oil is used in different ways to relieve the symptoms of different conditions. Some CBD oil products can be mixed into different foods or drinks, taken from a pipette or dropper, or are available as a thick paste to be massaged into the skin. CBD can also be purchased in capsule form. Other products are provided as sprays that are meant to be administered under the tongue. Please seek advice from a medical professional before settling on any particular serving size. As with any medicinal product the serving size you choose to take can make all the difference. It’s always important to talk to your doctor if you think CBD is right for you. They can advise you on dosage, recommended methods for usage, and how it may affect existing health conditions or interact with any treatments you’re already taking. You should never combine CBD oil–or any other remedies–with other medications until after consulting a licensed health professional. When it comes to the CBD serving size there are a few factors to consider when you’re deciding how much you need to take. Here is our best to give you all the information necessary to make the best decision possible and the one that’s right for you. Here are some general guidelines: • General Health: 2.5–15mg CBD by mouth daily • To treat chronic pain: 2.5–20 mg CBD by mouth daily • To treat sleep disorders: 40–160 mg CBD by mouth daily Please understand, no two people are alike. We all have different quirks, preferences and tolerances and this can have a huge effect on our serving. A 15mb serving for general health might be fine for you but the effect can vary wildly from person to person. Start Small Any time you take a new supplement, it can take time to assess effectiveness. Our advice is always to start small and work your way up to a serving that best suits you. This will give you the most positive and beneficial experience. Can I overdose on CBD Oil? The first and only answer to this question is absolutely not! This is one of the reasons both CBD is vastly superior to other treatments. It’s virtually impossible to overdose and you would need impossible quantities in your system to do so. If you over do it the worst thing you’ll experience is a sound sleep. How Should You Take Your CBD? The simplest way to take CBD oil it to simply drop the required serving on your tongue. You can follow it up with a bit of water. The water helps to wash it down and make sure you get every last drop. Do What’s Right for You There is no one serving or consumption method that is right for everyone. Start out with a small amount and discover what’s right for you. With a little time, experiments you’ll eventually find the CBD serving size that’s perfect for you. After discussing risks with a doctor, it is important to compare different brands. There are a range of different CBD oils available to purchase online, with different benefits and applications. Many sites do that work for you, picking the very best brands, from the most reliable companies who produce medical-grade products. Many small-scale studies have looked into the safety of CBD in adults and found that it is well tolerated across a wide range of doses. There have been no significant side effects in the central nervous system or effects on vital signs and mood among people who use it either slightly or heavily. The most common side effect noted is tiredness. Some people have noticed diarrhea and changes in appetite or weight. There are still very little long-term safety data available, and, to date, tests have not been carried out on children. As with any new or alternative treatment option, a patient should discuss CBD with a qualified healthcare practitioner before use. Though CBD is generally well tolerated and considered safe, it may cause adverse reactions in some people. CBD is also known to interact with several medications. Before you start using CBD oil, discuss it with your medical professional and family to ensure your safety and avoid potentially harmful interactions.

Medium.com,Life,How Did Cyanide Get Into Bootleg Vape Carts?,Cannabis,https://medium.com/marijuana-wire/how-did-cyanide-get-into-bootleg-cannabis-vape-cartridges-71ec329622e7?source=topic_page---------33------------------1," [As reported on The Marijuana Times] Updated Oct. 3, 2019 Last Friday (Sept. 28, 2019), two months after the national hunt for the cause of the vaping illness epidemic began in earnest, there were two dramatic developments that move us giant steps closer to identifying a culprit. The NBC News segment aired Friday morning, reporting the results of tests the network had commissioned on black market (or “knock-off”) cannabis vape cartridges. The lab found the contents were contaminated with a fungicide which, when heated to more than 400 degrees fahrenheit, decomposes into hydrogen cyanide—the same poison the Nazi regime used in its gas chambers to murder millions. (Read the report by CannaSafe, the testing lab NBC used.) Inhalation of cyanide could explain a Mayo Clinic report yesterday, that tests on a group of vape lung biopsies showed evidence of a “chemical burn” injury. Victims’ lungs had been scorched by “noxious chemical fumes.” In a brief email exchange yesterday, Dr. Brandon T. Larsen, a noted lung illness expert and lead investigator on the Mayo report, said chemical analyses of the biopsies are incomplete but a myclobutanil connection could be “a plausible explanation.” The NBC story confirmed what The Marijuana Times has been reporting since Spring, before any vaping related cases had surfaced in the media—that there was a budding health crisis developing due to toxic pesticides and fungicides in illegal vape cartridges. As we reported then, Mendocino, California County Sheriff Thomas D. Allman had done what NBC did, only he did it six months earlier. He sent samples of seized knock-off vape cartridges to a lab. The finding—an astronomical level of contamination—so disturbed Sheriff Allman that he made a public health warning video and posted it on Facebook. He said he notified state officials but that as of last month none had followed up. The CDC has reported common symptoms in vaping victims include coughing, shortness of breath, chest pain, difficulty breathing, nausea, and vomiting. The CDC website separately states: “Breathing small amounts of hydrogen cyanide may cause headache, dizziness, weakness, nausea, and vomiting. Larger amounts may cause gasping, irregular heartbeats, seizures, fainting. Hydrogen cyanide … can produce death within minutes.” The good news from the NBC tests was that the lab found none of the cyanide-producing chemical in cartridges bought from licensed dispensaries. The bad news: NBC reported that “ten out of ten” cartridges bought from unlicensed black market dealers tested positive for myclobutanil which, according to The Dow Chemical Company (now Dow, Inc.), is the common name for an active ingredient in several fungicide products registered to one of its wholly owned subsidiaries. Eagle 20 and Nova 40 are two widely available brands that contain myclobutanil. Myclobutanil is used around the world, especially in the US and China, on a wide range of perennial and annual crops, fruit trees, vines, and turf. One of the most common uses is on wine grapes, a major industry in California that depends on growing conditions similar to those that favor marijuana, another major California commodity. For each, mold and fungus is a major headache. An outbreak can destroy a year’s worth of work. On grapes it’s not considered a threat to human health as the chemical is washed off before the fruit is processed for human consumption. Not so with marijuana. Myclobutanil is so dangerous when heated that it is banned on tobacco, is banned for use on marijuana in Canada, and in the states of Washington, Oregon, and Colorado. In 2017, scientists warned California pesticide regulators that myclobutanil “is incredibly dangerous in smokable cannabis.” The fungicide is especially dangerous in distilled cannabis. Vape oil is produced by leaching the THC elements out of marijuana leaves and stems with volatile chemicals until the psycho-active molecules are highly concentrated. The problem is that residual pesticides and fungicides in the plant also become super concentrated. The oil seized by Sheriff Allman tested at 7,300 times the state limit for myclobutanil in marijuana for public consumption. According to David Kurzfeld, a partner and head of sales for Modular Processing Systems in Willits, California, which cleans dirty vape oil, careless outlaw pot growers are using myclobutanil in spite of Dow’s product safety specs: “Avoid exposure to elevated temperatures.” Crops that have been sprayed with it end up in the illegal vape oil supply chain, bought by processors who have no idea what might be in the weed they buy besides weed. Finally, illegal vape oil cartridges, often packaged to imitate a popular brand, are sold in unlicensed pop-up dispensaries and by underground dealers at a big discount to legal cannabis products. Prime markets are high school and college-aged men, which could explain why the majority of victims have been young men. By the time the mystery is solved, it’s possible that the lung damage sustained by more than 1,000 vapers and the deaths of nearly two dozen and counting may be exacerbated by other contaminants, misuse of vaping devices, or some other element yet to be discovered. For now, the word on the street is loud and clear—stay away from black market vape cartridges. The bootleg vaping epidemic appears to be energizing legalization and regulation movements. Congress could find itself under pressure to finally remove the restrictions that have made the cannabis black market so profitable, and thus enabled the scale of this tragedy."
Medium.com,Life,"Why alcohol-free, THC-infused beverages are the #futureofalcohol",Cannabis,https://medium.com/hngry/why-alcohol-free-thc-infused-beverages-are-the-futureofalcohol-e7004e6a69c3?source=topic_page---------34------------------1," Since Constellation Brands’ (owner of Modelo, Pacifico, Corona, etc.) $4bn investment last year into Canopy Growth, a Canadian cannabis company, I have become fascinated by the potential threat that weed poses to alcohol. New joint ventures and investments between alcohol and cannabis businesses are giving rise to a new category of THC-infused, alcohol-free beverages that are forming the conversation for HNGRY’s next episode about the #futureofalcohol. There are a number of macro trends happening right now in both cannabis and alcohol spaces that I believe are creating the perfect storm for a surge for products like Lagunitas’ HiFi Hops, Two Roots, High Style, and New Frontier. Sober movement and better-for-you alcohol-free spirits This is leveraging Nasim Taleb’s theory of the dictatorship of the small minority: it only takes a small number of virtuous people who are intolerant of something (e.g. Kosher, vegan, etc.) for society to adapt to their needs. Since 1980, pure ethanol consumption has declined by 16% in the US. Over the last three years, alcohol volumes have been in steady decline, reaching nearly -1% last year. On top of this, there is a rising health-conscious sober movement that still wishes to socialize, hence the advent of alcohol free spirits like Seedlip (recently acquired by Diageo) and Kin. Hip restaurants are leveraging these new spirits to form mocktails that can be sold alongside regular spirits, ensuring that lone sober millennials can still clink glasses with their friends without feeling left out. It’s akin to the rise of Beyond and Impossible Burgers popping up at fast food chains nationwide- they may not be the best selling items, but they create a draw for newly health-minded consumers. The non-alcoholic beer category, while super tiny, is growing 8% annually and THC-infused beer companies like Two Roots are already selling their non-alcoholic versions at big box retailers like BevMo! with the hopes of driving them to a THC-infused purchase at a dispensary. The next layer of this trend would be lower ABV spirits like Haus and hard seltzers like White Claw, Truly, etc. but I won’t dive in there too much because “hot girl summer” is officially over. Let’s just say that younger people are getting smarter about their consumption and realizing that drinking is seldom worth the hangover. Cannabis cafes We’re about to see a host of new cannabis consumption lounges pop up. Next week, Lowell Farms will launch Lowell Cafe, the first restaurant to sell cannabis alongside regular food, in West Hollywood. These spaces will define how cannabis can be consumed socially in public as a potential substitute to traditional bars. First time tokers According to BDS Analytics, there is an increasing trend of alcohol users consuming cannabis while cannabis consumers simultaneously drink less alcohol. On average, about one in every five consumers of cannabis report reducing their booze consumption by a half. A study over a 10 year period of states with medical marijuana programs found a 13% decrease in alcohol sales in those counties. The “vaping crisis” and edible legalization in Canada October 17 marks the date that edibles will become legal in Canada, hitting dispensary shelves by the end of December. Molson Coors, through their joint venture with HEXO, is already ahead of this trend and plans to launch its mysterious Truss Beverages line this year. This will be a breeding ground for other alcohol companies to test the THC-infused beverage market, preparing for legalization in the US. I don’t have to add on the vaping crisis in the US, but let’s just say the growth projections for edibles look a lot better in light of all the health concerns around vaping. According to ArcView Group and BDS Analytics, the edible market in the US and Canada is projected to reach $4.1bn by 2022 (32%+ CAGR), stealing a decent share from traditional flower sales in that timeframe. Better onset times through nanoemulsion of THC Normal edibles can take up to two hours to metabolize through your liver and into your bloodstream. Newer nanoemulsion technology allows better delivery system of THC by doing that work outside the body by processing THC into tiny water soluble droplets that can enter the bloodstream, skipping the liver, and go straight to the blood-brain barrier. The result is an onset time that is quicker than edibles and just shy of a typical alcoholic beverage. In conclusion… As Canada legalizes edibles, consumers shift towards healthier alternatives to alcohol, and cannabis consumption lounges come online, we’re starting to form a full picture of what a post-prohibition society might look like in the US. Big beer conglomerates who don’t start testing in Canada now may find themselves grossly overpaying for growth in the future, just as they did with craft beer four years ago."

Medium.com,Life,Here’s Why China Is A Growing Hemp Superpower,Cannabis,https://medium.com/@ministryofhemp/heres-why-china-is-a-growing-hemp-superpower-4ae4b12ed7bc?source=topic_page---------36------------------1," Ever wondered where your hemp product comes from? More likely than not, it came from China, the world’s largest source of hemp agriculture. While China grows more acres of hemp than any other nation, in some ways their regulations are far more strict than the U.S. For example, China is only just starting to allow hemp’s use in beauty products! Even so, at once time China grew 70% of the world’s hemp, and its the source of most of the imported hemp in the United States. In this article, we’ll take a closer look at where hemp is grown in China and how it’s used there. Chinese people used hemp since before the beginning of recorded history. Hemp was used in medicine, oil, rope, food, paper and clothing. The oldest known example of paper comes from China. It was made from hemp, rags, and other plant materials. Even though hemp was an important part in China’s history, it was affected by the harsh drug restrictions of past governments, especially under Communism. These restrictions saw harsh punishments for drug use, cultivation and transportation, sometimes even resulting in the death penalty. Then, after signing United Nations Convention on Psychotropic Substances in 1985, China banned all cultivation of the cannabis plant. Culturally, this increased the stigma against the cannabis plant with the Chinese people. It’s only since 2010 that China started to loosen its grip on the hemp industry, and companies still have to abide by very strict regulations. But, with the undeniable popularity of hemp products in the United States, Canada and all throughout Europe, China simply couldn’t afford to stay out of this quickly growing industry. With this pressure growing, China is looking into further expanding, hopefully allowing more uses like food and modern medicine. China allows hemp growing in just two regions: Yunnan Province in the south & Heilongjiang Province in the north. Together, these two provinces account for more than half of the world’s total hemp production and 1/3rd of total world hemp sales. Textiles make up about 3/4ths of those sales according to New Frontier data. Other products like cosmetics, CBD, food and supplements make up the rest. The hemp textile industry is large and China’s biggest money-maker so far. Jilin, Yunnan’s neighboring Province is also set to place regulations for hemp production as well. With the favorable success of just two of China’s thirty-four provinces, we can only assume that China will continue to produce the plant in increasing quantities. In the current market, hemp farmers can make up to $300 per acre of hemp. As hemp becomes more solidified within the world economy, that valuation could go up. China has natural advantages for growing hemp. It has a lot of farmland to cultivate the plant on the Eastern coast of the country, where the majority of the population lives. And, while hemp can be grown in almost any climate, China has favorable farming conditions in a majority of its provinces. Not only do they have a climate and terrain that’s perfect for growing hemp, but they have a long history in farming and production. By leveraging their tradition, and production-focused economy, they can really perform well. Long story short, the partnership of hemp and China is a match made in heaven. As China’s creates more finalized products, we’re likely to see a seismic shift in industry power. Chinese firms contain large amounts of capital funding and better production capabilities than most Western firms can afford. U.S. companies should prepare now, as China will inevitably create a major disruption in the industry. At the moment, U.S. companies maintain higher standards in CBD extractions and growing. We always recommend hemp products produced carefully in the U.S. from growing to final production. This is because hemp is a bio accumulator and absorbs and toxins contained in its growing soil. One firm advocating for hemp product expansion in China is the Hanma Investment Group. With a farmland in Yunnan Province under the subsidiary name of Hempsoul that cultivates over 1,600 acres of hemp, Hanma is doubling up with their cultivation of the crop. They not only grow hemp, but they also process it, as Hempsoul is one of a handful of firms that have attained licensing to extract cannabidiol. Other companies such as the Conba Group and Huaren Pharmaceutical are vying for licensing and production in Yunnan Province. In Heilongjiang Province, Chinese firm Shineco plans on building a CBD industrial park. Starting by seeding about 90 acres of field with CBD-rich cannabis seeds, Shineco plans on creating a 3,000–5,000-acre industrial park. The park will accommodate the entire hemp supply-chain, including an extraction plant, growing fields, research center and other buildings for future processing expansion. Much like American firms, Chinese firms work closely with local governments in order to expand and grow their businesses. Even with the high levels of restrictions and remaining stigma, China is still a superpower in our industry. As local and national governments loosen regulations, and production standards improve, China’s influence will only continue to grow."

There, I healed the original wounds of my childhood and my lineage, and I developed a new capacity for self-regulation using a scaffolding of neurobiology and magic, so I no longer need to rely on weed. And now: I’ve got a great product that can help you, too, to heal your cannabis addiction. JK. I’m not gonna sell you some bullshit linear “good survivor” narrative about how I overcame all my obstacles, found the “one perfect solution,” and no longer struggle with any of the problems I used to have. Last time I checked, capitalism still sucks, the earth is still being destroyed by hungry global extraction schemes, women still walk around being violated, and black and brown and queer and trans bodies all over the world are ongoing targets of the very institutions meant to keep us “safe.” So no, I didn’t heal all that shit. If I had a product for that, you’d for real know about it. In reality, my process of healing took years and years and years, and is ongoing. But I’ve learned some things along the way, allowing me to look back, connect the dots, and offer a roadmap for others who are treading similar paths. As any weed-smoker knows, cannabis graciously pulls back the veil again and again, showing us the glimmering, animated universe of beauty and wonder that is always available to us. Learning to tune our bodies into that frequency of reality is basically the center of every spiritual path you’ve ever heard of. A dude called Jesus and his muse, Mary Magdalene, had a pretty compelling way of inviting folks into it, and it changed the course of history. (This also led to a bunch of colonialism and violence — yet another story about what humans sometimes do with good ideas when they get together in groups.) So here I am, knowing that this glimmering place exists, but how the f--k do I get back there again? I couldn’t figure out how to access that place without help. So I kept smoking. Forever. For years. Desperately. Endlessly. Emptily. At friends’ houses, waiting with sweaty palms until someone would pass me the bong. Alone at night, trying to sooth my aching body and heart. I’ve written about this in other articles here, here, here, and endlessly, really, because this story is burning a hole in me, and I’m trying to work it out, and writing is the best way I know how. It’s a forever-chase, unless we find a pathway to routinely experience the thing that is already right here, the thing that our bodies have forgotten. Here’s what I’ve come to know so far about addiction. Beyond the neurobiology of substances, beyond conversations about healing childhood trauma, beyond solutions about how to dismantle systems of oppression so we aren’t so fucking distressed all the time, beyond all that (which is all valid and true and important) is this: If you wanna get high, you gotta remember how to be an animist. You must inhabit a frequency of consciousness that knows, unshakably, that there is no material difference between the vibrating, hyper-vigilant terror of the sensation we call “anxiety” and the wild shrill pleasure of another sensation we call “orgasm.” It’s about getting to the place underneath our pre-frontal cortex, below our feelings and emotional circuitry, below our physical sensations, within and beyond our bodies. There is a deep, pulsing, direct experience of oneness that most of us chase for our whole lives. Weed often helps us see and feel this place, then we end up chasing it forever. We go to Burning Man and chase it. We journey with shaman on ayahuasca. We read books about tantric sex. We go to “authentic relating” events to try to access it in community. We drink until we melt into other bodies with sloppy attempts at connecting to them. We smoke weed until our lungs are sore. But nothing really changes in us; it’s a forever chase unless we find a pathway to routinely experience the thing that is already right here — the thing that our bodies have forgotten. How’d we forget? It’s buried under thousands of years of Empire; forceful indoctrination to mistrust our bodies, to regulate, control, and limit our untamed life energy. It’s buried underneath brains that say things like “I’m trying to get back in touch with my body” as if our body is somehow separate. And it’s buried under a bunch of pathological ideologies about “self” and “control” and “civilization” that humans have created to tell us all kinds of other stories to mask us from seeing things that are already here. See how that happens? So: It’s not a simple path. A zillion and one snake oil salesmen have lined up right next to legit healers and teachers, making it hard to know which way is the right way home. But here’s something I’ve tried that I didn’t come up with alone: I asked cannabis, if she was willing, to show me how to access that pulsing place. And then I humbly asked her how I could serve her, and be in the right kind of relationship with her. This is what I heard her say: The path home is our ancestral birthright of belonging. To get there, we must unlearn the toxic narratives that uphold all systems of oppression so we can see clearly what is in front of us and what can bring us home. We are made of stars. (No, really.) We are made of cannabis, and cannabis is made of us. (Seriously. We share DNA with everything.) We have a bunch of trauma and other bullshit that gets in the way but we can remember this truth together, with each other, and with support. There are many paths to shimmering direct experience. Choose the one that serves you. But please, don’t try to do it alone. You cannot. This story perpetuates the separation myth which is a relatively new story, as far as humans go. Try to unlearn it. Do it with others. Do it in sangha. Do it somatically. And put a container around it so you can focus, which is also known as ritual. Please, do it with an understanding that we are all connected and that we all (seen and unseen beings) matter and impact each other. And do it safely with titration, with community, and with regulatory structures that help you go up, come down, and integrate nice and slow. Above all: Remember that ancestral memories live in our DNA. (Literally, in the protein sheath around the helix. We can read them now like tree rings and they show the impact of trauma.) And let this knowledge guide you to trust that you can remember how to be in communion with all life because you are life, not something separate from it. Your body and cells remember. Ask them. Do it with an understanding that we are all connected, and that we all (seen and unseen beings) matter and impact each other. Look, I could talk about all of this using academic language. I write about relational neuroscience for a living so I could fill in the blanks here about how to build self-regulation in your nervous system, how to understand the neurobiology of addiction so that you can tread carefully based on how your particular trauma has impacted your biochemistry, and whatever the hell else would convince you that accessing this place of deeply pulsing pleasure is possible. But I’m also a witch. And I’m tired of knowing and doing the magic things in mostly secret ritual containers. These practices could really help a handful of humans I know who are getting high all the time without really wanting to, among a zillion other kinds of healing that we all need right now. For now, please promise me you’ll start talking to cannabis and remember that she is your elder and your ancestor. She’s powerful beyond imagination. Ask her for help next time you’re high, or next time you’re thinking about getting high and wishing there was another way. She will likely (it’s up to her) talk back if you listen closely enough. Write me if you need any more support about how to facilitate that conversation if you’ve forgotten how to speak to spirits. I’m here. I’ve got a lot of time on my hands now that I’m not getting high all the time."

Medium.com,Life,"Medical Marijuana Rules, Regulations, & Legislature in Oklahoma (2019)",Cannabis,https://medium.com/greenscreens/medical-marijuana-rules-regulations-legislature-in-oklahoma-2019-c1dc1a3f3e2a?source=topic_page---------42------------------1," Between August and November 2019, the Oklahoma Medical Marijuana Authority (OMMA) will be outlining updates to the rules and regulation surrounding cannabis sales. The updates will be decided within a series of “emergency rule promulgation” activities occurring over the previously mentioned months. One element that has yet to be decided on is what system Oklahoma dispensary owners will be required to use for their seed-to-sale tracking. According to a local news source, OMMA announced their plans on July 13th, and plan to begin enforcing the new compliance regulations by 2020. Business owners in the medical marijuana industry will need to pay close attention, as the new legislature will affect consumers, prescribing physicians, dispensaries, and cultivators. The new legislature covers several aspects of the cannabis industry but does not provide any updates to cannabis sales tax in Oklahoma, which remains at a 7% excise tax at the state level, and a local sales tax that varies. For your convenience, I’ve summarized the new regulations being put forth below. Board Certification: Removed the requirement for physicians issuing recommendations to patients for medical marijuana to be board certified. Patient and Caregiver Application Processing: Update to legislation gives OMMA 14 business days to review and provide a response on patient and caregiver applications. This changes the previous requirement of 14 calendar days. Waste Disposal: This update to Oklahoma legislature authorizes businesses to destroy root balls, stems, fan leaves, and seeds through open burning, incineration, burying, mulching, composting or any other technique approved by the Department of Environmental Quality. Patients: Physicians authorized by and in good standing with the Board of Podiatric Medical Examiners are now able to recommend medical marijuana. Patients: A new short-term, 60-day medical marijuana patient license for Oklahoma patients will soon be available when their physician recommendation is only valid for 60 days. Patients: OMMA is required to share information displayed on medical marijuana licenses with the Oklahoma Law Enforcement Telecommunications System. OMMA is evaluating implementation timelines for this data infrastructure. Patients: Medical marijuana application fees in Oklahoma set to be reduced to $20.00, with a 100% discount for disabled veterans. Application Processing: Extending the timeline for review of business applications to 90 business days. Renewal Applications: The online renewal system will be available starting Aug. 29. Licenses will remain valid and active while the renewal is being processed, even if the renewal processing time goes beyond the expiration date of the license. Residency Requirements: Updates to residency requirements change Oklahoma residency to mean (1) Oklahoma residency for two years preceding the date of application; or (2) five years of continuous Oklahoma residency during the 25 years preceding the date of application. Commercial licensees who were issued a license prior to the enactment of the Oklahoma Medical Marijuana and Patient Protection Act (HB 2612) are exempt from the new two-year or five-year residency requirements. All other business applicants will be subject to the new residency requirements set forth in HB 2612. Certificate of Compliance: All business applicants will be required to provide a certificate of compliance from relevant local government(s) that certifies the applicant is compliant with zoning classifications, municipal ordinances, and all applicable safety, electrical, fire, plumbing, waste, construction and building specification codes. Schools: Increased clarity around the definition of a “School” for the purposes of the 1,000 feet requirement for dispensaries. “School” does not include a homeschool, daycare or childcare facility. Sales: Licensed growers will be authorized to sell seeds, flowers or clones to other licensed growers. Licensed dispensaries will also be able to sell to other licensed dispensaries. Seed-to-Sale: HB 2612 requires the implementation of an electronic seed-to-sale inventory tracking system that will track the entire life-cycle of medical marijuana and requires business licensees to integrate their seed-to-sale tracking system with the seed-to-sale tracking system established by OMMA. Procurement of this system is following state agency procurement requirements prescribed by law, with an anticipated award in early 2020. Testing: Growers and processors will be required to utilize licensed laboratories to test harvest and product batches that are no greater than 10 pounds before any sale, transfer or processing of medical marijuana. Owners of laboratories cannot have a direct or indirect beneficial ownership interest in any licensed dispensary, grower, or processor. Testing requirements are expanded to encompass all medical marijuana. Packaging/labeling: HB 2612 and HB 2601 add packaging and labeling requirements, previously unaddressed in the existing legislation. Compliance: HB 2612 broadens OMMA inspection authority to include all commercial license types and authorizes inspections twice a year with prior notice and additional inspections when necessary due to violations. The following categories are to be added as license categories by 2020. Transporter ($2,500): In addition to the license granted to growers, processors, and dispensaries upon issuance of license, standalone transportation licenses will be made available for the distribution and storage of medical marijuana. Transporter Agent ($100): Required for any agents, employees, officers or owners of a transporter license holder in order to transport medical marijuana. Testing Laboratory ($2,500): Licenses a laboratory to perform testing on medical marijuana. This license is anticipated to be available by early 2020. Education Facility ($500): Licenses a nonprofit entity to provide training and education to individuals involved in the growing, processing, packaging and testing of medical marijuana. This license is anticipated to be available by early 2020.

Medium.com,Life,DIY Psychedelics: Why grow and prepare your own plant medicine,Cannabis,https://medium.com/@jerrytoth/https-medium-com-jerrytoth-diy-psychedelics-109eae84ad5c?source=topic_page---------43------------------1," The beauty of utilizing psychedelic plants, as opposed to synthetics, is a question of intimacy. Especially when you coax a plant into life, care for it, harvest it yourself, and prepare it with your own hands. Unless you’re a chemist, your relationship with a synthetic psychedelic is usually that of a consumer, in the economic sense of the word. Somebody somewhere has created this thing, by a method that we know little or nothing about, and we use money to buy it. In some cases, we even buy it online. It gets shipped to us in a package like earphones. Of course plant medicines can also be purchased like consumer products, and now they often are. This is not entirely a bad thing. I’ll be the first to admit that legally purchasing well-engineered Indica gummies online is better than furtively buying a ratty wad of dry weed from the dude in the park who says “walk with me” as he looks around and shoves a bag into your hand in exchange for a greasy banknote and then later, when you smoke it, you just feel kind of dumb. The legal Cannabis industry is definitely a positive development, as is the decriminalization of Psilocybin and the increasingly-mainstream use of Ayahuasca. But now we’re starting to use these plants like prescription medicine purchased from behind a white counter. It’s okay, I do it too sometimes. I’m not here to beat us up about this. I merely wish to propose an alternative approach, when circumstances allow it. Even if it’s only a few Cannabis plants sitting in pots on the windowsill, or San Pedro cacti in the garden — it’s almost always more rewarding when we grow the plants ourselves. Why? For one, I think we humans have a lot to learn from plants, and not all of these lessons are acquired by consuming them. The process of raising a plant from seed to maturity is an intimate experience. It is an example of co-creation. You create the conditions for its growth, and the DNA of the plant executes the growth in conjunction with the elements. It’s a dynamic partnership. And it’s also a great lesson in patience. Caring for a psychotropic plant also allows you to shape its personality, to some extent. And this, in turn, may allow you to influence the tone of the experience that comes with consuming the plant. Processing the plant yourself adds yet another layer of intimacy as well as security. The best way to trust that a psychedelic substance has been processed and dosed correctly is by doing it yourself. Sure, there’s a bit of a learning curve involved, but with the information available on the internet, the answers are usually within reach. All that you really need is the desire to do it yourself, and a little bit of time. DIY psychedelics are often more economical, as well. Sometimes money isn’t even needed at all. The first Cannabis plants I grew cost me a grand total of zero dollars and zero cents, and they were lovely. I have never once paid for San Pedro, or consumed San Pedro that was prepared by any pair of hands other than my own. And those are the most rewarding psychedelic experiences I’ve ever had. The one caveat is: do your homework beforehand. Train yourself to become an expert. And be smart about it. Cannabis seeds and San Pedro cuttings are both easy to source and to grow at home in many countries. If you’re willing to grow them indoors, the climate doesn’t matter too much — all you need is a window with good sun exposure. I know people who are growing San Pedro as far north as Canada — indoors of course. I also know people who are growing it outdoors as far north as Colorado and all throughout the American southwest, and as far south as New Zealand. In the realm of DIY psychedelics, Cannabis and San Pedro are the low-hanging fruit. Peyote cactus can also be grown at home, but it grows much more slowly than San Pedro and the trip can be less forgiving. Growing Psilocybin mushrooms is also doable, although it’s a more involved process than planting a succulent. Here’s a good 7-step tutorial on growing Psilocybes at home. The other option is to forage for Psilocybes, but only do this if you really know how to identify them. An online psilocybe identification guide can certainly help, and the definitive book on this subject was written by the legendary Paul Stamets. But remember: the consequence of misidentifying wild mushrooms — of any kind — can be a painful death. The more intrepid DIY psychonauts can source Mimosa hostilis root bark (which is legal in the US and most other countries) and then extract the DMT at home. This is not as simple as boiling San Pedro pulp, but it can be done by anyone with access to vinegar, sodium hydroxide, and Naptha or any other solvent easily purchased at a hardware store. PsychonautWiki provides a step-by-step guide. If you live in USDA planting zone 9, you can try growing your own Mimosa hostilis. For everyone else, the more realistic option is to simply order the root bark online and then process it yourself. Several other plants can also be used to extract DMT, but Mimosa hostilis is the gold standard. A relatively simpler option is to grow Morning Glory vines at home, and then consume the seeds. The seeds contain Lysergic Acid Amide (LSA), which is a close relative to LSD. Consuming the former is a bit harder on the stomach, but the effects are comparable. There are many varieties of Morning Glory; the two that are most widely used for consumption are “Heavenly Blue” and “Pearly Gates.” You can even buy these seeds on Amazon. WikiHow provides a tutorial on how to grow Morning Glory vines. On Erowid you can find two different methods of preparation: the extraction method versus the just-chew-them method, both of which have their virtues. Salvia and Iboga can also be grown at home, but they’re not the most user-friendly plants to consume. I’ve tried Salvia twice and that’s enough. It’s a 10-minute journey to another dimension that is not particularly inviting, and the entry is harsher than DMT and 5-MEO. But for some reason Salvia is legal in the US and DMT is not. As for Iboga, this plant requires extreme caution. It goes without saying that the deadly nightshades should not even be considered. I do grow Angel’s Trumpet in Ecuador but only for its sumptuous aroma at night — this plant should never be consumed. It really all comes back to Cannabis and San Pedro. Cannabis-growing tutorials are plentiful, so take your pick. I like the 6-minute video by Leafly on how to grow Cannabis outdoors. San Pedro is a great plant to work with because it’s easy to grow and to consume. The only tools required to prepare it are a knife, a pot of water, and fire. My favorite San Pedro resource is an article called “DIY Mescaline: How to explore San Pedro without a guide.” I’m biased because I wrote it. It covers identification, cultivation, harvest, preparation, and what the experience is like, to the extent that something ineffable can be expressed in words. A more recent article I wrote — “Macro-Dosing Mescaline: The danger of not consuming enough San Pedro” — provides more specific preparation and dosage instructions. I also made a short film about wild San Pedro use in Ecuador, which we shot under the influence of this great cactus. It’s called Kissing Gaia. If you’d like to see the final cut, please send me an email at jerrytoth@hotmail.com and write “SAN PEDRO FILM” in the subject heading. All of this said, I feel obliged to issue two disclaimers. If there are any other psychotropic plants that you think I overlooked, please let me know in the comments section."
Medium.com,Life,Why Consistency Is The Key To Embracing CBD Products,Cannabis,https://medium.com/cbd-wellness/why-consistency-is-the-key-to-embracing-cbd-products-226e73516ed6?source=topic_page---------44------------------1," I have been detailing my journey of wellness with the vital assistance of tested CBD products that I have been lucky enough to sample for the benefit of confirming the hype, that has elevated the marketplace for suppliers, trying to target consumers who are in desperate need of dependable supplements for ravaging symptoms of anxiety and pain. My dependency on alcohol and weed was proving to be a debilitating combo that wasn’t yielding the long-term results that would guarantee my survivability. We hear mostly about the magical phase of getting older with the accompaniment of superstars who’ve managed to miraculously defeat the clinical realities of aging. A slew of A-listers like Jennifer Aniston, Jennifer Lopez, and Julia Roberts, turned the big 5–0 this year, and the glowing reception was enhanced by the physical appearance and infectious optimism of the celebrants, who confirmed the rumors of how amazing it is to reach a milestone of that magnitude, and still look and feel fabulous. Of course, if we had access to the amount of wealth that dictates the lifestyle that keeps ordinariness at bay in favor of extraordinary tendencies, lowly folk like me, could very well attest to the feat of being able to avoid the real life symptoms that attack on command when you enter your forties and beyond. And that’s why the CBD marketplace is the notable ally in this struggle to keep your head above water, when you’re battling the currents that used to glide without interference back when you were in complete control of your template. As a regular gal, who has succumbed to the mandate of a viciously installed healthcare system that doesn’t allow for much flexibility in the realm of erratic hormones and troublesome menstrual cycles, that hint at the dreaded diagnosis that dashes hopes and dreams of motherhood, it was comforting to realize that there are safer options that can provide the relief that doesn’t require the aftermath of hungover episodes. Once I was certain that staying alive and well was the mission at hand, the search began for the options that would make that purpose a reality. As a writer, the objective is to investigate the topics that are of interest for accrued knowledge that can be shared with those who are also curious on a relatable level. This summer was spent indulging in the variety of items that are key players in a growing movement of wellness that aims to provide an open door policy to the outlet of mental and physical enhancement, that doesn’t kill the virus of our discontent, but rather heals the scars in ways that prevent further erosion. After months of careful recordings of examined responses to various items from CBD brands, my recommendation is that consistency is key when it comes to embracing products that pass the test of validity. My latest batch of lovelies helped me sprint to the end of summer with the self-assurance and sheath of calm that was never possible when I relied on my own vices for reinforcement. My favorite way of decompressing and setting up the rest of the day under the umbrella of purified alertness with the presence of mind that keeps faculties protected from the infiltration of mental scammers is with the aid of CBD tinctures, that are seamless to digest without the buzzkill of guiltily indulging with the potent stench that leads to the aftermath that stalls progression. Here are the latest batch of products that could change your life for the better if you’re interested in a much-needed renewal. Again, the only avenue to a better existence is to arm yourself with the tried and true approach that matches your immediate needs and desires. If you’re ready for the stimulus to wellness and vitality, peep my suggestions below. Full Spectrum Tinctures/Hemp Extract in Mango or Raspberry Flavors (500 & 1000mg strength) — HUGS Wellness The motto for HUGS Wellness, an Austin-based company is “self-care starts with self love,” and when you indulge in the array of CBD tinctures that comprise of high-quality and third party lab tested ingredients that include “MCT Oil, Full Spectrum Hemp Extract, Organic Mango or Raspberry extract for flavor” — you will be swiftly convinced that life is good! The everyday battles of trying to maintain the healthy balance of personal obligations with career goals, and the additional stress of a hostile political climate, can take a toll in ways that aren’t always evident until the symptoms are exaggerated. There are no easy fixes, but we can adopt daily supplements to our routines in an effort to experience the waves of relief that supply the immediate rejuvenation that gives our mental and physical cells that extra boost for consistent delivery that doesn’t wear us out. The first impression of the CBD tinctures from Hugs Wellness that are produced in Colorado, was how effortless it was to internalize, with the bottle opening and closing with ease, which can be a surprising and annoying challenge with other products. The flavors provide a pleasant and clean taste that goes down smoothly, and considering the price points and top-notch quality, this product is quite a bargain. I was really impressed with how quickly it begins to calm those nerves without interfering with your thought process, and the cost-effectiveness was the ability to have a little of it go a long way, with a full dropper providing maximum effect. I thoroughly enjoyed the testing period and I must admit that the tinctures from this thriving brand definitely fits my palette and roster of needs better than anything else I’ve tried so far, when it comes to the combination of overall comfort and the convenience of getting what I want within a reasonable period of time, thanks to the affordable potency. Hugs Wellness is committed to the quest of educating consumers about the empowerment that erupts when health and wellness plays a vital role in preventing our hectic schedules from denying us the privilege of living our best lives. The company just made its debut in Spring 2019, and is already becoming one of the pioneering forces of the CBD market with the promise to “bring a new standard of honesty and transparency to the CBD industry by providing the highest quality of ethically sourced product.” And the awesome bonus of being a regular costumer is the philanthropic pursuit that guarantees that a percentage of the company’s earnings will be forwarded to a worthy cause and organization called 10,000 Beds, that has a mission statement of “connecting individuals seeking help for addiction to vetted treatment programs.” There’s nothing better than giving back while also taking care of your body and soul, and with Hugs Wellness, you will find yourself on that path of enlightenment that will be ceaselessly rewarding. All Natural/Full Spectrum CBD Blend Tinctures — Koi CBD Established in 2015, Koi CBD is one of the leading manufacturers of quality CBD products that are made from “99 percent pure cannabidiol extracted through pharma grade processes in a cGMP certified facility.” The objective of Koi CBD is to maintain the high standard of consistent delivery that can be proven to be both effective and authentic without the scamming initiatives of some competitors, that’s polluting the growing marketplace with products that don’t contain the key ingredients of CBD, plastered on the packages. The tinctures come in a variety of flavors and four strength levels with the infusion of 13 distinct terpenes, and in order to have the best experience, consumers have to patiently test how well they respond to the full dropper, which can be taken up to three times daily. The method of intake is the standard procedure of putting the drops underneath the tongue and waiting 15–20 second before digesting. You can even deposit some drops into your favorite beverages if you prefer. The range of flavors should satisfy any palette, and I can attest to how good they all taste without any unpleasantness. It goes down smoothly and since our body compositions differ, the full effects may take longer to manifest or you might feel it almost immediately. The best way to work with tinctures is to follow the instructions and adjust dosage based on what works best for you. You have to patiently listen to your body and notice how well the process is working, and sometimes it will take a week or two to be able to enjoy the benefits. Koi CBD is great for newbies who are still a bit skeptical about the CBD market, but are willing to cautiously explore. There are a plethora of options that can offer the right kind of relief, depending on your needs, and the prices definitely won’t scare you away! THC-Free Agave Beverage Powder — Cannovia As the CBD marketplace continues to expand, consumers are constantly introduced to a wide array of products that accommodate preferences based on lifestyles. I have been able to test CBD tinctures, capsules, gummies, and even mints, and so I was excited to try the Agave Beverage Powder from Cannovia. Cannovia is one of the prominent brands in the CBD realm that’s helping to improve the standards of the crowded marketplace by producing quality items that are pure, based on the method of “farming and harvesting [their] own crops to control the purity of extracts.” Based on the flooding of CBD products which can cause confusion for potential consumers, Cannovia also strives to help educate through the transparency of their operations, which allows for a thorough experience that provides the building of knowledge and power. And you can share the goodness with your pets, by purchasing products that cater to their wellness. The Agave Beverage Powder is an all natural product that’s unflavored and contains no THC, with the boost of being gluten-free. The best way to internalize is by dropping 1/2 a teaspoon into a hot beverage like coffee or tea, 1–3 times daily. For me, the potency as a mood booster was immediate, which is a great way to start my morning! There was no need to take it more than once a day, but again, it really is up to the individual to decide what dosage works best because it boils down to having the experience that matches expectations. This product isn’t cheap, but if you’re looking for a fast-acting, quality CBD product that helps with minimizing stress as well as soothing physical discomforts that affect nerves and muscles, the Agave Beverage Powder is a lifesaver that will provide relief for the trouble spots that will react positively to your daily intake. And don’t forget to be consistent with your embrace of CBD products because that’s the only way to determine what works and what doesn’t, so that you can gradually settle into a routine that will make your journey to health and wellness worth the trip!"

Medium.com,Life,The Downside of Marijuana That Nobody Talks About,Cannabis,https://medium.com/@j3216stone/the-downside-of-marijuana-that-nobody-talks-about-2c4aecdfbf39?source=topic_page---------47------------------1," I’ve been a rock musician for most of my life, and I have smoked my share of marijuana. I found that being a rock musician made drugs easily available to me. I don’t know the reason why, but that’s the way it was. Although I smoked a lot of marijuana, it apparently did not harm me physically. I didn’t get any illness. I didn’t go crazy. I no longer smoke marijuana for reasons I’ll explain below, but my personal view is that marijuana should be legal. Various studies, and many health care professionals, conclude that smoking marijuana does not lead to the serious health conditions that are caused by drinking alcohol or smoking tobacco. I probably don’t have to mention that new uses for marijuana are being found in pain management, relieving chemotherapy symptoms, treating insomnia. Research into marijuana’s benefits are continuing, so we can expect more good news. For those reasons, the movement to legalize marijuana is gathering momentum across the country. It’s not unreasonable to expect it to happen soon. In my opinion, marijuana should be regulated similar to alcohol. Just like stores need a liquor license to sell alcohol, a license should be required to sell marijuana, or to grow it in commercial quantities. To maintain quality of life in our neighborhoods, street sales should be prohibited. Public intoxication, driving under the influence and sales to minors should also be prohibited. Since marijuana doesn’t seem to be more dangerous than other legal drugs like alcohol and tobacco, it seems logical to make it legal for recreational use, as well as medical use. Science has proved that alcohol and tobacco can kill people who use them long term. Not so with marijuana. It has psychological effects, but it is not lethal. Also, not many would want to buy their weed from a drug dealer, if they were given the much safer choice of buying it in a store. Street sales of marijuana would likely dry up, giving less money to criminals. It might even make our streets a little safer. It has long been proposed that marijuana leads to usage of harder drugs, like opioids. In reality, 95% of marijuana users do not go on to stronger drugs. Making marijuana legal will mean that users will no longer have to go to drug dealers to buy it, and making it less likely that marijuana users will be exposed to harder drugs. To say that marijuana is no more harmful than alcohol or tobacco does not mean there are no bad effects. Although marijuana hasn’t been shown to be as lethal as long term use of alcohol or tobacco can be, there are still problems. Short term use can cause paranoia, impaired driving, sexual dysfunction in men, coordination problems, hallucinations. These symptoms generally go away as the drug wears off. Heavy long term use of marijuana is most problematic in young people. It can permanently lower the IQ, if started early in life. It doesn’t seem to cause that problem in adults. But there are more serious effects of long term marijuana use. In the efforts to legalize it, little attention is paid to the damage it can do to one’s quality of life. Marijuana might not kill you, but it can mess you up. Long term use can cause the following: A person is not going to get ahead with all that going on. Suffering from just a few of the above effects can lead to a decline in the satisfaction of life. People like to smoke marijuana because it works. It will make you feel good. That is also the downside of marijuana. It works too well. It kept me feeling good as my life slowly became more and more unmanageable. I experienced every one of those seven long term effects listed above: There is a common thread to all this: Whenever I was sober and started to worry about how my life was going downhill, I would just smoke another joint. That would send me back into my blissful, carefree illusion that I was doing fine. The decline in the quality of my life was very slow and gradual. It was easy to keep the illusion going at first. All I had to do was keep smoking the weed. But eventually, I was failing in school. And then, I wasn’t getting any work as a musician. That’s when it hit me. I had totally screwed up my life by being irresponsible. It was like everything had suddenly gone to hell when I wasn’t looking. It is ironic that I started smoking marijuana to feel good, but it ended up making me feel bad. I should have seen what was happening, but I was high all the time and I didn’t see it coming. Marijuana is currently being promoted as a useful, safe drug, but there is that serious downside for the habitual user. It took me years to get my life back on track. But I don’t have a problem with anyone using marijuana in the privacy of their home. It’s a personal decision. The occasional, light user will likely never have a problem. It is only when it becomes a long term habit that life can become unmanageable. I didn’t write this piece to preach on whether anyone should smoke marijuana or not. Just educate yourself and be careful. My one go round with marijuana was enough for me because I’m the type of person that might overdo it again. But everyone is not like me, so I’m not going to take a position on what others should do. Your life. Your choice."
Medium.com,Life,A Complete Introduction To Terpenes,Cannabis,https://medium.com/@ministryofhemp/a-complete-introduction-to-terpenes-81717a977019?source=topic_page---------48------------------1," Terpenes are natural compounds found in all forms of hemp and cannabis that give the plant its bouquet of smells. In addition, terpenes work in concert with the better known compounds found in the plant such as the cannabinoids THC and CBD to provide their own unique health benefits. One reason we enjoy writing about hemp is the opportunity to learn new cannabinoid science and then get to share it with our readers. We’ve said it before, but it bears repeating, there really is so much more to the cannabis plant than just CBD and THC. Of course, both of these two cannabinoids, along with the other hundred or so cannabinoids, are instrumental in the healing and feel better properties of the cannabis plant. But increasingly researchers believe other parts of the hemp plant work synergistically with the cannabinoids to maximize the healing properties, Today’s article focuses on one of those parts: terpenes. While all forms of hemp contain terpenes, some are especially prevalent in psychoactive cannabis (“marijuana”), which we’ve noted below. Cannabis isn’t the only plant that produces terpenes. According to Wikipedia, terpenes “are a large and diverse class of organic compounds, produced by a variety of plants, particularly conifers.” Terpenes give these plants their unique scents and assist plants in a variety of ways. Terpenes attract pollenating insects for plant reproduction. They also ward off or even kill predators. They slow plant maturation and regulate metabolism. Terpenes are a major component of plants’ essential oils. Aromatherapy treatments frequently use terpenes due to their medicinal properties. Some terpenes develop because of stress to a plant, like excessive heat. The exact number of terpenes found in the cannabis plant ranges between 100–200 depending on different variations in scientific classification. For example, the popular terpene limonene gives citrus fruits their unique smells. It is found in both lemons and oranges, but in different concentrations thus creating a different scent, or variations. Here we discuss nine primary terpenes found in hemp and share the healing properties of each. Below, we look at 9 of the most prominent terpenes: mycerne, limonene, carophyllene, pinene (Alpha/Beta), terpineol, borneol, linalool, eucalyptol, and nerolidol. Mycerne is the most common terpene found in hemp. In some strains, over 60% of the essential oil is made up of mycerne. It smells very similar to cloves. Scientists consider myrcene a potent analgesic, anti-inflammatory, and antibiotic. Mycerne blocks cytochrome, aflatoxin B, and other pro-mutagenic carcinogens. It has a relaxing, calming, anti-spasmodic, and sedative effect. Myrcene works synergistically with THC and may also increase the psychoactive potential. The essential oil of citrus fruits contains high levels of myrcene. Many claim that eating a mango 45 minutes before consuming psychoactive cannabis results in a faster onset and greater intensity. Limonene is often the second, third or fourth terpene found in cannabis resin and produces the smell we find in citrus fruits. Like mycerne, limonene contains anti-fungal, anti-bacterial, and anti-carcinogenic properties. It is also said to protect against Aspergillus and other carcinogens found in smoke. Even more, a cancer study from 2013 revealed that terpene reduces tumors in women with early-stage breast cancer. Limonene quickly and easily penetrates the blood barrier, which increases systolic pressure. What’s more, some experts say limonene increases attention, mental focus, well-being, and sex drive. Citrus fruit rinds, rosemary, juniper, peppermint, and several pine needle oils all contain limonene. Many herbs and spices contain caryophyllene. Black pepper contains high amounts, giving it that spicy flavor. As with the previous two terpenes, caryophyllene has anti-inflammatory, analgesic, and anti-fungal properties. It has affinity for our bodies’ CB2 receptors making it a common ingredient for anti-inflammatory topicals and creams. Topical application of caryophyllene also relieves toothaches. One interesting note about this terpene is its promising role in alcohol rehabilitation. In a study on mice, scientists found that caryophyllene reduces the voluntary intake of alcohol. In addition to black pepper, Thai basils, cloves, and cinnamon leaves have caryophyllene. Lavender also produces caryophyllene in small quantities. Pinene, as the name implies, creates the smell associated with pine and fir trees. Doctors use pinene in medicines as an expectorant, bronchodilator, anti-inflammatory and local antiseptic. Pinene also improves concentration, personal satisfaction, and energy. Patients suffering from arthritis, Crohn’s Disease, and cancer may benefit from pinene. A unique fact about pinene: Smoking cannabis with high levels of Pinene may give the sensation of sucking more air, which can lead to coughing or hyperventilation. Many conifers and non-coniferous plants, balsamic resin, pinewoods, and some citrus fruits produce pinene. Terpineol smells of lilacs, crabapple, blossoms, and lime blossoms. Plants with high-levels of pinene often also produce terpineol. If you’ve ever enjoyed Lapsang souchong tea, part of the flavor came from the terpineol in the pine smoke used during processing. Terpineol creates a sedative effect often connected to indica strains of psychoactive cannabis. During tests on mice, terpineol reduced mobility by 45 percent. Experts also believe terpineol has antibiotic and antioxidant properties. Commercial producers of terpineol often derive this terpene from Monterey cypress trees. Borneol smells like mint and camphor. Chinese herbalists use borneol in medicines against fatigue, stress, lingering illness. Some researchers believe this terpene’s natural insect repellent properties and could be used against diseases caused by ticks, fleas, and mosquitoes such as West Nile Virus. One study published even show that borneol kills breast cancer cells. Linalool has a floral smell similar to lavender and spring flowers. It is currently being used in the treatment of various cancers. Linalool has a calming action, antianxiety, and produces sedative effects. Linalool is responsible for the sedative effects of certain psychoactive cannabis strains. In tests on mice their activity decreased by 75%. It also has analgesic and anti-epileptic properties. Patients suffering from arthritis, depression, seizures, insomnia and cancer have all found relief with this terpene. The Lamiaceae plant and herb family, which includes mints, laurels, cinnamon, rosewood, and Birch trees, all produce linalool. Linalool is a precursor in the formation of Vitamin E. Eucalyptol is the main ingredient in eucalyptus essential oil. It has a minty smell and found in small amounts in psychoactive cannabis. Eucalyptol relieves pain, improves concentration, and inner balance. Plants containing eucalyptol enhance meditation and concentration. It is showing promise as a treatment for Alzheimer’s, but it’s still in early stages of research. The Eucalyptus plant, bay leaves, sage, sweet basil, and cardamom contain notable quantities of eucalyptol. Nerolidol has a unique woody and fresh bark aroma. Nerolidol contains anti-fungal, anti-cancer, and anti-malarial properties. It may prevent certain kinds of parasites. Neroli, ginger, jasmine, lavender, and tea tree oil contain nerolidol. Again, these are just some of the most common terpenes found in hemp and cannabis. There are many more. These profiles were summarized from Alchimia and Greencamp, where you you can read more on terpenes. After reading this article, we hope you understand how the benefits of terpenes and pair so perfectly with the benefits of CBD, and all the other cannabinoids. We hope you start incorporating them into your daily CBD regimen. More and more CBD supplement companies recognize the importance of terpenes and now add different terpenes to their products to supplement those already found in hemp. Some brands even sell terpene concentrates for customers to incorporate on their own. However, if you’re unable to find the terpenes you want through your local CBD store or online, try looking to a non-cannabis plant type or spice and simply combine with your CBD. You might not achieve the same synergistic effect as when the terpenes are naturally present, but you should still receive the healing properties of the terpenes themselves and the healing properties of the CBD."
Medium.com,Life,What are Retail Cannabis Regulations and Sales Tax in Illinois?,Cannabis,https://medium.com/greenscreens/what-are-retail-cannabis-regulations-and-sales-tax-in-illinois-621f575865c8?source=topic_page---------49------------------1," Recreational cannabis will become legal in the state of Illinois starting in January 2020. Governor J.B. Pritzker recently signed a bill that allows the sale of recreational cannabis, as well as puts forth new legislation to handle regulating the industry. The new legislation covers taxes, restrictions on who can purchase cannabis, how much cannabis an individual can purchase, and a potential route for expunging those convicted of cannabis-related crimes. While the state isn’t the first to legalize cannabis, it is the first to do so hand-in-hand with aggressive social equity legislature. Providing clear routes for the benefits of recreational marijuana on an economic level to reach low-income communities. The Illinois state government has made a point of using the future revenue generated from marijuana taxation to invest in impoverished communities. The underlying goal is to drive value into the hands of those who have been jailed over cannabis-related crimes. [H2] Creating Social Equity through Criminal Expungement There are almost 800,000 people in Illinois with criminal records tied to minor cannabis-related convictions. Those whose crimes involved possessing less than 30 grams of marijuana now have a chance to have their crimes expunged. While the cannabis user demographic is diverse, the majority of cannabis-related arrests in Illinois were involving minorities. In an attempt to create “social equity”, Illinois will also give preference to minority business owners in low-income areas who apply for licenses as vendors or retail outlets. They’ve also dedicated 25% of the tax revenue generated from recreational cannabis to developing low-income communities. The Cannabis Regulation and Tax Act (CRTA) passed in the House on May 31. This allows anyone above the age of 21 to buy or consume cannabis in Illinois. Adults who wish to purchase cannabis will be allowed to hold up to 30 grams of flower at a time, 5 grams of concentrate, and 5 grams of THC infused products (edibles). Under CRTA, it is still illegal for Illinois residents to grow cannabis unless they have a medical marijuana license.

Medium.com,Life,New Marijuana Breathalyzer is a Dud — But That Doesn’t Stop Cops from Using It,Cannabis,https://medium.com/@hdyerjr/new-marijuana-breathalyzer-turns-out-to-be-a-dud-but-doesnt-stop-cops-from-using-it-16b5819f4393?source=topic_page---------52------------------1," As
marijuana is rapidly being legalized throughout the United States, state, county, and city law and police forces are likewise in a mad dash to figure out how to maintain their arrest, conviction and incarceration rates, which have heretofore heavily relied on busting people for everything from paraphernalia, twigs and seeds, to pounds, to tons of the stuff. To date, 33 states have legalized marijuana in some form. In Illinois, recreational use, possession and sale of the demon weed becomes perfectly legal on January 1 of next year. Medical marijuana has been legal for some time here, and possession of less than an ounce has also been basically decriminalized. But that hasn’t stopped cops from hassling and harassing, and yes, arresting, marijuana possessors and users and sellers on the streets of Chicago — especially the South and West Side streets of Chicago, where most black Chicagoans live. This means Chicago will become the second largest city in the country where marijuana is legal. (Los Angeles beat us by a few months, but California is still arguing over what it all means). But, again, now that the whole enchilada will soon become a non-crime, what are cops supposed to do? Busting people, especially black people, for marijuana in Chicago and many other cities is something of a sport; indeed, it’s a traditional part of the normal routine among cops, to the point of…addiction. Will they, can they now break their habit? Or will they find new ways to feed it? Enter the magical marijuana breathalyzer. Of course driving while high on anything is always taboo. In terms of marijuana-use detection, current breathalyzers do not and cannot accurately measure either the amount and certainly not the effect of THC (tetrahydrocannabinol) in one’s system. And, because THC, the “active ingredient” of marijuana, metabolizes far differently from alcohol, some police and prosecutors are hesitant to use results of the current methods in court. Other THC testing procedures have traditionally used blood, hair, and urine to determine whether or not one is “high” on marijuana. Still, these tests only detect the presence of THC, not the amount, or for how long it has been since your last joint, or anything else for that matter. And the mere presence of THC does not indicate impairment. An urban legend confirms science in that THC can be detected in one’s system from thirty to as long as forty-five days. However, University of Pittsburgh chemists and engineers claim to have resolved these issues by use of carbon nanotubes in their new breathalyzer. It works like this: THC molecules in your breath, bind with the tubes and alter their electrical properties, while sensors detect levels of the compound with an accuracy comparable to, or better than, mass spectrometry, the gold standard for THC detection. The semiconductor carbon nanotubes that we are using weren’t available even a few years ago,” said Sean Hwang, lead author of the paper published in the journal ACS Sensors. We used machine learning to “teach” the breathalyzer to recognize the presence of THC based on the electrical currents recovery time, even when there are other substances, like alcohol, present in the breath. This sounds nice…all technical and such. But does this mean that this new breathalyzer, this new test, can determine how high a person is? Not really, say these researchers. It’s an ongoing “challenge” they are confronting and grappling with. Indeed, Ervin Sejdic, a professor of electrical and computer engineering at Pitt and who has been tasked to build the prototype for this breathalyzer, readily admits that at this stage of development, his breathalyzer cannot determine how stoned someone is or is not. Yet, in the next breath, Professor Sejdic insists that his breathalyzer is nearly ready for mass production. As NPR reports: “With alcohol, you can figure out impairment by measuring the amount of alcohol in someone’s blood, which you can determine from a Breathalyzer using the ‘blood to breath,’ or ‘partition,’ ratio. Make that translation from breath to blood to brain, and you have a relatively accurate sense of how drunk someone is. “Chris Halsor is a Denver attorney where pot has been legal since 2014. Halsor’s practice concentrates on issues around legal cannabis. ‘So when it comes to these marijuana breath tests…..that’s the million-dollar question right now,’ he says. So, what does that question look like? “Is there a specific ratio that links the amount of THC in someone’s breath to the amount in the person’s blood — and then to exactly how ‘high’ that person is? “‘No’, Sejdic says, in answer to his own question. That correlation does not exist in this new breathalyzer and ‘is basically missing, from a scientific point of view.’ “In legal states, you’ll see road signs that say ‘Drive High, Get a DUI,’ but there has not been a reliable and practical way to enforce that,’ said Dr. Alex Star, whose lab developed the prototype. ‘There are debates in the legal community about what levels of THC would amount to a DUI, but creating such a device is an important first step toward making sure people don’t partake and drive.’” Again, driving while impaired is a definite no-no. But, despite this new breathalyzer, there is, as of yet, no reliable, definitive, and accurate test to determine impairment after smoking weed; and comparison to alcohol consumption amounts to an “apples-to-oranges” analysis. But none of this has stopped cops and the prosecutors they report to from conducting “checkpoint” stops to determine, simply, whether any amount whatsoever of THC is in folks’ systems. As reported last year, the Massachusetts State Police are using a saliva swab to detect drivers under the influence of cannabis. They tested about 170 people at sobriety checkpoints and drug treatment clinics using these swabs, but even they are reluctant to use these results in court. Similar programs have been initiated in Colorado, California, Kansas, and Michigan. That same report, on the contrary, revealed that legal weed may actually be making drivers safer. The Nevada Department of Public Safety reports that deaths from traffic accidents there have dropped by over 10 percent in the first year that marijuana was legalized for recreational use. Prior to legalization in Nevada, between July 2016 and May 2017, 310 people died in traffic accidents, but in the year since legalization, between July 2017 and May 2018, that number has fallen to just 277. More? A study published by the American Public Health Association found that states with legal medical cannabis have lower rates of traffic fatalities than states with full prohibition. Yes, yes, yes.…. correlation does not necessarily mean causation. But the statistics cannot be ignored. These numbers indicate that legalization appears to actually make the roads safer, debunking even one’s commonsense belief that DUIs would likely increase with legalization. But beyond commonsense, marijuana critics happily cite statistics indicating how very often people test positive for marijuana after car accidents. That is noteworthy as far as it goes….but it does not go far enough. What these naked numbers and assessments usually do not mention are the many numerous and varied other drugs, particularly alcohol or opiates, which are also found in auto crash victims’ systems. These drugs obviously have a much greater affect and effect on anyone’s motor skills. So, let us summarize. What we have here is a shiny new device that will tell police that you have THC in your system; but it cannot tell them how long ago you indulged, how much you smoked or used, how high you are right this minute — or why you blew that stop sign. Nor is there any medical or legal standard which determines or even suggests that one is “stoned” on marijuana. All of which leaves us exactly where we have always been: at the mercy of, at the “discretion” of individual police officers — at least until we can get into court, spend untold amounts of money on attorneys and experts, in order to “prove” that you were not “high” when the “arresting officer” pulled you over (or whenever he or she decided to confront you at any time or at any place). So if these things do not perform as advertised (inform law enforcement of the level of one’s “impairment”), then what’s the point of having them, using them? My guess is that this is more about shoring up and solidifying the American police state by providing it with yet another “tool” (think Rambo-style cops with military-grade equipment of every type except perhaps nuclear bombs, surveillance cameras everywhere, license plate readers, see-through-walls technology, eavesdropping through any or all of one’s personal “devices”). T
he American police state is chomping at the bit to get this new breathalyzer into cops’ hands and they are just as eager to receive it."

Medium.com,Life,How CBD Saved My Life And Helped Me Graduate College,Cannabis,https://medium.com/@kaytchristensen/how-cbd-saved-my-life-and-helped-me-graduate-college-c0b06af03f5f?source=topic_page---------55------------------1," Let me get this out of the way before I continue: Anxiety is a bitch. I’ve dealt and struggled with anxiety for most of my life, beginning in middle school. It’s progressively gotten harder to manage, but I never thought it would prevent me from succeeding in life, or even living day today. That was until the spring semester of my final year in college rolled around. I had a panic attack in the middle of February 2019, just a month into my last semester. I couldn’t tell then, and still am not sure now, what brought it on as they aren’t usual symptoms of my anxiety. This event threw me into a massive downward spiral. My heart-rate skyrocketed to 126 beats per minute while I was lying in bed. I ran (ok, realistically, I took a bus and very slowly walked to) my school’s health center. I was convinced something was detrimentally wrong with me. I must be dying, I must be gravely ill, I must have some sort of heart condition I previously knew nothing about. I couldn’t breathe. I couldn’t stop crying. My chest, everything hurt. Something had to explain this. This diagnosis was meant to ease my mind as they sent me to my school’s mental health case manager, who was meant to help me find a therapist or psychiatrist who could help me beyond school walls. Instead, I was told this often happens to graduating seniors, that I should meditate and try deep breathing techniques, and that I’d be fine. I was scared and exhausted, and my anxiety only grew. Every headache due to lack of sleep became an undiagnosed tumor in my mind. Every dizzy spell was the sign of illness. Every nauseating step from one side of my room to the other felt impossible. I cried non-stop for 9 days. I called my parents every moment I could just to hear them tell me I wasn’t dying, and that it would pass. I was miserable. This feeling of utter dread, hopelessness, and despair lasted another three weeks. I missed 8 classes in those three weeks, a significant amount considering I only had each class once a week. I sent my professors desperate emails trying to convey how hard I was trying to pass their classes and graduate. Thankfully, I’d had most of the professors beforehand, and they were kind and understanding, trying to help me as much as possible. I took a nine-hour bus ride from San Francisco to Anaheim, California. I couldn’t stand the thought of getting on a plane given my mental state at the time, I thought I would’ve passed out due to fear. I hadn’t slept in weeks, and falling into my parents' arms finally after nearly a month of constant panic was a welcomed relief. Spring break came in went. March was nearing an end, and I found myself back in San Francisco without really recognizing how I got there. I was in a haze of fear, wondering if the panic would set back in as intensely as before. I got myself to classes so I wouldn’t fail, but otherwise, I was locked in my room. Afraid stepping outside would cause lightning to strike me down, and smite me for trying to enjoy my last months in the city I loved with friends. It was exhausting explaining to everyone why I didn’t want to go out and celebrate anything, it was defeating when I realized I wasn’t even excited for my book release that was set for the middle of May. My birthday was mere weeks away in April, and I was reaching the end of my wits. I wasn’t a stranger to weed at that time. In the years previous, I’d tried joints and edibles in the past. While I enjoyed the high and feeling they gave me more than drinking alcohol, as I felt more in control of myself and more coherent, I’d stopped all drinking and smoking habits months prior when the panic had originally set in. I started reading testimonials of how people with anxiety had taken up CBD, how some had completely eradicated anxiety from their lives, and how others were much better equipped to deal with it on a day to day basis. I was desperate for relief and decided to order myself a bottle of 500mg pure CBD peppermint oil. What did I have to lose? My package came days later and proceeded to sit on my bedside table for a week. My anxiety began to play through scenarios in my head. What if you’re the first person to have an adverse reaction to CBD? What if it makes things worse? What if this doesn’t help at all? The end of April was here. I had less than one month left of college, finals and papers were creeping up along with graduation and the release of my first book. It was now or never. My friends, both online and off, god bless them, encouraged me to try it for a few days consistently. They stayed with me for a few hours after each dose to ease my mind, and show me that I had support if something ever did go wrong. They’re company and support is something I will always be grateful for. I let myself laugh one night. Four days into taking one 15mL dropper of CBD oil per day, and I actually found myself laughing for the first time in months. I didn’t miss any more classes and actually started participating in them again. I didn’t constantly worry about tumors, or aneurysms, or dropping dead. I began to be able to refocus my life, after months of being held hostage by my anxiety. It’s allowed me to graduate college. Celebrate the publication of my first book. Move 500 miles back home. Grieve the loss of two dogs. It’s allowed me to feel all my emotions again, rather than just one desperate overbearing sensation of fear. I still deal with anxiety on a daily basis. But CBD has allowed me to live with it, rather than in fear of it."
Medium.com,Life,"Crisis Looms For Cannabis Industry As Bootleg Vape Toll Passes 1,000",Cannabis,https://medium.com/marijuana-wire/dispensary-oil-implicated-in-second-cannabis-vaping-death-a4d974add92?source=topic_page---------56------------------1," [Originally reported in The Marijuana Times] As reported in August by The Marijuana Times, a teenager from Long Island, New York — whose lungs were severely damaged — denied vaping cannabis right up until he almost died and his family, desperate for answers, searched his bedroom, finding a black market cartridge containing THC. His doctor has said the boy’s lungs are permanently impaired. One of the worst-kept secrets among American teenagers and young adults is the ready availability of black market THC oils and cartridges, many of which are packaged to look like legitimate licensed products and sold at a deep discount from dispensary prices. Some enterprising outlaws are buying inexpensive “shake,” the leftover leaves from trimmed buds, and cooking their own cannabis oil in their basements and garages, then selling it like modern-day bootleggers. The process of making the oil concentrates the THC but also the contaminants. Vaping THC instead of smoking it has become popular because the vape devices look similar to e-cigarettes, or the oil can be put into an e-cigarette, and the vapor produced is nearly odorless. A teenager can get high in the back of a classroom, or an employee in the office bathroom, completely undetected or, at worst, presumed to be just getting a hit of nicotine. Gregory Conley, president of the e-cigarette trade group American Vaping Association, said federal agencies should crack down on black market THC vapes. He noted that e-cigarettes and nicotine oils have been in widespread use for years, while the outbreak of lung illnesses tied to vaping only began this summer. Officially, the cause is urgently under investigation. But as first reported in The Marijuana Times in June, the Sheriff’s Department in Mendocino County, California intercepted a large shipment of illegal THC cartridges last spring that were found to contain an astronomical concentration of a fungicide — myclobutanil — which, when heated, converts into a deadly form of cyanide. Because of that characteristic, myclobutanil (sold under the brands Eagle 20 or Nova 40) is banned in Canada, Colorado, Washington, and Oregon for the production of medical and recreational marijuana. It is illegal to use it on tobacco plants anywhere in the US. But it is widely used on crops such as grapes and almonds, which means myclobutanil is everywhere in California and easy for outlaw growers to buy and use. Fungus is a major headache in cannabis cultivation. An outbreak can destroy a year’s worth of work. The danger of myclobutanil has been floating around the cannabis agenda for several years. In 2017, as the California Department of Pesticide Regulation prepared draft regulations regarding the use of pesticides and fertilizers on cannabis, scientists warned that myclobutanil “is incredibly dangerous in smokable cannabis.” The black market cannabis oil tested in Mendocino County had a concentration of myclobutanil that is 7,300 times the limit set by the department. The lab that did the test is part of a larger operation in Mendocino that specializes in cleaning cannabis oil of contaminants. David Kurzfeld, a partner and head of sales at Modular Processing Systems in Willits, California, recently told The Marijuana Times that the state has yet to come to grips with the amount of contaminated cannabis that is finding its way into the nation’s markets. “People have brought us cannabis oil to be purified that was so toxic I wouldn’t even rub it on my skin. By the time we get done, it’s completely decontaminated and safe. But we’re only seeing a small slice of the amount of product that’s ending up being used by consumers.” Kurzfeld said it is common practice even among legal cannabis growers to unload contaminated weed that doesn’t meet state standards by selling it cheap on the black market. He also noted that the way contaminated oil is heated may be a factor in the lung illnesses. “The kids sometimes get the oil straight, not in cartridges, scoop it into a bowl, heat it with a torch until it’s smoking, and inhale it. (Myclobutanil begins to release hydrogen cyanide above 400 degrees.) Imagine them, coating their entire lungs with huge concentrations of all sorts of contaminants!” Kurzfeld echoed comments by others interviewed for this article, that the problem stems from the fact that California—the source of much of the cannabis consumed in the US—legalized marijuana before it was prepared to effectively regulate it. To grow, process, and market marijuana products in California is an arduous, costly process at best. Furthermore, Kurzfeld says, state inspectors on the ground are few and far between. Those he’s worked with, “don’t last very long. They either quit or get fired.” The epidemic of vaping-related illness—now referred to as Vaping Associated Pulmonary Injury (VAPI)—is likely to get worse before it gets better. Cases are popping up all over the country, so it’s an outbreak that cannot easily be contained or explained. There may be many factors at work. Some have suggested that processors may be using unknown additives that may be toxic or become toxic when mixed or heated or consumed. The cartridges themselves may be a contributing factor. In California, laboratories have identified the presence of lead that may be leaching from the Chinese made cartridges into the oil. The crisis is unfolding at a pivotal moment in the development of the legitimate cannabis industry and could prove to be a big stick in its spokes. In the past few months industry executives say they have seen a rapid shift in the market, from traditional recreational smokers to a more mainstream audience interested in health and wellness. Ed Schmults, CEO of Las Vegas-based Calyx Peak Companies, recently told Forbes.com, “I’ve been astonished at how many older friends and family — people who before would have been too shy to ask — are coming to me with pens and notepads, asking me for advice about products for insomnia, pain, anxiety, etc. Everything is happening much faster than we anticipated.” In a twist on the way that Prohibition led to adulterated alcohol that injured and killed unsuspecting users, legalization of marijuana may suffer from the unintended consequence of too much legalization too soon, and too little regulation too late."
Medium.com,Life,The Ultimate Guide to Marketing Your Dispensary,Cannabis,https://medium.com/greenscreens/the-ultimate-guide-to-marketing-your-dispensary-d45494c4dbd5?source=topic_page---------57------------------1," Whether you’re a new dispensary owner or a part-time Elvis impersonator, you need to attract customers to succeed. Marketing is the act of acquiring customers through messaging. That messaging can be the copy on your website, a caption in an Instagram post, or even the way your branding makes customers feel when they enter your store. Marketing is how you connect with your existing customers and find new ones. As crucial as it is, small businesses often skimp on these efforts. The problem with marketing is, there isn’t a right answer. With accounting, finance, sales: there is a clear right answer. Either the books are balanced or they aren’t, either you converted the customer or you didn’t, etc. With marketing, your responsibilities touch on several different aspects of your dispensary. Marketing helps budtenders, it helps cultivators find your store and attracts customers to your door. Because of this, there isn’t one clear path to success in marketing. It changes from company to company, depending on their goals, the budget available, and the size of the team that can execute. As you read this guide to dispensary marketing, keep in mind that it’s better to do a few things extremely well and consistently than it is to do everything on this list mediocrely. Your brand is who you are as a company. It’s your identity, your sense of humor, your values, and your mission. We’ll be looking at two aspects of branding: cultural branding and visual branding. Branding encompasses everything from your logo, the color scheme on your menu, to the fonts you use on your website. Some companies don’t prioritize branding in their marketing strategy because it doesn’t necessarily move the bottom line. That being said, in hyper-competitive industries like retail marijuana, branding is often the only way to differentiate yourself from competitors. You can’t stop a competing dispensary from carrying the same products as you, but at least you can make sure they don’t look as cool doing it. This is your identity, who your target audience is, your values, and your mission/vision. Your mission is what you’re doing now to create your vision. Example: Let’s say that Joey is a military veteran and he brings aspects of military culture into his brand. His main priority is selling cannabis, but he’s seen what prescription drugs have done to fellow vets and wants to educate them on cannabis as an alternative. Mission Statement: To make a comfortable and friendly environment for military veterans to purchase retail marijuana products and educate them on the benefits of cannabis and opportunities in the industry. Vision Statement: Help ease the unemployment and opioid epidemics plaguing our veterans by giving them jobs in a network of dispensaries, and the tools they need to educate their peers. This doesn’t mean Joe is only going to sell to veterans, they’re just his target market. It’s how he will differentiate himself from the competition, and shows customers his values. If a customer identifies with the same values, he or she might be with Joe for a lifetime. Your visual branding is how you convey your mission and values to your audience. Joe and his veteran-focused dispensary might incorporate a lot of greens into his color scheme to show his military ties. Or perhaps it’s represented in his logo. Visual branding includes the following assets: You don’t need each of these to get started, but having at least a logo, fonts, and color scheme ironed out is essential. Once the basic foundation of the brand has been determined, make sure there’s uniformity everywhere your brand is displayed. The goal of branding is to get customers to relate to your brand and build loyalty- they can’t do this if your brand keeps changing! Having trouble with your dispensary menu branding or design? Check out our dispensary menu design guide. Dispensary owners don’t need to break the bank when creating a new website. Don’t be intimidated by developers high hourly rates. If your budget is tight, there are plenty of easy and cheap methods to create a website yourself. Your website is a brochure for your dispensary, it should display all the information a customer will need about your business. What information do you need on your dispensary website? When designing your website it’s important to optimize it for mobile devices. 58% of website traffic in 2018 came from mobile devices. If you’re targeting a younger demographic then it’s likely that percentage is even higher. Limit paragraph lengths to there aren’t any large blocks of text. On mobile devices, lengthy paragraphs can intimidate readers and stop them from consuming the content. Use high-quality images but ensure that the file size on these images isn’t too large otherwise, it will slow down the load time on your site. Most importantly, keep it simple. Collect customer information whenever possible. You’ll notice that #6 on the list of information to keep on your dispensary website is “Email Capture”. Email capture is simply an input box where customers can give you their email. Customers will leave their email to stay up to date on sales, promotions, and general news about your industry (if news-focused content is a part of your content offering). Building an email database is extremely important. You can use tools like MailChimp or Drip to create email lists of dispensary customers and even segment them based on their buying habits. If someone only buys flower then you can serve them sales and promotions around flower, for example. There are three types of emails in email marketing: Transactional emails are automated messages usually sent by a POS system if the customer inputs their email at the point of sale. Email newsletters are an extension of your brand, they show customers what you care about, what you’ve been up to, and what deals they can take advantage of at your store. They typically come out at a regular tempo such as weekly or monthly. Finally, direct emails are essentially everything else. They can be an email blast to everyone who’s visited your site, or an announcement about a new product line your offering. Content marketing is the act of distributing content designed to bring value to a specific audience. It can be used to spread awareness of your brand, and educate customers about your products. Content marketing is also crucial to developing strong SEO. The more high-quality content there is on your site, the higher Google will rank it — bringing even more attention to your content! Publishings blogs and case studies are a great method to build authority in your market. This content can be shared on social media for additional reach, helps SEO on your website, and shows your audience that you are knowledgeable about your industry. Think about what your customers will search for when they want one of your products. Do they want to learn more about the differences between Indica and Sativa? Do they want to know where they can get the best deal on a certain strain? If you have the ability to survey some of your existing customers — do it! Ask them about how they found you, and if there’s any information about cannabis products they’d like that isn’t readily available. Come up with a content roadmap, or a schedule for when you’ll post your blogs, and what the blogs will be about. Pick a regular cadence (how often you post) and stick to it. Consistency is extremely important in content marketing. Because the retail cannabis industry is so young, there is a lot of room for high-quality video content. There are very few resources for cannabis consumers who want trustworthy information from credible sources. Creating high-quality video content that you believe your audience will resonate with is a great way to establish yourself as an authority in the industry. This also adds to your brand value. When you show your audience that you produce high-quality content, it’s easy for them to assume that you only hold the highest quality products as well. Search engine marketing is pivotal for dispensary sales. There’s no better way to get in front of your customer when they’re looking for your service than Google advertisements. Setting up your dispensary with a “Google My Business” profile is also a great way to increase your ranking with Google. Running Adwords campaigns, keeping your web pages search engine optimized, and publishing valuable content consistently are the keys to improving your page ranking on Google. SEO is a long process that often takes time to generate results but is a crucial aspect of any digital marketing strategy. Originally published on GreenScreens"

ecades ago I suffered a severe electric shock that left me afraid of turning on a clothes dryer for years. At the time, I didn’t have any of the mental health problems that I do now, like depression and anxiety, so it was hard for me to put into words to my family and friends how I felt about my experience. I was definitely traumatized by it, and my trauma manifested itself mostly in insomnia, night terrors, and the occasional random panic attack. It would be years before I was actually diagnosed with PTSD, but long before that, in my twenties I started smoking weed for the first time — and it completely changed my life."
Medium.com,Life,Quitting Cannabis: How I Lost Control and Found Choice,Cannabis,https://medium.com/@rachellewett/quitting-cannabis-how-i-lost-control-and-found-choice-974f0362ab83?source=topic_page---------60------------------1," A year ago today, I was deep in ceremony on the wild coast of southwest Ireland, praying to my ancestors for togetherness, for repair, for belonging and connection. One intention for this ancestral healing journey was to quit using ganja like a drug. Not because she is bad — I know cannabis as a deeply wise plant ally who gives endless gifts — but because I was using her obsessively, desperately, and without reverence, the way you do when you’re addicted. I wanted to have choice in that relationship, and I wanted other ways of regulating the actual source of my distress, instead of soothing it temporarily and externally. I was prepared to quit forever, to never smoke again, if I couldn’t figure out how to have more choice and consent in how to get in right relationship with her, and her with me. When I returned, I wrote an article about quitting that struck a collective chord — 26k+ people read or listened to the article, and hundreds of those readers flooded my website and FB messenger inbox from all over the world, asking for advice, wanting to connect, feeling confused and concerned with their own usage, wanting to be together in the riddle of how to get in right relationship with cannabis. Many were frustrated with programs and sobriety coaches that make ganja into the enemy and us into static binary beings: you’re either a desperate, shameful addict, or you’re a good person who’s decided to quit smoking forever. I’ve had almost one hundred of conversations with readers since that article published. We are, most of us who use weed regularly as a strategy for self-medication, struggling to know how to be with the frequent overwhelm in our bodies. The flooding of emotions we don’t want. The crushing despair and depression of living on the brink of social and environmental collapse. The flatness, the depression. The rage we never learned to express or hold. Moments that feel boring, moments that feel more fun with a joint. We long to smoke weed sometimes, but to not need it so much. We are afraid when we notice the extent of our dependency: hanging with friends, tracking the bong in the background, urgently wondering when the host will offer us some; driving home from the dispensary and unable to wait 10 minutes to arrive in our driveway. There are other similarities too, between me and the hundreds of folks I’ve spoken to in the last year: Nope. There’s another way, and starts by jumping out of the fishbowl, zooming WAY out to look at the historical context of addiction. What we think we know about addiction — the so-called “disease model” — is a construct that supports a continued delusion that we live in a world where some individuals get sick for no reason, that addiction is a chronic disease, and that if people would just get their usage under control then we’d all be better for it. This “official view of addiction” is mostly still prevalent, as is funded and perpetuated by governments and big-money corporations who have a stake in us NOT seeing the actual source. The official view spins a narrative about sick individuals being to blame for what are actually systemic harms that create distress (isolation, oppression, injustice for example). The brave process of zooming out to see the actual context that leads humans to seek out behavioral adaptations to sooth our distress is sometimes called the “historical view of addiction.” This model has focuses on the traumatic and on-going consequences of the modern era — the impact of 500+ years of colonialism, dislocation and fragmentation. I believe that looking at this context is imperative if we truly wish to support ourselves and our cultures to heal and reweave ourselves into connection and wholeness."
Medium.com,Life,What Makes It “Medical Marijuana”?,Cannabis,https://medium.com/the-no-bs-guide-to-medical-cannabis/medical-marijuana-versus-recreational-marijuana-c55f7cef191?source=topic_page---------61------------------1," For the better part of a century, cannabis has been demonized as a drug of abuse. Public perception says that smoking marijuana makes people lazy, apathetic, and leads to even harder drugs. Yet it wasn’t always this way. The earliest known uses of cannabis for medical purposes date back to 2,500 BCE in China. There’s evidence of human cultivation going back even further. Even in the United States, pharmaceutical companies were making and selling cannabis-based tinctures up until the late 1930’s. While the reasons for this shift are beyond the scope of this article, it seems much of the world has come back around to considering marijuana as medicine. This shift in public perception has led to a wave of legalization efforts across the US and elsewhere. The majority of US States have legalized for medical purposes only, while a few have legalized for recreational use. For those who have never dabbled in the cannabis world, this can lead to confusion. After all, we don’t talk about most medicine in terms of “recreational” use. Nobody’s out there taking aspirin or chemotherapy drugs to get high. So which marijuana is “medicine”, and how does one know the difference? There are three major features that distinguish medical use from recreational use: intent, product choice, and dosage strategy."

Medium.com,Life,Vegan CBD Products That Are Actually Worth It,Cannabis,https://medium.com/tenderlymag/27-vegan-cbd-products-that-are-actually-worth-it-548642aedbfa?source=topic_page---------64------------------1," A
few years ago, when I was more of a verified stoner, I rolled my eyes at CBD products. But they don’t even get you high! But now I’ve come to appreciate the real effect of CBD — which is certainly noticeable to me now both in topicals and when ingested. With all the body and relaxation effects of marijuana, CBD gets you blissed out without the mental fog. Turns out you can get very relaxed without being technically “high.” Since CBD is newly deregulated in many states where marijuana still isn’t, the market for CBD products has exploded. CBD must have less than .3% THC to be legal, since it’s not psychoactive under this amount. But don’t think that means it doesn’t do anything! CBD acts as an inhibitor to certain cannabinoid receptors, which studies show seems to help the body regulate pain, stress, anxiety, and even sleep. That said, not all products claiming to have CBD are created equal, and you’re going to want to read the label to ensure you’re getting your money’s worth. “CBD listed as cannabinol, full-spectrum hemp, hemp oil, or PCR extracts (polycannabinoid rich) are what you are looking for,” Dr. Kristine Blanche, CEO of Integrative Healing Center, tells Tenderly. The market isn’t properly regulated, she cautions, so if a product lists “hemp seed oil (cannabis sativa oil),” you’re not actually getting any of the benefits of CBD, just the price bump. For this reason, I haven’t included any of those products on this list of vegan CBD products; all contain actual CBD, not just hemp seed oil. To further verify that you’re not getting ripped off, Dr. Blanche says you’ll want to look for how many milligrams of CBD are in the product. If you’re purchasing CBD oil outside of a dispensary, she suggests you make sure the product lists where the cannabis was grown. (It should be more specific than just “Asia” or “Europe,” she notes.) Otherwise, since there are currently few growing standards, “products can be contaminated with pesticides, heavy metals like arsenic, lead, and even bacteria and fungus.” You should also be sure the manufacturer has a “COA” (certificate of analysis). So, with that in mind, here are some excellent vegan CBD products you can try — all of which I’ve happily sampled myself. According to Dr. Blanche, THC is actually what makes you munchy — not CBD. There’s even evidence that for some people, CBD intake might suppress appetite (though that’s inconclusive, since for some it also seems to increase it or have no effect). When it comes to animal-free CBD edibles, there are certainly no shortage of options. These brands know their target demo, and many CBD snacks are vegan. Beam’s CBD Powered Protein Bar made me feel effects from just a few bites, as did these delicious Weller Coconut Bites, which are like not-too-sweet coconut granola snacks, each split into 5mg for easy dosing. Sparkling CBD beverages are also popular, and Recess makes Spindrift-like bubbly seltzers that are refreshing without being overly sweet, adding unique ingredients like Ginseng, Schisandra, and L-theanine — all of which are supposed to support your mood. If a hot beverage is more your thing, you can have an upper with your downer with Sträva Craft Coffee, which is ethically-sourced and will both wake you and (non-THC) bake you. If you’d rather make your own CBD cocktail or latte, a water-soluble barista blend powder is the fanciest way to go, or a water-soluble tincture like this one by The Rooted Co. will work equally well. While ingested CBD is certainly noticeable in its effects, to me, topical applications are even more impressive. It’s like Windex in My Big Fat Greek Wedding, I swear. Just put some CBD on it, and you’ll notice you immediately soothe skin and heal faster. Unfortunately, many of the pain balms out there needlessly use beeswax, which I prefer to avoid for ethical reasons — but there are certainly many, many vegan topicals out there happy to help. One of my absolute favorites is Vital Body Therapeutics’ CBD Pain Relief Cream, which I’ve used on everything from bug bites to sunburns to cramps to back pain to minor scrapes to pimples to post-wax bumps. I know it helps all of the above feel calmed and recover more quickly, and I appreciate the tingling peppermint, as well as the fact that there are no ingredients in this product you won’t recognize. CBD Essentials Extra-strength Pain Cream also does the trick with easy-to-pronounce ingredients (and doubled for me as a soothing lip balm as well). Another deeply impressive product is Sagely CBD headache relief, a roll-on with tingly essential oils that help distract and soothe as CBD works its magic. Each time I use it, I don’t expect it to work, or think I’ll end up needing Advil anyway. I don’t know why I keep thinking that, because it always significantly helps — the majority of the time to the point that I don’t need to take a pill. Medterra’s topical cooling cream also deserves an honorable mention for creating a thoroughly distracting sensation while it works on pain or itchy mosquito bites, while Koi CBD Lavender lotion is relaxing enough to put you and your muscles right to sleep. Gelatin-free and otherwise vegan CBD supplements are certainly not hard to come by, but you need to always read that label for surprise animal ingredients. I like Plant People’s Calm Capsules, which also include a proprietary herbal blend with other relaxing extracts. Hath CBD’s Better Nights capsules combine 25 mg CBD and melatonin, and definitely worked for me — and that’s coming from someone who has, for a brief unfortunate moment, formed a tolerance for Ambien. I felt a little hungover the morning after from these capsules, for about 30 minutes, but felt normal the rest of the day, even oddly more productive than usual. Finally, BonaVibe deserves some love for being a proudly all-vegan brand that sells bundles of both premium CBD capsules and vegan Omega 3 supplements. Taken together, they both interact with the endocannabinoid system. Co-Founder Tanner Louen tells me that there’s evidence that both “Omega 3’s and other essential fatty acids are critical for cell membrane health and may help improve your body’s production of endocannabinoids…Though we can’t necessarily prove that omega 3 is essential for CBD effectiveness, increasing your dietary intake of the two together is certainly better for your health than not.” As with CBD in general, can’t hurt. While Foria was the first to really market CBD lube (and suppositories for period pain!), plenty of other CBD brands have since entered the field. How much of a difference CBD makes in your orgasmic potential is debatable, but the psychological component of believing you have an extra aid on your side also definitely doesn’t hurt. High on Love’s Stimulating o-Gel For Women is appropriately fragrance-free, vegan, and leaves a nice tingly sensation as it relaxes you and works to increase blood flow and aid muscle relaxation. (Be sure to look for their CBD rather than hemp seed oil version.) Kush Queen’s Ignite CBD Lube is also a great vegan lube to experiment with topicals in this way. One of the first CBD brands I tested was Cannabliss, and their products remain some of my favorites. Their Body Oil is probably the best deal for the amount you get, and works nicely as everything from a sensual massage oil, hair serum, aftershave, or body moisturizer. The makeup and beauty market is newly-obsessed with CBD, but these products are also some of the biggest offenders when it comes to claiming that “hemp seed oil” is the same as CBD or full spectrum hemp oil — so be sure to read labels carefully. Beboe Therapies High Potency Serum is a winner for keeping your skin nice and dewy, as is their CBD sheet mask. For high-level pampering, try CBD bath bombs like this one, or a CBD epsom salt soak, which will both relax your muscles and likely put you to sleep. In the hair realm, I appreciated the effect of Eco Natural Cannabis Sativa Co-Wash. Like all co-washes, it won’t strip your hair of natural oils it needs the way shampoo does, but unlike most, it is also vegan and filled with CBD. In the mascara realm, two vegan makeup brands deserve props. Milk Makeup’s Kush Mascara is already becoming a cult favorite, and for good reason — it gives you very dramatic lashes, plus cannabis sativa oil to help those little hairs thrive. Beloved vegan makeup brand Vegamour is also coming out with a CBD mascara and lash serum shortly. I got to test an advance copy and can say that it was a better vegan mascara than most, so you’ll want to keep an eye out for that as well. CBD is real and a humane way to help anxious or aging companion animals without risking them getting nonconsensually high off THC. You’ll be safest vegan-wise with a tincture like this one by Bluebird Botanicals (rather than an animal edible or gelatin capsules). The market is saturated, but CBD Distillery also distinguishes itself with a CBD tincture bundle that comes complete with a “CBD and Chill” doggie bandana, so everyone can know you’re not a regular dog mom — you’re a cool dog mom. Update: An earlier version of this story included a non-vegan beverage due to some ingredient labeling confusion — it has been removed."
Medium.com,Life,Should You Avoid Cannabis While Breastfeeding?,Cannabis,https://medium.com/@kimberlyvlawson/should-you-avoid-cannabis-while-breastfeeding-5ca734ccdde2?source=topic_page---------65------------------1," When Kayla, who lives in Asheville, North Carolina, became pregnant a few years ago, she decided to continue consuming cannabis after weighing the benefits and risks with her doctor. Not only did it relieve her anxiety and improve her ability to focus, she also found that cannabis improved her morning sickness. Despite these benefits, Kayla, whose name we’re withholding to protect her privacy, says she recalls several instances of having to deal with stigma. In North Carolina, both medical and recreational cannabis are illegal. The 31-year-old says that when her mother found out she smoked (she was with Kayla as she disclosed to a nurse during a hospitalization), “her shoulders dropped and disappointment filled the room.” “She asked me if I had really been that sick the whole pregnancy,” Kayla says. “She asked if I researched and discussed this with my husband. Of course I did. I had many sleepless nights worried about my child. Who doesn’t.” Later, after her daughter was born, Kayla says she also remembers feeling like she was being criticized for her cannabis use as she recovered from a Cesarean section. Her daughter was barely two days old. “I remember sitting in the hospital, attempting to feed my baby when a nurse walked in [and] said, ‘Your baby is getting all the THC in your system from breastfeeding her.’ No help with the latch, tips or tricks of the trade. I cried to my husband because it hurt so bad.” — - In September, the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) published a new report in the journal Pediatrics that included the results of a new study on marijuana use during pregnancy and breastfeeding. Their message to moms and moms-to-be: Avoid it altogether. As more states vote to legalize cannabis, the health organization noted in a statement, it’s important to understand the effects of its use among women while pregnant and breastfeeding. Currently, recreational marijuana is legal in 10 states and Washington, D.C., while medical marijuana is legal in 33 states and D.C. According to data cited in the report, 4.9 percent of pregnant women ages 15 through 44 in 2016 reported use of marijuana in the past month, compared with 11 percent of nonpregnant women in the same age group. The study was led by researchers at the University of California, San Diego. They tested the breast milk of 50 nursing mothers between 2014 and 2017. In total, the women provided 54 samples. Lab testing found that THC, the psychoactive chemical in marijuana that makes a person feel high, was detectable in 34 of those samples up to six days after last reported use. Citing this and other evidence, the AAP recommended “that pediatricians advise adolescents and women of childbearing age to abstain from marijuana use while pregnant or breastfeeding due to potential adverse consequences to the fetus, infant or child.” Dr. Seth Ammerman, a report co-author and Stanford University pediatrics professor, told CBS News: “We still support women breastfeeding even if using marijuana but would encourage them to cut down and quit.” The report’s authors also admit that, well, there actually isn’t enough scientific research to really prove that cannabis use is harmful. Or, as they put it, “the evidence for independent, adverse effects of marijuana on human neonatal outcomes and prenatal development is limited.” That’s because of federal regulations that make it difficult to study cannabis use among adults. They argue, however, that what little evidence there is does “indicate reason for concern.” Their findings aren’t enough to sway most canna-moms though. Talia, for example, is a 23-year-old mother who lives in Maryland, where marijuana for medicinal purposes is legal. Although she is not certified under the state’s medical cannabis commission to obtain it, Talia has been using cannabis to deal with her depression and anxiety for more than two years. Her daughter, whom she’s breastfeeding, is almost one year old now. “It helps me be a better mom,” says Talia, whose last name we’ve withheld to protect her identity. In addition to her infant, she has two stepdaughters. “I feel more relaxed, even on the days I don’t smoke it. I’m more evened out. It’s really made life a little bit better.” Talia says she had planned to quit using cannabis after she got pregnant, but found that it helped relieve her pregnancy-related aches and pains, in addition to her morning sickness. When her daughter was born, she researched the association between breastfeeding and cannabis and decided there wasn’t enough evidence of risks to stop smoking. What she does know, Talia says, is that her daughter is healthy and reaching all of her developmental milestones early or on time. “She’s one of the happiest babies you’ll ever meet — always full of smiles and giggles.” — Many women who use cannabis during their pregnancy and afterward reference a 1994 study published in Pediatrics to support their decision. It’s often referred to in online cannabist mom groups as “the Jamaican study.” That’s because researcher Melanie Dreher and her team followed 24 pregnant Jamaican women who’d been exposed to marijuana prenatally and 20 pregnant women who had not. They assessed the development and behavior of the participants’ children within the first month of their life and found that the babies who’d been exposed to cannabis appeared to do a little better in several areas, including stability and quality of alertness, compared to babies who hadn’t been exposed. A five-year follow-up with those children found “no significant differences in developmental testing outcomes.” When Dreher sought federal funding to continue her research and check back with the children when they turned 9 and 10, she was denied by the National Institute on Drug Abuse, she said in an interview with Counterpunch. In the late ’90s, Dreher told Cannabis Culture’s Pete Brady that “one of my goals with this research was to get the message to physicians: so women smoke a little marijuana — big deal. Let women enjoy their pregnancies. If there’s something seriously wrong with their baby it would have occurred no matter what — marijuana or not.” Kayla, the mom in North Carolina, says the decision to continue cannabis use during her pregnancy wasn’t one she took lightly. Regardless, she faced backlash: Kayla says a nurse told her the state’s social services division was going to open a case on her because of her history with cannabis. “We went home and waited for weeks with bated breath for a social worker to call and schedule an appointment, or worse, show up,” she recalls. Later, her doctor told her they didn’t find anything in her baby’s cord blood drug screening worth investigating. Kayla says she did find comfort in the few interactions she had with other moms who said they also self-medicated during their pregnancy. “I wasn’t alone,” she says. “[But] finding other moms who consume is still a problem. Even though I live in one of the most liberal cities in North Carolina, it isn’t talked about.” This story originally published in Carolina Cannabis News, a North Carolina-based online publication that shuttered in 2019."

Medium.com,Life,Exaggerated Health Claims Prompt FDA to Hold First Hearing on CBD,Cannabis,https://medium.com/swlh/exaggerated-health-claims-prompt-fda-to-hold-first-hearing-on-cbd-c49a0207ebe8?source=topic_page---------67------------------1," Recently, the FDA held a highly anticipated hearing on the regulations surrounding CBD products such as capsules and oils. The hearing was well attended by companies and individuals with invested interest in pushing their agenda forward, including individuals talking about the potential suicidal effects of cannabis, entrepreneurs looking for answers regarding the safety of CBD in products such as cosmetics, and lawyers suggesting potential regulatory frameworks to help guide CBD’s entrance into the market. Because the current regulations surrounding CBD products are so discordant and ill-defined, the current moment remains a fertile time for companies and individuals to gain a foothold in influencing the regulatory laws of CBD. The most recent FDA hearing on the regulatory guidelines of CBD was provoked by findings suggesting the potential toxicity of CBD products. In an effort to address these health concerns, the FDA held a hearing to gather more data on CBD including its safety, marketing and regulatory issues. During the hearing, they asked speakers to submit well-documented clinical studies to back their claims-focusing more on obtaining data than opinions. The FDA’s decision to hold a hearing on CBD was a step forward on the path to clarifying what types of regulations companies and individuals might come to expect moving forward. One of the primary areas of confusion surrounding the regulation of cannabis comes from the fact that cannabis is primarily comprised of two basic substances, CBD and THC, which are separately regulated in very different ways. For instance, THC, unlike CBD, is heavily regulated by the DEA and is not acceptable at the federal level, whereas CBD enjoys a less heavy-handed regulation and can be considered federally legal depending on its presence of THC and proposed use. The myriad of laws surrounding these two cannabis substances makes the proper, legal promotion of CBD a difficult undertaking for companies which run the risk of inappropriately marketing their products. If a company or individual is found to be violating this complicated network of federal laws, for example, in the case of inappropriate promotions, they face serious consequences including major fines and criminal punishment. It is crucial for companies to therefore carefully consider how they market their cannabis products to ensure that they remain within FDA-approved boundaries, especially considering how quickly the regulations are changing in the cannabis industry. Although cannabis has become legalized in many different states both for medical and recreational use, companies and individuals still run the risk of incurring fines or penalties when it comes to the actual use of the product itself. For instance, many medical shops contain recreational cannabis products that are marketed by using medical claims, which is a dangerous move for companies to make because it means that they may end up violating federal and state laws and regulations. Many states also require that medical cannabis be marketed according to federal laws relating to the promotion, manufacturing, or sale of such products. This jumble of federal and state laws surrounding the promotion of cannabis products has made it exceptionally difficult for companies to successfully navigate the regulatory space and ensure that they do not face penalties or fines. It remains a difficult task for companies selling cannabis products, including CBD, to remain compliant with state and federal laws and regulations because of the FDA’s lack of overall clarity. As a consequence of the discordant laws governing the marketing and sale of cannabis products, many companies and individuals are already facing harsh punishments including numerous fines and jail time. This means that companies in the cannabis industry must remain very well-informed on the constantly shifting regulatory framework surrounding the sale of cannabis-derived products-particularly now that the FDA is taking steps toward clarifying its stance on these drugs."

Medium.com,Life,Marijuana Could Soon Be Decriminalized in Georgia,Cannabis,https://medium.com/@samuelj31415/marijuana-could-soon-be-decriminalized-in-georgia-fce701e3544a?source=topic_page---------70------------------1," Since the early 20th century, marijuana use has been an extremely controversial issue within the United States. In it’s infancy, the plant was not even regulated until the Marijuana Tax Act of 1937, and it would eventually be used to legally criminalize African Americans, a trend that surfaced during the Harlem Renaissance. Many argue that the proven medical benefits of the plant provide enough reason to legalize nation-wide. Others claim that it is an essential step to ending the racial divide plaguing our country now. If these things are true, however, what does the newly proposed law, currently still in session as Senate Bill 10, aim to do? Firstly, it must be made clear that the new law would not legalize the plant for recreational use, nor affect any of the current laws that allow for the sale and purchase of medical marijuana (in the form of oil only) for certain patients. Instead, what the law would do is make it a fine-able offense to possess less than half an ounce, or 14 grams, of cannabis. Essentially, this brings the offense down to the same level as a speeding ticket, and the fine can reach up to $300. The law would also only make it a misdemeanor, instead of a felony, to possess less than two ounces of marijuana. This could be an important step for the state as marijuana consumers, considered low level offenders, will no longer be penalized. Not to mention that the extra taxes from the fines may help the state deal with its ongoing opioid crisis. The bill, currently still in session, is an extremely divisive piece of legislature for Georgia, and many doubt its ability to even make it through a senate vote. In the meantime, however, states across the country continue to take big steps when it comes to the cannabis plant, and most recently we have seen the state of New York decriminalize the natural substance. The real question remains, though; will the state actually take its first steps towards legalization?"
Medium.com,Life,Two Routes to Federal Cannabis Legalization,Cannabis,https://medium.com/@jennifergumer/two-routes-to-federal-cannabis-legalization-2be6a67bde26?source=topic_page---------71------------------1," And the possible impacts on the cannabis industry To say that cannabis is big in the United States right now would be the understatement of the year. Ten states have now legalized recreational cannabis while 20 allow medical use. Public opinion has also shifted drastically in favor legalization. Currently, 61% of Americans support full legalization as opposed to only 16% in the early 90s. Even conservative, former speaker of the house John Boehner has joined the mass migration into cannabis — an industry that is projected to be worth $32 billion by 2022. Amongst all the exuberance of the green rush, however, it’s sometimes easy to forget that cannabis is still illegal under federal law. Since the passage of the Controlled Substances Act (CSA) in 1970, ‘marihuana’ has been classified as a schedule 1 drug — a category reserved for highly dangerous substances with no medicinal value. Putting aside that this designation is entirely out of step with the related science, it creates a lot of issues for the cannabis industry and the public more generally. Impacts of Federal Illegality First, the schedule 1 status of cannabis technically renders licensed cannabis operators and their service providers (e.g., attorneys and accountants) criminals under the CSA. Although Department of Justice (DOJ) has not taken action against a state-legal cannabis operator since January 2017, there is currently no federal law or policy protecting industry members from DOJ enforcement. Furthermore, the schedule 1 status of cannabis has created some infamous hurdles for the industry. For instance, most banks will not except money from the cannabis industry given potential liability under federal anti-money laundering statutes. Although FinCen, a bureau of the Department of Treasury, released guidelines in 2014 allowing banks to take cannabis money without facing prosecution under these statutes, the related reporting requirements are so onerous that many financial institutions have decided that it’s not worth the related compliance costs to bank cannabis money. As a result, the majority of the industry still conducts business in cash, which is not only incredibly burdensome but dangerous. The schedule 1 status of cannabis also saddles cannabis businesses with crushing tax liabilities. Section 280E of the federal tax code prevents organizations from deducting business expenses related to “trafficking in controlled substances”. Because cannabis is a controlled substance, cannabis businesses are precluded from deducting most ordinary business expenses to the significant detriment of their bottom lines. The federal illegality of cannabis has also caused immigration problems for foreign investors in state-legal cannabis operations. For instance, several Canadian cannabis investors have been permanently banned from entering the country. Such incidents are not only incredibly disruptive to the investors themselves but also to the industry as a whole given the related cooling effect on foreign investment. Finally, federal illegality is problematic for the simple fact that the existence of an entire industry that violates federal law makes a mockery the United States government and the rule of law in general. For all these reasons and more, the schism between federal and state law regarding cannabis must be addressed Two Routes to Legalization Luckily there are two decently supported bills before congress that, if passed, could better harmonize state and federal cannabis laws. The first bill is the Ending Federal Marijuana Prohibition Act of 2019, which would de-schedule cannabis and it’s derivatives under the CSA. This bill, which was introduced to the house on March 7, 2019, currently has 31 sponsors. The second bill before congress, the Strengthening the Tenth Amendment Through Entrusting States Act (STATES Act), takes a different approach. Rather than de-schedule marijuana completely, the bill would exempt marijuana from its schedule 1 status in states that have legalized. For example, in states were cannabis is illegal (e.g., Texas), cannabis will remain a schedule 1 drug. However, in states where cannabis is legal for recreational use (e.g., California) or medical purposes (e.g., New York), commercial cannabis activities conducted in compliance with state law would no longer be unlawful under the CSA. With wide bipartisan support and 61 co-sponsors, this bill is significantly more likely to pass. The Impacts of Each Bill If passed, both bills would: 1) protect cannabis operators in compliance with state cannabis laws from prosecution under the CSA; 2) allow state-legal cannabis operators to access banking services without putting banks in violation of anti-money laundering statutes; and 3) remove state-legal cannabis operations from the ambit of 280E thus allowing the deduction business expenses. Additionally, by completely de-scheduling cannabis and its derivatives at the federal level, the Ending Federal Marijuana Prohibition Act, if passed, would open up a national cannabis market whereby operators in California, for example, could ostensibly sell their cannabis in any state. The STATES Act, however, would seemingly maintain the status quo whereby a state-legal operator can only sell cannabis products within the state in which it’s licensed. Furthermore, unlike the STATES Act, the Ending Federal Marijuana Prohibition Act allows for the import and export of cannabis goods to and from jurisdictions where cannabis is also legal, opening up the possibility of a global cannabis market. As a result, the Ending Federal Marijuana Prohibition Act would increase the potential market that any one operator could reach, potentially favoring bigger players that can capitalize on that access. The STATES Act, however, would likely increase the total number of operators in the industry by keeping markets local but would in turn limit the potential market share, and therefore profitability, of individual operators. The Ending Federal Marijuana Prohibition Act would also allow for more research into the risks and benefits of cannabis, which is desperately needed from a public health perspective. Currently, anyone looking to conduct cannabis research must endure an onerous DEA approval and certification process. By de-scheduling cannabis, however, the Ending Federal Marijuana Prohibition Act would remove these barriers against research in a way that the STATES Act apparently would not. Finally, neither act addresses the impact that the illegality of cannabis and the related war on drugs has had on communities of color. There is, however, a third bill, called the Marijuana Justice Act, that, like the Ending Federal Marijuana Prohibition Act, would de-schedule cannabis while also addressing the injustices wrought by prohibition. Specifically the Marijuana Justice Act would: 1) disqualify states that have disproportionately incarcerated minority individuals for marijuana offenses from receiving certain federal funds related to prisons and policing; 2) provide for the expungement of marijuana related offenses; 3) create a private right of action by which minority individuals impacted by discriminatory enforcement of marijuana laws can sue states; and 4) create a Community Reinvestment Fund to provide services to communities disproportionately affected by the war on drugs. Although the Marijuana Justice Act only has 7 cosponsors and is therefore unlikely to pass, some members of congress who support federal legalization have indicated that they will not vote for the other two bills because they fail to address to address the disproportionate impact of the war on drugs — an important reminder that although there is growing consensus that cannabis should be legalized, there is still much divisiveness surrounding the means for doing so. Although such division will likely delay federal legalization, it is important for advocates and law-makers to act thoughtfully given that the route to legalization ultimately taken will significantly impact the trajectory of the cannabis industry both in the United States and abroad."

Medium.com,Life,Is Your Weed Vegan?,Cannabis,https://medium.com/tenderlymag/is-your-weed-vegan-8ff77e30c075?source=topic_page---------73------------------1," It
sounds like a question straight out of a Portlandia sketch, but vegan cannabis is a real thing! If you’ve ever seen a “veganic” strain at your local dispensary, you’ve already encountered it. Hold up — isn’t marijuana, a plant, already vegan? Not necessarily, depending on how strictly you define the parameters of your veganism. Before you hit your next pre-roll or take that strawberry-flavored edible, here’s everything you need to know about vegan-friendly weed and how to find it. Marijuana is a plant, yes, but the way it’s grown can be anything but cruelty-free. “When medical cannabis was first passed [legally in California] as an alternative treatment in the ’90s, not many people seemed to think about the fertilizers and pesticides used to produce [it],” says Barry Warman, executive of sales for Bio-Veganic, a plant-based cannabis nutrient system. If you buy organic fertilizer, it almost definitely contains bone or blood meal, which are both made from slaughterhouse waste and comprise a major revenue source for the beef, fish, and poultry industries. Cannabis farmers, like other farmers, need healthy soil to grow healthy plants. The fertilizer you use at home and fertilizers used in agriculture have something in common: they likely contain chemical-based growing additives like nitrogen, potassium and phosphorus, as well as other metals like zinc. If you buy organic fertilizer, it’ll be chemical-free, but it almost definitely contains bone or blood meal, which are both made from slaughterhouse waste and comprise a major revenue source for the beef, fish, and poultry industries. So in the same way that a tomato might be grown with cow manure or fish meal-based fertilizer, cannabis is also grown with animal products. Now that cannabis is legal for recreational use in 11 states and in D.C. — and for medical use in almost all of the rest — many users can be selective about what they choose to consume, whether it’s a specific THC-to-CBD ratio, a locally grown gram, or just a really cutely-packaged cookie. For a community of veganic growers, taking the extra step to provide consumers with cannabis that’s grown veganically and sustainably is worth the work. Veganic cannabis strains might still be niche, but they comprise a growing (heh) cottage industry. In fact, a veganic high-CBD strain won a first place prize in the High Times Cannabis Cup in 2016, and Veganic Strawberry Cough took home second place for Best U.S. Sativa Flower in 2015. Popular strains you might have seen include Veganic Starkiller OG and Veganic Platinum Cookies, which is grown from a clone of the popular Girl Scout Cookies strain. Buds and Roses dispensary in Los Angeles often has several different veganic strains in stock, including Veganic Royal Highness. It’s important to note that the legal cannabis industry has no regulatory way to certify bud as “organic” or “vegan.” (The closest you can get is something called the “Clean Green” certification for sustainably and naturally grown products.) But since you can unofficially grow cannabis veganically, how does it work? First, a little gardening 101. At your local grocery store, you’ve probably noticed organic produce sitting right next to non-organic, or conventional, produce. Those non-organic carrots were grown with fertilizers like you find at any big-box home or hardware store, which are usually made by combining synthetic elemental salts — mainly nitrogen, phosphorous and potassium. (Synthetic pesticides and herbicides are also used in conventional farming, and unless otherwise specified, GMOs.) The organic carrots definitely cost more, but that’s because they were farmed using a more natural method. To be USDA-certified organic, a vegetable cannot be grown with synthetic fertilizers, synthetic pesticides or sewage sludge, and it can’t be genetically engineered or irradiated. But it can be grown with animal products. So instead of being fortified with mineral salts, your organic carrots might have been fertilized with manure or bone meal. “Veganic” farming combines two growing philosophies: organic and vegan. Veganic plants are grown both organically — without the aforementioned synthetic fertilizers or pesticides — and vegan. Because traditional organic farming often uses biological fertilizers like manure, veganic takes it one step further by eschewing any of the typical animal by-product ingredients like cow manure, fish meal, or bat guano. “People who are vegan are definitely drawn to vegan cultivation, but there are a myriad of reasons to take some out of the organic animal production of growing cannabis.” The practice of veganic farming has been around for a while, perhaps first highlighted by an Irish gardening enthusiast named Maye Bruce in her 1940 book on composting, From Vegetable Waste to Fertile Soil. But it’s master grower Kyle Kushman who really put veganic cannabis on the weed map. An award-winning cannabis cultivator, Kushman is the founder of Vegamatrix, a line of veganic bottled nutrients for growing without the use of animal products. “People who are vegan are definitely drawn to vegan cultivation,” Kushman says, “but there are a myriad of reasons to take some out of the organic animal production of growing cannabis.” When it comes to farming, cannabis plants in particular are especially finicky, requiring things like microbial inoculants and carbon dioxide tanks to produce healthy plants. And one thing they definitely require? Special nutrients to thrive. A small sector of veganic cannabis nutrient mixes like Kushman’s has sprung up, including the previously mentioned Bio-Veganic and the Dutch-based Canna company’s BioCanna line. Besides these pre-fab mixes, veganic gardening has developed several interesting alternatives to both chemical and animal-based farming. “Green manure,” also referred to as cover crops, is a term for plants grown specifically to be dug back into the soil to fertilize it. (Common plants used as cover crops are legumes and grasses.) Alfalfa meal is a plant-based substitute for blood meal, which is often added to commercial fertilizers to boost nitrogen in soil, and a hay mulch can expedite the natural composting and worming processes. One of the most popular veganic methods is to use a good compost tea, made by steeping compost in aerated water for an even richer fertilizer. (Really hardcore people can use human urine and “humanure” from compost toilets — and to go even farther, some will use only the waste from people who eat vegan diets.) Without having to fight through synthetic chemicals and animal products, the theory goes, a plant like cannabis can grow in peace and nurture a balanced pH soil. But let’s get down to brass tacks: Does vegan-grown weed taste or smoke better? “When you light a bowl of veganic weed or a joint, as that cherry cools, it doesn’t extinguish. You’ll be able to smoke a bowl or a joint in less than a minute.” Veganic cannabis proponents say vegan Mary Jane does provide a cleaner smoke with less residue; Kushman claims that users can taste or smoke a palpable difference. “When you inhale veganic weed for the very first time, you will note how smooth it is,” he says. “The flavors are much more prominent. You can taste the terpene profile much more because you’re not also tasting metals. When you light a bowl of veganic weed or a joint, as that cherry cools, it doesn’t extinguish. You’ll be able to smoke a bowl or a joint in less than a minute.” Kushman and others claim it can also make you cough less. “Smoked veganic cannabis won’t produce noxious fumes that tend to be associated with the notorious cannabis cough,” says Adam Siskin, founder of the website Cannaplayground. “From personal experience, the flowers are definitely a smoother smoke. [The cannabis] has a better taste, and when the joint paper burns, it burns white smoke and ash instead of dark black or gray you would see with commercial fertilizers,” Warman says. For smokers, that all surely sounds great. But just how valid are these claims that veganic cannabis is healthier for your body? Dr. Robert Flannery, founder of Dr. Robb Farms and the first PhD in the United States with certified technical expertise in growing commercial cannabis, says that even if a plant is grown veganically, it will still contain mineral nutrients like nitrogen and phosphorus. “Plants, cannabis included, can only absorb mineral nutrients through the root system to provide nutrition for the plants,” Flannery says. “This means that regardless of whether I use an organic fertilizer, a veganic fertilizer, or a mineral nutrient to fertilize my plants, the plant is only going to absorb mineral nutrients.” Flannery says he’s heard the arguments that mineral nutrients cause a harsher smoke because of the presence of fertilizer salts inside the flower. “However, I am here to say that even if you use veganic nutrients, the plant will still only absorb mineral nutrients,” he says. “The plant will still have those salts in its tissue regardless of the type of fertilizer.” But even for tokers who might be skeptical, benefits to vegan weed extend beyond just the experience. Veganic growing techniques don’t only result in allegedly cleaner Mary Jane; they’re safer for the planet. Farmers of all types would do well to minimize their use of traditional chemical fertilizers; runoff from these products pollutes waterways by spawning algal blooms that pull valuable oxygen from the water. Nutrient runoff from the Mississippi River watershed has already created one such large low oxygen “dead zone” in the Gulf of Mexico, choking off marine plants and animals. By cutting back on demand for animal by-product-based fertilizers, consumers can send a powerful message to the meat industry. Veganic fertilizers also boosts a plant’s bio-availability, which refers to how much nutrient it’s able to absorb. “Regular” fertilizer is received by soil as a foreign substance, but organic nutrients more closely resemble forms of nutrients plants would be exposed to in their environment and are more readily absorbed by the plant, leaving behind richer and more fertile soil. Finally, factory farming, which generates the bone and blood meal used in organic fertilizers, is not only harmful to animals, people, and the economy, it’s also resource- inefficient, taking up increasing amounts of farmland and water that could be used for plant agriculture or housing. By cutting back on demand for animal by-product-based fertilizers, consumers can send a powerful message to the meat industry."

here’s been a lot of debate around drugs in the US, from the legalization of marijuana to the stunning fatality rates of our ‘opioid crisis.’ We’ve built up such a tremendous fear, negativity and stigma around drugs that our main solution has been to throw enough enforcement at our issues that they’ll somehow be forever stomped out of existence. Yet, the ‘War on drugs’ has been glaringly ineffective, and our stigmatizations have overshadowed critical information about the benefits of drugs, such as the positive effects of hallucinogens for medical purposes as well as their improvement on mental health and well-being. We’re looking at this all wrong. I argue that we need to get far more honest about the root of our problems. Drugs are not the issue. Their negative effects— from ‘pot addiction’ to opioid fatalities— are a symptom of social dis-ease."
Medium.com,Life,3 Obstacles Halting U.S. Cannabis Industry Momentum,Cannabis,https://medium.com/the-mission/3-obstacles-halting-u-s-cannabis-industry-momentum-2d96dc99ea45?source=topic_page---------75------------------1," By Ben Owens, founder of CannaVenture If we don’t act and address the current roadblocks inherent to the U.S. cannabis industry, we risk falling behind and missing out on what could be a new global gold rush. As the popularity of legal cannabis industry continues to rise globally, projections in the billions of dollars are attracting both investors and governments looking to capitalize on these projected revenues. An untapped legal market with preexisting demand that can be invested in for pennies on the dollar seems like a dream come true for many venture capitalists and aspiring entrepreneurs who are looking to take advantage of the newly-legal industry. Countries like Canada that have legalized cannabis on a national level are paving the way for multinational cannabis corporations that will dominate the international cannabis markets in the near future. Meanwhile, the United States maintains some 30+ independent frameworks for how legal cannabis should be handled. The federal government has refused to reschedule or de-schedule the plant which would allow for traditional nationwide regulations, commonly-accepted financial services and deductions, as well as allow for the creation of a nationally accepted framework for legal cannabis consumption. The United States’ labyrinthine system of frameworks and contradictory laws is having real negative effects on our national cannabis industry. Here are three specific roadblocks that we should address if we wish to remain competitive in the ever-growing global cannabis market. Having worked directly with cannabis brands across the country, I know firsthand the troubles that state-by-state legality presents. Brands that exist in multiple states, such as the notorious MedMen, must start from the ground up each time with licenses in each state. New everything, from staff to licenses to the products themselves, which often must undergo expensive labeling, formulation, and marketing changes to be compliant with each market’s unique requirements. This additional financial burden creates both a barrier to entry for those looking to get into the industry, while also proving cost-prohibitive for many brands and businesses who have already established a local following but do not have the means to take their businesses to the next level in another state. This caps their market potential. A national framework would encourage more businesses to invest in growth, which would continue to spur job creation and tax revenues, and would raise this ceiling much higher, allowing businesses and investors to increase their potential return on investment beyond one state’s market. With the federal government in charge of banking regulations, the current Schedule I status of cannabis has scared most banks away from allowing cannabis-related businesses to use traditional banking services such as checking and savings accounts. Or they allow them to do so, but at a significantly higher fee. Cannabis businesses are not allowed to take advantages of deductions or write off the same expenses that other industries are. This directly adds to the financial burdens involved in growing the business, making it harder for businesses looking to consistently grow their efforts. In most industries, more staff and more expenses means more deductions to allow for the increased investment. For cannabis businesses, it often means a significantly higher financial burden, restricting the amount of businesses that have the liquidity to expand while also maintaining daily operations and receiving no incentive for doing so. Additionally, the brands that I work with have to form consultant firms that allow them to work with banks under nondescript names and write off non-cannabis expenses as any other industry would be allowed to do so. Some use the firm to process payments to avoid being shut down by credit processors, while others may rent or purchase under an affiliated but distinctly non-cannabis name. While this presents a short-term solution, it is an unnecessary complication added to an already intricate logistical nightmare. Businesses may be listed under one name but ordering supplies or making deliveries under another. Similarly, payments are often made from these ancillary companies rather than the actual licensed brand, which can present confusion to vendors and clients. The more diluted a brand is, the less valuable it is, and the cannabis industry is often forced to dilute its brands in order to play ball with banking, compliance, and other regulatory agencies. In addition to the logistical nightmare of state frameworks and financial uncertainty, most states with legal cannabis regulations have yet to establish consumption regulations other than to prohibit the public use of cannabis. California, Colorado (specifically Denver), Massachusetts and Nevada are among the only states to attempt to create social consumption models. This forces tourists who visit legal states to light up illegally in public, on the street, behind bars, or in their hotels and rentals, often to the tune of hundreds of dollars in fines. We legalized the sale, production and possession of cannabis, but forgot to legalize its use. And those businesses that allow cannabis consumption are under constant scrutiny, subject to raids and licensing restrictions that prevent them from having a viable business model. Often, the only remaining areas to consume are private or illegal. The countries that have legalized cannabis on a federal level have not only created a consistent framework, but have also allowed for cannabis businesses to take advantage of financial services, a move that allows investors to feel more comfortable working in the new industry, and set up laws for consumption, such as allowing cannabis to be consumed wherever nicotine is consumed. The removal of these barriers eliminates confusion among consumers and provides an extra level of assurance for investors and entrepreneurs who may be on the fence about getting in on the action. Other countries that adopt nationally legal programs pave the way for the remaining pieces of the pot puzzle, namely: Federally legal status. Banks will be leery of cannabis money until this changes, and the convoluted nature of 33+ individual cannabis industry frameworks will remain convoluted until a national framework is established allowing interstate commerce. Some states are attempting to encourage this line of thought, such as Oregon, who recently proposed a state cannabis export bill. Nationally-accepted social consumption laws. Similar to alcohol, the federal government needs to have standards that states can further regulate. There’s nowhere to legally consume legal cannabis as a tourist, renter, etc. in most states with legal cannabis, which means that we haven’t fully legalized cannabis. Without a place to legally consume cannabis, many will be discouraged from ever trying a cannabis product or supporting the cannabis industry because they have nowhere to use the substance while visiting, and no way to legally transport it to their residence upon departure. California has among the most robust system to date for handling cannabis consumption in public, but it is still in its early stages and has much to improve upon. As more states develop pilot regulations that allow for consumption of cannabis as they do tobacco or vaporizers, more adults will be able to legally use the products they purchase without having to own their own home. Access to traditional banking and financial services. Having to work and operate under DBA’s or partner companies adds unnecessary complication to an already complicated industry. Companies still must drive large sums of cash from one place to another, even to pay items like taxes, due to a lack of access to banks. Members of congress are starting to agree that this must change, but, again, most of this momentum will be paused until federal progress is made. Once banks and financial service businesses are allowed to openly work with cannabis businesses, the fees for using these services will decrease, making them more accessible to a greater majority of the industry while also encouraging outside investors who require specific considerations for large investments and wish to protect their interests as they would in other markets. As an organizer who hosts cannabis events throughout the country, specifically hikes and campouts, the inability to allow public cannabis consumption in legal states presents a logistical problem; most hiking trails are on public land and public consumption is illegal. We have had to come up with workarounds for hikes, campouts and disc golf tournaments to allow adults to choose whether or not they wanted to consume while protecting ourselves from potential illegal acts (consumption) that might take place. My business is ancillary to the industry, and I do not “touch” the product, which has allowed me to still enjoy banking and manage my expenses as any traditional pipe company, clothing brand, or smoke shop might. But cannabis businesses aren’t always this lucky. In working with so many established cannabis brands over the years — and founders who’re experiencing the issues detailed above first hand — it’s clear that something needs to change. If we don’t act and address the current roadblocks inherent to the U.S. cannabis industry, we risk falling behind and missing out on what could be a new global gold rush."

Situated at the base of the Rocky Mountains in Boulder, CO, the interior revealed glass shelves lined with tinctures, mints, gummies, and countless strains of cannabis flower. I purchased a box of CBD mints, and as I walked out a man sitting outside lit up a pre-rolled joint. Everything about the experience felt normal — like any other purchase I’d made before. We’re living in a cannabis renaissance. Within a span of just five years, this country has gone from policing cannabis to cannabis companies popping up in every sector imaginable. From breath spray to menstrual cramp salves, there is now a cannabis product for just about everything, and it makes sense: there is a lot of money to be made in the booming industry. And yet, I can’t help but wonder who is shaping the future of this burgeoning sector — especially as the war on drugs still targets so many people who share my lived experience as a queer, Black woman. Just as it felt surreal to walk into that house at the base of the mountains and hand over my money in exchange for my legal cannabis product, looking around at the homogeneity of this nascent landscape is already a reason for concern. According to recent studies, the U.S. cannabis market is projected to be worth around $26 billion by 2025. With more states joining the push to legalize both medicinal and recreational cannabis, it makes sense for businesses to want to get in on the action. But the question of who can enter this space remains an important topic that needs more visibility. And yet, I can’t help but wonder who is shaping the future of this burgeoning industry — especially as the war on drugs still targets so many people who share my lived experience as a queer, Black woman. The legal red tape and hurdles facing would-be entrepreneurs interested in launching a cannabis venture have already placed familiar barriers around the space. The so-called “green rush” is only a goldmine for those with access and the continued disenfranchisement of underrepresented groups becomes increasingly apparent as the industry expands. As with most industries, those with enough upfront capital and social mobility to successfully launch a cannabis venture are dominating this nascent sector. In spite of this, there are a number of people of color (POC) building equitable cannabis businesses. I spoke to three Black founders about what building a sustainable, socially responsible cannabis venture can look like. The People’s Dispensary provides high-quality cannabis products and expertise. Currently located in Oakland, CA and Portland, OR, equity is at the core of their business and values. They commit 10% of their net profits to local community reinvestment funds and believe that the cannabis industry is a change catalyst for empowerment. What made you enter the industry now, and what impact are you hoping to have? It’s important not only for me but for Black people, in general, to be involved in the cannabis industry. Whether it’s ownership, activism or both. We cannot allow this industry to be completely run by white men. It is important that we’re involved in this industry for our survival. Right now, housing is a big issue in Oakland as Black people and POC are being pushed out due to gentrification. I believe cannabis can combat displacement and homelessness [and that] cities should use tax money generated from cannabis to invest in affordable housing. The People’s Dispensary has our own equity framework which includes providing affordable housing for employees. How can new cannabis brands focus on social impact and social responsibility? If brands aren’t coming from a place of integrity and sincerity, then they’re not making an impact. Currently, you have corporations who are using movements and Black trauma to drive sales. Companies make commercials featuring Black entertainers, dispensaries have Black Lives Matters sign in their windows, but how many POC, Women and LGBT people do they have in positions of power? Are they investing in communities of color and other marginalized communities? If new brands want to be socially responsible they need to [build] equity into their model. “We cannot allow this industry to be completely run by white men. It is important that we’re involved in this industry for our survival.” How have your experiences as a woman of color influenced the way you’re building your business? What advice do you have for others? My experiences have taught me to stay resilient. I would suggest starting a business in a field that you’re passionate about. If you have no experience in retail then maybe a dispensary isn’t the right business to start. There are plenty of job creation opportunities, find out how you can transition your skills over to the cannabis industry. What advice do you have for investors interested in backing cannabis ventures? Find a company that you believe in. Break the cycle of investing in corporations. Look for small, innovative businesses that not only will bring you a great return but will also create social impact and change. This is the time to be on the right side of history and to build generational wealth for those who have been left out. Humble Bloom is curating the culture of cannabis, breaking stigma, and elevating cannabis brands with integrity. By partnering with thought leaders and experts, consulting with growing brands, and connecting diverse communities through plant education, advocacy and inclusion is at the root of all that they do. What made you enter the industry now, and what impact are you hoping to have? I entered because I love the plant, wanted to be my own boss, and thought it would be smart to create a product in a growing industry. Immediately upon entering, our focus shifted to community building and education. What most know about cannabis is based on deliberate misinformation. As a first generation Carribean-American woman, I feel it’s my duty to advocate for an equitable, fair, and regenerative industry. I will always use my voice to make sure we don’t end up in a monopoly situation where we’re stuck with only a couple big players controlling all. How are you educating people about conscious consumerism? We are educating through our speaking engagements, panel discussions, and immersive experiences. We have residencies at The William Vale and the Assemblage where we [curate] opportunities for attendees to learn by listening, questioning, and doing. That can look like a discussion on cannabis as an agricultural crop, a brand activation that includes dosing, making your own product to take away, or a heart-opening tea ceremony with meditation. We take groups on field trips bridging the gap between urban and rural as well as connecting people more deeply with the plant and each other. We lead with collaboration and the intention that we’re all connected. How can new cannabis brands focus on social impact and social responsibility? Build it into your DNA. There are brands doing the right thing by having diverse leadership, hiring those who’ve been in the system for a drug offense. [Brands] whose packaging is sustainable and that don’t have additives that cause illness or farming practices heal rather than hurt our environment. Don’t make social impact or corporate social responsibility an afterthought. We have so many examples from major corporations [like] Patagonia to innovative cannabiz models like the People’s Dispensary. We don’t have to reinvent the wheel. Take inspiration from brands like these and put your spin on it. How have your experiences as a woman of color influenced the way you’re building your business? What advice do you have for others? Jump in. There are so many avenues and pathways to cannabis, and not all are in making products, running a farm, or dispensary. Take your skillset and bring it over here to make sure we have a wide variety of voices in the conversation. We need people from all backgrounds to make this unlike any industry before it. You can start your own ancillary business and by not being plant touching it is a lot less expensive. You also won’t go through the regulatory insecurities. Do your homework, get involved in organizations, meet and set informational conversations with people already in the industry. Find your allies and co-conspirators who will advocate and support you along the way. “I feel it’s my duty to advocate for an equitable, fair, and regenerative industry.” What advice do you have for investors interested in backing cannabis ventures? Support those who don’t look like you. Let’s flip the paradigm. Make womxn, POC (specifically Black and Brown populations) LGBTQAI+, the differently abled, and those impacted by structural inequities a priority and move them to the front of the line. Get out of your circle of sameness to allow for true innovation in cannabis. Supernova Women is an organization formed by and for women of color with the goal of utilizing empowering people of color to become self sufficient shareholders in the evolving cannabis economy. Why was it important for you to enter the industry now, and what impact are you hoping to have? I started blogging about cannabis in 2009, [and] I’ve been around the cannabis industry for a while. I moved to California for a sales and marketing job with an edibles company in February of 2014. I have been a proponent of the normalization of cannabis since I started smoking in 1999. As cannabis continues to be legalized and normalized it is important for Black and Brown people to be afforded the opportunity to participate in an industry that was built off the backs of their communities terrorized by the war on drugs. How have your experiences as a woman of color influenced the way you’re building your business? What advice do you have for others? My team is almost entirely people of color, from the investors to my staff. I have been intentional in striving to build a diverse business and working to give those in my community opportunities that will help to benefit everyone collectively. The cannabis industry is not an easy space to operate in, it is currently not being built for us. It’s critical that we participate and advocate on behalf of our communities now as we can help to mold what this industry should look like. Crafting legalization legislation that is inclusive of communities damaged by the war on drugs is critical. The regulated cannabis industry is only two years old in California, and there is so much potential to shape it how we want. It is not an easy task, as most things that are worth the hard work aren’t. We will encounter resistance. Participation in the cannabis industry as an underrepresented group requires perseverance and grit. How can businesses use their platform and privileges to advance cannabis equity? Support equity businesses by working with social equity companies. Work with groups that organize expungement clinics and help them put on events. Support local community organizations that offer resources and training to the community involving the cannabis industry. “Crafting legalization legislation that is inclusive of communities damaged by the war on drugs is critical.” How can new cannabis brands focus on social impact and social responsibility? New brands can start by supporting local organizations that are already boots on the ground doing work in the community and asking those organizations how they can help. Getting active and being proactive is important. What advice do you have for investors interested in backing cannabis ventures? Do your research and due diligence. Get on the ground and get to know the founders and the operations. The cost of compliance is high and those that spend the most won’t win in this industry. This is a margins game. The path and pace are a marathon. __ Story originally published at Supermaker.com. Follow Supermaker on Twitter, Facebook, and Instagram."
Medium.com,Life,Proper Disposal of Cannabis — The Basics for Individuals and Businesses,Cannabis,https://medium.com/tcheck/proper-disposal-of-cannabis-the-basics-for-individuals-and-businesses-2c9686e07e39?source=topic_page---------78------------------1," The cannabis industry has a growing problem, and it’s one many businesses don’t consider until they are well underway. Cultivators, processors, and retailers all produce various categories of waste, which under strict track and trace regulations — all require proper handling. If you’ve read through the various sets of regulations, you aren’t the only one whose gone cross-eyed. Although in reality waste removal is pretty straightforward, the rules can often seem overly-complicated and convoluted. We sat down with Arman Zeytounyan from EcoWaste, a cannabis waste services company operating in Southern California to get a better idea of how to handle the challenging problem of staying compliant, even with garbage. If anyone knows how to navigate the complexities of cannabis waste, it’s someone who works with it daily. According to some reports, California produces 9 million pounds of product annually. From the cultivators planting the seeds to the extractors producing concentrates, to the packing plants pumping out consumer products, there is a lot of waste produced in the ecosystem of cannabis. Waste might not make for exciting headlines, but it’s aspects of doing business in a highly regulated industry. https://www.lamag.com/citythinkblog/california-weed-surplus/ Part of compliance is accounting for the waste. Cannabis is a highly regulated industry, no matter how you look at it. Regulators need to know where the waste product ends up, to safeguard public safety, and uphold environmental standards. Many regions treat cannabis waste like they would to medical or hazardous waste. Regulators don’t want waste material ending up where it doesn’t belong, or it somehow reappearing on the black market. As such, there is a strict structure in place to track cannabis throughout its life, including as it heads to the landfill, recycling facility, or composting plant. While Zeytounyan feels regulators are seeking to train businesses instead of punishing them (so far), failed compliance can be very costly. For example, in the state of California, failed inspections and ignored warnings may trigger daily penalties. Zeytounyan told us about one example from Northern California, where a cannabis business was fined $95,000 per day for failed waste management, including plant material, water, and hazardous waste. Cannabis waste management services, like EcoWaste, take all the regulatory mumbo-jumbo out of the process. They understand the laws, to provide a simple one-stop-solution to their clients. They manage each category of waste (water, recyclables, compostables, and hazardous) properly, to make compliance easy. Zeytounyan estimates roughly 60 percent of new contracts are in urgent need of a waste disposal solution. Waste isn’t a sexy aspect of any business, and as such, many companies remain ignorant about the strict requirements until it comes time for licensing. Suddenly, with their license on the line, waste becomes a major priority. By using a licensed and reputable cannabis waste company, your waste problem is minimal. As Zeytounyan explained, after an initial exploratory conversation about scope and scale, followed by the necessary paperwork, EcoWaste can quickly schedule the delivery of the required containers. What sorts of disposal does a business need to concern themselves with? If you are an extractor, that might mean containers to hold leftover solvents or other hazardous waste. Cultivators might require a compost bin, for the leftover soil and plant material. Edible makers or vape pen producers might need systems for recyclables, solids, or battery recycling. Also, all cannabis businesses must render their waste to make in unusable and unrecognizable. This is the responsibility of the company, not the disposal service. Other specifics vary from state to state (and even county to county), its best to speak with the agency involved, and a disposal company to get a clear idea of what regulations your business must follow. The other essential points of disposal revolve around track and trace compliance measures. Rendered waste is weighed on-site, then the disposal company weighs before removal, and finally, the waste is weighed at the end processing facility like a composting site or landfill. Total traceability from end to end. As a customer, do you have to follow the same complicated series of steps as the commercial industry? Is the final consumer held to the same standards as their suppliers? Thankfully, individuals have far less to worry about, and there are no paperwork requirements for disposing of your personal products. With that said, individuals might want to keep in mind where their waste ends up. Cannabis containing THC can be dangerous if left within reach of children or pets. Therefore you’ll want to render all waste unusable and unrecognizable before tossing it in the trash. The emerging trends for cannabis waste follow similar patterns seen in other industries. People are more thoughtful about what packaging they purchase, prefer recyclable over single-use, and are generally just more green. In Zeytounyan’s opinion, the cannabis industry hasn’t made much progress on reducing, reusing, and recycling in its frantic journey to legalization — but he expects that to change soon. Now that companies are getting to market and navigating compliance better, it’s time to examine waste management practices. It’s the green rush, but there are currently few green solutions. Clearly, there is room for improvement in many areas. On a positive note, EcoWaste is currently working towards closed loops waste solutions to divert away from landfills.

Medium.com,Life,Reports Suggest Legal Marijuana Increases Illegal Possession Arrests,Cannabis,https://medium.com/@subverse/reports-suggest-legal-marijuana-increases-illegal-possession-arrests-4703c924eb44?source=topic_page---------79------------------1," By Tarik Johnson Thirty-three states and Washington, D.C. have passed some sort of laws that legalize marijuana, ranging from limited medical use to legal recreational use. Last month the state of Illinois signed a historic law allowing Illinois residents 21 and over to possess up to 30 grams of cannabis flower, 5 grams of concentrate and 500 milligrams of THC infused in edibles and other products, while out-of-state visitors may have up to half those amounts, effective in January 2020. However, due to the number of states that still have not moved towards legalization, the black market for pot continues to thrive. According to Politico, Idaho reported a 665 percent increase in the amount of illicit marijuana officers seized. Neighboring state Oregon, which was one of the earliest states to legalize marijuana back in 2014, is overproducing the crop, cultivating 3 times the amount demanded by consumers within the state. Politico reported, “When Oregon legalized marijuana in 2014, the state tried very hard to stifle its black market by ensuring the path into the legal market was as easy as possible. It did not limit licenses and it simplified regulations, creating a program with one of the lowest barriers to entry in the United States.” The results looked good for Oregon, with their Department of Revenue reporting it would distribute “$85 million in marijuana taxes for schools, public health, police and local governments,” with the largest share going towards schools. However the state is now trying to limit the number of licences in Oregon, citing the illicit market. Oregon State Police Sgt. Brandon Boice told Politico, “There’s still high demand for Southern Oregon marijuana throughout the country, that has not changed. There might be more illicit marijuana growing in Southern Oregon than there was before legalization, with almost all of it heading out of the state.” Colorado, which also legalized recreational leaf, reported surpassing $1 billion in tax revenue from legal pot sales, while using the funds for youth and public health programs, including mental health services, youth literacy initiatives and anti-bullying programs similar to Oregon. Meanwhile in neighboring state Wyoming, Law enforcement reported “an increasing amount of marijuana in dispensary packaging since legalization in nearby states.” In a report by the Casper Star Tribune, a woman named Ali Kistler, who was arrested for possession with intent to deliver, and possession of marijuana, spoke from her experience saying, “It happens all the time, I’ve known people to get caught and I’ve known people to not ever get caught. It’s comparable to a game of Russian roulette for sure. Legalization has led to more arrests and seizures of marijuana,” she said. “It’s not really always people trying to sell it, people get tired of dealing with the law out here. It’s easier, cheaper and lower risk than working with people in town because you never know who’s going to drop names to get a lesser sentence when they get caught.” Kistler’s theory may be accurate. A study by the University of Nebraska-Omaha’s Nebraska Center for Justice Research showed that “the rate of marijuana arrests in Nebraska grew by 11% in 2014 compared to 2013. The rate of marijuana sale arrests more than doubled in border and panhandle counties while I-80 and comparison counties experienced smaller increases; overall, the rate of sale arrests per 1000 residents is very low (<1.28), and 10 increased slightly across the state.” According to The Hill, “Public opinion polls show that legalizing marijuana has become more politically popular over the years, especially after Washington and Colorado became the first state to do so in 2012. A Marist College poll conducted for NPR and PBS NewsHour released Monday shows 62 percent of registered voters, including two-thirds of independents, say legalizing recreational marijuana is a good idea.” On June 20th this year, The House of Representatives approved a far-reaching measure on Thursday to prevent the Department of Justice from interfering with state marijuana laws, including those allowing recreational use, cultivation and sales. State Rep. Earl Blumenauer (D-OR) spoke to MarijuanaMovement before the voice vote saying, “This is what the American people have demanded, why it is now legal in 33 states, it is supported by two-thirds of the American public, and 90 percent for medical marijuana. It’s time that we extend this protection to state-legal activities so they can drive and move forward.”"
Medium.com,Life,Texans Most Affected by Marijuana Policy Appear Less Likely to be Civically Active,Cannabis,https://medium.com/@LyleChad/texans-most-affected-by-marijuana-policy-appear-less-likely-to-be-civically-active-36541407391f?source=topic_page---------80------------------1," by Chad Lyle D
uring the most recent Texas Legislative Session, bills to reform regulations on marijuana possession received a considerable amount of media attention. This coverage makes sense considering a number of recent polls indicating that Texans would like to see restrictions weakened for marijuana use and possession. According to The Texas Politics Project, a majority of Texas voters seem to support legalizing marijuana for recreational use. However, bills that would alter current cannabis laws in such a significant way have yet to gain enough traction to become law. A possible explanation for this is that those who would be most positively affected by changes to marijuana laws are less likely to be civically engaged than other Texans. Indeed, evidence seems to support the idea that Texans who are more likely to be arrested for marijuana possession are less likely to vote than others. Without a large enough portion of the electorate being passionate about reforming marijuana laws, it is unlikely to be a priority for politicians once they are elected to office. For example, if legalization of recreational marijuana were a motivating issue for most Texas voters in the 2018 election, Governor Greg Abbott might not have been re-elected. Abbott does not support legalizing recreational marijuana, though according to a Texas Politics Project poll taken in June of 2018, 53 percent of Texas voters supported doing so, indicating that Abbott received votes from people who disagreed with his stance. However, demographic groups that are more likely to be arrested for marijuana possession are also groups that are not as likely to vote. This means that Texans who have the largest stake in wanting to change marijuana regulations are making their voices heard less than other Texans. According to data from the Texas Department of Public Safety, 30,490 people arrested for marijuana possession in 2016 were between the ages of 18 and 24. This is about 48 percent of all marijuana possession arrests that year. The same age group only comprised 7.2 percent of Texans who voted in the 2016 general election: around 694,000 people. So, while 18–24 year-olds made up a plurality of arrests for marijuana use in Texas in 2016, they were the smallest group of general election voters that year. The low rate of voter participation among 18–24 year-olds is not due to the fact that they are a small portion of those eligible to vote. In fact, 18–24 year-olds were 12.5% of Texas citizens in 2016, just over 2 million people. Further, the share of marijuana possession arrests for those aged 17 or younger was 4,481 people or 7.1 percent. This means that in Texas, the majority of arrests for marijuana possession in 2016 were individuals under 25 — the most underrepresented age block on election day. Age groups are not the only category where variations in the rate of arrests for marijuana possession exist. 25,689 Hispanic people were arrested for the crime in 2016, the largest share of any racial group. Caucasians accounted for the second-largest amount, with 21,172 arrests. Notably, the percentage of Caucasians who voted in the 2016 election was almost twice as large as the share of those who were arrested for marijuana possession: 61.3 percent of general election voters were white Texans, while only 32 percent of possession arrests were. However, these proportions are nearly inverted when it comes to Hispanic Texans. About 1,938,000 Hispanic people voted in the 2016 election. Their proportion of Texas voters that year, 20.1 percent, is almost half the share of Hispanic people arrested for marijuana possession, 38.8 percent. Additionally, the majority of 2016 arrests for marijuana possession can be attributed to racial minorities. 18,578 African Americans were arrested for possession, bringing the share of minority groups arrested to 66.9 percent when combined with the number of Hispanic people arrested. On Election Day in 2016, the combined number of Hispanic and African American people who voted was 3,287,000. This is just 46 percent of the 7,139,000 Texas citizens who belonged to the Hispanic or African American communities in 2016 respectively. As with age groups, it is clear that racial minority groups are not necessarily underrepresented at the ballot box just because they are a smaller portion of the population. In fact, 41 percent of Texas citizens were either Hispanic or African American in 2016, though they collectively represented only 34.1 percent of general election voters. When it comes to arrests for marijuana possession, the largest share of those affected are 18–25 year-olds and racial minorities. Both of these groups show up to vote in smaller numbers than those who are less likely to be arrested for marijuana possession, and when they do turn out to vote they are not turning out in numbers representative of their share of the voting-eligible population. Based on this finding, it is apparent that those who would be most impacted by new legislation dealing with marijuana possession lack a strong electoral presence. Because these demographic groups do not assert as much influence on Texas politics — at least not yet — it is likely that marijuana legislation will remain a low priority for Texas lawmakers.

Medium.com,Life,More Than Medicine: Other Benefits of Legalizing Cannabis,Cannabis,https://medium.com/@angelaschweers/more-than-medicine-other-benefits-of-legalizing-cannabis-8ae4b47089ca?source=topic_page---------81------------------1," At this point, most everyone is aware of the medical benefits of cannabis. Of course, even with those benefits, some still fight and cling to prohibition propaganda. The good news is, as more research is done, more evidence is stacking up against those prohibitionist beliefs and more benefits of legalization are being found. These benefits range beyond medicine and business and impact more than just the active cannabis consumer. You read that right. One of the biggest arguments of the prohibition platform is that dispensaries allegedly increase crime in their neighborhoods. Not so, according to the latest research. A study out of the Journal of Economic Behavior & Organization showed statistically insignificant changes in crime rates in cities with legalized medical marijuana and actually found a 3.7 percent drop in violent crimes in those cities. Similarly, research by the University of California, Irvine suggests dispensaries may make their surrounding neighborhoods safer. The Los Angeles Police Department blamed dispensaries for an increase in crime, but it was found that only after dispensaries closed did property crimes increase 12 to 14 percent and low-level crimes increase 14 to 16 percent. No adverse impact on crime feeds into the next benefit of legalized cannabis — increased property values. Just like a new grocery store or school opening near your home, research suggests having a dispensary in your neighborhood, or even having legalized cannabis in your state, immediately increases your property values. A study out of Colorado State University found that having a dispensary within .25 miles of your home increased its value by an average of 7.7 percent. If the dispensary is within .25-.5 miles of your home, the increase was around 4.7 percent. Even without a dispensary nearby, living in a state with legalized cannabis can come with increased property values. Clever Real Estate found that from 2017–2019 cities with legal recreational cannabis saw home values increase more than $6,000 compared to cities where marijuana was illegal. Take Denver, Colorado, for example. Denver opened their first recreational cannabis dispensaries in 2014. Since then, residential property values have increased 67.8 percent. While neither study could identify exactly why legalized cannabis increased property values, there were a few suggestions like employment growth in the cannabis industry and the lower crime rates in areas with legal marijuana. The idea that legalizing marijuana will free police resources to handle more serious crimes has some new data to support it. Police Quarterly looked into police clearance rates, AKA the number of cases solved, in Colorado and Washington, the first two states to legalize recreational marijuana. Turns out, clearance rates significantly increased after legalization. Specifically, clearance rates for violent crimes, property crimes, burglary and motor vehicle theft all increased, while the rate of marijuana possession arrests dropped almost 50 percent in Colorado and more than 50 percent in Washington. With over 80 percent of Americans in favor of legalizing cannabis for medical or recreational use, some law enforcement officials argue their time is better spent on issues that are more important to citizens than marijuana-related crimes, and the data is here to support that. As marijuana legalization continues to spread in the United States, we continue to see a positive domino effect at our southern border. Violence rates in states bordering Mexico have decreased, the number of marijuana fields discovered by Mexican officials has dropped and the smuggling of marijuana from Mexico into the U.S. has taken a significant downturn. The decline in marijuana smuggling started almost immediately after Colorado and Washington legalized cannabis and that decline has continued. In the five-year period since recreational dispensaries opened in the U.S., 11 states have legalized marijuana, and in turn marijuana smuggling at the border has decreased more than 70 percent. Pot prohibition lore has long relied on the idea that legalizing cannabis will hurt Americans more than help them, but data suggests otherwise. The pros are very quickly outweighing the cons, and Americans are embracing that. Hi, I’m Angela, a freelance cannabis copywriter.

Medium.com,Life,Researchers Find Pain Relief Potential of Cannabis,Cannabis,https://medium.com/@subverse/researchers-find-pain-relief-potential-of-cannabis-580c02d12e99?source=topic_page---------84------------------1," By Mac Molli Researchers at the University of Guelph found how the sativa strain of the cannabis plant creates important pain-relieving molecules that are thirty times more powerful at reducing inflammation than Aspirin. Their findingsshow the potential to create a naturally derived pain treatment that gives potent relief without the risk of addiction to prescribed pills. Tariq Akhtar, a Professor at the University of Guelph’s Molecular and Cellular Biology Department said, “There’s clearly a need to develop alternatives for relief of acute and chronic pain that go beyond opioids. These molecules are non-psychoactive and they target the inflammation at the source, making them ideal painkillers.” The research team partnered with a Anahit International Corp., a Toronto-based company which licensed a patent from the University of Guelph to biosynthesize cannflavin A and B outside of the cannabis plant. Professor Akhtar worked with MCB professor Steven Rothstein on a procedure that uses a combination of biochemistry and genomics. They successfully determined how cannabis makes two important molecules named cannflavin A and B, known as flavonoids, which provide anti-inflammatory benefits that are nearly 30 times more effective (gram for gram) than Aspirin. In the past decades, research into these molecules stalled in part because cannabis research was highly regulated, since its legalization in Canada and improved genomics research, the two researchers were able to analyze and understand how Cannabis sativa biosynthesized cannflavins. “Our objective was to better understand how these molecules are made, which is a relatively straightforward exercise these days,” said Akhtar. “There are many sequenced genomes that are publicly available, including the genome of Cannabis sativa, which can be mined for information. If you know what you’re looking for, one can bring genes to life, so to speak, and piece together how molecules like cannflavins A and B are assembled.” Once they had the genomic information, they applied biochemistry to verify which cannabis genes were required to created cannflavins A and B. Their findings allow for natural health products to be produced containing these molecules. Most who suffer from chronic pain are prescribed opioids which work by blocking the brain’s pain receptors, those who take these medications run the risk of negative side effects and addiction. However, Cannflavins work differently by targeting the pain by reducing inflammation. Rothstein states, “The problem with these molecules is they are present in cannabis at such low levels, it’s not feasible to try to engineer the cannabis plant to create more of these substances. We are now working to develop a biological system to create these molecules, which would give us the opportunity to engineer large quantities.” Anahit’s Chief Operating Officer Darren Carrigan, who patented the work of the Guelph researchers stated, “Anahit looks forward to working closely with University of Guelph researchers to develop effective and safe anti-inflammatory medicines from cannabis phytochemicals that would provide an alternative to non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs. Anahit will commercialize the application of cannflavin A and B to be accessible to consumers through a variety of medical and athletic products such as creams, pills, sports drinks, transdermal patches and other innovative options.”"
Medium.com,Life,Medical Marijuana and Seniors,Cannabis,https://medium.com/the-no-bs-guide-to-medical-cannabis/medical-marijuana-and-seniors-ba791c2dd582?source=topic_page---------85------------------1," I recently came across a story in the Wall Street Journal talking about NiaMedic, a clinic that specializes in medical marijuana for seniors. While most of the article is focused on the clinic and their approach, it also highlighted a few issues I thought worthy of discussion. In particular, the rising rates of cannabis use among older adults, and the challenge of treating populations with specialized concerns. Though Millennials are more likely to consume marijuana than any other age group, the older generations are starting to catch up. An analysis of government survey data revealed increasing numbers of cannabis users among those fifty and older. Specifically, 4.8% of those surveyed in 2013 said they had used cannabis in the last year, a near doubling from 2007. According to sales data from market research firm Headset, Baby Boomers accounted for ~24% of cannabis sales in 2018. As legalization efforts proceed and stigmas wane, these numbers are set to keep going up. The reasons for this increase are difficult to pin down, but it’s likely due to the perceived health benefits of marijuana. According to the article, older users have concerns about or a fear of getting high. This is reflected in NiaMedic’s marketing. On their front page, they state that 94% of their patients report no psychoactive side effects from cannabis. Dr. Benjamin Han, a geriatric specialist interviewed for the piece, says that he’s been increasingly asked about marijuana by his patients in the past five years. “The two main things are pain and sleep,” he says. Support for marijuana legalization has risen across all demographics over the last several decades. The number one reason? Medical uses. The fear of getting high reflects the different concerns that different populations face. As we get older, falls become more prevalent and more serious. Being lightheaded or dizzy from medication increases the risk of a fall. The elderly are also more likely to suffer from chronic illness, and are at increased risk of acute, life-threatening health events like heart attacks or stroke, both of which are weakly associated with cannabis use. Therefore, doctors and patients have a lot of extra risks to consider when deciding to treat with cannabis. The method of obtaining medical marijuana presents its own issues. When a doctor writes a prescription, they specify the number of doses given to a patient, the strength of each, and a dosing schedule. This information goes to a pharmacist, who prepares and delivers the medications. However, this is not how it works with medical marijuana. A doctor can recommend cannabis and offer guidance, but it’s up to the patient or a caregiver to decide what to buy and how much. This creates an opportunity for dispensary sales staff to have an outsized impact on what the patient actually walks out with. This can be doubly dicey for those seniors who are too embarrassed to ask their doctors about marijuana. That said, with proper medical supervision, these risks can be avoided or mitigated. For example, a report from the European Journal of Internal medicine suggests the “start low, go slow” philosophy. This approach allows patients to build up a tolerance to THC without feeling any of the high. By closely monitoring the amounts taken and their effects, doctors can work with their patients to determine the optimal dose and make adjustments as necessary. And thankfully for Dr. Han’s patients, cannabis has been shown to be effective for treating insomnia and chronic pain. Overall, there’s no reason why seniors as a group should be excluded from exploring marijuana as a treatment option. It may require a little extra care, but if a single medication can treat several conditions at once, it might just be worth it."
Medium.com,Life,How the Endocannabinoid System Interacts And Affects Our Hormones?,Cannabis,https://medium.com/quality-cbd/how-the-endocannabinoid-system-interacts-and-affects-our-hormones-ae992ae39df7?source=topic_page---------86------------------1," Cannabinoids are becoming more and more popular in the world of natural medicine. As research continues, we are learning more about how their effects stem from the way they interact with the endocannabinoid system (ECS). Hormones are chemical messengers to the body that travel in our blood to organs and tissues, signaling them to work. They can affect different processes in our body including metabolism, health and mood, all of which are also affected by cannabinoids and the way they react with the ECS. In this article, we will be taking a closer look at the relationship between hormones and the endocannabinoid system to better understand how cannabinoids work in the body. What is the Endocannabinoid System? The ECS is a physiological system involved in health maintenance. The system’s receptors are found in the brain, numerous organs, connective tissues, glands and immune cells. Because it has so many points of interaction within the body, it has a powerful effect on the body as well as the mind. When cannabinoids are introduced to the body, they react with the system’s receptors (CB1 and CB2 receptors) to produce different results throughout the body. What is the Endocrine System? The endocrine system is a collection of glands that secretes hormones to the bloodstream, to be carried towards organs throughout the rest of the body. The central neuroendocrine system is the interface between the brain and the rest of the endocrine systems. The part of the brain that regulates the release of hormones in called the hypothalamus. It sits on top of the pituitary gland and works to regulate stress, metabolism, growth, reproduction and lactation. These are regulated when the hypothalamus releases or inhibits the release of hormones by the pituitary gland. The release of these hormones affects certain physiological functions in the body. These enable the nervous system to respond rapidly to internal or external environmental changes and maintain a response through endocrine hormonal transducers. The ECS modulates the regulation of the neuroendocrine system working to maintain organ functions, stress response and a healthy balance overall. The ECS and Endocrine Regulation When cannabinoids interact with the ECS, they affect the secretion of pituitary hormones. They regulate hormonal balance through the effect they have on the organs. They stimulate the hypothalamic pituitary adrenal axis (HPA) to produce a response to stress that is dependent on the CB1 receptor signaling. Activating these receptors results in a series of signaling events that inhibits overall neuroendocrine function. The endocrine response, as part of the HPA axis, is central to its regulation. Up until a few years ago, scientists thought the stimulatory effects cannabinoids had on the HPA axis was an exception. It was thought that the ECS played an inhibitory role on neuroendocrine functions. Today, we understand that the functions can be both stimulatory and inhibitory, which is how it modulates regulation. How CBD Comes Into Play Now let’s look at how cannabinoids come into play in all this. CBD does not interact strongly with the CB receptors. Rather it inhibits fatty acid amide hydrolase (FAAH), an enzyme that breaks down cannabinoids in the body. Its effect as a FAAH inhibitor makes it helpful for people suffering with anxiety disorders. It also may improve the regulation of the HPA axis to modulate the sensitivity of cannabinoid receptors in the body. But in addition to stimulating the HPA, it can also work to play an inhibitory role. It can negatively modulate the stress induced activation of the HPA axis. This makes for an increase in endocannabinoid signaling activity which can also be helpful in treating anxiety disorders. The way CBD and other cannabinoids react with the endocrine system also make it promising in treatment of infertility, obesity, diabetes and even some diseases associated with the cardiovascular system. CBD and Hormones in the Body CBD and Cortisol: Another way CBD is effective in treating anxiety is dependent on the way it interacts with the hormone, cortisol. The endocrine system manages our response to stress via hormones like epinephrine (adrenaline) and cortisol. Cortisol is one of the main hormones involved in managing a stress response. It produces the fight or flight instinct that is necessary for survival but increased levels of the hormone can lead to weight gain, mood swings and anxiety. CBD is believed to interfere with the secretion of cortisol decreasing its prevalence in plasma samples and making levels drop significantly. CBD and Insulin: The endocrine system also works to manage the metabolism. It produces hormones in the pancreas, one of which is insulin. Insulin helps the body absorb and store nutrients from food and allow sugar to pass from your bloodstream to individual cells. Insulin imbalances have detrimental effects to health. Too much insulin can lead to high blood sugar (hyperglycemia) and too little insulin can lead to low blood sugar (hypoglycemia). When blood sugar levels are constantly high, diabetes can occur. The relationship between CBD, insulin and the metabolism is still unclear, but animal studies have shown that there was a drop in diabetes related to the use of CBD. Other studies have shown it can impact the functioning of the pancreas in such a way that it affects insulin production, blood sugar levels and more. CBD and Melatonin: Melatonin is a hormone naturally produced in the body. It spikes at night to make us sleepy and levels out in the morning. The ECS plays a key role in regulating sleep via the activation of the CB1 receptors. CBD reacts with the receptors in the pineal gland to stimulate the secretion of sleep hormones like melatonin, helping to affect the sleep cycle and energy levels to regulate the sleep-wake cycle. The ECS and Estrogen As CBD oil becomes more accepted in the medical field, many wonder what affects it has on sex hormones, reproductive functions and other critical health issues like cognition and immune health. One interesting fact to look at when studying the relationship between the ECS and hormones is that women have been found to be more susceptible to the abuse of cannabinoids and the development of dependence. They also tend to experience more withdrawal symptoms and relapse more often than men do. In addition, it’s been found that women are more impacted when under the influence. Female adolescents, in particular, are more adversely affected by the use of marijuana as opposed to men, most likely due to estrogen levels. The cannabinoid was shown to have a direct relationship with the ECS and gonadal hormones. These are hormones that are located in the gonads and include steroid gonads such as estrogen and progesterone from the ovaries and testosterone from the gonads. The ECS is involved in many functions, including sexual behavior which is regulated by gonadal hormones paving the way for there to be a complex bidirectional interaction, specifically when changes to the HPG axis occur. When thinking of the relationship between endocannabinoids and estrogen, here is what is currently known: The CB1 is modulated by estrogen, which also increases anandamide synthesis while decreasing FAAH activity. FAAH is the principal enzyme which degrades anandamide. Degrading the enzyme increases the amount of anandamide that is present. This, in turn, decreases GnRH release to make for less FSH and LH release. This leads to a decrease of estrogen from the ovaries. It also down regulates FAAH activity in the uterus and immune cells. Endocannabinoid activity and CB1 receptor functions fluctuate throughout the menstrual cycle. In humans, the amount of anandamide circulating is higher during the follicular stage and lower during the luteal stage. This means the ECS plays a role in the regulation of the menstrual cycle as well as fertility. Various levels of the ECS have been found in the ovaries and uterus and levels can vary in a set matter during the time of embryo implantation. Data suggests that low anandamide levels are best for implantation and carrying a baby to term while higher levels facilitate the labor process. In pregnant women, anandamide levels are typically low throughout pregnancy but surge right before labor is about to take place. When, due to unforeseen circumstances, a surge occurs during pregnancy, miscarriages are more likely to happen. Furthermore, animal studies have shown that the administration of estradiol can increase levels of anandamide causing antidepressant effects. This impact on emotion is believed to be elicited through the endocannabinoid system. The recent research that links estrogen and the endocannabinoid system should open up new ways of looking at the human body, especially in relation to women. This will allow us to continue on our medical journey with a clear understanding of the role the ECS plays in a women’s reproductive, emotional and immune health. This article has highlighted the connection between hormones and the ECS, not only for women, but for all people. This information opens new doors in the medical community and is shedding light on the understanding of the functions of the human body and the role cannabinoids play on well-being."
Medium.com,Life,Cannabis Stocks Are Crashing: 3 Pot Stocks on Sale,Cannabis,https://medium.com/the-motley-fool/cannabis-stocks-are-crashing-3-pot-stocks-on-sale-ed720e6da37d?source=topic_page---------87------------------1," Marijuana stocks’ sky-high valuations have been coming back to earth in 2019 on worry that Canada’s legal, adult-use market sales are stalling and fervor over growing legalization in the United States is overdone. The tumble in marijuana market caps, however, could offer growth investors a second-chance opportunity to pick up pot stocks at bargain prices. There are a lot of pot stocks you can choose to buy on this dip, but I think HEXO Corp. (NYSEMKT:HEXO), CannTrust Holdings (NYSE:CTST), and OrganiGram Holdings (NASDAQ:OGI) may offer the best bang for your investment buck. Canada’s marijuana market is valued at an estimated 6 billion Canadian dollars per year. The prospect of shifting those sales to legal, regulated companies rightfully has a lot of investors excited, but the total dollar potential to marijuana companies could be much bigger. Why? Because most of Canada’s illegal marijuana market is for dried flower, not value-added products like oils, edibles, and other consumer products such as beverages and lotions. Recognizing there’s a lot of potential profit in marketing finished products that use marijuana as an ingredient, HEXO has taken steps to position itself as a major player in what could be the next big driver of demand. In August 2018, HEXO inked a joint venture with beer giant Molson Coors Brewing to create cannabis-infused beverages. That company, Truss, is already deep into developing products that could hit the Canadian market as soon as the end of 2019, if regulators cooperate. HEXO is also putting in place a U.S. consumer goods strategy that seeks to take advantage of December’s passage of the U.S. Farm Bill, which removed hemp — a strain of cannabis sativa — from the controlled substances list. The move clears the way toward enabling companies to market products consisting of hemp-derived cannabidiol (CBD), a chemical cannabinoid found in marijuana and hemp that’s associated with wellness. HEXO’s management recently disclosed its inked supply agreements that provide the company with 260,000 kilograms of hemp through 2020. Its goal? To extract CBD from it for use in products that it can sell in up to eight U.S. states as early as next year. The possibility of new products on the horizon is exciting, especially since HEXO’s guidance already calls for significant revenue growth, in part because of additional marijuana grow capacity that’s coming on line. The company’s annual marijuana capacity is currently about 9,800 kilograms, but investments have it on track to reach annualized production of 150,000 kilograms. The increase in production prompted management to set a goal of CA$400 million in sales in fiscal 2020 (12 months ending July 2020). CannTrust has been a disaster stock for investors this year, and it’s arguably the riskiest pot stock with the greatest potential reward from here. Let’s begin by listing all the bad news that’s derailed this company this year: Needless to say, investors can’t be blamed for souring on CannTrust given that onslaught. There’s undeniably no telling how this shakes out, but it’s not out of the question that a path emerges that allows CannTrust to get back to business, rewarding investors in the process. For instance, regulators could limit their action to a fine and greater oversight, rather than a revoking of CannTrust’s license. Couple such an outcome with the resignation of the company’s CEO — a must in my view — and a healing process with shareholders could begin. There’s plenty of potential if — and this is a big if — this best-case scenario plays out. CannTrust’s current expansions could result in annualized production of 50,000 kilos in Q3, and if it finally gets its acreage licensed, outdoor growing could increase production to 200,000 kilos in 2020, making CannTrust one of the largest second-tier Canadian growers. Nevertheless, it could be an even bigger disaster if a regulatory verdict doesn’t go CannTrust’s way. Since we don’t know what’s going to happen, only those who can withstand a complete loss should probably consider buying this one off the clearance rack. A three-tier grow system allows OrganiGram to produce a lot of high-quality marijuana indoors on the cheap, and that may make it the most attractive beat-up pot stock to buy on this list. Last quarter, OrganiGram’s net revenue jumped 620% year over year to CA$24.75 million, and over the past nine months its sales were CA$64.1 million. Its quarterly sales performance was driven by a sharp increase in kilograms sold to 4,615 kilos that only hints at the potential revenue associated with its planned increases in production. OrganiGram’s current annual production capacity is 61,000 kilos following it securing licenses for its phase 4A expansion last month. It’s already in the process of filing rooms from its phase 4B expansion for approval, and if licenses are granted, that would add another 28,000 kilos of production per year. Finally, it’s targeting the filing of its phase 4C rooms for approval by year’s end, which would increase total production to 113,000 kilos if regulators give them a green light. That’s a substantial increase that could allow the company to make big headway toward profitability. OrganiGram’s gross margin dipped because of lower yields associated with a pilot grow program that didn’t pan out last quarter, but management expects margin to return to industry-leading levels. For perspective, before dipping to 50% last quarter, its gross margin was 60% two quarters ago, which was miles higher than many of its peers. If OrganiGram can hold the line on its expenses and its yields recover to where they were before its failed pilot program, then a substantial increase in sales resulting from its production capacity growth could position it perfectly for best-in-class operating margin someday, making it my favorite of the three to buy on sale."

They were all members of the Club des Hashischins — the “Hash Club” — formed in the 19th century as a way to provide opportunities for these towering figures and other celebrated creatives to explore the benefits of writing while high. Shocked? Probably not. It’s a long-held assumption that many artistic types throughout history have at least experimented with substances. Step outside the world of the highly creative, though, and the picture changes: Being high in the workplace is generally not considered responsible or productive. Yet data suggests that more people are using cannabis on the job. In 2018 nearly 3% of drug tests among workers and job applicants proved positive for marijuana, a 16% jump from 2014, according to a study of more than 10 million drug tests by lab testing firm Quest Diagnostics. As marijuana laws and attitudes continue to evolve toward tolerance, could this change? There’s reason to believe mixing pot and work may not be as problematic as once thought. Some scientists, physicians, and other experts are going as far as to suggest that for some people, pot can even be a tool for increasing productivity. “It depends on the individual and the job,” says Michael Tagen, a PhD pharmacology researcher who consults pharmaceutical companies about marijuana neuroscience. “But there are tantalizing hints from studies, and lots of anecdotal evidence, that it can help some people.”"
Medium.com,Life,Illinois Becomes The 11th US State To Legalize Weed,Cannabis,https://medium.com/@yomiadebisi/illinois-becomes-the-11th-us-state-to-legalize-weed-800834b52e40?source=topic_page---------90------------------1," Marijuana still illegal at the federal level, but since 2014, federal prosecutors have generally ignored marijuana sales in 10 states that legalized for personal use including: Alaska, California, Colorado, Maine, Massachusetts, Michigan, Oregon, Nevada, Vermont, and Washington, District of Columbia. Illinois becomes the latest state to join the group and the first to create a regulated cannabis system legalized by the legislature. Tuesday, the 25th of June 2019, marks an important day in the life of cannabis users in the state of Illinois, as the Illinois “Cannabis Regulation and Tax Act” bill passed by the Illinois General Assembly to legalize recreational marijuana use was signed by democrat Governor J.B. Pritzker. Although this marks the first time a state would create a regulated cannabis system legalized by the legislature, Illinois becomes the second state after Vermont to legalize the use of weed through state legislature rather than by voters at the ballot box. While Illinois law establishes statewide distribution regulations, legalizing the sale of cannabis. Vermont, however has no provision made for commercial sale. The bill which goes into effect January 1, 2020 will allow Illinois residents have licenses to grow and sell cannabis, as well as allow adults 21 and older to possess and consume it. It allows residents the purchase and possession of up to one ounce of weed and non-residents up to 15 grams. Personal growing will only be fully legal for medical use. Previous low-level convictions and arrests for marijuana will be pardoned and expunged. Although the state previously allowed marijuana for medical purposes, possession of pot is still a crime in Illinois till Jan 1, 2020. By legalizing marijuana, the state is hopeful of clipping tax on it, and it’s estimated to eventually rack up $500 million in revenue. The governor plans to take 25 percent of the marijuana tax revenue and put it toward local businesses that sell cannabis in predominantly black and brown neighborhoods. Governor J.B. Pritzker, whose successful campaign for governor capitalized on growing public sentiment, pointed out that the law enforcement had better things to do than chase pot-smokers and that state government could benefit from the regulating and taxing of the product as it does alcohol and tobacco. He initially estimated that in the budget year which begins July 1, dispensary licensing would generate $170 million, but Senator Heather Steans and Representative Kelly Cassidy, both Chicago Democrats who have been advocating legalization for at least four years, were forced to lower that estimate to about $58 million in the final proposal. Cassidy added that the fully implemented program might generate only $500 million annually within five years. Promising proposals in New York and New Jersey both ended up in failure this spring. Despite efforts by governors of each states to legalize weed. Are you a resident of Illinois planning on owning a weed farm? You are going to have to wait till Jan 1, next year to get your license."

In researching that piece, I came across a documentary on YouTube called “The Exit Drug”. The title refers to marijuana’s longstanding designation as a “gateway” drug that leads impressionable youth to try harder and harder substances. The argument made in this film is that the opposite is true: we have a country wracked by opioid use, and marijuana is the way out. Using interviews with doctors, scientists, and former opioid addicts, it makes a compelling case for cannabis. But is this a good source of truthful information, or is it a piece of propaganda using the trappings of science? Time to dig in and give it a whiff in this first installment of The Sniff Test."
Medium.com,Life,Cannabis Transformed My Sex Life,Cannabis,https://medium.com/soccer-domme/cannabis-transformed-my-sex-life-3acf6f78ada5?source=topic_page---------92------------------1," My
boyfriend and I have just left the restaurant where we’ve eaten a delicious meal. We’re waiting to cross the street when he takes out a joint and lights it. We smoke as we walk to our favorite dispensary. The cannabis enhances our journey. The colored lights of the Los Angeles downtown cityscape glow all the more brightly. The air feels warmer and more comforting; the city sounds lull. When we arrive at the dispensary, now open for the sale of recreational marijuana in the state of California, we enter the brightly lit store. Young sales associates rush around to guide customers to the right purchase. The dispensary boasts expertly packaged products and tasteful displays. Clearly a lot of money is going into this industry, but it’s not just so people can get high. Quite a few products target sexual health, which is why my boyfriend and I are there. Our sex life has greatly benefited thanks to marijuana. That some politicians continue to tout marijuana as a dangerous gateway drug or an example of moral decrepitude is ridiculous. Cannabis helps couples feel closer and therefore be more stable. Focus on the family, right? For this evening’s bout of lovemaking, we purchase a cannabis-infused bath bomb as well as a vape pen that’s engineered to create “passion.” The vape is specifically geared to be used when having sex. We also buy a tincture that is sprayed right onto your sexual parts to increase sensation. It’s a water-based lube that’s also steeped in cannabis. Then we return to my boyfriend’s place for a night of sex. He fills the bath, and we let the bath bomb sizzle while we soak naked in the tub. We relax, and I feel my muscles open up. This is so necessary for me, as I suffer from back pain that is only exacerbated by the hours I spend every day in front of my computer. I also have TMJ, which means I grind my teeth at night. Even sleeping with a mouth splint means I still often wake up with neck pain and a headache. This has all led to the tightening of my pelvic floor, and that’s contributed to numbness and lack of sensation in my vagina. Cannabis use helps my body to relax in a way that over-the-counter anti-inflammatories can’t. It’s also safer and less addictive than the benzodiazepines I’ve been prescribed by doctors. After the bath, we dry ourselves off, then inhale some vapor. I feel my body release even more — all of my body, which means my vagina as well. My erogenous zones feel like they’re lighting up all over, begging to be touched. We move to the bed where my boyfriend sprays some of the tincture on my clitoris and vulva lips. When we finally have sex, it’s sex I don’t want to stop. I climax with multiple orgasms. Once my orgasms subside, I feel every muscle in my body go slack. I feel my body as I haven’t felt it in years. I feel my muscles without tension or pain. I feel the body I had before I began to spend my days sitting in a chair, typing at a computer. The knots in my muscles from my feet to my neck cease to ache."
Medium.com,Life,"Yes, There Is Too Such A Thing As A Marijuana Expert",Cannabis,https://medium.com/the-no-bs-guide-to-medical-cannabis/yes-there-is-too-such-a-thing-as-a-marijuana-expert-d51cf18b16c1?source=topic_page---------93------------------1," The other day, while researching topics to write about, I came across an opinion piece titled “Marijuana Experts? There Really Is No Such Thing”. I found this to be a really odd statement, coming as it does from someone who I would consider a marijuana expert, freelance writer Mike Adams. He’s been writing about cannabis for six years, publishing work in Forbes, Salon, and High Times, among others. He publishes pieces on cannabis culture and legalization a few times a week. If he’s not an expert, who is? And in fact, I actually agree with the spirit of his piece. Essentially, he’s arguing that we (as in humans, collectively) don’t know nearly as much as we should about the positive and negative effects of marijuana consumption. Obviously I have no issue with that stance; this publication exists for that very reason! It’s the suggestion that no one individual knows enough to have an authoritative opinion that sticks in my craw. To make his point, Adams cites some potentially disturbing research regarding the paucity of marijuana education for medical professionals in the US. A 2016 survey of American medical schools found that only 9% included a discussion of cannabis in their curricula. Nearly 90% of doctors surveyed felt unprepared to prescribe cannabis, and just over a third felt qualified to even answer questions about it. Clearly, this is a situation that needs to be rectified. But in response, Adams goes on to say: This means that when discussing medical marijuana with your family doctor, chances are everything he or she tells you, good or bad, is just an opinion and not rooted in any sort of science. I have a real problem with this statement. Doctors don’t stop learning when they leave medical school. They are constantly reading new research to keep up with the state of medicine. With the demand for medical marijuana being what it is, it’s unrealistic to assume that doctors aren’t taking notice and working to educate themselves, or that they don’t have the required background to do so effectively. Adams’s statement also makes the assumption that all opinions have equal validity. Even if your doctor hasn’t taken the time to educate him-/herself on this subject, any medical opinion they give you will be based on years of study and practical experience, and will certainly be more valuable than that of your local budtender. It’s this last point that makes Adams’s position worth arguing against. A 2016 survey of dispensary employees showed that, while only 20% had any sort of prior medical or scientific training, 94% of them made recommendations based on a person’s self-reported symptoms or ailments. These individuals have no training in assessing potential drug-drug interactions, the relative harms of ingesting marijuana based on pre-existing conditions, or any number of other medically relevant reasons not to smoke. These people are not qualified to have medical opinions, and could be putting people in harm’s way. Early in the piece, Adams says, “[…]I am no expert on every facet of this plant. Nobody is.” While technically true, this is not how expertise works. I have a PhD in Molecular Biology, and would consider myself an expert, but not in every aspect of the field. Neither is any other professor, post-doc, or graduate student. However, we can communicate the intricacies of our particular specialities to each other using specialized language because of a shared understanding of the subject’s fundamentals. It’s the ability to internalize and synthesize information based on an existing body of knowledge that makes an expert. Do doctors need more training in the uses of marijuana as medicine? Absolutely. Do we need more research into what those uses are? You betcha. But just because our knowledge is incomplete doesn’t mean that that we know nothing, and it certainly doesn’t mean that no one individual doesn’t hold or understand that knowledge. The trick is to rely upon each expert for their particular area of expertise. I wouldn’t ask my doctor to recommend a vaporizer any more than I’d ask my budtender about fixing my tendonitis. Neither should you."
Medium.com,Life,What Does Science Say About Using CBD For ADHD?,Cannabis,https://medium.com/@ministryofhemp/what-does-science-say-about-using-cbd-for-adhd-e1e59b9d8725?source=topic_page---------94------------------1," As part of our continuing look at the science of cannabinoids, we thought we’d look at what current research says about using CBD for ADHD and ADD. We all have trouble concentrating and controlling our impulses from time to time. But for a considerable number of children and adults, these problems can disrupt their lives. In the United States, approximately 8.1% of the population struggles with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) at some point in their lives. Although research is still preliminary, a growing body of evidence shows cannabinoids could be beneficial in ADHD treatment, not only by alleviating symptoms but by also improving the chemical imbalances that cause them. Below we’ll look at what the current science suggests about using CBD for ADHD, including its safety. A neurobiological disorder, doctors typically diagnose ADHD during childhood or adolescence, though it often persists into adulthood. Characterized by inattentiveness and hyperactivity-impulsivity, there are three subtypes: Additional symptoms can include problems with managing stress, insomnia, anxiety, aggression, and self-focusing behavior (the inability to recognize the needs or wants of others). An extremely complex disorder, ADHD is thought to be caused by a combination of genetics and environmental factors. Widespread brain abnormalities, spanning from the prefrontal cortex to the cerebellum, are associated with the disorder. Whether dependent on genes or environment, individuals who do develop the disorder have lower than average levels of dopamine and norepinephrine. Both of these neurotransmitters play a critical role in the motor and reward systems, which may explain the inattentive and hyperactive-impulsive symptoms. The chances of inheriting ADHD from a parent is somewhere between 60–90%. This suggests genetics are the primary cause but not the only one. Chromosomal deletions and duplications, where parts of the genetic code are either missing or repeated, are common in individuals with the disorder. These likely cause the associated brain abnormalities. Environmental factors during fetal development and infancy can aggravate pre-existing genetic issues. Prenatal exposure to alcohol and nicotine, low birth weight, malnutrition, and a lack of socialization early in life may increase the risk of ADHD. Of course, it is not possible to alter genes using cannabinoids or any other medications. However, CBD may help with addictions, possibly reducing fetal exposure. People with ADHD have lower levels of dopamine, which affects reward-motivated behavior. Pharmaceutical stimulants, like Ritalin and Adderall, increase the availability of dopamine in the brain. Unfortunately, these medications do not work for everyone. They also pose a risk of severe or life-threatening side effects. Some cannabinoids, like the psychoactive tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), may increase dopamine activity in the bain. They do this in the same way as stimulants, and all other drugs with a potential for abuse, by triggering the reward system. CBD may also increase availability but in a very different way. In a preclinical trial, mice with lower than average numbers of G protein-coupled receptors (GPR6) in the brain showed higher levels of dopamine than mice with a normal amount of these receptors. This indicates that reducing activity in GPR6 increases either dopamine production or release. A brain receptor is a sort of parking lot for different neurotransmitters, with spaces for them to ‘park’ and produce their effects. Because CBD can ‘park’ on GPR6 but does not do anything once there, it reduces activity in the receptor by taking up space. Theoretically, this may increase dopamine levels. A neurotransmitter and hormone vital to everything from movement to blood pressure, norepinephrine levels are also lower than average in people with ADHD. Nonstimulant medications, like atomoxetine and clonidine, increase levels of norepinephrine. This improves attention span and lowers hyperactivity and impulsivity. The locus coeruleus (LC) region of the brain, which plays a role in the ability to concentrate, is a principal source of this neurotransmitter. CBR1 cannabinoid receptors appear throughout the LC. Stimulating these receptors seems to increase the release of norepinephrine into the rest of the brain. Study shows some synthetic cannabinoids created in the lab may increase norepinephrine activity in the LC, consequently raising dopamine levels. Cannabinoids also show the potential to regulate this area of the brain by preventing over-activation, which can reduce the ability to focus. Because these chemicals mimic naturally occurring cannabinoids, plant-based treatments may produce similar results. The beneficial effects are possible due to the ability of cannabinoids to inhibit monoamine oxidase (MAO), which helps metabolize dopamine and norepinephrine. Slowing the breakdown process of these neurotransmitters can lead to higher levels throughout the brain. While the body of research on the effect of cannabinoids in the brain is quite large, there are very few studies specifically on ADHD. The few that do exist show there is potential, but further research is necessary. In a preclinical trial, researchers used a drug called MK-801, which induces inattentiveness and hyperactivity in rats. This mimics the symptoms of ADHD. Pretreatment with CBD reduced hyperactivity but did not appear to affect attention span. A clinical trial conducted in 2017 compared the effects of a placebo treatment to Sativex (an oral spray containing a 1:1 ratio of CBD to THC) in 30 adults with ADHD. The adults given Sativex showed improvements in hyperactivity-impulsivity, attention span, and emotional control, while the placebo group did not. While the existing studies show cannabinoids indeed have potential, the likelihood of ADHD treatment beginning during childhood means more research is needed to determine their safety. Although 5.2% of children already take traditional stimulant or non-stimulant medications, most are not recommended for use in patients under six years old, and the effects of long-term use are not clear. Over 20 weeks, a group of 20 children took a cannabis extract containing 100 mg/ml CBD and 2 mg/ml THC. Most of the participants had mild adverse effects, such as tiredness and poor balance, but these resolved themselves within eight weeks. While these results are encouraging, further study is needed to determine the long-term effects. Behavioral therapy is the recommended frontline ADHD treatment for younger pediatric patients. Medication is only appropriate in older patients, when therapy proves ineffective. And we just don’t know enough about the effect of cannabinoids on young minds. When it comes to adults, there’s a growing body of evidence suggesting that CBD has very few side effects. Even the World Health Organization reported that CBD is safe and nonaddictive. Approximately 26.5 million Americans struggle with ADHD at some point in their lives. If cannabinoids can help even a fraction of them, an enormous amount of lives could be improved. We can’t stress this enough, but it’s vital to consult with a medical professional before beginning any treatment program. This is even more true when it comes to children and adolescents. It’s also important not to change your existing treatment plan without medical advice. Abruptly discontinuing behavioral or pharmaceutical therapies can be extremely detrimental and is not recommended in any circumstance. We think it’s clear that CBD and other cannabinoids could help some people with ADHD. We hope scientists continue to investigate and we’ll continue to report back when they do."

We answer questions about the new law which makes it legal to possess a certain amount of recreational marijuana, to smoke marijuana recreationally in certain places, and to obtain and sell a license to grow and sell recreational, including: The new Illinois Marijuana Law will go into effect on January 1, 2020. If you are 21 years old or older, you will be allowed to purchase marijuana from licenced sellers and smoke it in Illinois. Beginning on January 1, 2020, if you are 21 years or older and an Illinois resident it will be legal for you to possess 30 grams of marijuana, 5 grams of cannabis concentrate, or edibles containing up to 500 milligrams of THC. If you are not a resident, you may only possess half of these amounts while visiting Illinois. For approximately the first half of 2020, only medical marijuana dispensaries will be permitted to sell recreational marijuana. After that time period, Illinois will begin granting licenses to other sellers. Minority-owned businesses will be given preference. Applicants may be eligible for low-interest loans in order to facilitate startup. Even though Marijuana will be legal, you will still not be permitted to smoke recreationally in public places, in motor vehicles, on school grounds, in proximity to anyone under the age of 21, or in proximity to an on-duty bus driver, police officer, firefighter, or corrections officer. It will be legal to smoke in your home and in businesses that permit marijuana smoking. Medical marijuana patients will be permitted to grow up to five Marijuana plants at a time. Other residents must apply for a license as a craft grower in order to grow marijuana. The penalty for unlicensed growing of marijuana is $200.00 or more depending on the amount. Prior to the new law being effective, minor marijuana cultivation offenses were punishable by up to one-year in prison and a $2,500.00 fine. The legal limit for driving is a THC blood concentration of more than five nanograms per milliliter. If you have more than that in your system you will be charged with a DUI. If you were convicted of possessing under 30 grams of Marijuana prior to January 1, 2020, your record will likely be automatically expunged as long as the convictions were not part of a violent crime. You can petition for expungement of convictions for possession of between 30 and 500 grams of marijuana.

Medium.com,Life,Indica or Sativa Marijuana—Explained,Cannabis,https://medium.com/cannabis-education/indica-or-sativa-marijuana-explained-25176ad7a865?source=topic_page---------96------------------1," The names we use for describing marijuana such as “indica” and “sativa” were introduced in the 18th century to describe different species of cannabis: Marijuana sativa and Weed indica. The term sativa, named by Carl Linneaus, described hemp ferns noticed in Europe and western Eurasia, where it was cultivated for its fiber and seeds. Pot indica, named by Jean-Baptiste Lamarck, describes the psychoactive varieties discovered in India, where it was harvested for its seeds, fiber, and hashish production. Here’s how terms have shifted since their earliest botanical definitions: In recent times, sativa marijauna” refers to tall, narrow-leaf varieties of marijuana, thought to induce energizing effects. But, these narrow-leaf drug (NLD) varieties were originally Weed indica ssp. Indica. Indica marijuana has come to describe stout, broad-leaf ferns, thought to deliver sedating effects. These broad-leaf drug (BLD) varieties tend to be technically Marijuana indica ssp. Afghanica. What we call “hemp” refers to the industrial, non-intoxicating varieties harvested primarily for fiber, seeds, and CBD. But, this was originally named Pot sativa. Confused? We can understand. As you could visualize, with the mass commercialization of pot, the taxonomic distinctions between marijuana species and subspecies got turned on its head and calcified. It seems the contemporary use of indica and sativa marijuana identifier is here to stay, although as an informed marijuana user, it’s key to understand the practical value of those categories — which brings us to the statistics. This labeling system we use to determine marijuana effects is no doubt convenient, especially any time while first entering the vast, overpowering world of pot. With hundreds of unique strains and products to pick from, where else would we start? In general, Indica marijuana plants grow low to the ground in a bushy manner, with large leaves branching out. Indica strains of marijuana are often preferred by growers, because of their faster growth and larger produce than sativa strains. There are a number of benefits to consuming marijuana inica-dominant marijuana strain. Why choose Indica Marijuana Strains: To learn more, visit the library of known indica marijuana strains, including their effects and flavors, as well as how they have been bred. Sativa dominant marijuana plants are often considered polar opposites of the Indica marijuana strains, and tend to grow much larger than indicas. You can sually identify a sativa marijuana plant by it’s large but thin leaves, much more narrow than indica leaves. Sativa strains take longer to harvest than Indica, typically taking 12+ weeks, versus Indica’s 9+ week flowering period. Because of where Sativa plants originate, they often require much more light than their indica counterparts.

Medium.com,Life,Girls Just Wanna Get Stoned,Cannabis,https://medium.com/@mibowden505/girls-just-wanna-get-stoned-e055800cefcd?source=topic_page---------97------------------1," When people talk about marijuana and music, the focus tends to be on genres like hip-hop and rock and on iconic male artists like Willie Nelson and Snoop Dog. But women artists are not only engaging with the cannabis culture, they are poised to alter it in a major way as marijuana becomes a larger industry with each passing year. With recreational cannabis legal in Canada and 11 U.S. States and a total of 33 states with some form of legal medical marijuana, the march towards decriminalization and legalization has begun to legitimize recreational marijuana use as a lifestyle choice. Having mature artists like Nelson become deeply involved in the blooming cannabis industry helps to remove the stigma that has always surrounded the drug and demonstrate its potential as an entrepreneurial and economic engine. Streaming music has helped to stabilize the music industry but it has contributed to a generalized decrease in album sales. Artists have already become familiar with the fact that live performances and gear tend to rack up bigger dollar sales than their recorded music. The music itself has become more of a content marketing tool than a moneymaker: the music draws in a certain group of listeners and creates a community that the artist can then market other merchandise to. For some artists cannabis products are a natural line to promote, and an increasing number of those artists are women. Indie rocker and former Rilo Kiley singer Jenny Lewis has recently announced that she will release a strain called “Rabbit Hole” developed by Glass House Farms, a Santa Barbara area pot cultivator. Lewis’ product is available in pre-rolls and is described as a Sour Diesel sativa with a 16.3% THC content. Many users like to smoke a strain that is lower in TCH because they can partake of some of the more positive effects of the drug while still being able to function at a high level. In a recent Rolling Stone interview Lewis offered this insight into her product: “I really wanted a low-THC sativa dominant. Because I think a lot of the weed that you can buy at the dispensaries is pretty high THC. And that stuff, lets say you roll a joint, and then your friends’ parent is backstage, it will just knock them on their asses. You want something that’s a little more old-school, like a low-THC sativa. Sour Diesel is perfect. And this is not my own strain, which I want to be clear about. This is a blend, and we’ve got these doobs right now, however I hope a strain is imminent.” Lewis apparently sampled around 20 kinds of weed before she settled on the Sour Diesel strain. “When we had our meetings, she showed up and busted out her stash and started smoking. She’s a true fan and not just doing a greenwash,” says Glasshouse Farms CEO Graham Farrar. So far one of the key elements to successfully selling a marijuana product has been for the artist involved to be a regular user of the product, not merely someone looking for additional revenue. Lewis acknowledges that marijuana use isn’t a non-issue yet, though, even in the music industry: “In our generation, there’s a little bit of secrecy and shame if you’re a true pothead, because there were consequences.” One of the female artists who seems to have taken heat over her use of pot is country pop star Kacey Musgraves. While spaceykacey (her Instagram handle) has never shied away from talking about marijuana use in songs like “Trailer Park” and “Straight Arrow” or her own affection for pot, some fans thought it went too far when she posted wedding pics of her and husband Ruston Kelly appearing to smoke weed at the event. Many users posted comments saying they were disappointed and that Musgraves was a role model who should not be flaunting such behavior. Would people say the same to Snoop Dog or Whiz Khalifa? Musgraves has staked her claim as an outlaw, and her overall aesthetic definitely represents a changing demographic in country music, one that is at odds with the mores of traditional (read: male) country listeners. In some ways, participation in the cannabis lifestyle and culture is a declaration of independence for many women artists, for whom it represents not only personal freedom, but also the ability to craft a lifestyle brand in an industry that is creating itself from the ground up. Other female country artists have signaled a cannabis positive approach, including Ashley Monroe and singer-songwriter Margo Price. Price is another artist with a cannabis product, this one her own strain named for her album All American Made. Like Musgraves, Margo isn’t exactly the stereotypical female country performer. Her songs wrap up criticism of Nashville’s toxic sexism, cocaine cowboys, and other obstacles with masterful melodies and a steel guitar-soaked country sound, while dark humor and introspection allow her to explore depression and drinking as well. “I think there’s more money to be made in the weed industry than selling records,” she says in a recent Guardian article. “No one buys albums any more — most people just stream them for free — but lots of people buy weed!” Price’s cannabis strain was created specifically for her by Willie Nelson’s brand Willie’s Reserve. According to brand developer Elizabeth Hogan: “It’s a natural extension of Margo’s love of Willie and weed, and our love of Margo’s music and outlaw attitude. This started where a lot of collaborations do — as an idea backstage, around a joint…Musicians supporting cannabis is nothing new, and artist voices are incredibly powerful for building support, but it takes an extra dose of boldness to speak up about cannabis in a pre-legalization community like Nashville.” Right now one of the biggest things the legal cannabis industry has going for it is that those who are most involved are strong advocates for legalized weed and live the lifestyle themselves. We’re in the ‘absolute beginners’ phase of the industry, before the culture becomes completely co-opted by the biggest companies in the world. That will inevitably happen, but I don’t think you can ignore the fact that this is an industry being created from the ground up for the first time in the digital age. Social media, social branding, and a more engaged and woke consumer all reward authenticity over greenwashing (or any ‘washing’) and reward the individual for being authentic rather than fitting into a tribe or genre."

Medium.com,Life,Is Marijuana Addictive?,Cannabis,https://elemental.medium.com/is-marijuana-addictive-ab3a99b4276e?source=topic_page---------99------------------1," he idea that pot is not addictive is widespread. A global survey of 55,000 cannabis users last year found that while 75% believe messages around the health risks of marijuana — from driving under the influence to forgetfulness, as well as harmful chemicals in the smoke — only 64% believe the fact that some people who try it become addicted. Yet health experts and scientists agree marijuana is addictive, though less so than, say, heroin. And as cannabis potency soars, some experts worry that the addictive potential is rising, especially for the under-25 set whose brains are still developing. “Definitely, yes,” cannabis is addictive, says Ruben Baler, a health scientist at the science-policy branch of the National Institute on Drug Abuse (NIDA). “About 10% of people who use marijuana run the risk of addiction,” Baler says. “The risk goes up if you use it frequently.” Furthermore, according to a NIDA statement, “data suggest that 30% of those who use marijuana may have some degree of ‘marijuana use disorder,’” a term recently rolled into the pot lexicon in an as yet confusing attempt to recognize a spectrum of use from relatively harmless to harmful, and to snuff out the stigma of addiction. A brain-imaging study last year found the brain’s neural circuitry is altered in young adults with cannabis dependence, especially for those who start in adolescence. “People with heavy cannabis use had abnormally high connectivity in brain regions important for reward processing and habit formation,” wrote the researchers, led by Peter Manza at the National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism. The findings were detailed in the journal Biological Psychiatry: Cognitive Neuroscience and Neuroimaging. All human addictions point back to dopamine, a chemical that transmits information between the brain’s neurons. Dopamine regulates many functions, from attention and learning to motor skills and emotions. In particular, dopamine is largely responsible for the sense of pleasure, that human frailty behind many motivations and all addictions. But dopamine doesn’t act alone. There’s serotonin (another feel-good chemical), adrenaline, and others. “Whether you are watching a movie, having sex or eating a slice of pizza, neurotransmitters are flowing back and forth, helping you make sense of the experience,” Baler explains. All this is governed by the endocannabinoid system, a set of molecules in the brain and throughout the body that act as an all-powerful puppet master for the other neurotransmitting systems. It employs its own neurotransmitters and also enzymes that make or can destroy others. “It dials things up or down to modulate the effect and balance various system in the brain,” Baler says. “It is a major translator of every experience you go through.” But the endocannabinoid system has its kryptonite: delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol, or THC. THC, a cannabinoid produced in the resin of leaves and buds primarily from the female marijuana plant, is a master of disguise. It mimics the brain’s endocannabinoids and locks onto natural cannabinoid receptors. “THC hijacks the system,” Baler says. The stoned mind is flooded with dopamine, no longer able to properly processes emotions, particularly pleasure. The result for most people, of course, is a good feeling. “Addiction happens when a substance or activity causes the dopamine system to make something pleasurable a habit that becomes stronger and stronger over time,” he says. When cannabis use starts young, the hijacking alters the very structure of the brain’s developing hardware and inserts bad code into its software as it’s being written, potentially setting kids up for addiction problems down the road. Official definitions, especially as they relate to marijuana, are vague and varying. Much of the confusion stems from a move over the past six years to strip the word “addiction” from scientific texts in favor of “substance use disorder.” NIDA, part of the National Institutes of Health (NIH), still sprinkles “addiction” liberally in its explanation of marijuana risks, while an NIH web page discussing “marijuana use disorder” completely avoids mentioning “addiction” in relation to marijuana. Meanwhile, “severe substance use disorder” and “addiction” are used interchangeably by the American Psychiatric Association. Part of the motivation has to do with the meaning of “addiction” becoming diluted. In addition to describing chemically induced dependencies, “Addiction is a more general term, describing behaviors like sex, shopping and gambling,” as well as the internet, video games, and phones, Baler explains. The linguistic pivot also includes a move away from “disease” in favor of “disorder” and dropping “abuse” in favor of varying degrees of “use” — all efforts to destigmatize drug use. The logic: Many people “use” substances that can be harmful, but that use may not necessarily interfere with life. “When that use becomes pathological, it becomes ‘substance use disorder,’” Baler says. “Your life is not going to be upended by that infrequent use. If you smoke every day… the risk of it impacting your life shoots up.” This emerging definition of substance use disorder was introduced in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition, or DSM-5, published in 2013 and representing decades of evolved scientific thinking. DSM-5 was developed by the APA in cooperation with NIDA and other U.S. and global health agencies. DSM-5 replaced “substance abuse” and “substance dependence” with one category: “substance use disorder.” It has three flavors: mild, moderate and severe. According to the definition, experiencing any two of these 11 criteria constitutes what experts used to call addiction: Interpreting the DSM-5 for cannabis is even hazier. NIDA, interpreting DSM-5, puts it this way: “Marijuana use can lead to the development of problem use, known as a marijuana use disorder, which takes the form of addiction in severe cases,” suggesting mild and moderate use disorders don’t signify addiction. By the new definition, it remains unclear exactly how many people have marijuana use disorder and how many suffer outright addiction. A 2015 study led by Deborah Hasin, a professor of psychology and epidemiology at Columbia University, found that nearly 30% of marijuana users “experienced a marijuana use disorder of abuse or dependence.” The finding is based on the DSM-5 definitions, “which are somewhat more inclusive than the way people ordinarily think of ‘addiction,’” Hasin says. A person suffering from addiction, regardless of the substance, uses the substance compulsively, to the point that it takes over their lives, at least in part. They have “distorted thinking, behavior and body functions,” according to the American Psychiatric Association. “Changes in the brain’s wiring are what cause people to have intense cravings for the drug and make it hard to stop using the drug.” Over time, a person builds tolerance and needs more. Marijuana is the most commonly used illicit drug in the United States, yet as with alcohol, not everyone who tries pot will develop a lifelong, destructive habit. Men are more likely than women to get hooked, as are people who smoke tobacco. Other factors that make a person more prone to cannabis addiction, according to several experts: And as with alcohol, moderate marijuana consumption by most people 25 and older is seen by many experts as, well, no big deal. “If you, as an adult, smoke a joint with relatively low potency during the weekends… you’ll probably be okay, unless you suffer from a mental illness or another environmental risk factor,” says Baler, the NIDA scientist. “Your life is not going to be upended by that infrequent use. If you smoke every day… the risk of it impacting your life shoots up.” Getting heavy marijuana users to recognize they have a problem can be difficult. “People who are addicted are characteristically slow to recognize their own addiction, regardless of the substance that’s the issue, because of denial, because of impaired cognitive functioning, or whatever other factors are causing this,” Hasin says. “However, recognizing a cannabis use disorder or cannabis ‘addiction’ is even more problematic than other substances, because the zeitgeist right now is that cannabis is harmless.” A classic sign of addiction is withdrawals, and marijuana withdrawal syndrome is included in DSM-5. Hasin and colleagues reviewed data from a nationwide series of in-home surveys from 2012–13 that included 1,527 frequent cannabis users 18 and older. Among them, 12% said they experienced cannabis withdrawal syndrome. Here were the most commonly reported symptoms, which Hasin says are also common to depressive disorders: Common physical symptoms included headaches, shakiness or tremors and sweating, the researchers reported in the journal Drug and Alcohol Dependence. “Cannabis withdrawal has been well-characterized in laboratory, clinical and epidemiologic studies, so there is solid evidence about this,” Hasin says. Upon stopping, heavy users may not realize their symptoms are due to withdrawal, so they use more, feel better, “and then think the cannabis is helping them.” Cannabis withdrawal syndrome is “absolutely real,” says Edwin Salsitz, an associate clinical professor of psychiatry and a specialist in addiction medicine at Mount Sinai Icahn School of Medicine. He says the cycle of addiction is compounded by the fact that today’s cannabis is not your grandfather’s weed. “A lot of Baby Boomers are remembering what it was like to smoke marijuana in the ’60s, when the THC level was significantly lower,” Salsitz explains. What’s more, “Mostly young adults were smoking marijuana in the ’60s and ’70s, not young kids. And now, unfortunately, young kids are smoking as well. It might not have been as addictive to a 25-year-old hippie, but it is more addictive to a teenager.” While cannabis has more than 500 different compounds, including more than 100 cannabinoids whose possible effects aren’t well studied, potency is generally measured by the concentration of THC. The potency of cannabis seized on its way to illegal sales in the United States rose consistently from 4% in 1995 to about 12% in 2014, according to a study in the journal Biological Psychiatry. The reason is simple: The rise in sensimilla marijuana. Marijuana comes in two basic varieties: regular, and sensimilla, which is derived from an unfertilized female marijuana plant unable to produce seeds. Instead, it puts all its energy into creating new buds with higher concentrations of THC, making sensimilla more potent. The number of seized regular marijuana samples declined from nearly 100% in 1995 to about 20% in 2014, while sensimilla rose from near zero to around 80%. Meanwhile, in England and Wales, cannabis use had been declining through 2015, but the demand for cannabis addiction treatment was on the rise, according to Tom Freeman at University College London. He and a colleague looked into why, finding a “huge variation” in cannabis potency in the illicit and legal markets. And among young marijuana users, they found that 43% of those who preferred high-potency varieties were dependent on cannabis compared to 22% of those who went for the milder stuff. “The illicit cannabis market is dominated by high-potency cannabis containing high THC,” Freeman says. “Our findings suggest that people who prefer this type of cannabis are around twice as likely to show problematic use.” The results were published in the journal Psychological Medicine. THC concentrations can skyrocket in solutions that can be added to drinks, or in dabbing. In dabbing, people inhale vapors from a cannabis concentrate, with names like hash oil and waxy budder, by bong or vaping. Dabs can be four times as concentrated as the cannabis in a typical high-grade joint, according to the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration. Higher doses have a greater effect on a neuron when THC binds to its cannabinoid receptor, as well as “what happens to the user’s feelings, perceptions, emotions, desire to repeat the experience,” Baler says. However, while cannabis use among U.S. adults has risen over the past two decades, the percentage of users who have marijuana use disorder has not changed, at least according to Hasin’s 2015 study. Yet with teen use of vape products soaring in recent years, it remains to be seen what effects the higher potency cannabis might have. Marijuana use among teens peaked in the late 1990s, declined through the mid-2000s, and has since leveled off. Still, it is used daily by nearly 5.8% of high-school seniors in the United States and 3.4% of 10th graders, according to the National Institute on Drug Abuse. Nearly a quarter of seniors say they’ve tried it in the past month, and 44% during their lives. Nearly 14% of eighth graders have tried pot. Use by teens and young adults worries health experts, because THC is much more damaging to developing brains, and its addictive power is far greater. Think of the brain as the most complex computer known, and the endocannabinoid system as head of programming. The brain’s hardware and software aren’t fully built and written until around age 25. Until then, every experience — from food and exercise to love and abuse — creates lasting connections between neurons, along with thick bundles of fiber connecting different brain regions. The mind’s memory cards and processor chips are soldered onto the motherboard, an operating system is designed, and apps are created for everything from decision-making to impulse control. A study published last year in the American Journal of Psychiatry involving 3,826 Canadian adolescents across four years linked marijuana use to poorer memory, reasoning skills and ability to control inhibitions, especially when the kids started at younger ages. “Of particular concern was the finding that cannabis use was associated with lasting effects on a measure of inhibitory control, which is a risk factor for other addictive behaviors, and might explain why early-onset cannabis use is a risk factor for other addictions,” says study team member Patricia Conrod at the University of Montreal. “It’s a vulnerable period,” Baler says. “You’re writing the programs for the rest of your life. If you interfere with programming, you run the risk of incorporating errors into the program.” THC doesn’t just hack the brain by inserting a feel-good script, it puts youth “exponentially higher” risk for addiction, he says. It’s important to note, however, that the number of children using marijuana in the United States remained flat from 2008 through 2018, according to NIDA. Even in Colorado, where cannabis is widely available, use among youth has not risen since legalization, according to the state’s Department of Public Health and the Environment. Whether the rate of addiction among young users has changed remains an open question. The National Organization for the Reform of Marijuana Laws (NORML), a group that advocates for legalization, acknowledges the dependency potential of marijuana and the additional risks for youth, though it emphasizes the lower “dependence liability” compared to either alcohol or tobacco, says Paul Armentano, the organization’s deputy director."

Medium.com,Life,THC Overdose: What’s Going On In Louisiana?,Cannabis,https://medium.com/the-no-bs-guide-to-medical-cannabis/the-strange-case-of-thc-overdose-in-louisiana-48eebe667de8?source=topic_page---------101------------------1," In early June, a Louisiana coroner made headlines when he proclaimed the death of a 39 year old woman was due to THC overdose. In an interview with the New Orleans Advocate, Dr. Christy Montegut explained his findings. From the report: “It looked like it was all THC because her autopsy showed no physical disease or afflictions that were the cause of death. There was nothing else identified in the toxicology — no other drugs, no alcohol,” Montegut said. “There was nothing else.” Even after experts weighed in to express their skepticism, Montegut defended his claim: “I definitely did some research before I came to the conclusion that this was the cause of death.” Before we simply write him off, let’s examine what is known about the lethality of THC and the potential of a THC overdose. First things first: it is possible to poison yourself with anything if you have enough of it. Hell, even water is toxic if you drink enough. So yes, technically, you can die of a THC overdose. How much is lethal? We actually don’t have a great handle on this, in part because we don’t have any human data on the subject. No one has yet (verifiably) died from a THC overdose, so we have to rely on experiments in animals to get an idea. One report from 1974 found that, for rats inhaling simulated marijuana smoke, a dose of 42 mg/kg was lethal. Other reports put that figure much higher, on the order of several hundred mg/kg. That’s a lot. Like, A LOT a lot. In order to get to 42mg/kg, you’d have to smoke ~221 joints* more or less instantaneously (math below). You would need an IV drip to get that much THC in your bloodstream (I don’t need to tell you not to do this, do I? DO NOT DO THIS!). The toxicology report from Dr. Montegut’s purported overdosee detected 8.4ng/mL in her blood, which is perfectly in line with her taking several hits from a vape pen. While I’d wager she was feeling the effects (~5ng/mL is enough to be considered “significantly impaired”, depending on your tolerance), that’s a far cry from the amount needed for a lethal dose. There are other ways in which marijuana can contribute to death that we should keep in mind, such as exacerbating an underlying condition, for example. THC exposure is known to cause a rapid increase in heart rate; therefore, smoking marijuana might be a bad idea for those with certain heart conditions. It’s unclear if the woman in question had such a heart condition, but three weeks prior to her death she had been taken to the hospital for a chest infection. If the infection weakened her heart, it’s plausible that the THC set off a heart attack, though you’d think Dr. Montegut would have found evidence to that effect. Keep in mind, though, that I’m not a medical doctor, and had no involvement in this case, so my speculation is merely that of an outside observer. Still, it’s unwise to think that THC overdose is the only metric we need to consider in cases like this. What is clear is that this woman did not simply smoke too much and die from THC overdose. Keith Humphreys, a former senior policy adviser at the White House Office of National Drug Control Policy, gave this quote to the New Orleans Advocate: “We know from really good survey data that Americans use cannabis products billions of times a year, collectively. Not millions of times, but billions of times a year,” said Humphreys. “So, that means that if the risk of death was one in a million, we would have a couple thousand cannabis overdose deaths a year.” He’s spot on with this analysis. Even if it were a one-in-a-billion chance, we’d see several deaths of this kind in a year. THC may have contributed to this young woman’s untimely death, but Dr. Montegut’s claim of THC overdose seems grossly exaggerated and very unlikely."
Medium.com,Life,Marijuana and Opioid Deaths: Is There A Connection?,Cannabis,https://medium.com/the-no-bs-guide-to-medical-cannabis/cannabis-use-and-opioid-deaths-is-there-a-connection-2cee12d5943f?source=topic_page---------102------------------1," It’s no secret that the United States is having some serious issues with narcotic abuse, with a 12.9-fold increase in opioid overdose deaths between 2007–2017. Most of these deaths are attributable to non-prescription narcotics, but it’s widely believed that an increase in opioid prescriptions has led to increased rates of illicit use. As states scramble to find a solution and stem the tide of overdose deaths, many point to what they see as a potential alternative — medical marijuana. If marijuana were a legal alternative for pain relief, proponents argue, we would see reduced rates of opioid use and fewer overdose deaths. This argument isn’t completely without merit. Fewer opioid prescriptions are written in states where marijuana is legal for either medical or recreational use. Several studies have shown that it is useful as a pain reliever. And while marijuana is addictive, addicts don’t form a physical dependency on the drug, and it’s certainly not as addictive as opioids. Finally, no one has ever died from a marijuana overdose, so on that front it is considerably safer. That said, these arguments all come with caveats. This is a quote from the article linking marijuana legalization with prescription rates: “[…]as with any observational study, we cannot definitively establish causality between marijuana liberalization and opioid prescribing.” In other words, one might have nothing to do with the other. As far as pain relief goes, there is far from a scientific consensus on the subject. Pain is impossible to measure objectively and is highly susceptible to the placebo effect. While a placebo is better than nothing, analgesics like NSAIDS (aspirin and ibuprofen) and opiates work whether you believe in them or not, and are generally stronger in their effect. Medical marijuana’s proponents were vindicated in 2014 by a paper published in JAMA Internal Medicine, an academic journal affiliated with the American Medical Association. In this paper, the authors found that states with medical marijuana had 24.8% fewer opioid-related deaths than states that didn’t. The article made a big splash in both the scientific and popular press. It’s been cited nearly four-hundred times in the scientific literature, discussed in national and international news outlets, and has spurred new research into the use of marijuana to treat both chronic pain and opioid addiction. Clearly, this was a big win for medical marijuana. However, new research shows that marijuana may not be the key to solving our opioid epidemic after all. A new article published in Procedings of the National Academy of Sciences re-examined the conclusions of that 2014 paper, replicating the original work and also including data for a longer period of time. Using the new data, they found that states with medical marijuana laws actually had 22.7% higher rates of opioid-related overdose deaths compared to those without. How can we explain these differing results? It’s tempting to say that one group simply screwed up somewhere, especially if the results of one paper or the other bolsters your pre-existing views. However, this is very unlikely. Both groups were using the same data, which was collected by a third party, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The second group also used the same statistical methods since one of their primary goals was to replicate the first group’s findings. In fact, when they considered opioid overdose deaths for the years between 1999–2010, as the first group did, they got approximately the same result. Therefore, it’s not an issue of the input or the methodology. The difference comes from the amount of data each group had to draw on. In the first paper, the authors noticed that opioid deaths kept going down each year after the passage of medical marijuana laws. The second group found the same thing… but here’s the kicker: if you keep going, the effect levels off, and then reverses in 2013. In effect, both groups interpreted their results correctly, it’s just that the first group didn’t have enough data to see the fluctuating trends. What, if anything, does this tell us about marijuana legalization and the fight against opioid addiction? If there is a connection between the two, it is most likely indirect, and the effect is quite small. These papers did consider a handful of other possible explanations for the observed effect, such as unemployment rates and state laws regarding patient monitoring for opioid abuse, but there are many others that were not included. Further, only ~2.5% of the general population smokes marijuana regularly. Therefore, it’s unlikely that such a small population would account for such a massive swing in the number of opioid deaths. The simplest explanation is that one does not affect the other. Remember, these studies detect correlations, not causes. Unfortunately, it’s very easy to confuse the two, as often happens when the popular press gets hold of scientific work, and especially on topics as divisive as this one. No doubt we’ll see marijuana’s detractors pointing to this second study as further proof that marijuana is a “gateway drug” that is worsening the opioid crisis. This is an example of why we can’t make policy or personal decisions based on single studies, tempting though it may be. The only way forward is more research and careful journalism."
Medium.com,Life,"This Week in CBD: July 5, 2019",Cannabis,https://medium.com/cbd-hacker/this-week-in-cbd-july-5-2019-ce6e171c504d?source=topic_page---------103------------------1," A new hemp law is having an unexpected impact on marijuana prosecutions in Texas. That’s because the law, which went into effect on June 10, legalized hemp that contains less than 0.3 percent THC. In the past, law enforcement only had to prove that THC was present in a sample in order to pursue a possession charge. Under the new law, more precise testing is necessary to prove that the substance in question falls under the state’s definition of “marijuana.” But most labs aren’t equipped to determine the exact amount of THC in a sample, and third-party testing is costly. So, without a lab test to prove that the substance in question in above the 0.3 percent threshold for THC, the state has a backlog of possession cases that it can’t prosecute. In one county, the district attorney’s office will dismiss around 200 misdemeanor cases instead of paying to retest the samples for THC percentage."
Medium.com,Life,Cannabis and Driving,Cannabis,https://medium.com/quality-cbd/cannabis-and-driving-e8e2ced4648b?source=topic_page---------104------------------1," We have all heard about how dangerous it can be to drive while intoxicated. And when most of us think of intoxication, we think of alcohol. However, there are many other things that can intoxicate us and impair our driving including pills, medications and cannabis. Cannabis is becoming more popular for the medical benefits. Because it is more commonly accepted, the law is cracking down making sure there are no cannabis impaired motorists on the streets. But how bad is driving while intoxicated on cannabis? Read on to find out. Let’s start by considering how THC works in the body. People who use marijuana have differences in the area of the brain called the corticostriatal networks, compared to those who don’t. These are connected to motor learning and control and can affect reaction time, memory and the ability to switch between tasks. However, results on how THC actually affected motor skills were inconsistent. One study showed that frequent THC users had poorer memory then non-users and reduced activity in the cerebellum, an area of the brain linked to motor skills. Another study prompted frequent users and non-users to push a button in response to select stimuli. In this study, both groups made the same amount of mistakes but the non-users were more aware of their mistakes than the frequent users were. Further research has been done with wildly varying results. Some evidence shows those who use marijuana sporadically will experience more impairment of motor skills while intoxicated while those who use regularly will experience less impairment. This is likely due to a tolerance that builds up in frequent users. Basically, the research that has been gathered shows wide gaps in finding any conclusive evidence on how marijuana affects motor coordination. This may be due to the fact that there were many variables in the studies that were not accounted for. These include: So, although it’s likely that THC affects motor skills, there seems to be no conclusive evidence on how substantial these effects are. So what does this mean when considering driving and THC use? Before continuing, let’s consider that there are different types of cannabis. THC is well known for its mind-altering abilities and therefore has the most potential be dangerous when used before or while driving a vehicle. 70% of people polled who drive on marijuana say they don’t feel the intoxication caused by cannabis is much of an issue, while the other 29% think it is a serious problem. This is in contrast to 79% of Americans who think drinking while impaired by alcohol is a very serious problem. Alcohol causes a third of all fatal accidents, so let’s take a look at how much of a risk it is to drive while high on marijuana. Studies show that, although it does impair driving abilities, there is no proof that marijuana can increase chances of accidents. In fact, it may actually reduce chances of them occurring. This may be due to the fact that those intoxicated by marijuana are more aware that they are impaired and compensate effectively by driving more slowly, passing less and leaving more space for cars in front of them. This is in comparison to those intoxicated by alcohol who may not be as aware of their impairments and may follow cars more closely, speed and perform other actions that make accidents more likely. However, even though these statistics exist, there is no doubt that marijuana impairs driving abilities. It impairs motor coordination, visual function and divided attention. Drivers intoxicated by THC are also more likely to weave within their own lane than sober people, but they did not weave out of their lane or speed, as a person intoxicated by alcohol would. Another interesting thing to consider is that after medical marijuana laws passed, there was actually a reduction of traffic fatalities with the sharpest reductions being evening and drunk driving and alcohol related accidents. Experts feel this may be due to the fact that individuals are now choosing to take THC as an alternative to drinking alcohol although more research would be needed to this. Despite the fact that marijuana is not likely to increase the risk of accidents, backing this up with statistics is a bit trickier. Statistics show that 11% of drivers killed in accidents had taken at least one drug, but whether this drug was marijuana was unclear. The lack of clarity owes to the fact that there is no way to measure marijuana with a breathalyzer. While blood tests can be used, this can also be deceiving since concentrations of the drug tend to stay high in the blood of chronic users. It is also difficult for officers to determine if drivers are intoxicated by doing roadside tests like ‘touch your nose’ or ‘walk in a straight line’ as marijuana does not always affect motor skills in this way. These tests are somewhat effective but only catch about 30% of high drivers. Novice pot smokers tend to do worse on them while chronic smokers can ace these tests. Other points make it even more difficult to determine what constitutes as intoxicated driving. Especially when considering THC use and whether or not THC is to blame for the accident occurring. These include the fact that drivers are not always tested for drug use, especially if they have an illegal blood alcohol concentration level because that is enough evidence to constitute driving while impaired. Furthermore, when tested for substance use following a car crash, drivers may have THC, alcohol and other drugs in their system making it difficult to determine what was responsible for the crash. This creates a dilemma. There is a law in place prohibiting driving while on THC, but how effectively can we enforce these laws? Despite the fact that determining a point of intoxication is difficult, there are legal limits that apply to THC consumption while driving. In the Drug and Alcohol Dependence study, lane weaving began when a person’s blood levels reach 13 micrograms per each liter of blood. Interestingly enough, this compares with a .08% alcohol content which is the legal limit for alcohol in most states. However, the legal limit for THC can vary from state to state. Washington and Colorado, for instance, call it at 5 micrograms per liter. Rhode Island, Pennsylvania and Indiana do not permit driving with any amount of THC in the bloodstream. In traffic fatality studies, any amount of THC in the blood, no matter how tiny, will count as a positive drug test. For reference, one joint can raise THC levels to about 20 micrograms per liter. Aside from THC, there are other constituents found in cannabis that can also provide health benefits. One that is rising in popularity is CBD. CBD is known for improving wellness without providing mind-altering effects. However, it can impact mood and alertness due to the alterations it causes in brain chemistry. So does this mean it’s safe to use while driving? CBD affects serotonin receptors when taken in high doses. It also works as a reuptake inhibitor raising and maintaining levels of anandamide, an endocannabinoid similar to THC. It inhibits the reuptake of adenosine, increasing levels of the molecule in the brain. This is how it works to reduce anxiety. CBD may also work as an allosteric modulator of the GABA A receptor meaning it can enhance or inhibit receptor transmission. In doing so, the receptor binds more easily with the neurotransmitter GABA. GABA has an inhibitory effect on the nervous system inducing activity so that it produces states of calm and relaxation. For the most part, CBD will not affect driving. However, there are side effects that some users may experience as a result of the calming effects of CBD. These can be potentially dangerous; They include low blood pressure, light-headedness and drowsiness. These can be especially prevalent in those that take higher doses of the compound. To make sure you are safe while driving, start out with lower doses and find out how CBD will affect you before attempting to take the wheel. Although there seems to be a lot of back and forth on how THC can affect driving, the bottom line is, it’s illegal and best to be avoided. If you are thinking of using THC consider the length of time your high will last. (High length can vary according to the form of THC you are taking and the amount you are consuming.) Once you have done that, plan your day so that driving will not be necessary during that time. THC can be a very beneficial compound, but if you are going to be driving a vehicle, it’s just not worth the risk."

In La Plaza de Armas, the center of the city, men and women dressed in cultural garb will approach tourists and try to sell the same bags of green candy. This candy is made of coca leaves, which are considered an herbal remedy for what locals call “sorroche,” or altitude sickness. Coca leaves are the raw material for cocaine and when unrefined and unprocessed, provide vitamins and minerals that boost metabolism and help “gringos,” or foreigners, adjust to the altitude of Cusco. While many chew the leaves, coca is often more palatable as a tea or candy. Hotels and restaurants will often offer coca tea, or “mate de coca,” and vendors will sell the small bags of coca candy. At first, I was very surprised by how popular coca products were in Cusco. In the US, we don’t see racks of a single type of candy or cough drop and our hotels mostly just offer coffee or water. Herbal remedies especially, can often only be found in specialty stores or online. Or at least, that’s what I thought. Before coming to Peru, I spent a few days with a friend by the Jersey Shore. In one of the boardwalk stores, there was a rack filled with small bottles and packets of one type of herbal remedy: CBD. Apparently I missed the memo because CBD products, or cannabidiol products, have been gracing stores in the US for almost a year. Often sold as a powder or oil, CBD is an active ingredient in marijuana and is thought to improve symptoms of childhood epilepsy, chronic pain, insomnia, anxiety, etc. Both coca and CBD are one of hundreds of ingredients of cocaine and marijuana respectively, but they themselves don’t cause anything remotely similar to a high. While coca has been valued as a medicine for almost 8,000 years by South American civilizations, CBD has recently been introduced as a mainstream herbal supplement. CBD, which can be found in bath bombs and ice cream, is also much more commercialized in the US compared to coca in South America, which comes as no surprise considering our commodity-obsessed corner of the world. The popularity of both of these herbal products come from the fact that they address niche medical issues that are specific to a particular region. Coca addresses the symptoms of altitude sickness in a city that is 4,000 meters above sea level. CBD addresses anxiety in a region plagued by the rat race and all of its symptoms: imposter syndrome, FOMO, and stress. The regulation of coca in Peru, however, is unique compared to the regulation of CBD in the United States. Possession of more than a certain amount of cocaine is punishable by law in Peru, and police officers often treat all who possess processed cocaine as possible traffickers. Unrefined coca, however, is legal and openly sold in the market. Cocaine is also illegal in the US, but so are coca leaves and all coca products. In the US, the federal government considers marijuana as a Class 1 controlled substance: illegal. Despite that, almost half of the states in the US have approved using marijuana for medical purposes, as it can reduce symptoms associated with Parkinson’s, anxiety, cancer, and multiple sclerosis. Other Class 1 drugs include heroin and LSD, while Class 2 drugs are highly addictive but have medicinal purpose (think morphine). According to a study published by the Shafer Commission during the Nixon era, marijuana should be a Class 2 drug because of its medicinal value. Being in Class 1, medical marijuana can’t be formally prescribed by physicians, even in states where it’s considered legal. It also can’t be held by doctors, who can really only suggest that patients seek it out on their own. Needless to say, that comes with its own risks. Doctors in Peru, however, can provide patients coca leaves and coca tea. Of course, coca is a lot farther from cocaine than medical marijuana is from marijuana: cocaine is refined coca but medical marijuana is just marijuana dispensed from a MMTC (medical marijuana treatment center) and used for medical purposes. But weren’t we talking about CBD? According to the federal government, CBD products, with the exception of a seizure medication called Epidiolex, are also considered Class 1 drugs: illegal. The fact that the FDA approved Epidiolex makes the situation even more complicated: the drug exclusion rule states that you can’t add any active ingredient in a pharmaceutical to a food. Yes, that includes CBD muffins and lollipops. Frankly, the law has a point. In Cusco, the uses of coca are well-known and trusted by the general public. I mean, it makes sense because people have been using it for thousands of years with no long term damage. CBD products, on the other hand, are far from trustworthy. While there are some accredited studies to support some of its uses, there isn’t enough science to back up its safety. A number of institutions are doing more research on CBD, but until then, the FDA is turning a blind eye on stores and companies that sell CBD products. Because no one’s really paying attention to the products on store shelves, CBD is being advertised as a panacea for almost anything and it’s getting harder and harder to determine fact from fiction. It’s also hitting the market in an era of social media that perpetuates misinformation and, well, hype. If it’s uses, as seen by the general public, aren’t scientifically backed, it’s hard to see the supplement as anything but snake oil. The danger of this is that potentially useful CBD products and medicines, like Epidiolex, could disappear under a cloud of misunderstanding and high expectations that CBD can’t live up to. CBD is quickly becoming the American version of Peru’s coca, but it’s all happening a little too fast. In order for CBD’s medical potential to be realized, the media and market have to take it seriously: it could be much more than an opportunity to capitalize on millennials, vegans, and creatives who seem to be the target demographic for CBD products. With less noise, science can make a valid case for the use of CBD products. Then, maybe we’ll have laws that actually make sense.

Medium.com,Life,Is CBG the New CBD?,Cannabis,https://elemental.medium.com/is-cbg-the-new-cbd-6de59e568008?source=topic_page---------107------------------1," hen Shango Los, founder of the cannabis education organization VIMEA and host of the Shaping Fire podcast, first met Judy* (name changed), she was struggling with overwhelming anxiety that had started to get in the way of her everyday life. She was exhausted, even if she only went out to buy groceries. Getting her work done felt like a daily struggle and she says her prescribed SSRIs offered more negative side effects than help. Judy initially approached Los because she knew he had been teaching people in her local community about cannabis as an alternative treatment. Los first recommended that Judy use cannabidiol, or CBD, to treat her anxiety. She took a dose of a ratio of 2-to-1 CBD to THC every day, and found that her anxiety started to ebb a bit. Then, Los introduced her to CBG, a new-to-the-market cannabinoid, which she swallowed in a capsule filled with extracted cannabis oil from a rare marijuana plant that was high in CBG. Judy was stunned: Her anxiety decreased immediately. Now, she is less exhausted and says she can spend time with her friends in the evening. She has the energy to cook for herself and her family, and her life has improved overall. For all of this, Judy credits CBG, which she now takes almost daily (alternating with a few other cannabis tinctures) as part of her therapeutic regime. Chemically, CBG is the big brother of CBD and THC. If Judy and Los are right, CBG might be the next big thing. The lesser-known cannabinoid, touted by cannabis advocates to be even more effective than CBD for anxiety and chronic pain, could even follow in CBD’s market-disrupting footsteps. But because CBG research is at a very early stage and mostly based on animal models, scientists are skeptical. A good way to understand CBG is to step back and take a look at the cannabis plant as a whole. The plant produces a number of cannabinoids, which are molecules in marijuana or hemp plants that act on the cannabinoid receptors — part of the endocannabinoid system — in the brain. You’ve probably heard of the two most common cannabinoids: THC and CBD. Chemically, CBG is the big brother of CBD and THC. “Cannabis plants make CBG, but usually the plant doesn’t stop there. CBG is just a brief way station on the way to the production of other cannabinoids, like THC and CBD,” explains Dr. Ethan Russo, Director of Research and Development at the International Cannabis and Cannabinoids Institute. This is fine for growers who want to make products that appeal to people looking to get high on THC or those who want to jump on the CBD wellness hype. But some cannabis advocates, like Heylo Cannabis’ founder and lead chemist Lo Friesen, have started to wonder if you could stop the cannabis plant’s development early in order to preserve a high percentage of CBG. Friesen and her Seattle-based team make cannabis extracts, and she believes chasing CBG could be a smart business move. In order to grasp the potentials and limitations of CBG, it makes sense to take a closer look at its little brother, CBD. CBD has become extremely popular over the past few years. In fact, the industry is predicted to be worth nearly $1.8 billion by 2022, according to Statista. People swear by CBD because it’s a non-psychotropic cannabis byproduct, which means it doesn’t make you feel high. CBD is mostly derived from hemp and some research suggests that it provides relief for a number of conditions like epilepsy, anxiety, insomnia, and chronic pain. CBD research is still at a very early stage and mainly focused on laboratory tests and animal models, which means experts don’t fully know if CBD really works for treating medical conditions in humans. CBD’s popularity also hinges on its low-risk nature. According to the World Health Organization, “CBD exhibits no effects indicative of any abuse or dependence potential… To date, there is no evidence of public health-related problems associated with the use of pure CBD.” (WHO has not yet released any statements about CBG, likely because it’s not yet popular enough to merit a mention.) That said, CBD research is still at a very early stage and mainly focused on laboratory tests and animal models, which means experts don’t fully know if CBD really works for treating medical conditions in humans or if its effects are predominantly tied to the placebo effect. “There is so much potential, which we are just beginning to realize, from the use of CBD and other cannabinoids, both in terms of medical use and for other, lifestyle-related issues,” says Dr. Peter Grinspoon, a primary care physician at Massachusetts General Hospital and an instructor at Harvard Medical School. “We need to be careful as it is easy for the expectations, enthusiasm, and marketing claims to far outpace the actual scientific evidence, as we are seeing with CBD.” The other big issue is that CBD products can vary widely in quality because they’re not regulated. CBD is incredibly accessible, particularly online. All 50 states have laws legalizing CBD in varying degrees of restriction, and despite CBD being a cannabis product, the federal government’s punishment policy for use of CBD remains a gray area. CBG is in the same boat as CBD, but with even less research out on its efficacy and less availability. Still, advocates believe the substance could become a viable alternative treatment option for people with anxiety and chronic pain — perhaps even more so than THC and CBD. “THC can draw you inward, and it can make anxiety worse. But CBG seems to mitigate that effect,” says Daniel Luebke, the Head of Marketing and Brand at Heylo Cannabis. Russo explains that early studies have highlighted CBG’s strong anti-anxiety effects, without being sedative and without the potential for addiction. The final bonus is that CBG appears to have very few negative side effects, except increasing appetite. “CBG binds to the cannabinoid receptors but with an affinity that is way lower than THC, so a person can take a large amount of it and not be intoxicated,” Russo says of early research on the topic. “But it displays a very strong anti-anxiety effect and it also has muscle relaxing effects, maybe even more than THC. Scientists believe that CBG binds to certain endocannabinoid receptors in the brain that mitigate anxiety and pain. The final bonus is that CBG appears to have very few negative side effects, except increasing appetite. Los cites several anecdotal stories of people who have used CBG to treat chronic pain issues, often rotating CBG with CBD and THC to make sure they don’t gain too much tolerance to any of the cannabinoids. He says these people have experienced ease in muscle tension and cramping, but without a high. For them, it’s been a total win-win. Unfortunately, there aren’t yet solid scientific studies to back up these anecdotal wins — and it may be awhile before there’s any kind of evidence of CBG’s effects on humans. Some early animal research has shown that CBG can indeed be used to effectively manage pain. In one study, researchers found that CBG greatly benefitted cats with glaucoma by reducing eye pressure. In another study, CBG use alleviated neuroinflammation in mice. A 2013 study also found that CBG was effective for treating inflammatory bowel disease, and scientists are even looking at the substance’s ability to help manage neurodegeneration. Other animal studies back Judy’s experience of using CBG to regulate anxiety, although they’re still not conducted in humans because of current bans on cannabis research. One 2006 study showed that the herb had antidepressant effects in mice, while another found that CBG had an analgesic effect on certain receptors, leading to anxiety reduction. There are still many barriers when it comes to bringing CBG to the masses. First, there’s the issue of regulation and research. Grinspoon says the only way to move the industry forward is by taking cannabis substances like CBD and CBG out of the DEA’s “Schedule 1” category, which prevents research. As of now, the FDA has only approved one CBD-based medication called Epidiolex, for children with epilepsy. In order to know if CBD and CBG work for the treatment of other conditions, there needs to be human studies. Russo notes that any future CBG research in humans will likely be done outside of the United States. “To my knowledge, the National Institute on Drug Abuse, which does all of the cannabis research in the U.S., does not have any CBG in their arsenal right now,” he says. As has happened in the CBD world, this lack of research leaves patients to do their own trials regarding dosage and delivery method, which they then report to organizations like Los’ VIMEA.“Desperate patients, and those who care for them, are trading information online and moving the science ahead,” Los says. Second, there’s the problem of CBG quantity and quality. Most cannabis plants produce only small amounts of CBG, as they typically convert CBG into THC and CBD before they flower. This means there’s not a lot of CBG available for distribution. For consumers, CBG can be hard to find, even at dispensaries in states where the substance is legal. (In dispensaries, CBG is usually sold in products that combine THC or CBD with CBG.) Most patients struggle to find enough of the substance to dose themselves regularly. And even if you can find enough CBG, quality is still suspect. There are still many barriers when it comes to bringing CBG to the masses. First, there’s the issue of regulation and research. Second, there’s the problem of CBG quantity and quality. Friesen believes this will all change in the years to come. Some entrepreneurs, like David Heldreth, the Chief Science Officer of True Terpenes and CEO of Panacea Plant Sciences, are working to develop cannabis plants that will stop their development at CBG. If this process works, the plants could yield up to 100% of the secondary cannabinoid for interested chemists like Friesen. GW Pharmaceuticals also reportedly has a strain of plants that can produce pure CBG, which they are using to do research on the secondary cannabinoid. “For us, it’s quality in and quality out,” Friesen says of her desire to work with sustainable growers who can offer cannabis products that demonstrate unique chemical makeups. For Friesen, extending offerings like CBG to people who aren’t cannabis users is both a smart business decision and a great way to educate the public on the benefits of medical marijuana use. “Our goal is to offer a wide variety of diverse chemical profiles of cannabis products and to help spread research,” Friesen says. “I think the industry is shifting to treasure interesting genetics, and we’ll see heightened interest in products like CBG. The cannabis user is also evolving to focus on how this plant can help them get more out of their lives.”"

Medium.com,Life,Women and Weed: Why Marijuana Legalization is a Feminist Cause,Cannabis,https://medium.com/@emilyrosethorne6/women-and-weed-why-marijuana-legalization-is-a-feminist-cause-91e96e7aab5?source=topic_page---------109------------------1," Smoking weed to smash the patriarchy? Well, common-sense drug reform isn’t just about letting Bay Area stoners light up whenever they please. It’s rooted in undoing decades of social inequality that led to nationwide pot prohibition in the first place. Marijuana legalization typically finds support in women because its medicinal properties can treat conditions that disproportionately affect AFAB (assigned female at birth) people, but there are plenty of other reasons why legal pot is a feminist issue. Pot could bring in a projected $11 billion in 2019 alone, and women are at the forefront of the industry’s growth. They’re not just working in dispensaries, either, so forget the stereotypical hot budtender. More women hold executive positions in the marijuana sector than in most other industries. In general, less than a quarter of executives are women, but they fill between 27% and 36% of exec seats in the legal pot business. Female attorneys, doctors, nurses, chemists, chefs, investors, teachers, and other professionals have found a more welcoming space to practice in the world of weed. Cannabis science is taking off as a field of study, too, and most of its students are — you guessed it — women, especially Black women and femmes. Many already have advanced science degrees, and they’re learning to apply that knowledge to the marijuana industry. In fact, here’s a list of some of the most badass women and femmes in cannabusiness from The High Times. Most pro-legalization activists in Colorado and Washington State were women between the ages of 30 and 50, and we owe medical marijuana legislation to the LGBTQIA+ community. During the throes of the HIV/AIDS epidemic of the early 1990s, they advocated pot’s medical value. It helped alleviate some of the unpleasant symptoms of the disease, which still affects LGBTQIA+ folks more than any other population in the US. “The LGBTQ community out in California were the first main activists pushing for medicinal marijuana laws,” Khadijah Tribble, an HIV and cannabis activist who studied pot policy at the Harvard Kennedy School, told The Washington Blade. “When you have identities that have been systematically discriminated — your gender, your sexuality — you are primed to be more marginalized by marijuana laws. If you are a cisgender white male, you are the least likely to be stopped for marijuana. If you are a person of color who is trans, you are more likely to be stopped, more likely to do time, and the time will be longer.” These discrepancies persist today. LGBTQIA+ individuals may be more likely to use marijuana than heterosexual people. In turn, they are also more likely to suffer the consequences of pot prohibition; and conversely, to have promoted reform. “It’s still an LGBT issue because it’s still not accessible to everybody everywhere,” Paul Scott, president of the Los Angeles Black Gay Pride Association, said in an interview with The Washington Blade. “HIV/AIDS is still high in Black populations in the South, and they can’t get pot. They still have to break laws.” Weed wasn’t high on America’s watchlist until the turn of the twentieth century, when displaced and threatened populations from Mexico crossed into the US seeking refuge during the Mexican Revolution. They brought marijuana with them and used it for both medical and recreational purposes. Although some US plantations were actually required to grow hemp and Americans used medical cannabis frequently until this point, white Southerners hadn’t come around to its medical purposes and had little tolerance for the influx of immigrants into their communities (surprise!). Painting pot as a public menace was a convenient way for them to demonize the Mexican populations and perpetuate the stereotype of Hispanics as lazy. From there, journalists and anti-marijuana activists grabbed the attention of legislators and policymakers, who started putting restrictions in place in an effort to control “the Mexican menace” and incarcerate Brown folks who smoked it. The first marijuana ban in the county affected El Paso, Texas, in 1915, and officials quickly got to work rounding up Mexican immigrants and deporting them on drug charges. Once drug policy reform efforts ramped up in the 1980s and ’90s, it was women, Black and Hispanic Americans, and LGBTQIA+ folks leading the way — but not all of these marginalized groups were treated equally. The HIV/AIDS epidemic particularly shed light on the racism underlying this and other social justice spaces. “We had all these other diseases that marijuana helps for, but it wasn’t until the visual effect of young white men dying in the hospitals with AIDS that it shook the conscience of America and began to change the law,” Scott told The Washington Blade. “It wasn’t because of Black folks getting arrested. It wasn’t because it was the right thing to do. For the first time, this country saw young white men dying and sprung into action to do something.” More Black people receive marijuana charges than white people even today, although people are equally likely to smoke weed no matter their race, gender, economic class, or education level, despite media stereotypes. And when it comes to the marijuana industry, Black entrepreneurs still face discrimination when trying to access capital. Systemic racism within American capitalism can limit people of color from equally participating in the industry — especially multiply-marginalized individuals. It’s no coincidence that the part of the marijuana plant we smoke is the female part. Weed has been a part of feminist spirituality for as long as history has documented it. Think about it: plant medicine and herbal healing were long considered the tools of the witch, and political activism and female spirituality go hand-in-hand more often than not. According to Ellen Komp, the author of Tokin’ Women: A 4,000 Year Herstory and an activist as deputy director of the California chapter of the National Organization for the Reform of Marijuana Laws (NORML), the unity of weed and woman has been revered as divine since the 3rd millennium BC. “Back then, a predominant Sumerian goddess named Ishtar was associated with cannabis, and up until the Semitic invasion in 2600 BC, women practiced the healing arts without restriction,” Komp told VICE. “But by 1000 BC, women didn’t have that freedom to be healers anymore.” And with the stripping of their right to practice came the first “crackdown” on marijuana use — from its very beginning, an affront to women’s autonomy. Women still use weed in rituals and as a part of their spirituality. Just ask Gabriela Herstik, a practicing witch with Jewish and Latina roots who runs a monthly column in The High Times, The High Priestess. It’s all about using bud to supplement her craft, attune with deity, and get in touch with her sexuality. Marijuana legalization has been a feminist cause since the idea was introduced.

Medium.com,Life,The FDA Is About to Crack Down on Shady CBD Products,Cannabis,https://elemental.medium.com/the-fda-is-about-to-crack-down-on-shady-cbd-products-765b7f76a882?source=topic_page---------111------------------1," ederal officials are coming for America’s latest health trend. The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) is gearing up to tighten its oversight of cannabidiol, better known as CBD — the non-intoxicating chemical cousin of THC that is marketed as a natural remedy for a wide variety of ailments. Since late last year, products containing CBD — from pills, oils, and cosmetics to drinks, gummies, and even dog treats — have proliferated across the country. The boom is largely thanks to a change in federal law in December 2018 that legalized hemp, a low-THC variety of marijuana that had previously been categorized with pot and harder drugs like cocaine and heroin. That change opened the door for legal hemp-derived CBD and a market that could explode to $22 billion by 2022, according to the market research firm Brightfield Group. Now a broad cross section of medical researchers, policy analysts, marijuana industry insiders, and federal regulators are worried that door was opened a little too wide. On June 20, the House of Representatives approved an amendment to a package of upcoming spending bills that directs the FDA to come up with new regulations for CBD products. The agency was already on it: In May, it hosted an all-day hearing on CBD, where officials grilled dozens of experts about which — if any — of the multitude of claims made about CBD were actually backed by science, and how consumers can be sure about the quality of what they’re getting when they pay for a CBD product. The FDA also fired off a series of menacing letters to CBD-selling companies that the agency claims violated marketing laws. It’s accepting public comments on potential CBD regulation until July 16, and has already received more than 2,700 (many of which sing CBD’s praises). After that, new rules could follow quickly. “We must sort this out in service of public health,” Amy Abernethy, the FDA’s principal deputy commissioner, said on Twitter after the hearing. “We will work as quickly as possible to define a way forward.” So is it time to start stockpiling your favorite CBD products before they disappear? Here’s all you need to know about CBD and its future. This is a very tough question to answer, and can differ based on where you live. “It’s just crazy. It’s the Wild West,” says Daniele Piomelli, director of the University of California-Irvine’s Institute for the Study of Cannabis, describing the legal landscape for CBD. At the federal level, CBD is now legal to produce when it is derived from legally-grown hemp — not, of course, from marijuana, which remains a Schedule 1 narcotic (meaning the government believes it has a high potential for abuse). The sticking point is how you market it after that. The FDA has made clear that it is not legal to market CBD as a dietary supplement or as a food additive, and that only one CBD-containing product — Epidiolex, which can be used to treat certain rare forms of childhood epilepsy — has been approved as a prescription drug. “Lettuce is more regulated than CBD. Right now there’s no way to determine what’s good and what’s not.” But enforcement of those rules has been scarce. Instead, a grab bag of local laws have filled the gap: New York City, for example, is about to implement a ban on CBD in food and drinks. Oklahoma state health officials recently promised to start patrolling facilities that produce CBD. In April, Tampa Bay police arrested a great-grandmother in line at Disney World for carrying a bottle of CBD oil (the charges were later dropped). And at the Dallas-Fort Worth International Airport, confiscations of CBD products by security officers have “skyrocketed.” Meanwhile, without specific criteria from the FDA for how CBD can and can’t be used, consumers have no way to ensure whether a product they’re buying even contains CBD at all, says Rosemary Mazanet, chief scientific officer of the medical marijuana company Columbia Care. “Lettuce is more regulated than CBD,” she says. “Right now there’s no way to determine what’s good and what’s not.” Because it was federally illegal until recently, CBD has not been easily available to medical researchers, so its physiological effects are still not well understood. It appears to boost the neurotransmitter serotonin, a mood stabilizer, and may stimulate chemical receptors in the nervous system that produce a calming effect. The strongest evidence for CBD’s effectiveness is in treating certain forms of epilepsy. In a May 2018 study published in the peer-reviewed New England Journal of Medicine, people with epilepsy treated with CBD reported a 40% reduction in seizures, compared to 17% reported by those given a placebo. That study was funded by GW Pharmaceuticals, a British company with offices in California that produces Epidiolex. Steve Schultz, the company’s VP of investor relations, says several other trials have produced similar outcomes, which paved the way for the drug — which is swallowed as a liquid — to be approved by the FDA. Some other applications are also promising. A growing body of research has found evidence that CBD can be useful in mitigating anxiety and certain psychological disorders, including schizophrenia. Applied to the skin, it may be anti-inflammatory. “We’re talking about a drug that could really help in certain situations and should definitely be considered seriously,” Piomelli says. As for the panoply of more ambitious claims sometimes found in CBD marketing — that it can address Alzheimer’s and Parkinson’s, slow the growth of cancerous tumors, help kick addictions, and cure rheumatoid arthritis, among others — the jury is still out. “That’s not to say that CBD might not have some role in some of these conditions, but the evidence is just lacking at the moment,” says Igor Grant, director of the Center for Medicinal Cannabis Research at the University of California-San Diego. Grant says research is especially vague on what dosages and delivery mechanisms — pill, oil, etc. — are most effective, and what the potential side effects might be: Some studies have shown signs that high doses of CBD could affect liver function. Lyndsay Meyer, an FDA spokesperson, declined an interview request, citing the ongoing public comment period, but said in a statement that “the currently available data leave open crucial questions about whether these products are safe or effective. Our biggest concern is the marketing of products that put the health and safety of consumers at greatest risk, such as those claiming to prevent, diagnose, treat, or cure serious diseases, such as cancer.” The FDA gave a preview of its position in three warning letters it sent in March, two to CBD product manufacturers and one to a chain of New Jersey pain clinics. All three letters list extensive examples of medical benefit claims made on the companies’ websites and social media that “may not be substantiated by competent and reliable scientific evidence.” The letters also cite products that are marketed as drugs or dietary supplements without FDA approval and threaten that without changes, the FDA will seek a federal court injunction, and may also be able to compel the companies to reimburse customers. All three websites that received letters appear to have removed the dubious medical claims, although two of the three, Florida-based Diamond CBD and Washington-based CBD Pure, still offer CBD products that are labelled as dietary supplements (neither company responded to requests for comment). Semantics isn’t the FDA’s only concern. Recent studies have found that many CBD products on the market either misrepresent the concentration of CBD they actually contain — which could be none at all — or contain alarming additives, including synthetic cannabinoids and the cough syrup ingredient dextromethorphan. “We’re trying to do self-regulation, but without [federal] regulation what’s happening is that smaller shops can mislabel and put whatever they want in there,” says Justin Blehar, a managing partner of California-based CBD producer Genco Pura. A 2017 study in the journal JAMA sampled 84 CBD products and found that 42% contained more CBD than advertised and 26% contained less. The study also found that one-fifth of the samples contained THC, raising not only a legal problem but also the risk that users could get high unintentionally. “The name CBD can be used as a marketing ploy,” Daniele Piomelli says, adding that the concentrations of CBD in many commercially available products may be far below the levels that might produce a medical benefit. “The FDA should be much more aggressive.” “There’s no doubt that the FDA is going to be fairly strict in the way it regulates these products,” says John Hudak, who researches the cannabis industry at the nonpartisan Brookings Institution. That process will likely start with manufacturers of CBD products, including more scrutiny of where the CBD is coming from (remember, it’s still illegal to produce from marijuana) and setting an official standard for its purity. The FDA is also expected to introduce maximum concentrations, especially as a food additive. It may facilitate greater access to CBD for medical researchers, in the interest of answering some of the unresolved health questions. And it may choose to pursue more aggressive legal action against companies that step out of line. The effect of all this, Hudak says, will be to smooth the waters for up-and-coming hemp entrepreneurs who want to invest in high-quality CBD products. So some sketchier CBD products will soon disappear from shelves, he says, and hopefully, be replaced by better legal alternatives."

an CBD or Cannabidiol improve your mental health? What is CBD and why is it all the rage today? CBD or Cannabidiol is a non psycho-active compound extracted from cannabis and hemp plants. As a new mom and trauma survivor I’ve been curious about the benefits of CBD. I was craving a tool to aid me in moments when my anxiety is high or my PTSD symptoms have increased. However I didn’t want to feel “high”. Being a stay-at-home mom I want to be 100% present for my son so it was important to me to find a CBD that could relieve my symptoms without interrupting my ability to be present. Studies have shown CBD can not only improve mental health, relieve anxiety, insomnia, epilepsy and pain. Research has also shown that it may be a superbug infection fighter. My partner got me a bottle of 100% pure CBD oil (no THC) — THC is the part of the plant that can get you high. If you are a newbie like me, you want to find a CBD oil that is either 100% pure full-spectrum CBD or has a higher ratio of CBD to THC in it. The first time I used it was in oil-tincture form. Within 30 minutes of taking a full dropper I felt space from my anxiety-provoking thoughts. I felt some ease in my mind and honestly — it felt amazing. I didn’t feel high. For people with anxiety or PTSD we need something to help us get grounded in bodies and out of our heads. Very recently, I had an argument with my partner and felt triggered about it for days. I was harboring on a story in my head about our sex life and couldn’t get myself unhooked. It was a tangled web of bullshit honestly. I was so tired of feeling angry and confused so I took a few hits of a CBD joint. I realized some profound truths about my relationship to sex and how it has impacted my intimate relationships. If I am sexually rejected by a partner I take it personal rather than account for other factors i.e. parenthood, stress, libido. I feel a deep sense of relief and peace around this old belief of needing validation through sex. This is a huge breakthrough for me and all because of a few puffs from a CBD joint. I can get new information. I can feel at ease. I can be present and not live in the past or stay in my triggered story. It is helping me gain perspective, heal and become a better person. I can find peace and move forward."
Medium.com,Life,Marijuana Breeding Explained,Cannabis,https://medium.com/cannabis-education/marijuana-breeding-explained-59c6f8713f4?source=topic_page---------113------------------1," Learning about the different strains can be intimidating, because you could wonder what a cross of this and that strain is, and what a hybrid or a land race strain is, or what a predecessor strain is. All of those have to do with plant breeding — essentially, breeding a gentleman and female plant to combine or refine the DNA of two variations or strains. Breeding two different strains often results in a new strain, or hybrid. Weed breeders generally breed to purify and strengthen strains, combine strain traits, or enhance specific characteristics.
Marijuana breeders generally breed to purify and strengthen strains, combine strain traits, or enhance specific attributes like higher harvests, specific aromas, strength, and several other things. Once cultivating and breeding, it’s key to know where your seeds come from and what sort of DNA they have. If the seed breeder can’t give you an elaborate history of how a packet of seeds was bred or what they were crossed with, you never really know what you’re getting. Pot flowers can be either male or female. Pot users are generally mainly concerned with female ferns, because only ladies produce the sticky nuggets that we all know and love. Nevertheless male weed flowers tend to be key for the breeding process, as they usually are required to pollinate the bud-producing females. To do this, you require a gentleman of one strain to pollinate a lady of the other. Once pollinated, the female will then produce seeds that express the genes of both the male and female plant. Those seeds will be harvested and grown separately, and voilà: You have congregated a hybrid. So how do you think whether to pick a man or a lady of each strain that you’re crossing? “Often in pot, the traits of the female carry over to progeny (seeds) over the male. That mentioned, the traits of the male tend to be are usually obvious to the discerning grower so one should certainly pick a gentleman that will complement the traits of the female,” says Nat Pennington, founder and CEO of Humboldt Seed Organization who’s been breeding marijuana for 20 years. “So much is possible with truly intentional breeding strategies.”
Immediately after two predecessor strains are generally selected for breeding, a gentleman and a few ladies tend to be put into a breeding chamber to contain the pollen. A breeding chamber can be as simple as an enclosed environment with plastic sheeting on the sides, or a specially designed sterile environment for large-scale breeding. “A healthy male marijuana plant can pollinate up to 20 women plants, and by pollinate, I mean absolutely completely mask the plant with seeds.”
Nat Penningon, Humboldt Seed Company
a sole male plant can pollinate tens of women. “It’s routinely a perfect idea to have only one male, genetically speaking, per pollination effort,” says Pennington. “A healthy male can pollinate up to 20 women, and by pollinate, I mean absolutely completely mask the plant with seeds.” This is intentional breeding — any grower who’s accidentally grown a man and pollinated a crop will know that one male can easy pollinate hundreds of girls, filling your whole crop with seeds. The mature male will grow pollen sacs in the initial couple weeks of its flowering phase. Pollen will release from the sacs, move via air, and land on the female ferns, pollinating them. Having an enclosed breeding chamber is essential to contain the pollen along with to prevent outdoors pollen from getting in. you could also help along the pollination effort by shaking pollen from the male onto the ladies, or by collecting pollen from the male and directly applying it to the ladies. These female ferns will continue to grow and flower, throughout which they’ll grow seeds (as well as nuggets. These seeds will express the dna of both the male and female plant. These seeds — now a hybrid of the two predecessor strains — will be grown on their own, outdoor of the breeding environment. Although the process doesn’t end there. The hybrid strain that you purchase at the dispensary has likely gone through several rounds — or generations — of breeding to strengthen its genes and to make sure that its descendants are usually healthy and consistent. Homozygosity ensures that a plant will regularly produce the same seeds with the same genetic makeup over and over again.
A plant that produces a set of characteristics that have a lot of variety usually are mentioned to be heterozygous. With marijuana, you generally want seeds that are usually homozygous — ones that have the same set of genes. Homozygosity ensures that a plant will routinely produce the same seeds with the same genetic makeup over and over again, ensuring that buyers and patients will get the same plant or seed time and again. Right after a strain is crossed, a breeder will then have to select which phenotype of the new strain they like best. For large-scale growers, they desire to pick decide on the perfect phenotype for mass production. Back to the Super Lemon Haze example: this strain of marijuana takes a lot of its bud structure, trichome and resin production, and in general appearance from Super Silver Haze. Nevertheless it takes its flavors and aromas from Lemon Skunk. Many likely, there were early characteristics of Super Lemon Haze that grew tall and loose like Lemon Skunk, or tasted more like Super Silver Haze. Nevertheless the breeder discarded those characteristics and keep cultivating the ones that have the characteristics of what we right now know is Super Lemon Haze. High-quality breeding still doesn’t stop there. Whenever a breeder has crossed a strain and narrowed down a phenotype and finally has the one, they plan to will constantly backcross that strain to strengthen its genetics. Backcrossing is a practice where a breeder will cross-pollinate the new strain with itself or a parent — essentially, inbreeding the strain. This makes the strain more homozygous, and strengthens its dna and desirable attributes, along with ensures that those genes continue to pass down from generation to generation. Breeding is about time and patience. Says Pennington: “To be a breeder, you must be ready to accept the fact that you won’t have uniformity in the offspring, you can get many ugly ducklings in the hunt for your golden goose. To prepare seeds that will actually mirror the golden goose takes time, and yes it takes over just an one-off cross. Even soon after you noticed your golden goose, expect to have to do a whole variety of stabilizing backcrosses to reproduce your golden goose in seed form.” Weed propagation is a lengthy and complex process that can take years to understand and decades to master. Although, it doesn’t have to be, at least not for the residence grower looking to get into breeding on a tiny scale. For some, breeding can be as simple as fortifying a little seed stock for next year’s crop, or maybe taking your preference strain and keeping its pollen to cross with other desirable female genotypes or characteristics in the future. In this guide, we’ll review the basics of small-scale weed breeding methods and illustrate the advantages these methods may issue to those who desire to make their very own unique weed seeds and strains. On the other hand, those who desire to carry seed stock through to the next season will find breeding to be a sustainable option to keep those dna around. Not every grower can afford to go back to the nursery or seed business and buy new dna between every season. Soon considering that, in many states the cost of an individual clone can exceed $20, while a dozen weed seeds could with little effort cost $100 or more. For several micro-budget residence growers, breeding is the only way to keep dna around. For instance, a popular breeding practice demands propagating genotypes in large batches some days hundreds of ferns in number) to be able to see the widest margin of genetic variation possible. This permits growers to select only the many desirable characteristics to cultivate further. But, any time while you have a maximum household plant count of 12, this isn’t possible. Residence breeders must work around these issues if they want to both breed and propagate sinsemilla marijuana (without seed) as well. What You’ll Need: One mature male pot plant, between 2–3 weeks into bloom phase (or collected male pollen)
One mature female weed plant, between 2–3 weeks into bloom phase
Isolated propagation chamber (e.G. A sealed grow tent or equivalent)
Gloves
Small paint brush
Plastic baggies and ties Below are the steps to get started: First, you should work within a tidy and sanitized environment. Start by cleaning your isolation chamber in preparation of obtaining the female plant. A tidy space will both help to prevent cross-contamination and offer a safe and sanitary place for the plant to completely mature. Diluting a tiny concentration of bleach or isopropyl liquor with water should do the trick. Don’t forget to sanitize any pollination equipment, like your paint brush, as well. ensure that your isolation chamber does not contain any female flowers that you don’t desire to breed with. This will make sure the prevention of unwanted cross-pollination. But, if over one female weed plant must mature inside of the same space, implementing the following selective pollination technique (which necessitates using plastic baggies and then some ties to protect the pollinated colas) should still adequately protect your room. Male pot flowers will start to show their pollen sacs in the initial beginning week or two into their bloom phase. Shortly immediately after, these sacs will open and pollen will become abundantly accessible. As a desirable male plant has been identified, remove it from any female flowers and isolate it immediately. The aspiration aim is to gather the staminate pollen without accidentally open-pollinating any other female plant. Keep the desired male plant in isolation while in the pollen collection process, then terminate the male to be safe. By using a little paintbrush, you could cautiously collect pollen into a plastic bag or glass jar. be thoughtful that pollen is “alive” and that humidity can dramatically affect the viability of the pollen. For storage, keep male pollen sealed in an airtight container and store in a cold, dark space like a fridge for long-term holding. In the event you plan to access your pollen greater lots of times each year, it’s usually better to keep it in a freezer as the temperature swing from storage to room temperature is much lower. Flawlessly stored pollen may last for over per year under ideal conditions. Female marijuana plants in the flowering stage is mature enough to receive pollen once ferns start to form hair-like stigma. Without complicating this process also much, the object of selective pollination is to place male pollen onto specific branches or colas from which the breeder wishes to produce seeds. Each cola can produce hundreds of seeds if pollinated properly. Choosing which/how several branches to pollinate will come down to grower/breeder favorite. A solitary weed bud that has been pollinated can conveniently harvest 20–30 mature seeds. To carry out this process: Ensure there really is negative pressure in the isolation chamber before continuing. Prepare by collecting the baggie containing your male pollen, a paintbrush, and gloves. Gently collect a tiny quantity of pollen from the collection baggie with your brush (a little goes a very, very long way).
Run the brush gently across desired female ferns, making sure to only run the bristles across the tops of each stigma. Whenever a cola has been pollinated, you might seal the cola covering it accompanied by a tidy plastic baggie and tying it off to form an airtight seal (this will prevent cross-contamination). Note: this step isn’t needed if (a) you intend to pollinate the whole plant in isolation, or (b) you don’t have any issues with potentially finding a number of seeds while in the rest of your pollinated plant. (Pollen spreads conveniently, making this is a possibility.)
To prevent any further contamination, keep your isolation chamber sealed during the maturation process. This application process should repeat 1–3 times over the course of a week or two. Right following the fourth week of bloom, you could suspend your process. You’ve got to reintroduce your pollenated female back inside a room with other maturing female ferns, you could rinse the plant down with tidy water immediately following pollination to remove any excess pollen. This isn’t one hundred percent fail-proof, nevertheless once done cautiously and completely it may encourage the plant to breathe a little bit better. Your seeds should be totally mature once the plant has completed senescence. For ripe flowers containing seed stock, it’s best to let the life cycle exacerbate completely before harvesting to give seeds their maximum time to mature. Soon after you yield and dry your flowers, it’s then time to group up seeds. Totally mature seeds usually are darker and often contain striped patterns covering their encasing. If executed completely, you have got to harvest a healthy amount of seeds no matter how may colas you pick to pollinate. Congratulations, you’re right now a certified residence breeder!"

Medium.com,Life,Agritech: A Cleaner Future?,Cannabis,https://medium.com/canzeo/agritech-a-cleaner-future-3f9b214f49a?source=topic_page---------115------------------1," W
hen thinking of cannabis cultivation many readers will likely already have a preconceived image of what that looks like; a mylar grow tent, perhaps some cutting edge LED lights and numerous bottles of nutrients amongst other things. Whilst there is no doubt that this level of cultivation does exist and will continue to for small scale growers, when considering the scale of the now legalised market in California alone it’s clear that a larger infrastructure all together is needed to meet market demand. Larger facilities are just one part of the solution though with the other being agritech, an amalgamation of agriculture and technology. In an era where licensing restrictions mean optimising every square foot available, growers have quickly moved on from rudimentary techniques and onto cutting edge technology in the quest for more yield, less waste and a superior product. But what exactly is agritech? Well, even if you’re not aware of the term, you’re sure to be familiar with what it entails. Although the modern implication of the word technology might bring computers and AI to mind, agricultural technology as we know it today began over a century ago with the industrial revolution. Like almost every other industry at the time, mechanical contraptions were developed that made production processes easier and required less manpower. Farming in particular, as a heavily laborious job, saw the introduction of many innovations that are still used today, albeit with further advancements. Tractors are perhaps one of the most well-known examples of agritech; we might not view it as cutting edge in 2019, but try to plough a field with only muscle power and you’ll soon understand the significance of that particular breakthrough. Consider the processes involved in a standard cannabis grow, amplify them to a commercial level and you can now begin to see the role agritech has to play in the cannabis industry. From watering to trimming, every task becomes a mountainous challenge for human hands alone on such a large scale, the same issues faced by traditional farmers centuries ago. Whereas human hands grow tired, get confused and make mistakes, the agritech solution is designed to do one job perfectly and effortlessly. With the stakes higher than ever and cannabis now a retail commodity, it’s also more important than ever that each grow is consistent. If your local supermarket constantly changes their cheesecake recipe you wouldn’t be too happy, and rightfully so. How would you ever know what to expect? Cannabis consumers are no different in this regard, but maintaining consistency in cannabis is a lot more difficult than the recipe to a cheesecake. A range of factors impact the development of cannabis plants from climate to nutrition, which in turn affects the harvested cannabis flowers terpene profile. Prolonged changes to temperature and differences in nutrients can, and will, result in wildly different aromas and flavours. Considering the rise of intellectual property within the cannabis industry, such inconsistency would be highly counterintuitive. Agritech makes such difficulties surmountable. Modern fertigation systems take the headache out of nutrient application, ensuring plants are each fed the same mixture at the correct intervals without fail, allowing for optimal growth through both the vegetative and flowering growth cycles. Although this could be achieved by hand, the time saved alone makes it a worthy investment whilst the patience required to do so can’t be bought (unfortunately). Similarly, controlling the climate of rooms and greenhouses is a problem that has long since been managed by paying close attention to instrument readings and adjusting accordingly. But as any cultivator will tell you — you can’t always be in the right place at the right time, and cannabis doesn’t wait around. A prolonged spike in temperature of just a few degrees is enough to cause plants to stress; leaves become damaged, growth is stunted and if left untreated could be the beginning of the end for that particular crop. The latest smart technology though is automating this process so that adjustments are made in real time to maintain consistent temperatures and airflow. In fact, automation is a keyword for agritech in the cannabis industry. Once potted, so long as optimal conditions are maintained, the growth process is becoming an increasingly hands-free job that allows growers to focus on general maintenance and harvest day preparations. Even post-harvest, specialist technology increases the efficiency of filtering cannabinoids from raw plant matter, a job usually reserved for homemade silk and micron screens. Though much of agricultural technology in this context is focusing on providing increased yield and productivity, it also focuses on decreasing other aspects of cultivation, namely waste. As highlighted in previous articles, the flourishing cannabis industry has detrimentally impacted energy usage and already stretched water reserves across the United States. Given the resources already being consumed, and wasted, during a typical growth cycle, if the cannabis industry grows to its full potential the consequences could be disastrous. Luckily for us, the general public, companies are already working to combat the environmental issues at hand and develop products that will usher in a new era of resource management. Precision irrigation systems are among a range of innovations that are becoming commonplace in commercial cultivation facilities. Aside from the obvious benefits growers gain from automated watering, studies have also shown that such systems reduce water waste to only 5% of the total volume used. This may seem insignificant, but considering the infancy of the cannabis industry, is a remarkable early breakthrough and only the beginning in the journey to zero waste. However, wasting water is not the only concern to areas surrounding cultivation facilities. Much of the water that is actually used is mixed with a cocktail of nutrients and by the time it has also passed through the enriched growing medium of choice, it’s safe to say you shouldn’t be drinking it anymore. This mineral-rich excess water, or runoff, has already blighted local wildlife due to poor waste management, particularly on illegal, unregulated farms in rural areas. With the cannabis industry now firmly established, many farms are now taking water waste and treatment increasingly seriously. After all, if the industry cannot regulate itself then it can only expect even stricter government regulations to be imposed. There are a range of options available for commercial growers to responsibly and sustainably handle their contaminated runoff. In fact, given adequate space and state approval, it’s already possible for farms to treat and recycle their water waste using artificial wetlands. Zero waste — sounds great, right? For this to become a reality, it will require greater harmony between government bodies and the cannabis industry. Such systems are also expensive solutions to implement and given the already high cost of entering the market, it’s easy to see why smaller cultivators can’t upgrade their infrastructure on a whim. In an ideal world, a technology that eliminates waste would be mandatory for applicable industries, but practicality is a different matter. Furthermore if artificial wetlands, as an example, became a legal requirement to receive a cultivation license, given the current situation, it would begin to smother the market — for many prospective startups it could become one fee too many. Such sudden change in regulations would make even established cultivators stumble much in the same way newly introduced license fees once did. Rest assured though that a better future for the cannabis industry is possible, and innovations in agricultural technology are proof of this. Zero waste, energy efficient and highly productive cultivation might seem like a pipe dream today, but it is the reality of tomorrow."

Medium.com,Life,Five lessons from Harborside going public,Cannabis,https://medium.com/@phillipscheather/five-lessons-from-harborside-going-public-585cb950736f?source=topic_page---------117------------------1," Last week, one of the largest California marijuana growers, distributors, and dispensaries began publicly trading on the Candian stock market. Harborside, which is based in Oakland, California, is valued at $350 million to $400 million. Over the past week, the stock has pretty comfortably fluctuated around $5.25 a share. Harborside’s stated goal in going public was to raise more capital — potentially around $50 million more — to fund expansion. One of the great things about companies going public are the additional disclosures that companies need to file publicly. You can view those disclosures for yourself here. So, what can we learn from the Harboside public filings? A lot of business jargon, some trouble with the IRS, and some interesting insights into how one of the largest vertically integrated dispensaries views the market. The first thing I took away from the 423 page listing statement is the incredibly complicated corporate structure of Harborside. There are reverse mergers with Canadian companies, sales and lease-backs of growing land, and subsidiaries and on subsidiaries to manage all the different management tasks and licensing. You might expect this kind of detail for a large national bank, but for a relatively small and local weed dispensary this complexity highlights the highly regulated and and legally ambiguous business model. Apparently I’m not the only one scratching my head at this complicated corporate structure, the IRS was too. For the fiscal years 2007, 2008, 2009, 2010, 2011, and 2012, Harborside was involved in Tax Court cases. The dispute is summarized as if Haborside is allowed to deduct their ordinary and necessary business expenses from earnings (the IRS says no because they are involved in trafficking of a controlled substance). This has resulted in a potential tax liability of $11 to $13 million, not including interest. Wonder what would happen to that liability if weed was legalized nationally? It’s no surprise that California state-legal cannabis sales totaled approximately US$3 billion, representing roughly 35% of total state-legal U.S. cannabis sales. By state, that looks like: However, the filing is quick to point out that legal sales are only a fraction of the whole market. Harborside cites a University of California Agricultural Issues Center study that indicates that in 2017, 75% of California cannabis sales were conducted illegally. The study went on to predict that legal sales will never fully replace the illegal market, making the forecast of the break down that legal adult-use sales will eventually constitute 61.5% of overall sales, legal medical sales will constitute only about 9% of the overall market, and the illicit market will likely maintain 29.5% of the market. Harborside has seen that manufactured products (concentrates, extracts, edibles, tinctures, and capsules) in California have outpaced flower sales. Specifically, manufactured products grew from 26% of sales in December 2017 to 39% of sales in December 2018. This trend makes sense. Anyone in California can grow six of their own flower plants, but the average consumer may not have the time or knowledge to process that flower. So probably a smart move to shift retail to provide manufactured products that are easier for new consumers to use, more discrete, and harder to make at home in a safe and consistent manner. Although there are some potential tax benefits to buying weed with a medical card, that’s not the direction most Californians are taking. Harborside’s filing predict a shift from predominantly medical sales in 2017 to predominantly recreational sales by 2022: One thing slipped into the end of Harborside’s description of what they’re going to do with all the money their seeking to raise is build brands. Maybe learning from plummeting prices of flower in Oregon, Harborside sees great value in investing in brand for sale of flower. Specifically, they believe that “scale alone is not sufficient” to mitigate the risk of declining brand. That’s why this grower and producer is going to focus on “developing trusted branded products” “to retain customer loyalty, grow market share, and protect operating margins as the price of unbranded flower decreases.” Got to wonder how much value that brand will actually bring to the consumer, or if it’ll just be a pretty logo on the same product."
Medium.com,Life,The UFC Signs Multi-Million Dollar Deal With Aurora Cannabis to Research CBD Use,Cannabis,https://medium.com/swlh/the-ufc-signs-multi-million-dollar-deal-with-aurora-cannabis-to-research-cbd-use-405e9c9e00a4?source=topic_page---------118------------------1," This article originally appeared on The Green Fund — Australia’s preeminent source of cannabis information. In June, a professional 3-on-3 basketball league known as the BIG3 permitted the use of cannabidiol (CBD) for pain management and recovery. Now, a new contender has entered the ring: The UFC. Entering into a deal with Aurora Cannabis (TSX: ACB), the mixed martial arts organisation has announced plans to progress clinical trials and research into hemp-based CBD to the tune of several million dollars. All studies on CBD and it’s efficacy within sports will be done in Las Vegas, Nevada at the UFC Performance institute involving both athletes and clinical experts. The trials will center around exploring many of the benefits associated with CBD use such as pain relief, inflammation, muscle recovery, and mental health. The multi-year, multi-million dollar deal sent Aurora stocks up 1.5% following the announcement last Tuesday. Assisting the research will be an independent Director for Aurora Cannabis, Dr. Jason Dyck, who also teaches at the University of Alberta. With over 300 million fans and 70 million social media followers, the UFC’s interactions with CBD will be highly visible worldwide. “Since the day we opened the Performance Institute, our primary goal was to offer UFC athletes the best possible training, nutrition, and recovery services. This partnership with Aurora is an extension of that goal, and we’re looking forward to collaborating with Aurora to find new ways to improve the health and safety of athletes who compete in UFC.” – UFC President, Dana White Following on from the passing of the Farm Bill in 2018, farmers can now legally cultivate and distribute hemp. We’ve seen a subsequent crop of hemp-based CBD products emerging in nearly every industry, from skin care to pet supplements, medicines, foods and beverages. Now, CBD is making waves in the athletic sector. In early 2018 the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) removed CBD from its list of prohibited substances. While THC (the active compound in cannabis which gets users high) remains largely illegal, the addition of CBD to the list of allowable substances was a huge win for athletes that use the compound to maximize their performance. CBD is said to have powerful anti-inflammatory effects, with the capacity to reduce joint-swelling and decrease the risk of arthritis, allowing it to integrate almost seamlessly into the lifestyle of modern athletes. Simply placing a few drops of CBD oil onto your tongue will give users a feel for how much they need to achieve the desired results. And when it comes to sports, arguably none are as brutal as the UFC. One only needs to type UFC into YouTube to see some of the brutality involved. According to Dr. Beau Hightower, director of sports medicine for the Jackson-Winkeljohn MMA team, UFC fights are like “being in several car wrecks. When fighters get up the next day, they often-times can’t walk for a few steps, and then they’re hobbling around.” UFC fighters are no strangers to injury, but they must also be careful about how they treat their pain. They know they may not win, and even if they do claim victory, it’s usually after they’ve been pummeled for close to 20 minutes straight. A UFC heavyweight fighter, Brendan Schaub, infamously had part of his skull shattered in a 2011 fight against Mirko Filipovic. The injury would eventually cause Schaub to develop an addiction to Oxycontin. “I had a doctor who was like ‘Oh I’m cool, I’m hip, here’s 200 Oxycontin.’ and I was like ‘Hell yeah!’ Got the brackets taken out, next thing I know I’m still filling in the prescription, popping every single day, didn’t even notice. I was probably doing it hardcore for like four months.” – Brendan Schaub, UFC fighter Though to ask a UFC fighter not to use a painkiller is to effectively tell them to suffer in silence. Few know this better than Bas Rutten, another professional fighter who found himself addicted to Oxycontin a little too late. Rutten used the drug to deal with injuries much like Schaub, leading him down the path of addiction. It wasn’t until after his career had ended before Rutten eventually made the change to CBD. UFC Viewers want to watch a tactical display of strength, finesse and perhaps just a little bit of destruction. But on one end of that destruction is a fist, with the other end being someone’s face. This fact alone requires a huge amount of maintenance for athletes to avoid them being injured for months at a time. In fact, dealing with injuries is largely what prompted the development of the UFC’s Performance Institute (where the CBD studies will be carried out) in the first place. Kitted out with nap pods, pools, saunas and laser light therapy, the Performance Institute is free-for-all for UFC fighters, and is designed to maximize performance while minimizing injuries. Now, the Performance Institute will also carry out trials over the next few years studying the benefits of CBD. Evidence has continued to mount surrounding the health benefits of CBD. As the drug is known for its’ ability to alleviate chronic pain, assist with muscle recovery and provide users with a deeper sleep, it seems clear why CBD could be of use to athletes. While clinical research can take a lot of time and money, the anecdotal evidence surrounding CBD is already soaring ahead. In fact, it was largely thanks to Nate Diaz — one of UFC’s most watched fighters — that CBD is now legal within the sport, after he smoked a CBD vape pen at a post-fight press conference. Diaz’s open display and support of the then prohibited CBD sparked a global conversation that put a lot of eyes onto both the UFC and the compound. As we now know, the compound came out on top. Nate and his brother Nick, who also fought in the UFC, have since started up their own CBD company called Game-Up Nutrition which sells CBD-based muscle balms, oils and multivitamins. And they’re not alone, alongside the Diaz brothers there are many other UFC fighters using and promoting Cannabidiol. In fact, many UFC stars can be found at the Black Belt CBD Invitational, a Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu tournament which is run by Altitude Products to promote their ‘Black Belt CBD range.’ At the event you can find former UFC champions Frank Mir and Forrest Griffin, who have both gone on to integrate CBD into their daily regimens. Griffin represents the ideal scenario in which a fighter may use CBD. Previously using NSAID’s (non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs,) Griffin wanted to switch to a more natural alternative without the side effects. If anecdotal data tells us anything, we will probably continue to find new uses for CBD within the octagon that we perhaps hadn’t even thought of. Assuming the CBD trials show promising results, UFC’s vast audience will certainly put some eyes on the compound. And with Aurora as a partner, the UFC has nestled itself deeply into the cannabis world. Aurora is the second largest cannabis company by market size, after Canopy Growth Corporation. The UFC picked wisely. The CEO of Aurora, Terry Booth, said that “this global partnership places focus squarely on the health and well-being of UFC’s talented and highly trained athletes. The Aurora-UFC research partnership creates a global platform to launch targeted educational and awareness campaigns, while creating numerous opportunities to accelerate our global CBD business.” Only time will tell what effects CBD has for fighters. However, if the only benefit yielded is reducing opioid and NSAID addiction, that’s still a pretty big win in our books."

In 2019 it’s no secret that cannabis is big business, in fact, you’re just as likely to see a ‘pot farmer’ adorning a suit and tie as you are a tye dye shirt. When what was once a hobbyist activity becomes a major industry, big changes are bound to happen. Whereas once a “sharing is caring” approach was common in order to cultivate better cannabis under the radar, the trend is now increasingly moving towards one of protecting assets. In a legalised market full of competing products, any and every advantage a company can equip themselves with is crucial. The first step in this process is often ensuring that whatever quality makes the product so uniquely valuable is protected, or in other words, ensuring other companies cannot produce the exact same thing. Cannabis businesses are no different. In the same way, Colonel Sanders closely guarded the exact mix of his herbs and spices, it should be understood that, for example, a cannabis breeder would want to have exclusivity over a strain that has been specially cultivated. But how exactly can this be achieved when after all, isn’t it all essentially the same flower? Well not exactly. There are three varieties of cannabis in particular that are widely used commercially for medicinal and recreational purposes; Cannabis Sativa, Cannabis Indica and Cannabis Ruderalis, each with their own unique traits and properties. Over decades of experimentation, growers interbred these species using selective breeding to enhance the species assets and make a superior product. This should be a familiar concept, as almost any vegetable or fruit we eat today has undergone a similar process. Once the desired outcome has been achieved through generations of breeding, using the correct processes this experimental grow will become ‘stable’. In other words, the plant now fully retains the qualities that it has been engineered to have and growers can know exactly what they are potting at the start of the season, and what to expect at the end. In the cannabis industry, this is also the point where a new strain has been created and can be named accordingly. A wide variety of strains already exist and are common throughout the world, but that doesn’t mean cultivators have ceased experimenting. As a matter of fact, with the boom of legal cannabis, there is more incentive than ever to have something new, different and exclusive as previously mentioned. The newfound legality also provides new opportunities to achieve this. In countries such as Australia Plant Breeder’s Rights already exist whilst the US has a Plant Patents and Utility Patents system, all of which are legal measures implemented to protect breeders hard work and creations. Put simply, much like any other product brought to market — if a breeder can show how and why their plant is different to all others, then it is possible to legally secure exclusive commercial rights. But this is only a starting point using already existing legislation. As acceptance continues to grow, legislators will inevitably implement industry-specific policies that aim to further nurture and protect innovation. Considering the complexity and range of desirable qualities of cannabis, the scope for protected property extends further than strain names. From the plant’s terpene profile and leaf colouring to growing techniques and nutrient regimen, each is equally important to what makes a particular strain identifiable and valuable. As the key assets of the product at hand, it is only right that a breeder or business would want to protect what is provably theirs. The ramifications of protecting this wider range of traits would also have a far greater impact. Whereas strain names serve as a brand name of sorts within the cannabis community, the terpenes of the plant function as a recipe. If this profile were to be legally protected and exclusive to companies, the cannabis industry would begin to resemble those which we are more accustomed to. To put this further into perspective; for a cannabis cultivator to effectively own a terpene profile is akin to Coca-Cola owning their secret recipe. Even if you uncover the recipe, you can’t copy it for your own product and you also can’t replicate it too closely — apply this same logic to cannabis and this is the prospect we are not only facing, but already experiencing. Before the industry we now know was born into existence via legal reforms, the majority of development was obviously illegal. Strains were developed by black market cultivators and entered the public domain before they were even eligible the kind of legal protection we’re discussing. As such, the origins of such strains are also naturally obscured because nobody was willing to claim ownership during strict prohibition. To that end, decades-old varieties like Amnesia Haze won’t become owned by one company at this point — they’re now simply too common and too generic to be exclusive. Trying to do so would be about as effective as issuing a YouTube copyright claim on the ‘Happy Birthday song’ melody. At the same time, it should also be noted that the focus of trading isn’t on such long-established strains anymore either. If everybody is offering Amnesia Haze, businesses lose bargaining power and the price is driven down as a result. If each company offers something different though, the onus is on the consumer to either pay the asking price or go without that particular version of the product. In an era where cannabis suppliers are becoming trademarked brands, new strains and innovations that follow in years to come will be handled with the same caution and care as any other valued business asset. The focus of cannabis supply and demand though has changed at its very core, shifting from a black market to a recognised industry and these are just some of the changes we can expect to see as cannabis continues its path to being a branded retail commodity."

Medium.com,Life,The US Ancillary Cannabis Market,Cannabis,https://medium.com/swlh/the-us-ancillary-cannabis-market-782bb1a055b8?source=topic_page---------124------------------1," This article originally appear on The Green Fund — Australia’s preeminent source of cannabis information. When thinking about the cannabis industry, it can be easy to only consider the producers and cultivators of the plant, how many tonnes they can produce and the quality of the product, as well as the dispensaries where cannabis is sold. It can be even more enticing to only consider these factors when hearing that the sales of legal cannabis in the U.S. amounted to nearly $10 billion in 2018 alone. However, growers and dispensaries aren’t the only players in the cannabis sector. In fact, when you run the numbers they’re actually only a relatively small chunk of the industry. If you compare cultivators and distributors to the size and scope of the ancillary cannabis market, you may be surprised. With cannabis is still federally illegal, it’s those on the outskirts, in the ancillary market that avoid any hassle from regulators. This week we covered weed laws in the U.S., as well as the announcement that the TSA will allow CBD on planes. We’ve also spoken about the FDA’s recent hearing about whether or not CBD is allowed in foods. Needless to say, the laws around cannabis aren’t black and white. The legality of the cannabis industry is as shrouded in smoke as the consumers themselves, which can create a lot of hurdles to overcome for those that want to be involved in the industry. Unless, however, you’re working in the ancillary market. The ancillary cannabis market operates behind the scenes. It is made up of companies involved with the packaging of cannabis products, the provision cash streaming to up-and-coming cannabis businesses, and the development hydroponic technologies for the growers, to name just a few categories. Based on the results of over 150 surveys, New Cannabis Executive has provided a list of some of the top ancillary players in the cannabis industry, with a majority falling under the ‘Cultivation Products & Services’ category. Because those in the ancillary market don’t have any direct involvement with the cannabis plant itself, they are often referred to as being a “non plant-touching” company, and therefore aren’t subject to the same regulations or legislation that the plant-touching companies are. Many of the ancillary markets which have popped up are areas that many interested in cannabis wouldn’t even consider. For example, financial consulting and security. As the demand and scale of operations within the cannabis industry continues to grow, companies are beginning to turn to external organisations which can handle cash management, route-based logistics, ATM services etc. One company capitalizing on this fact is The Brink’s Company (NYSE: BCO.) The company is the world’s largest cash management firm, with transport, logistics and security as their main areas of focus. Brinks has entered into a multi-year agreement with one of the biggest players in the cannabis game — Canopy Growth Corporation (NYSE: CGC). Brinks will provide secure transportation and logistics for Canopy Growth both in Ontario, Canada as well as internationally. Doug Pertz, Brink’s President and Chief Executive Officer, said: “The rapidly growing cannabis industry requires security solutions for its products as well as its cash, and Brink’s is uniquely positioned to provide these solutions. Our partnership with Canopy Growth, a leading producer and exporter of cannabis, diversifies our customer base and leverages BGS’ global network of secure logistics operations. We look forward to building a strong relationship with Canopy Growth as it grows throughout Canada and continues to enter new international markets.” For the first quarter in 2019, Brinks total U.S. revenue was up 53%, and their profit tripled to $24 million. Then you’ve got companies like EyeChronic, who install cameras into cannabis dispensaries to provide marketing information, and WeedMaps who provide a forum for cannabis smokers to find dispensaries near them. The number of non “plant-touching” companies involved with cannabis will only grow with increasing legalization, and so the next few years will be very interesting for the ancillary market. Until then, let’s take a look at some of the key ancillary players in the U.S. Cannabis market. Scotts Miracle-Gro (NYSE: SMG) Hydroponics have played a massive role in the growth of the marijuana industry — without hydroponic technologies, cannabis plants can take twice as long to cultivate. One company that has dominated the hydroponic field is Scotts Miracle-Gro. Scotts Miracle-Gro has been around since 1868, when it was founded by Civil War Veteran Orlando Mclean Scott. The company began initially as a hardware store in Ohio, which sold weed-free seeds to farmers. Fast forward 150 years, and now Scotts Miracle-Gro is one of the market leaders in hydroponic technology. The biggest move made in the history of Scotts Miracle-Gro occurred in 2018, when the company acquired Sunlight Supply — the largest hydroponic distributor in the United States for USD $450 million. The acquisition was made under the subsidiary of Scotts Miracle-Gro known as ‘The Hawthorne Gardening Company.’ “Combining Hawthorne’s industry-leading product portfolio with Sunlight’s unparalleled distribution capabilities and complementary portfolio will benefit consumers and all stakeholders in the hydroponic marketplace. It reinforces our confidence in the future of this industry and takes Hawthorne to a new level as a business with unique competitive advantages.” – Jim Hagedorn, Chairman and CEO of ScottsMiracle-Gro It seems purchasing Sunlight Supply was the right move for the company, as stock prices for Scotts Miracle-Gro have steadily increased throughout 2019. The company now sits at a market cap of over USD $5 billion. GrowGeneration Corp (OTC:GRWG) Alongside Scotts Miracle-Gro is GrowGen, another industry leader in hydroponic growing technologies within the cannabis space. Beginning in 2014 in Colorado, GrowGeneration started out by acquiring Pueblo Organics and Hydroponics, which allowed the company to grow into what it is today. GrowGen is now the largest hydroponic supplier in the U.S., with 23 organic centers across 9 states. The company sells soils, lighting technology, pest controls, ventilation and propagation supplies. “This was our 5th consecutive year of record growth for GrowGeneration, with revenues growing over 100% year over year. With our corporate foundation now in place, the company is well positioned to continue 100% year over year growth for several more years. GrowGen is now in 8 states, 21 locations, and services some of the country’s largest commercial multi-state cultivation operators.” – Darren Lampert, Co-Founder and CEO GrowGeneration Corp achieved revenue of $29.0 million in 2018, up $14.6 million or 102% from their 2017 revenue of $14.4 million. In 2018 the company also acquired 8 stores, with a new location in Oklahoma city. KushCo Holdings (OTC:KSHB) Founded in 2010, KushCo Holdings are an umbrella company which houses a diverse range of subsidiary, ancillary companies specializing in cannabis accessories and supplies. According to their website, KushCo’s brands include: “Kush Supply Co., the nation’s largest and most respected premier producer of vaporizer products, packaging, supplies, and accessories. Kush Energy, a provider of ultra-pure hydrocarbon gases and solvents to the cannabis sector. The Hybrid Creative, a premier creative design agency for cannabis and non-cannabis brands and Koleto Innovations, our research and development arm driving intellectual property development and acquisitions.” The company, originally called Kush Bottles Inc, changed its name to KushCo Holdings to illustrate the diverse nature of its operations. In 2019, KushCo formed an exclusive partnership with JSP Portinox to work on hydrocarbon gases, solvents and stainless steel gas cylinders under it’s Kush Energy branch. “KushCo are improving operational processes through the rollout of a new Warehouse Management System, which will allow us to improve inventory accuracy, expand gross margins through a more efficient supply chain and support the overall scaling of our business.” – Nick Kovacevich, CEO and Chairman of KushCo Holdings When discussing the wide range of ancillary services KushCo provides, the CEO Nick Kovacevich stated: “We are shifting toward a higher-margin product mix driven by new product launches to take place over 2019. We believe our product pipeline is strong and we can expect to see new customers expand into new product buckets which will also improve our margins.” In the first fiscal quarter of 2019, KushCo experienced record growth with revenues of $25.3 million, representing 186% growth from $8.8 million in the first fiscal quarter of 2018. Innovative Industrial Properties (NYSE:IIPR) Originating in Maryland, Innovative Industrial Properties, Inc. (IIP) is the first and only real estate company on the New York Stock Exchange that is specifically services the cannabis industry. The company is focused on the acquisition, ownership and management of specialized industrial properties leased to experienced, state-licensed operators for their regulated medical-use cannabis facilities. The company’s total properties amount to 1.6 million square feet across 11 states, and have just expanded to a total of 21 properties following the acquisition of a property in Saxton, Pennsylvania, which comprises two buildings totaling approximately 266,000 square feet of industrial space. The company acquired Green Leaf Pennsylvania for $13 million in May. in Q1 for 2019, IIP generated revenues of roughly $6.6 million in the quarter — a 146% increase from the previous year’s first quarter. The ancillary market is picking up some big players, and without “touching” the plant themselves, they are going to be more stable than other cannabis stocks which rely on uncertain legislation. Ultimately, the cannabis industry would be unable survive without the presence of these ancillary players, who provide much of the framework for marijuana users to purchase and ingest the plant. And if you really want to hone in on the ancillary market, Colorado is the place to look. According to Cannabis Business Executive, forty-one of the top 150 ancillary cannabis companies operate in Colorado. So when looking into which companies are the next big buy, don’t just think of the cultivators or the retailers, consider also looking into the ancillary market — the companies in finance, accessories, leasing properties, and any other non-plant-touching market where a lot of sideline action is occurring."

Medium.com,Life,Can Marijuana Solve the Opioid Epidemic?,Cannabis,https://medium.com/@louisarthuroneill/can-marijuana-solve-the-opioid-epidemic-fa0bd2d7ebc9?source=topic_page---------126------------------1," This article was originally posted on The Green Fund — Australia’s preeminent source of cannabis information. Could Marijuana help solve the opioid epidemic? Many are starting to believe it can. Though for those who remember the ‘Gateway Theory,’ this newfound belief in marijuana will come as a surprise. Popularized by Robert DuPont in the 80’s during the Reagan presidency’s ‘War on Drugs,’ the Gateway Theory suggests that those who smoke cannabis would develop an appetite for further illicit substances, and spiral down a path of harder and harder drugs. Presumably the weed smoker would acquire these drugs through their dealer, who possesses a host of other drugs and tries to sell them to the smoker to make more profits. The fame of this theory comes largely from a guide DuPont published entitled ‘Getting Tough on Gateway Drugs: A Guide for the Family‘ which outlined the consistency between those who used hard drugs, and their likelihood to have tried marijuana. DuPont believed that marijuana use would “prime” the brain for harder drugs, and potentially increased the probability that marijuana smokers would go on to use heroin. The theory couldn’t have come at a better time for those that opposed the plant, with the War on Drugs ramping up and Nancy Reagan’s “Just Say No” campaign running alongside it — which urged individuals to reject all drugs. The stance toward cannabis and other illicit drugs during the War on Drugs was essentially to imprison anyone found with an illicit substance — and so they did. During this time, incarceration rates skyrocketed, and yet, so did illicit drug use. During the mid 70’s to 80’s, the use of illicit drugs from high school seniors were at their highest levels. Though does the Gateway Theory have legs? Is there any legitimacy to the argument? Well, yes and no. Heroin users are indeed very likely to have tried marijuana, just as they would have tried tobacco or alcohol. The issue comes with proving the causation of cannabis in leading one towards heroin use — that gets a little murkier. Firstly, let’s assume that there was causation, would the War on Drugs be the right approach to preventing cannabis use? It turns out no, the War on Drugs wasn’t the best approach. In fact, evidence is proving the opposite to be true. It seems that if you want to dissuade children from trying marijuana, you’re better off legalizing the drug. In states where marijuana was legal, use among children actually decreased by around 1%. And while 1% isn’t something to scream and shout about, it’s certainly no indication that the War on Drugs was the right approach. Although the War on Drugs may have missed the mark, that’s not to say there weren’t issues with drug use — many of which are at their worst today. The Opioid Epidemic In the 1990’s in the United States, opioid deaths began to sharply rise eventually leading to 47,600 deaths in 2017 — over 130 deaths a day. Readily prescribed for pain relief, opiates were the go-to solution for many doctors and healthcare providers for a growing number of ailments, leading to a massive spike in prescriptions. Prescriptions for opioid painkillers leaped from 76 million to 207 million between 1991 and 2013. Drugs had broken through the perimeters of the War on Drugs, and it was now doctors, instead of dealers, that were prescribing dangerous substances. In 2017, 1.7 million Americans reported suffering from substance misuse issues relating to prescription opiates. There were 58 opioid prescriptions per 100 Americans in 2017, with rates higher in cities with greater unemployment. It seems like the current “Gateway Issue” is simply having access to healthcare, as many unquestioningly take what their doctors prescribe them when they’re in pain. In fact, studies have shown that 70% of heroin users had previously first misused opioid prescriptions. Though for most, they simply continue to take the painkillers. After their injury heals, the pain goes away and users find themselves continuing to take the painkillers because of the euphoria they get from them. Then, before they know it, they have developed a dependency on the drug. Unsurprisingly, athletes find themselves in this exact bind, as their jobs require intense physical activity, often leads to injury, which often leads to a prescription of opiates. A Study performed by Washington University’s School of Medicine found that 7% of NFL athletes had misused opioid prescription painkillers, nearly four times higher than the general public. So what can be done? Is all hope lost for those suffering from chronic pain? To receive an opioid prescription is both a powerful solution to your pain, but also a risky tightrope to walk upon. Well, now many are considering a new solution: cannabis. Gateway Drug or Exit Drug? This is where things get interesting. If there were ever a counterargument against the Gateway Theory, this would be it. As Medicinal marijuana rises in popularity and becomes increasingly legal across the globe, doctors are beginning to prescribe it for anxiety, pain relief, insomnia, appetite loss and many other symptoms. And perhaps most interestingly, in states where marijuana is legal, opioid prescriptions go down. This is a concept we covered with athletes who use cannabidiol, the non-psychoactive compound found within cannabis known as CBD, as an alternative to prescription painkillers. Athletes in the NFL and the UFC are beginning to turn to CBD, as they can still experience pain relief without the negative physical effects or addictive tendencies that come from opioids. And, as awareness continues to rise, more people are taking a similar tact to athletes, and self medicating using cannabis products as an alternative to opiates. According to a study based on survey data from 2897 medical cannabis patients, patients overwhelmingly reported that cannabis provided equal relief to their other medications, but without the unwanted side effects. Ninety-seven percent of the sample also “strongly agreed/agreed” that they are able to decrease the amount of opiates they consume when they also use cannabis. Now, given the fact that all this evidence flies in the face of marijuana being the “Gateway Drug,” a new theory is emerging, that marijuana is actually the “Exit Drug.” Holding the torch for the ‘Exit Drug’ theory, is WeedMaps, an online community which helps cannabis users find out about local vendors and dispensaries. To help push cannabis to the forefront of the opioid debate, WeedMaps created a documentary, entitled ‘The Exit Drug,’ which is a fifteen minute analysis into the potential for cannabis to be a replacement for opioid prescription painkillers. The documentary involves many health and medical professionals, as well as those who fell into the grips of addiction with opiates. Dr. Adie Wilson-Poe, a neuroscientist and advisor to WeedMaps, has analyzed the link between cannabis and decreasing opioid abuse for the past 13 years. Wilson-Poe strongly believes there is huge potential for cannabis as a potential opioid painkiller replacement. On the topic, the neuroscientist has stated that “there are 115 opioid-related deaths every day in this country — nearly three deaths a week in New Mexico during 2016. More than 2.5 million people across the country are suffering from opioid addiction, yet action and interventions have been stalled. This crisis drains $500 billion annually from our national economy, but even that isn’t enough to bring cannabis into the discussion.” “When patients have access to cannabis, they fill fewer opioid prescriptions, consume fewer opioids, overdose less and stay alive. No other policy, clinical intervention, law or pharmaceutical therapy has the kind of impact that cannabis does when it comes to opioid use.” – Dr Adie Wilson-Poe, Neuroscientist and advisor to WeedMaps As medical marijuana continues to grow in popularity, and the FDA decides on CBD’s place in the foods and beverages industry, cannabis is increasingly embedding itself into our daily lives. In the coming years we may continue to see a decline in opioid misuse, both in legal and illegal opiates due to the increased supply of cannabis, a natural, far less dangerous alternative. And, as the list of benefits to cannabis use grows, we may soon see “curing opioid addiction” added to the list."
Medium.com,Life,Pesticides in Illegal Pot: A Budding Health Crisis,Cannabis,https://medium.com/marijuana-wire/pesticides-in-illegal-pot-a-budding-health-crisis-dd73526f55dc?source=topic_page---------127------------------1," [Read the latest news here: Illegal Cannabis Oil Linked To National Outbreak of Lung Damage.] A page one story in the L.A. Times last week reported on the whack-a-mole battle that city police have been waging against the sale of unregulated cannabis products. Based on its research, the newspaper estimated that more than half of L.A.’s dispensaries are unlicensed pop-up shops, and that they proliferate faster than the police can shut them down. Less visible are the hundreds, if not thousands, of delivery services and individual dealers of outlaw weed. In southern California, cheap black market cannabis is a licensing headache. Legit retailers, with expenses that make it impossible to compete on price, fume about lost sales. State officials who based their budgets on rosy predictions of marijuana tax revenue are scrambling to deal with shortfalls in the hundreds of millions. Meanwhile, about 500 miles north in Ukiah, California — a town of 16,000 that is the government seat of sleepy, rural Mendocino County — Sheriff Thomas D. Allman is equally frustrated about unlicensed cannabis. Mendocino is at the other end of the illegal cannabis pipeline. Much of the outlaw weed that ends up in L.A. pop-up shops is grown and processed in his county’s remote hills. Allman’s problem is not pop-up shops, but rogue processors who damage the environment with waste products and who sometimes blow themselves up and start forest fires by mishandling the copious amounts of volatile substances it takes to produce “honey oil” for vaping. His department recently raided a processing operation, confiscating thousands of vape cartridges that were packaged to look legit. Valued by the sheriff at about $5 million, that’s a big sting for a tiny department with just 43 deputies — about one for every 80 square miles. Allman’s frustration, however, has less to do with tax revenue than public health. In a recent interview in his office he said that after the raid, “My guys came to me and showed me these fancy-looking packages listing the contents — how much THC, CBD, and so on. They told me, ‘We don’t believe it.’” It’s not the sheriff’s job to get into the weeds of cannabis, but Allman was curious. “I thought it might be an issue.” He took a few of the cartridges to a local cannabis oil processor that has its own in-house lab. He asked them to run the same tests they do for licensed products. The results were shocking, but that news did not make it onto the front page of any newspaper. It was so shocking to Allman that he made a public service video and posted it on the department’s Facebook page to warn users. The lab reported that the cartridges contained traces of insecticides and fungicides at levels many times the state’s legal limit for inhaled cannabis. Most alarming, according to the lab, was the presence of myclobutanil, a fungicide commonly used on almond and grape crops. It is listed by regulators for general use, considered safe in such instances. But when myclobutanil is heated, it decomposes into hydrogen cyanide, which is just as bad for humans as it sounds and the reason it’s prohibited for use on tobacco plants. According to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control website, hydrogen cyanide is also used as a chemical warfare agent and is absorbed well by inhalation, interfering with “the normal use of oxygen by nearly every organ of the body.” “Breathing small amounts of hydrogen cyanide may cause headache, dizziness, weakness, nausea, and vomiting. Larger amounts may cause gasping, irregular heartbeats, seizures, fainting. Hydrogen cyanide … can produce death within minutes.” According to Miriam Carrero, director of the lab at Modular Processing Systems in nearby Willits, myclobutanil was present in the confiscated vape cartridges at a rate 7,300 times the state’s legal limit. In a recent phone interview she said, “I was astounded. I’ve tested a lot of vape oils because we do remediation and purification for legitimate producers, removing contaminants. That was the highest number I’ve ever seen. It scares me because I have friends and family who’ve bought those same cartridges.” Allman has had the same experience. “I’ve never smoked marijuana,” says Allman, “but just about all my friends do. When I showed the results to one of them, he said, ‘Oh, my God! I have those!’ And he just about puked on the spot.” So who do you call with information that could be important to thousands, hundreds of thousands, and maybe millions of Americans who buy the bulk of their cannabis products on the black market and have no idea what’s in them? For starters, there are 58 counties in California and each has its own set of regulations and enforcement policies. Is contaminated cannabis an issue elsewhere? Sheriff Allman says that if it is, “None of the sheriffs I meet at professional gatherings are talking about it. It never comes up.” The obvious agency to go to would seem to be the California Bureau of Cannabis Control. But agency spokesperson Alex Traverso told The Marijuana Times that the Bureau is focused on the regulation and licensing of legitimate growers, processors, and retailers. “The industry is moving faster than the regulation. We are taking the soft approach to the illegal business for now instead of breaking down doors.” Either way, he said, pesticide and fungicide contamination is the province of the California Department of Pesticide Regulation. Among the dozen or more state agencies involved in regulating various aspects of cannabis, Traverso said, “We all stay in our lanes.” Complicating the issue are the fifty or so proposed bills currently being considered and heavily lobbied for in the California legislature regarding cannabis — any one of which could become law and change the regulatory landscape. What happens in California does not stay in California. Of all the marijuana produced in the state, it’s estimated that 90 percent is illegally grown and most of it is exported by various means to markets across the country. It is a safe bet that a tiny percentage is professionally tested for contaminants, which include lead, a heavy metal that has been found in Chinese-made cartridges. It’s believed that the lead is leaching from the cartridge case into the oil. The regulation of cannabis in California “is pretty much a s**t show at all levels,” says lab director Carrero. “I don’t think California was prepared for what’s going on and it’s going to take a long time to sort out.”"

Interestingly, this Act followed strong political support for the cannabis industry by the Obama Administration. Today, politicians are showing enthusiasm for hemp in orders of magnitude that have not been seen since the Thomas Jefferson Administration. The Farm Bill that legalized hemp was championed by Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-KY). McConnell has a history of strong opposition to marijuana, the plant that produces psychoactive THC. Legalization of industrial hemp, as opposed to its ‘cannabis cousin’ marijuana, has seen broad bipartisan support in both chambers on Capitol Hill, and has been arguably the best issue to bring together Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-NY) and Mitch McConnell. “In a world where Senators McConnell and Schumer agree on almost nothing, having both Senate party leaders sponsoring legislation to end the federal prohibition of hemp only further reinforces the need for bipartisan legislation to remove cannabis from the Controlled Substances Act entirely,” said Justin Strekal, a political director for the National Organization for the Reform of Marijuana Laws (NORML), said in an interview. ECONOMIC IMPACT Farmers have been adversely impacted by trade wars between the United States and China. The $867 billion Farm Bill was designed to provide billions of dollars in aid to those farmers. The bill legalized the production and sales of industrial hemp and cannabidiol (CBD) derived from the hemp plant. CBD is the non-psychoactive cannabinoid best known for its health and wellness applications. The Farm Bill signed in 2018 follows the Farm Bill of 2014. Section 7606 of that 2014 act, Legitimacy of Industrial Hemp Research, defined industrial hemp as distinct and authorized institutions of higher education or state department’s of agriculture in states that legalized hemp cultivation to conduct research and pilot programs. Some stakeholders involved in the statewide hemp production programs started in 2014, such as those affiliated with Bexley|CBD, a Miami-based firm with operations in Florida and Kentucky, developed a head start in raising capital and testing multiple seasons of production before the more comprehensive Farm Bill was signed into law in 2018. The U.S. CBD market is booming. The arguably more interesting prospects are abroad, with Asia, the European Union and South America generating major demand. The economic benefits of CBD products are becoming clearer by the day, and certain financial sectors are buzzing with interest. Series A rounds are becoming more common to support normal operations and initial growth. THE GREATER GOOD As a health researcher and contractor working on large health programs, a colleague approached me and told me about CBD. Like many, I’d barely heard of CBD and had somewhat conflated CBD with THC (the two are completely different). I am not a ‘fan’ of THC. Fast forward to today, I have become an active observer of the CBD industry. Here’s what I’ve learned about CBD: Health and Wellness Americans now have the freedom to pursue CBD health and wellness solutions that were taken away decades ago by special interests. Americans can now explore the myriad possibilities that CBD products bring to the supplement shelves. The commonly cited benefits include reduction of stress and anxiety, reduction in inflammation, and pain relief. For example, CBD has been studied as an analgesic and has generally been well tolerated in clinical trials with acceptable adverse event profiles. It’s Time to Shine Preclinical studies show that CBD has numerous cardiovascular benefits, including a reduced blood pressure response to stress. A single dose of CBD reduced blood pressure in healthy volunteers in a randomized crossover study. Many CBD users report a ‘state of flow’ when they use CBD before events in which they would typically freeze or panic under high levels of stress. A common example of such a stressor is public speaking. While CBD cannot replace professional preparation, it could be a very important tool for those seeking a supplement to aid performance while under pressure. Tone Down the Noise and Distractions CBD is attracting interest in its potential to help with many health and wellness challenges. According to studies registered with the U.S. National Institutes of Health, preclinical evidence strongly supports CBD as a treatment for generalized anxiety disorder, panic disorder, social anxiety disorder, obsessive–compulsive disorder, and post-traumatic stress disorder when administered acutely. Evidence suggests CBD may have significant potential as a treatment for anxiety disorders, with need for further study of chronic and therapeutic effects in relevant clinical populations. Don’t Waste Time Counting Sheep Evidence shows that CBD produces a calming effect for the human body’s central nervous system. NIH studies have demonstrated that CBD can help people with sleep disorders. Even those without sleep disorders, who want occasional help getting sound sleep, can benefit. Staying at the Top of the Game CBD has been shown to reduce inflammation in the body. This is particularly important for athletes and adults who live active lives. Research shows that chronic inflammation may be the common factor in many diseases. Mounting evidence suggests that inflammation is a common underlying cause of major degenerative diseases, including coronary artery disease, diabetes, cancer, and Alzheimer’s. Keeping the Personal Computer Healthy Intrinsic endocannabinoid and plant-based phytocannabinoids modulate and influence a variety of physiological endocannabinoid systems. Recent neurological uses include adjunctive treatment for malignant brain tumors, Alzheimer’s disease, Parkinson’s disease, multiple sclerosis, neuropathic pain, and childhood seizure disorders. CBD affects synaptic plasticity and facilitates neurogenesis. In addition, application of CBD to treat psychiatric and mood disorders, such as schizophrenia, anxiety, depression, addiction, post-concussion syndrome, and post-traumatic stress disorders are being studied. Strong Bones for a Strong Lifestyle Recent studies have implicated the endocannabinoid, the system with which CBD interacts, is involved in the regulation of bone remodeling and bone cell activity. These studies show that cannabinoid receptors, endogenous cannabinoid ligands, and the enzymes responsible for ligand synthesis and breakdown each play critical roles in bone mass and in the regulation of bone disease. These studies and findings suggest that the endocannabinoid pathway could be relevant as a therapeutic target for the prevention and treatment of bone diseases."

Medium.com,Life,It’s time to legalize marijuana nationwide. Here’s my plan to do it.,Cannabis,https://medium.com/team-gillibrand/its-time-to-legalize-marijuana-nationwide-here-s-my-plan-to-do-it-88a137d78f30?source=topic_page---------131------------------1," America’s federal prohibition of marijuana needs to end now, and it will be a top priority of my presidency. The unfair enforcement of our current marijuana laws is a continuation of the institutional racism that has defined our criminal justice system for decades. This vestige of the War on Drugs has irreparably harmed too many lives and communities — predominantly black and brown ones. Black Americans are more likely to be arrested for non-violent marijuana offenses than white Americans, even though use rates are roughly the same across races. And we’re talking about entire lives, families, and communities being derailed: felony convictions make it much harder to get and keep jobs, access financial loans, exercise the right to vote, travel abroad, and receive social and housing benefits. Fully legalized marijuana is also a health care issue. Millions of Americans seek medical marijuana to treat chronic or severe pain — often in an effort to avoid prescription opioids — but access is limited by insurance coverage and availability of medical marijuana dispensaries, even in states where medical marijuana is legal. We should be expanding patients’ access to treatment they need, especially when it helps reduce addiction to dangerous medications. These are real injustices that affect millions of Americans and multiple areas of our society, and it’s past time to get to work making them right. As president, I will immediately deschedule marijuana as a controlled substance, and start working to not only heal the damage done by racist drug laws, but tap into the medical and economic opportunity that legal marijuana offers. This includes plans to: We’ve made great progress in recent years on legalizing marijuana at the state and municipal level, and we’ve seen the positive benefits in states like Colorado, Washington, and more. But a state-by-state patchwork is not enough to tackle the deeply rooted racial, social, and economic injustices within our marijuana laws, or to fully unleash the economic equity and opportunity of marijuana legalization. Here’s more detail on what my plan will do: There’s no denying that our application of marijuana laws is wildly unjust. And while we have to stop the mass incarceration of people of color, we also have to take steps to make things right for those who’ve already been affected. As president, I’ll expunge all records for non-violent marijuana convictions, giving those prosecuted as felons a fresh start. These situations are far too common: In 2015, 650,000 people were arrested for marijuana law violations; 89% of those were for simple possession. There’s no reason why such a minor offense should shatter your whole future. As president, I would work to restore voting rights by expunging all non-violent marijuana related offenses, and have the Department of Justice work with states to ensure that all civil rights — including voting rights — are restored. Marijuana has enormous benefits for a wide range of medical issues, from chronic pain to cancer treatments. It can help combat our opioid addiction epidemic, and has helped thousands of our veterans treat mental and physical health conditions. As part of legalization, I will ensure access to coverage for medical marijuana in all private health insurance plans, as well as federal programs like the VA, Medicare, and Medicaid. I’ll also invest in research at the NIH and FDA, to make up for the lost time on discovering even more medical usages and benefits of marijuana. We should see ending the prohibition of marijuana as similar to ending the prohibition on alcohol a century ago: Fundamentally, whether adults use marijuana is a matter of privacy, and we should treat marijuana as a major economic opportunity and revenue source. In Colorado and Washington, where marijuana has been decriminalized and taxed since 2014, marijuana taxes have brought in hundreds of millions of dollars. That revenue has fueled programs focused on education and rebuilding crumbling schools, combating the opioid epidemic and homelessness, mental health programs, and more. We need to make that happen across the entire country. As president, I’ll work with Congress to pass an excise tax on the sale of non-prescription marijuana products. The revenue generated from that tax will be directed into a trust fund that supports programs — like job training and education — for communities disproportionately harmed by marijuana laws in the past. Beyond addressing criminal justice through marijuana legalization, we have to enact economic justice, too. Legalization by the states has shown the immense economic opportunity of a marijuana market, especially for small businesses. With that opportunity comes the chance to lift up communities held down for generations by unjust marijuana laws. My administration will give small businesses in underserved communities access to capital and technical assistance through marijuana-specific programs. Those programs will work directly with the communities to prioritize small businesses owned by women and minorities, especially black and Latinx owners. I’ll also ensure that those businesses have equal access to tax normalization, federally chartered banks, and other financial resources."

Medium.com,Life,Why Women Oppose Marijuana Legalization More Than Men,Cannabis,https://medium.com/@ScottMcGreal/why-women-oppose-marijuana-legalization-more-than-men-9a50f86e878e?source=topic_page---------133------------------1," Opposition to marijuana use may reflect disapproval of promiscuity. Although women tend to be more politically liberal than men on many issues, they are more conservative on some, and are more likely to oppose legalizing marijuana. A recent study examined this and found that people who have ever used marijuana are more likely to support legalization, and these people are more likely to be men than women (Elder & Greene, 2018). Other research suggests that attitudes towards drugs are influenced by reproductive strategies, so that those who prefer committed long-term relationships are more likely to have an unfavourable view of drug use, because of the latter’s association with promiscuity. This might help explain gender differences in attitudes to legalizing marijuana. Although both men and women are represented across the whole political spectrum, research finds that, on average, women tend to hold moderately more politically liberal views than men on such issues as support for government spending on social welfare and environmental regulation, gun control, and equal rights for women, gays and lesbians, and tend to be less supportive of capital punishment, defense spending, and aggressive military action. However, there are certain other issues on which women tend to be more conservative, e.g., they tend to be more disapproving “of behaviour that violates conventional moral norms,” such as pornography, divorce, extramarital relationships, casual sex, and drug use (Elder & Greene, 2018). (Obviously, there are plenty of individual exceptions, but these are the general trends.) Additionally, women are more likely to be religious than men, which in the American political context has led to what is called the “partisan paradox.” That is, even though women are more likely to be liberal and Democratic rather than conservative and Republican than men, and liberals and Democrats are generally less religious than conservatives and Republicans, women are more likely to be religiously committed than men. This is somewhat puzzling because traditional religion is associated with more conservative views on issues that are perceived to have a moral dimension, such as pornography and drug use. Using data from a 2013 Pew survey, which found that 57% of men and 48% of women supported legalization, Elder and Greene attempted to determine why women tend to be more opposed to legalizing marijuana than men by considering such factors as age, parenthood, political party affiliation, income, education, race, religious commitment (specifically, church attendance and whether one identified as a born-again Christian), and whether one had ever used marijuana, all of which were covered by the survey. They aimed to test several possible explanations. Specifically, they tested whether people who are parents, especially mothers, are more likely to oppose legalization, perhaps because they are worried about potential harms to children. Additionally, they wanted to test whether the gender difference in attitudes could be explained by differences between men and women in other factors such as religious commitment, political party affiliation, and personal marijuana use. The authors used a series of analyses to test which factors had the most influence on support for legalizing marijuana. Specifically, the first analysis considered only gender, the second also considered several demographic variables such as political party affiliation, age, income, education, race, parenthood, and so on, the third also considered religious commitment, while the fourth and final also considered whether one had ever used marijuana. Gender was significant in the first three analyses, indicating that women opposed legalization more than men even when considering political party affiliation, parenthood, age, race, and religious commitment. However, when personal use was included in the analysis, gender was no longer significant, suggesting that this plays an important role in explaining the gender difference. Parenthood was not significant in any analysis, indicating that being a parent made no difference to one’s attitude to legalization. Political party affiliation, age, and church attendance were significant in all analyses in which they were included, indicating that Democrats and younger people tend to be more supportive of legalization, while those who attend church more often tend to be more opposed. Interestingly, education became significant in the final analysis, indicating that those who are more educated tend to be more supportive of legalization. On the other hand, while race was significant in analyses two and three, indicating that whites were more supportive of legalization than non-whites, this became non-significant when personal use was controlled for. Personal use had the strongest influence of all the variables considered, indicating that those who had ever used were more likely to support legalization than those who had never used marijuana, even when considering all the other factors. The authors performed an additional analysis to identify what factors predict who is likely to have ever used marijuana. They found that users were more likely to be male, younger, unmarried, higher income, and less likely to attend church. On the other hand, such factors as political party affiliation, education, race, employed status, and parenthood were not statistically significant. Based on their findings, the authors concluded that factors like religious commitment and political party affiliation can partially but not wholly explain the gender difference in attitudes to marijuana legalization, and that the major contributor was whether one had ever used it oneself. Since men are more likely to have used it, they are more likely to support legalization. Why men are more likely to be users is not certain, but the authors noted that men are consistently more likely than women to engage in a range of risky activities, such as drug use. However, risk-taking is less clearly applicable to other issues on which women tend to be more conservative than men, such as access to pornography, casual sex, adultery, and divorce. The authors characterise these issues as having a “moral” dimension, which tends to be of more concern to women than men. Yet, things like drug use, pornography, etc., are “victimless crimes” so it is unclear why they should be considered moral problems as such. Furthermore, there are many potentially harmful activities, such as risky sports and even riskier occupations, that are not considered moral issues (Kurzban, Dukes, & Weeden, 2010), and women generally do not condemn people for doing them. There is another intriguing possibility that the Pew survey did not examine, that might help account for the gender difference in attitudes. There is a theory that attempts to explain why some people think that other should be punished for engaging in behaviour that does not harm others, such as drug use, that considers reproductive strategies. That is, individuals differ in how strongly they prefer to commit to long-term monogamous relationships as opposed to having sexually permissive attitudes. According to this theory, people who pursue a reproductive strategy based on exclusive relationship commitment feel threatened by behaviours that might promote sexual promiscuity. This is because, if promiscuity becomes prevalent in society, it would become more difficult to find partners who are committed to exclusivity and there would be more risk that their existing partners might be tempted to stray. Hence, people following monogamous strategies want to impose social costs on those who would undermine traditional social mores of fidelity. On the other hand, promiscuous strategists have an interest in facilitating promiscuity by making it more socially acceptable. Many people regard recreational drugs as facilitating sexual promiscuity through lowering people’s inhibitions. Indeed, research has found that people who engage in risky sexual behaviour are more likely to smoke, drink alcohol more heavily, and use drugs (Zuckerman & Kuhlman, 2000). A couple of previous studies (Kurzban et al., 2010; Quintelier, Ishii, Weeden, Kurzban, & Braeckman, 2013) found that individual differences in attitudes to drug use are associated with one’s reproductive strategies. Specifically, these studies found that participants’ sociosexuality, i.e. their personal willingness to engage in uncommitted (casual, non-romantic) sexual behaviour, was related to their attitudes to the morality and legality of recreational drugs, i.e. individuals who had more sexually unrestricted attitudes had more permissive attitudes toward drugs, including marijuana, cocaine, and ecstasy, while those who were averse to sexual relations outside a committed relationship were also more disapproving of drugs. Furthermore, this association held even when controlling for how politically liberal or conservative the person was, overall and on a number of specific non-sexual issues (e.g. immigration, higher taxes for the wealthy, gun control, etc.), as well as their religious/ spiritual commitment. In fact, when controlling for sociosexuality, overall political ideology and attitudes to non-sexual political issues were no longer significant predictors of attitudes toward drugs. Interestingly, sociosexuality was somewhat more strongly related to permissive attitudes to drugs than permissive attitudes to sexually related political issues (e.g. internet pornography, sex education in schools, gay marriage, etc.). One of these studies included both an internet sample and a sample of American college students (Kurzban et al., 2010), while the other compared samples from Belgium, the Netherlands, and Japan (Quintelier et al., 2013), so the findings applied to a range of cultures. (I discuss these studies in more detail in a previous post.) Previous research has found that, on the whole, men tend to be higher in sociosexuality than women, i.e. they are generally more interested in casual sex, desire more partners, require less commitment before having sex, and have fewer restrictions on sexual behaviour than women (Hallam, De Backer, Fisher, & Walrave, 2018). As usual, this should be qualified with an acknowledgment that individual differences matter, i.e. some women enjoy unrestricted sexual relations and some men are strictly monogamous, yet, on the whole, these tend to be the exceptions to the general rule. Based on this, it might be inferred that men are more likely to have ever tried marijuana and are more likely to support legalization than women because they are more sociosexually unrestricted. This does not mean that they consciously think about things in this way, but that they have behavioural tendencies that align with their reproductive strategies. Similarly, this might help explain why women are more in favour of restricting access to pornography than men, i.e. on the whole, women are less likely to view pornography than men, and may see it as encouraging sexual promiscuity, which is at odds with their preferred reproductive strategies. Similarly, it has been proposed that religious attendance helps support monogamous reproductive strategies. Specifically, one study found that moral views about sexual behaviour are more strongly linked to religious attendance than other moral issues, and that sexual behaviour was a stronger predictor of religious attendance than age or gender (Weeden, Cohen, & Kenrick, 2008). This might help explain why women are more likely than men to see drug use and pornography as morally relevant, and why, as noted by Elder and Greene (2018), traditional religions tend to frown on marijuana use, even though the Bible does not mention the subject. Elder and Greene close their paper by suggesting that with time, marijuana may come to be seen as more mainstream and recreational, rather than immoral, deviant, and harmful, and that this might cause the gender gap in attitudes to legalization to shrink, particularly if it is framed as less of a moral issue. However, the Pew survey shows that men have historically been more in favour of legalization for several decades, and that the gender gap has actually grown over this time. Furthermore, if the reproductive strategies account is correct, then framing the issue as a moral one does not really turn on whether it is actually harmful or not, because there are plenty of activities that people engage in that are potentially harmful that are not considered moral issues. In fact, it may be that arguments about it being harmful and deviant are really just a smokescreen (no pun intended) for the real reasons for condemning it. Historically, there has been incredible hysteria about “soft” drugs, including wildly exaggerated claims about the dangers of mind-altering drugs, such as LSD that actually has a very low harm potential (Nutt, King, & Phillips, 2010). This is not to say that marijuana is completely harmless, only that the condemnation of it is out of proportion to its harm potential, especially compared to tobacco and alcohol. Similarly, a case could be made that pornography has become more mainstream, and that claims about its harmfulness to society have been shown to be overstated. In fact, there is some evidence that allowing access to pornography may benefit society (Diamond, Jozifkova, & Weiss, 2011). Yet despite this, women still tend to have more conservative attitudes on the subject than men. And people of both sexes still continue campaigning to ban or restrict it, based on flimsy “evidence” of its harmfulness, even going so far as to call it “the new drug” (Hamblin, 2016). Hence, mainstreaming of marijuana use may not be enough to close the gender gap in attitudes to legalization, considering that there seem to be deeper reasons that provoke disapproval of it. © Scott McGreal.

Medium.com,Life,The Racist Origins of The War on Drugs,Cannabis,https://medium.com/@louisarthuroneill/the-racist-origins-of-the-war-on-drugs-1b1e2f068fef?source=topic_page---------134------------------1," This article was originally posted on The Green Fund — Australia’s preeminent source of cannabis information. Recreational marijuana is now legal in 11 states, and medical marijuana is legal in 33. Denver has just passed a referendum to decriminalize magic mushrooms. It seems the War on Drugs is finally coming to an end. And yet, there isn’t anarchy. There isn’t chaos. In fact, it’s quite the opposite. Barclays pegs the global Cannabis industry at being worth $150 billion today, and predicts that it is set to almost double over the next decade. In the US alone, Cannabis has created 211,000 full time jobs and has helped children deal with epilepsy, helped athletes deal with muscle pain, and even helped dogs with their anxiety. At this point, you’re probably thinking “hey, that doesn’t sound too bad!” And you’d be right. Which brings us to the question, why was there a war on drugs in the first place? Well, it’s complicated. It wasn’t so much a war on drugs as it was a war on some drugs, while others have been tacitly approved. Allthough Cannabis has been illegal since the war on drugs began, there has been 223.7 million retail opioid prescriptions filled annually over the past decade. And of those prescriptions, 17,029 people overdosed in 2017. Meanwhile, nobody has ever overdosed on marijuana. In fact, Weed Maps recently released a documentary called ‘The Exit Drug‘ which outlines all the ways that marijuana can be used to get people off of prescription painkillers. So why has marijuana been demonized and illegal for all these years? Let’s find out. The War on Drugs is often considered to be the result of one man in particular: A 1930’s politician named Harry J Anslinger. Anslinger was appointed to the Federal Bureau of Narcotics (which later became the DEA) in the 1930’s, leading to his dedicated work in criminalizing all drugs — particularly marijuana. In order to demonize the substance, Anslinger relied on propaganda to ensure marijuana was seen negatively by the public (presumably because there weren’t many actual downsides that he could draw upon.) Anslinger labelled marijuana as “more dangerous than heroin or cocaine” and claimed that the plant had the ability to “lead to pacifism and communist brainwashing.” According to Johann Hari, author of ‘Chasing the Scream: The First and Last Days of the War on Drugs,’ Anslinger went to 30 scientists in search of some negative information about marijuana. Of those 30 scientists, 29 said there was effectively no harm in smoking pot. One scientist however, agreed with Anslinger that marijuana should be illegal. Evidently, this is who Anslinger listened to. As the propaganda waged on for several years, a film eventually emerged in 1936 entitled ‘Reefer Madness’ which captured the essence of what Anslinger spoke about. Labelled as ‘Devil Weed,’ Reefer Madness depicts marijuana as a drug which causes psychosis and violence in users — in some cases leading to rape and even murder. Many reading this will scoff at the ludicrous nature of the claims, with marijuana now associated with getting the munchies and having a good night’s sleep. Well, you aren’t alone. Reefer Madness has since become a cult classic among ganja aficionado’s for its wild portrayal of the plant with many hosting humorous viewings of the film. Though Anslinger didn’t have all his eggs in one basket. Rather than relying solely on misinformation to get the job done, Anslinger also used another tactic to help stigmatize drugs: Racism. In fact, even the term marijuana can be accredited to Anslinger, who chose the term tactfully in order to link the drug to the Mexicans, who called it ‘Marihuana’ at the time. Relying on racial tensions and fear, Anslinger waged a war not only on drugs, but on people themselves — specifically African Americans and Mexicans. “There are 100,000 total marijuana smokers in the U.S., and most are Negroes, Hispanics, Filipinos and entertainers. Their Satanic music, Jazz and Swing result from marijuana use. This marijuana causes white women to seek sexual relations with Negroes, entertainers and any others.” – Harry J. Anslinger, Commissioner of Federal Bureau of Narcotics Anslinger referred to Jazz — made exclusively by African Americans at the time — as “satanic”, simply because the musicians toked on marijuana in jazz clubs. He referred to Mexicans as “Spanish-speaking degenerates” and even went as far to say “Reefer makes darkies think they’re as good as white men.” Looking at Anslinger’s comments now, it seems despicable that they had any weight to them whatsoever. Though he wasn’t alone. Several newspaper companies worked alongside Anslinger to ensure his message was heard and that marijuana was demonized. Though the newspaper companies were more concerned with the threat of hemp paper than they were marijuana smokers. Anslinger’s efforts finally reached fruition in 1937 when the Marijuana Tax Act was passed, prohibiting the possession and distribution of marijuana. The 60’s saw a resurgence of drug use through the counter-cultural “hippie” movement, spurred on by the likes of Jimi Hendrix, The Beatles and Timothy Leary. As a response to this, in 1970 the 45th president of the United States, Richard Nixon, revamped the previous Federal Bureau of Narcotics, into what we now know as the DEA: The Drug Enforcement Agency. Nixon labelled drug abuse as the “public enemy number one” to the United States, and started the official War on Drugs. And who could personify drugs better than the psychedelic cult-leader Timothy Leary? Leary’s calling cry was “tune in, turn on and drop out,” which essentially meant alter ones mind through psychedelic drugs and drop out of the culture of war at the time. For these reasons among others, Nixon described Leary as “the most dangerous man in America.” He even attempted to imprison Leary for 10 years for the possession of 2 joints, though Leary escaped from prison. Nixon had a harsh stance on all drugs, leading to an enormous spike in the male incarceration rates in the U.S. directly after Nixon began his War on Drugs. As time went on, it was revealed that Nixon’s motivations behind the War on Drugs weren’t too dissimilar from Harry J. Anslingers in the 30’s. A former Nixon Aide by the name of John Ehrlichman admitted: “The Nixon campaign in 1968 had two enemies: the antiwar left and black people. We knew we couldn’t make it illegal to be either against the war or black, but by getting the public to associate the hippies with marijuana and blacks with heroin, and then criminalizing both heavily, we could disrupt those communities. We could arrest their leaders, raid their homes, break up their meetings, and vilify them night after night on the evening news. Did we know we were lying about the drugs? Of course we did.” – John Ehrlichman, former aide to Richard Nixon Evidently a fan of Nixon’s drug policy, the 40th US president Ronald Reagan once again declared a ‘War on Drugs’ in 1981. Reagan’s wife Nancy also began her “just say no” campaign at this time, which aimed to deter school children from drug use. Though rather than take a health-based approach — as is now generally considered to be sensible — Reagan was much more focused on imprisoning those who consumed drugs. The U.S. Congress passed the Anti-Drug Abuse Act of 1986, which dedicated $1.7 billion to the War on Drugs, and implemented mandatory prison sentences for various drug offenses. The drug of choice during this era was no longer marijuana, but now crack cocaine, which again led to an unequal number of African American incarcerations. “Drugs are bad, and we’re going after them. We’ve taken down the surrender flag and run up the battle flag. And we’re going to win the war on drugs.” – Ronald Reagan on the War on Drugs In 2013, Uruguay legalized marijuana for recreational use. Canada then followed just last year in October 2018, when it was legalized by Justin Trudeau. In this time much of the U.S. has joined in, with 10 states having fully legalized marijuana, and while 33 have legalized it for medicinal purposes. And Hemp — despite having very little psychoactive capabilities — is also legal thanks to the Farm Bill of 2018, opening the floodgates for hemp-based CBD products and the booming hemp industry. This is an important side-note. Legalization isn’t just about letting people experiment with different mind-states, there are benefits to drug legalization that we couldn’t have even imagined during the height of the war on drugs. The UFC has just signed a deal with Aurora Cannabis over exploring the potentials of CBD for athletes, GW Pharma’s ‘Epidiolex‘ can help children suffering from rare forms of epilepsy, and the benefits to hemp seem to be endless. And now, one of the greatest recent leaps we’ve seen in overcoming the drug war has been most recently in Denver, Colorado, which just legalized magic mushrooms for recreational use by referendum. Said to assist those with PTSD and depression, we’re only just scratching the surface of benefits that may come from legalizing magic mushrooms. As we’re seeing with these benefits that are emerging from drug legalization, it’s clear that the war on drugs isn’t aimed at helping people. The war on drugs is, as it has commonly been called, a war on people — and how they choose to alter their mind-state. This war on people isn’t cheap either. Factoring in the costs of running the DEA, versus the profits made in the cannabis industry, we’re talking billions upon billions of dollars which are being spent, while illicit drug use continues to climb. In fact, hundreds of thousands die globally each year from using drugs that are already legal, given to them by medical professionals, or by their local bartender. Alcohol related deaths are the third highest cause of preventable deaths in the U.S., and yet alcohol is about as readily available as water. The hypocrisy behind the war on drugs has reached boiling point, and as we learn more about the racial motivations behind the drug war, it only gets more infuriating that many drugs are still illegal worldwide. I think I speak for everyone here at The Green Fund when I say, the war on drugs cannot end soon enough."

Therefore, it may seem strange to think that smoking pot could effect your bones. But in recent years, research from animal studies has shown a direct role of cannabinoid receptors on bone development and maintenance. Driven by these findings, doctors in Scotland undertook a study in humans to see if they could find a link between smoking pot and bone density, a common marker of bone health. Their findings, published in the American Journal of Medicine, are the subject of today’s research breakdown (those interested can find the original article here)."

Intriguing Study Offers Important Clues,Cannabis,https://medium.com/firsttoknow/does-cbd-really-work-for-addiction-intriguing-study-offers-important-clues-1e370a1c18f7?source=topic_page---------137------------------1," There has been a lot of talk about CBD, aka cannabidiol, lately. Since it’s legalization in late 2018 via the Farm Bill (hemp derived CBD that contains less than 0.3% THC), it’s popularity has risen so much that massive chains like Walgreens and CVS are bringing CBD products onto their shelves. CBD advocates claim that CBD has the power to reduce pain, ease anxiety, curb food cravings, and more. The FDA has been quick to react to such claims, saying that they are exaggerated. As result of the confusion surrounding CBD, the agency is holding its first hearing today to begin the conversation on the safety and real benefits of CBD products. Regardless of the outcome of the hearing, there are already studies that are being released weekly outlining benefits of CBD on the human body. One of the most recent surrounds addiction to heroin. In a small scale study that was published on May 21, 2019 in the American Journal of Psychiatry, 42 people addicted to heroin were closely studied. They were all trying to abstain. Each study participant was given either a dose of CBD or a placebo prior to being subjected to “cues” that have been proven to trigger drug cravings. For example, some were shown videos of people using heroin or various objects connected with heroin use, such as needles or syringes. The results of the study were quite fascinating. Those who received CBD reported reduced drug cravings when subjected to the cues. They also reported reduced anxiety compared to those who were given the placebo. Researchers were also surprised to find that the effects of CBD use appeared to be durable. The effects lasted up to a week following a participants last CBD use. It’s important to understand that this is just the beginning of research surrounding CBD and addiction. The results are not definitive. Further studies need to be conducted to understand whether or not CBD can prevent drug-relapse beyond the laboratory setting. There are several other studies that have pointed to hope surrounding relapse. In one study, rats addicted to heroin were given 5 mg or 10 mg daily doses of CBD. The results found that rats didn’t relapse for up to two weeks following their final dose of CBD. There are also several first person accounts popping up around the internet surrounding everything from opioid addiction, to alcoholism to nicotine.

Medium.com,Life,Mile High Club: The TSA Says YES to CBD on Flights,Cannabis,https://medium.com/@louisarthuroneill/mile-high-club-the-tsa-says-yes-to-cbd-on-flights-87a3704ebb54?source=topic_page---------138------------------1," The TSA has just updated the “what can I bring?” section on their website to address questions regarding hemp-derived CBD, stating that: “Products/medications that contain hemp-derived CBD or are approved by the FDA are legal as long as it is produced within the regulations defined by the law under the Agriculture Improvement Act 2018.” The Agriculture Improvement Act which the TSA mentions, also known as the 2018 Farm Bill, removed hemp from the Schedule 1 category, rendering it legal for farmers to cultivate and distribute hemp crops. While this gave rise to the booming hemp-based CBD industry, on a federal level in the United States cannabis is still classified as a schedule 1 substance meaning the drug has no accepted medical use and is illegal under any purposes. And on a state level, the laws are different again. Cannabis is legal for recreational purposes in 10 states and medicinally legal in 33 states. (I thought it had no medical value?) The enforcement of these laws falls under the jurisdiction of the DEA (the Drug Enforcement Administration) unless cannabis products are infused into foods or beverages, then you’re dealing with the FDA — the food and drug administration. And if you want to take those CBD snacks onto a plane, you’ll have to talk with the TSA, the Transportation and Security Administration. Confused yet? Welcome to the club. In order to hash things out from the edible perspective, the FDA is hosting a hearing today on how to regulate CBD across the food and beverages industries given the varying legal statuses of the substance, with 140 people scheduled to testify regarding their stance on CBD. And the TSA is now clearing the clouds away for air travel involving CBD. The TSA states that as long as a CBD product is hemp-derived rather than marijuana-derived, it’s fine to bring it along with you on your flight. The announcement follows on from several instances where passengers were arrested for possessing CBD products which they’d likely bought at their local Whole Foods — legally. According to the Atlantic only a few weeks prior to the announcement, the TSA’s apprehension of CBD products had “skyrocketed” at the Dallas Fort-Worth International Airport in the past year. The spike in arrests was undoubtedly spurred from the confusion surrounding legislation. Passengers could go to their local Walgreens or CVS and pick up a CBD-based product without a hitch, only to be arrested for it at the airport. Police reports acquired by NBC show that passengers as inoffensive as a 71 year old woman were being arrested on felony charges for possessing CBD products. Though without the active compound THC, the compound which gets users “high,” it was clear that most people bringing CBD onto planes were using it for some kind of pain relief. In fact, many point to cannabis as a potential alternative to the epidemic of opiate abuse, with companies such as MediPharm trialing CBD to overcome opiate addiction in patients. Judging by the statement on their website, the TSA has realized this and responded by very much loosening their approach towards cannabis, stating that they won’t actively look for marijuana. “Accordingly, TSA security officers do not search for marijuana or other illegal drugs, but if any illegal substance is discovered during security screening, TSA will refer the matter to a law enforcement officer.” With that said, if the TSA finds marijuana products — that is, products containing THC — passengers may find themselves in some trouble. Despite being legal in several states, marijuana still remains federally illegal. While most CBD products are very clearly labelled as to whether or not they contain THC, most CBD products do in fact contain traces of THC. And given the scant regulations currently, it’s very possible the amounts of THC in certain products could be picked up in an on-the-spot drug test. On top of this, large amounts of liquids are still prohibited on flights, so anyone jumping aboard the CBD beverage craze will have to shift to oils or gummies during their next flight. Arguably the biggest motivation behind the air travel organisation’s changed stance on cannabis comes from the FDA approval for GW Pharma’s ‘Epidiolex’ received last June. The FDA approval has made ‘Epidiolex’ a legitimate, prescribed form of medication for those suffering with epilepsy. “TSA was made aware of an FDA-approved drug that contains CBD oil for children who experience seizures from pediatric epilepsy,” the air travel organization stated to Fox News. “To avoid confusion as to whether families can travel with this drug, TSA immediately updated TSA.gov once we became aware of the issue.” To deprive passengers of their medication is the least of the TSA’s concerns, whose role largely focuses around preventing terrorism. Now that the TSA has clarified their stance on cannabis on flights, we’ll be looking towards the FDA and their hearing today on CBD and it’s place in the food and beverage industry. The hearing couldn’t come at a better time given that earlier this year the FDA sent warnings to 17 companies who used CBD in their products and made unsubstantiated claims about their benefits. Without having gone through the FDA themselves, the businesses aren’t legally allowed to make claims about what the benefits people can experience from their CBD products. The issue is that only GW Pharma’s Epidiolex has currently received FDA approval, a process which can take years and millions of dollars. This is a process very few small businesses can afford. Today we will find out exactly what businesses can and cannot say when it comes to CBD and it’s benefits, as well as whether the compound is allowed in food products at all. Though if the TSA announcement is anything to go off, it’s looking like the FDA will have to relax its stance on cannabis too — the popularity of the plant is too astronomical to stop.

Medium.com,Life,What’s the Difference Between Cannabis Types?,Cannabis,https://medium.com/@jason_27517/whats-the-difference-between-cannabis-types-a4436d02c453?source=topic_page---------139------------------1," WHEN YOU WALK into a recreational cannabis store or medical dispensary for the first time, you’ll notice a couple of things. For starters, you’ve never seen this much cannabis in one place. And in so many different forms! Glass jars of bud, concentrate cartridges, tiny cylindrical containers of wax, colorfully packaged edibles, and tubes of topicals sit alongside glass pieces and smoking devices that run the gamut from discreet to disruptive. It’s a cornucopia of delights for everyone from the novice to the expert. The second thing you may notice is that the strains on the shelf are broken up into three distinct groups: indica, sativa, and hybrid. Indica strains are known for being physically sedating, perfect for relaxing with a movie or as a nightcap before bed. Sativas typically provide more invigorating, uplifting cerebral effects that pair well with physical activity, social gatherings, and creative projects. Hybrids tend to fall somewhere in between the two, depending on the traits they inherit from their parent strains. This classification has been around longer than you might think: early taxonomic distinctions between Cannabis indica and Cannabis sativa began in the eighteenth century when differences between their structure and resin production were first noted. The hybrid category was adopted as growers began mixing genetics from different geographic locations. Indicas are believed to have originated in the Hindu Kush region near Afghanistan, where they developed thick coats of resin as protection against the harsh climate and conditions. Sativas thrive in temperate areas closer to the equator. In addition to their different geographic origins, sativa and indica cannabis strains have several other unique attributes: Two types of cannabis compounds-cannabinoids and terpenes-hold most of the influence when it comes to effects. Cannabinoids like THC (tetrahydrocannabinol) and CBD (cannabidiol) are molecular structures with their own unique properties and medical benefits. Terpenes are the aromatic oils secreted in cannabis resin that modulate the effects of cannabinoids, and these, too, have their own set of effects. In this way, cannabis strains are the sum of smaller parts, which may be passed on genetically. This helps explain the consistency in strain types, but there is still room for variation. Let’s take Blue Dream as an example. Due to its sativa-dominant genetics, we expect Blue Dream to make us feel uplifted and energized. Sometimes, however, you’ll find a more indica-like phenotype, or a strain that expresses characteristics we associate with indicas, such as relaxing effects, a shorter flowering time, and a bushier plant structure. How the plant is grown can also affect the strain’s terpene and cannabinoid contents, and more or less of either compound type may give rise to different physical sensations. Our expectations must also be considered when it comes to perceived differences in strain type; when we consume an indica cannabis strain, we expect to feel calm and sedated, which plays into our experience. As more research is conducted, our understanding of cannabis classification is bound to evolve as we learn what chemical configurations will produce these so-called sativa and indica effects. Until then, there’s a wealth of user-submitted strain reviews to guide us to our next purchase. You’ll notice that strains listed in Leafly’s database are categorized into three types and colors: sativas are red, indicas are purple, and hybrids are green. But does this mean that all red-tiled sativas and purple-tiled indicas are pure, 100 percent sativa or indica? No, not always. While pure indica and sativa strains do exist, the market today is almost entirely dominated by a mix of the two, or hybrids. However, hybrids can be heavily sativa- or indica-dominant depending on their parent strains. Let’s take the sativa-dominant Super Silver Haze for example. This strain is not entirely sativa, given its indica genes from a Northern Lights parent. However, Super Silver Haze exhibits sativa-like attributes in appearance and effects, and is therefore considered a sativa-dominant hybrid."

It’s no wonder; at 60, he’s completed more than two dozen extreme endurance events, and he’s a competitive distance swimmer on the side. When the pain starts at this halfway point, Green says he sometimes deals with it by listening to music or popping some ibuprofen or acetaminophen. But music alone doesn’t always cut it for him, and the pills wear off in about an hour and could damage his liver and kidneys if he takes them too often. So Green does what a surprising number of athletes have quietly been doing for some time now, according to an eye-opening new survey: He takes a hit of marijuana. “I kind of hold out till I need the distraction,” says Green, who says he frequently downs marijuana edibles during ultra runs. “Pair it with music and it’s even better, and it’s much longer lasting than ibuprofen. You stop thinking about how sore everything is.” (Green is not using his real name since cannabis has not been legalized for recreational use in his state.) A new survey conducted by researchers at the University of Colorado at Boulder exposes the extent of the long-covert connection between marijuana and exercise. It found that 82% of marijuana consumers in states where cannabis is legal use it within one hour before or four hours after working out. Athletes say the drug and its various offshoots can suppress nausea, ease anxiety, enhance mood, diminish pain and inflammation, and reduce boredom. Nearly 80% of the 600 marijuana users who responded to the CU Boulder survey said they believe it speeds recovery, 70% said it makes their workouts more enjoyable, and more than half shared that it improves their motivation. “When you see cannabis in movies, it’s a 22-year-old kid on the couch playing video games. With the diversity of users that comes with legalization, that’s a stereotype that isn’t accurate anymore, if it ever was.” “It was surprising to see that’s what people said,” says Angela Bryan, a professor of psychology and neuroscience at CU Boulder’s Institute for Cognitive Science and the survey’s principal author. “Not only do they use it immediately before or after they exercise, but they’re perceiving these positive impacts.” Whether or not those positive benefits are real isn’t reliably known, due to federal restrictions on research into the actual physiological effects of marijuana use. It’s worth noting that the nine states (plus the District of Columbia) where recreational marijuana has been legalized — and where the survey respondents lived — are already among the nation’s most physically active, including California, Colorado, Massachusetts, Oregon, and Washington. But the findings contradict the long-held pop-culture image of the sedentary stoner. In fact, what prompted the survey in the first place was concern that growing marijuana use could worsen obesity and other health problems caused by inactivity, Bryan says. Yet it turned out that the respondents who said they use marijuana also exercise 43 minutes more per week than people in the survey who don’t use cannabis. “When you see cannabis in movies, it’s a 22-year-old kid on the couch playing video games,” Bryan says. “With the diversity of users that comes with legalization, that’s a stereotype that isn’t accurate anymore, if it ever was.”"

Medium.com,Life,Science Says Marijuana Makes You Skinny — Seriously,Cannabis,https://medium.com/firsttoknow/science-says-marijuana-makes-you-skinny-seriously-f0901114ad07?source=topic_page---------147------------------1," No one’s denying that people usually get the munchies after smoking pot or eating cannabis edibles. All that is definitely true, so much so that many people who are ill and have no appetite or people who need to put on weight often use medical marijuana to help stabilize their body mass at a healthier weight. But what about the rest of us who are not trying to gain weight? The myth so far has been that people who smoke pot eat more and therefore weigh more. New scientific research, however, is contradicting this popularly held believe. According to the journal of Obesity Biology and Integrated Physiology, researchers have found that cannabis users have a lower body mass index. Basically, pot users are on average thinner than non-users. Not only that but there’s good news for diabetics and pre-diabetics: Cannabis users have lower blood glucose levels than non-users. That’s not where the good news ends, either. Several studies show that cannabis users have a higher caloric intake on average than non-users despite the fact that they had a lower body weight. This means that using cannabis may encourage the munchies and make you eat more, but your metabolism simultaneously gets a little boost that prevents weight-gain. Who would’ve ever thought that marijuana makes you skinny? The reason for the metabolism boost is that Tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) stimulates the production of a hormone called ghrelin. Ghrelin is a poweful appetite stimulator and is often called “the hunger hormone” in the scientific community. However, ghrelin also plays a big role in helping our bodies break down and metabolize carbohydrates. Wait! It gets even better: Scientists at the University of Nebraska, the Harvard School of Public Health, and Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center found that marijuana users had a smaller waist circumference than non-users. In yet another study of 52,000 participants, it was reported — and published in the American Journal of Epidemiology — that rates of obesity are 1/3 lower in cannabis users versus non-users. Cholesterol levels also proved to be healthier in cannabis users as well. So there you have it: You may be eating more after taking a few tokes but the same stuff that makes you crave all kinds of crazy foods is keeping your body from retaining fat! Now that’s reason to celebrate with a few hits, no?"
Medium.com,Life,Were LSD & Marijuana the Secret to Steve Jobs’ Billions?,Cannabis,https://medium.com/firsttoknow/were-lsd-marijuana-the-secret-to-steve-jobs-billions-222203d63a9d?source=topic_page---------148------------------1," It was after Steve Jobs lost his battle to cancer that the biography simply called Steve Jobs was released. The book was written after hours and hours of interviews with the legendary co-founder, former chairman, and former chief executive officer of Apple. Some people were shocked to learn some intimate details about the genius’s personal life, but especially about his recreational drug use. It was already shocking that Jobs had risen to such heights without a college degree (He quit school after six months and hoped everything “would be fine.”), but most people didn’t know about him dabbling in Eastern philosophy, veganism, not showering and using lots of mind-altering substances. Apparently, LSD was Steve Jobs’ drug of choice. In fact, he wanted little to do with anyone who didn’t experiment with the drug. During Apple’s early years, Jobs sought out rebellious applicants, not the usual technology geeks who actually answered the postings for jobs. When one uptight candidate came in for an interview, Jobs asked him, “Are you a virgin?” and “How many times have you taken LSD?” Not only did Jobs want to have colleagues who explored their own minds with psychedelics, but he also chalked up his own success to drugs. This has all come to light from past FBI files on Jobs, from the days when he needed government clearance to work on Pixar. In the clearance questionnaire, Jobs confessed: “Throughout that period of time [1972–1974] I used the LSD approximately ten to fifteen times,” Jobs said. “I would ingest the LSD on a sugar cube or in a hard form of gelatin. I would usually take the LSD when I was by myself. I have no words to explain the effect the LSD had on me, although, I can say it was a positive life changing experience for me and I am glad I went through that experience.” Jobs also smoked marijuana or hashish, or ate it cooked into chocolate brownies, once or twice a week between 1973 and 1977. For many people, these revelations won’t come as much of a surprise. Apparently, many brilliant people — often innovators — have used drugs to expand the boundaries of their minds. Bill Gates, another billionaire techy, also has a past with LSD. For some reason, our culture doesn’t equate genius with drug use, but Steve Jobs definitely is proof that the two are not always mutually exclusive."

Potential cannabis investors must understand how speculative this industry is. To put it bluntly, the world’s four largest economies still have not legalised cannabis for medicinal purposes only, at the federal level. No matter what people tell you, we are still early on in the game. As a result of the industry being so speculative, this, in turn, filters down to the individual companies themselves. There is still no certainty as to which companies will end up leading the pack, and which will simply wither and die (taking millions of shareholder’s dollars with them). If you’re reading this, then I am going to assume (what did they say about assumptions?) that you have some interest in cannabis stocks and are either waiting to pull the trigger and start investing, or have already started investing. I am then further going to assume (it’s getting worse) that you are concerned about investing in the cannabis industry because right now, as the markets are in decline. Cannabis stocks have a higher Beta than normal stocks. In layman’s terms, this means that when the stock market is going up, cannabis stocks will go up more than the market. But, if the market is going down, then (on average) cannabis stocks will fall even more. Right now, there is uncertainty in the market, and nothing hurts the market more and gets investors more frazzled than uncertainty. It starts with Donald. The whole US-China trade war uncertainty is really weighing heavily on all markets. An economic showdown between the US and China is good for no one, with the IMF warning that a full-blown trade war would significantly weaken the global economy. Staying with America, there is uncertainty regarding cannabis legislation and the continuing conflict between State and Federal law. Cannabis is still illegal at the federal level, even though it is now recreationally legal in 10 States and medicinally legal in 33 US States. The weed uncertainty for investors relates to revenue outlooks, supply constraints and quality issues that significantly impact a company’s ability to scale and generate operating leverage. With uncertainty comes a falling market, and this is what we have seen in the early part of this year’s second quarter. But one needs to take a slightly longer-term approach than one or two quarters (unless of course, you are actively trading). This is an industry that is set to grow at a compound annual growth rate of 15% for the coming 5–10 years. We agree that every research house you speak to has a different number and potential of what the market might be worth in 2028. Truth be told, none of them know. But it doesn’t matter if it’s going to be worth $20, $30 or even $50 billion by 2025, point is that given its at around $11 billion now, the US market is set for phenomenal growth in the coming years. In the medium to long term. We have always maintained an investment timeframe for the cannabis industry of at least 5–10 years. In other words, the medium to long term. We believe this to be a 10-year bull run for the cannabis industry (a bull run indicates that the markets are rising). We believe that over the next 10 years, there will be significant growth in the value of certain cannabis companies. That’s not to mean that there will be no declines. FAAAAAAR from it. As you can see from the Aurora Cannabis graph above, it has risen beautifully over the past couple of years. However, there have also been periods of great decline, and these give rise to opportunities. Recent volatility in cannabis stocks, with some falling in the past couple of weeks, may just present an ideal opportunity for investors looking to buy the dip. Buying the dip refers to purchasing a stock after it has declined in price. Some traders are buying the dip if a stock is in a long-term uptrend, which they hope will continue after the dip. While others may use the phrase when no uptrend is present, but they believe an uptrend may occur in the future. Therefore, they are buying when the price drops in order to profit from a potential future price rise. We believe the current market presents a fantastic opportunity for investors looking to take an initial market position and buy a few shares, or even dollar-average down their cost base, by buying this dip. “Investors will use “this downturn as a buying opportunity as most are convinced that this sector remains a second half 2019- 2020 story.” Cowen & Co.’s Andrew Stein says investors have been moderating their expectations, but it won’t impede longer-term gains. He highlights Tilray as an example, which has fallen more than 25% this year. Shares of the Canadian company have seen bullish trends recently as investors become more willing to add to their positions at a price near $50, per Barron’s. We certainly believe there to be more volatility ahead. The industry is still very much finding its feet and some steps forward are often met with a step or two backward. In October 2018, Canada became the first G-7 nation to legalise cannabis for recreational use at the federal level. However, the Canadian cannabis market has gotten off to a slow start and has disappointed everyone by posting sales that are well below investor expectations. In November 2018 Michigan became the 10th US State to legalise for recreational use. It was thought that this was going to be the driving for behind NY and NJ legalising, only for both to postpone it now. Cannabis stocks are likely to face more market choppiness due to regulatory concerns and other risks, but we have a 3–5-year view on this and are focused on the long-term growth opportunity of the booming cannabis industry. Simon Moore, in his Forbes article, said, “Just like Paul Samuelson’s joke about how economists predicted nine of the last five recessions, so the stock market tends to cry wolf frequently and dips are often temporary rather than heralding a new crisis. There’s always something to worry about in the markets, but real bear-market inducing problems for stocks come along less frequently than bouts of worry do.” We’re buying the dip."

hree years ago, I went batshit crazy. My ten-year struggle with chronic anxiety and depression came to a head when I quit my full-time job as a data analyst via email so I could stay home on my couch alternating between sobbing incoherently and watching all of Showtime’s Homeland (you can skip it). A few weeks later, I started hitting the pipe. Here are some of the ways becoming a full-time pothead made my mental health better (and worse.) When people think weed, they think munchies and therefore weight gain, but over time, the relationship between weed and appetite gets more complicated. In my case, I replaced one addiction with another —before pot, I’d been eating out of boredom and sadness. Now instead of devouring a frozen pizza or a blue box of Kraft at 10 PM, I smoked. On top of the dietary changes, I also had more energy. By forcing me to slow down, weed put me in touch with a prickly place I’d been avoiding for years: my own body. When I was stoned, my insides buzzed, and with the edges softened, I could feel how much restlessness I carried. It took me weeks to identify that tension in my chest as a need for exercise, maybe because I hadn’t intentionally broken a sweat since high school when chased by gym teachers. Rather than take a jog around the neighborhood, I smoked myself up and hired a personal trainer. Never has there been a less informed decision made: I hired the very first woman who showed up in Google’s search results. Later that evening, I signed a legally binding contract with her for one year. I’m not rich — I can’t afford an in-home personal trainer, but stoned Sherry is suggestible and didn’t hesitate to hand over my credit card(s). On the bright side, my anxiety is down from all the exercise, plus the years of indentured servitude I’ll be doing to pay back the money I borrowed is bound to burn off some bonus fat. So while my clothes fit better, I can’t remember where I put them. Here’s a conversation I’ve had more than once: Friend: “Wanna watch Deadpool 2?”
Me: “No, never seen the first one.”
Them: “We watched it together…”
Me: “When?”
Them: “Like not even a year ago.”
Me: “Oh. Did I like it?” Before I became a pothead, I had a great memory. Laying in bed at night, I could bring back in full-color detail a stream of all the embarrassing things I’d said since I learned to talk. I also had a knack for recalling dates — in addition to their birthday, I could tell you what date a friend lost their virginity. That shit’s gone now — dear friends, unless your birthday is also a holiday, I don’t remember when you were born, so please stop hiding it on Facebook to trick me. Maybe it’s not just a result of the weed but also of getting older — unlike when I was sixteen, I no longer have room for unlimited capacities of bullshit in my brain. That space is now being used to store Excel formulas and that one really long password that lets me see all my other passwords. Or, maybe the pot is eating a hole right through the center of my memories like a rat chewing its way through a shelf of books. Either way, I’m not depressed anymore, mostly because I forgot to be. I grew up in a house where dreams were as likely to come true as Shrek. Mom encouraged me not to hope too much for anything, probably because she’d grown up with dirt floors and was so fragile she couldn’t watch one more person in Appalachia try at something and fail. When asked as a 9-year-old what I wanted to be when I grew up, I said I wanted to be a secretary. I watched a lot of Bewitched back then and had come to the conclusion that if I wasn’t going to develop magical powers like Samantha, secretary work would offer the job security that I, as a 9-year-old, really needed. Then I woke up high in California and noticed that I was almost 30, that I hated fluorescent lights, and that the constant polite conversation generated by our open office floor plan was enough to make anyone go mad. I noticed office work is a trap you enter when you’re young — the cheese is a 401k, and the trap is coming out the other side gray and too tired to do your own work. I noticed that I liked to write but had never taken it seriously because of my childhood conviction that artists don’t make nearly as much money as say, the lavish lifestyle of the modern secretary. I noticed I was packing bowls and settling in to write, and once I’d smoked enough to think it was funny, I started sending the shit out. I still have a day job, fluorescent lights included, but I also have peace of mind that now I’m doing what I’m supposed to be doing. I’m more absent-minded, but overall, I’m healthier in both body and spirit. Case closed, cannabis wins, right? Sort of. There’s also this terrible, disgusting cough I have now. I don’t even mind the occasional mucus — it’s the looks I get from strangers on the train like they think I’m an obnoxious improv actor who’s been paid to perform an especially noisy cough. Sitting on the couch during one of my fits, friends roll their eyes and ask me, “ARE YOU OKAY.” in a way that makes me think they’re not actually concerned for my well-being. “Why don’t you try edibles instead?” my boyfriend shouts once a week, huddled against the other end of our sofa with his hands cupped over his ears. Because I’d miss the motion, hand to mouth, of vaping. That’s not what I say. Instead, I tell him again how edibles aren’t as reliable in their dosage as inhaling flower or concentrate; once, when I was home alone, I ate half a KIVA bar and got so high I couldn’t process language anymore. I kept turning up the television thinking that if I could just make their voices louder, I could understand what they were saying. I fell asleep certain I was having a stroke. I don’t know if you lucky alcoholics with your $5.99 bottles of Boone’s Farm know this, but legal marijuana is criminally expensive, thanks to a tax of 37% here in Oakland, CA. Other counties tax up to 45%. It would be easy to cite the taxes that came with recreational legalization as the only reason my monthly weed expense has been going up and to the left, but there’s also the issue of tolerance. This is a drug, and as such, it takes more and more to do the same thing. Most people take tolerance breaks (quitting weed for a short amount of time to reset their cannabinoid system) to mitigate this effect, but all of mine have failed. To medical professionals and anyone familiar with addiction, this signals a big problem. “What does it do for you that you can’t go a single day without it?” one doctor asked me. “It takes the edge off…everything.” He looked me in the eyes in a meaningful way, like, Do you hear yourself? At the same time, this doctor praised all the other changes marijuana had brought into my life including big changes like the daily exercise and smaller changes like the marked increase in my daily hydration. I used to drink six to eight Diet Cokes every single day. Drinking water never occurred to me — if I was thirsty, I thought the beverage had to have fizz and flavor (and no, that fruity shit La Croix doesn’t count — if you’ve ever offered me one and I said, “Thank you,” I was lying.) Then I got a good case of cotton mouth for the first time. There isn’t enough Diet Coke in the world to quench it — I could’ve gone through a whole case. Instead, I drank a bottle of water and then two more. Now I drink between 64–100 ounces every day. I’m less anxious, and not just because my skin cleared up and I shit more regularly — apparently dehydration could have also been contributing to my mental health issues. A
fter a few months on the couch, I got a new job. I sought out other forms of treatment like talk therapy. I’m a more productive member of society now than I’ve ever been, but I still can’t say for sure pot is only a positive force in my life. I forget things, have trouble focusing, have an extra expense to worry about, and I cough like I think my lungs would look better on the outside than where they are now. But until something else happens, say I start spewing vomit as though possessed (called cannabis-induced hyperemesis), I don’t expect I’ll change anytime soon. I’m happier because I wake up every day knowing I’m taking steps toward the person I want to be, even if right now I have to use a crutch to hobble there. *Originally, this post cited HBO as Homeland’s network, but when I stopped coughing, a friend reminded me it’s actually Showtime.

Medium.com,Life,Can CBD Soothe The Pain Of A Toothache?,Cannabis,https://medium.com/nordicoil/can-cbd-soothe-the-pain-of-a-toothache-2f4a1a4ec0c5?source=topic_page---------152------------------1," If you haven’t, why not? It’s widely known that THC and CBD have anti-inflammatory, and bone-stimulating properties which can help with severe conditions such as arthritis, why not use it for dental pain and swelling? So, should you consider trying CBD oil the next time you get a toothache? Let’s look at some of the causes of tooth pain, and how CBD can help combat it. There can be many reasons for a toothache, but most of the time, the cause of a toothache is an infection. Bacteria buildup on the teeth and gums eventually spread to the nerves and blood vessels located on the inner part the teeth. Infrequent brushing and poor hygeine helps bacteria thrive. Whatever the cause of pain might be, it is always recommended to visit a medical professional if you have a long-lasting or a severe toothache. Moreover, a professional check-up and cleaning every 6 months or 1 year is always advisable as a method of prevention for any dental disease. Since there still isn’t enough research into the use of CBD in dentistry, the benefits have not been investigated throughly. As it is difficult to dose CBD, the results are inconsistent. Some patients find pain relief from their toothache with CBD oil, and some do not. Those who consume cannabis know about cottonmouth. It’s a common symptom that happens whether you are consuming marijuana with THC or hemp with CBD. Cottonmouth just simply means dry mouth. Typically after consuming cannabis people may feel that their mouth becomes dry and they feel thirsty. It’s important to remember that when recovering from any dental surgery, saliva is important. It contains antibacterial compounds that keep bacterial growth in check. Saliva also contains enzymes and proteins essential to tooth and gum health. This is the reason it is important to be careful when using CBD oil to treat a toothache. Like THC, it also causes dry mouth. You just need to drink plenty of water and stay hydrated. You can also chew gum if you feel your mouth is getting dry to stimulate saliva production. Dry mouth due to CBD oil treatment goes away after some time. Dry mouth will happen less often when your body adjusts to the presence of CBD. Plain & Simple: DO NOT Smoke Cannabis After Tooth Extraction Your dentist will warn you not to smoke after tooth extraction because smoking may cause dry socket. What is a dry socket? After removing one of the permanent teeth, a blood clot forms where it was removed. This clot of blood is important for healing, as it protects the bone and nerve endings. When you smoke, the sucking motion causes pressure on your gums. This pressure is enough to damage the blood clot and a dry hole is formed. If the blood clot is removed, dissolved, or not completely formed, the nerve endings and bone become prone to infection. This condition is accompanied by severe pain in the oral cavity and in the face and requires immediate attention from the dentist. How Long Should You Wait Before Smoking Cannabis After Wisdom Tooth Extraction? People often ask : “How soon can I smoke cannabis after tooth extraction?” After your tooth has been removed, you should give up smoking for a period of two days to 1 week. If you really need to smoke, try to wait for 2 days but a 7 day period would be optimal to ensure that the wound has completely healed. If you really need your fix of THC or CBD it is better for you to use edibles while the wound is healing. Dry socket can be far worse than you think. It is worth waiting for the healing process to finish before smoking cannabis again. Do you have any experience consuming cannabis after a tooth extraction? Do you use CBD oil to manage dental pain?

Medium.com,Life,Can I Take CBD Oil Products Before Driving — Is it Safe?,Cannabis,https://medium.com/@devincole2112/can-i-take-cbd-oil-products-before-driving-is-it-safe-f016baf003ed?source=topic_page---------153------------------1," Ever since scientists found out the amazing medical properties of CBD, more and more people are slowly turning towards it. After it, it has been proven to help people in a lot of their health issues like reducing stress, managing their blood pressure, etc. Moreover, people can even use it to treat the health conditions of their pets. One example is dog separation anxiety. One of the fascinating things about CBD is that people can use it in multiple ways. It comes in the form of gummy bears for children. It comes in the form of vape for adults and the form of capsules for senior citizens. Some people have even started using it in their daily lives, considering they can add it to their regular food routines such as adding it in their favorite salad or taking it with their morning coffee. Keeping all the benefits of consuming CBD at one side, there are some things that people might be skeptical about when it comes to CBD. Especially true for people who use CBD daily. And that thing is CBD and driving. A lot of people ask ‘can you drive on CBD? Well, if you also happen to ask yourself this question quite a lot these days, then this article will help you in getting the answer to that question. Let’s dig in: I wouldn’t be writing this article if CBD weren’t legal. Different countries have different rules regarding the legality; for example, in European countries, CBD is only permissible if it contains THC content equal to or less than 0.2%. When it comes to the U.S., CBD is permitted as long as it contains THC content equal to or less than You should not worry about this considering most of the CBD products that medical dispensaries sell have THC content which abides by the law. If you don’t know already, THC is the psychoactive compound which can get people high. CBD does not contain it. Even if it does, the amount is negligible which is precisely the reason why doctors and scientists have started working on it. Since CBD is a compound that people have just started using for treating different medical conditions, they aren’t well-educated on the topic, which is why people confuse CBD and driving. Since CBD and THC both are extracted from hemp, people confuse one with the other. That is why they start questioning whether CBD would make them high if they start driving after consuming it. As we have already established what the difference between CBD, THC, and hemp is, let’s move on to the answer that most people came here to look for. The answer is: Yes. You can absolutely drive on CBD. And the reason behind this is that CBD reacts with two receptors, CB1 and CB2, which are in the endocannabinoid system. These receptors are responsible for helping human beings do a lot of functions including managing pain and regulating appetite. So when people consume CBD, it directly interacts with these two receptors. In a way, it helps the receptors do their job smoothly. Consuming CBD will alter your mood, but not in an intoxicating way. Your functions will not cease to work once you consume CBD. One thing, however, should be noted here and that is that some people might feel some side effects after consuming CBD. Though those side effects aren’t severe, such as lightheadedness, driving is not recommended if you are experiencing any side effect. So the best way to make sure you don’t experience is that you go low with the dosage of CBD. After some time, if your doctor asks you to increase the dose, you can do it. Different people have different limitations. It is best that you consult with your doctor and then start on a dosage since he will know better about your medical history. Even though it is entirely safe to drive while you have consumed CBD, it is better that you follow a few tips which will help you even more in being a competent driver while using CBD: Know what’s best for you: a person himself knows better about him than anyone else. So, at any point when you are driving, you feel like your head is feeling light, you should stop and pull over the car. It could be anything, but since it is a side effect of CBD, it is better that you take care of it first. Take it with you if traffic stresses you out: there are a lot of people who can get easily stressed when they are waiting in traffic. This cannot be a good thing considering you are driving. So it is better that you take CBD with you when you are going somewhere. Since it comes in a lot of forms, this shouldn’t be a problem. Tolerance: if you see someone consuming a lot of CBD during a day, don’t think that maybe you deserve a higher dosage as well. It works differently in different people. Perhaps that person’s body requires him to consume a lot of it while yours don’t. Yes, it can be pretty confusing sometimes to differentiate CBD from THC. But when you try to think about it, the differences are quite striking. Though both of them are extracted from the same plant hemp, that’s about the only similarity they have. THC is a psychoactive compound that can get people high. CBD does not have that compound. That is precisely why it is safe to drive if you have taken CBD. There might be some side effects of consuming CBD that you need to know. Though it isn’t severe, driving is a task that requires all your attention and concentration. So it is better that you try and find out what dosage would be enough for you not to experience that side effect. Always remember that if you are new to CBD, go easy with the dosage and work with your doctor."

he night sky glowed a dark blue, the shallow stars shining through the light pollution like a thousand stars strewn across a dark blanket. We sat on the strip of concrete just outside the fence of my backyard, watching the moonlight reflect on the water before us. Lily had a glass pipe in one hand and a ziplock sandwich bag in the other, both brought expressly for this purpose. The dark feeling lurked behind my chest and my stomach knocked around like it was filled with buzzing insects. We were mostly quiet as she broke up the nugs of weed and packed them into the small purple pipe. The air buzzed with insects and every so often we slapped at mosquitoes that nipped at our skin, hoping to suck our blood. I’d run around this lake so many times, having adventures with the neighborhood kids and chasing after my dogs, that it felt strangely blasphemous to be here, smoking weed for the first time. I coughed on the first hit. As we passed the pipe between us, pulling the smoke into our lungs, the world gradually started to feel fuzzier, its edges softened by the relaxation that floated through me. I don’t remember what I said, but I began to talk and didn’t stop for half an hour, all of the emotions normally bundled and packed so tightly away in my brain now spread out inside of my consciousness. Connections danced and leapt between neurons and I laughed and smiled like nothing in my life had ever been wrong, understanding that it all made sense, even if I couldn’t make sense of it. I had never known that life could be so blissful, even if it was just for a few hours with my best friend, sitting in the humid Florida night sharing stories."

Thanks to a constitutional guarantee to privacy Alaskan pot-smokers enjoyed a relatively lax legal environment for decades. In 2014 Alaskans voted in favor of full legalization for recreational and commercial marijuana. Since then the 49th State has been continuously and nigh-consistently breaking ground with its marijuana policies. Marijuana’s trajectory in Alaska is not as linear as it may seem. The state does lean heavily conservative and the legalization vote was not an overwhelming victory. After legalization the political path for pot was largely left to local communities to decide; some rejected a marijuana industry entirely and the votes were close in most of the cities and towns that ultimately chose to permit marijuana businesses. Alaska’s politicians are decidedly split in how the government should be treating marijuana and the businesses that sell it. It would seem that Alaska Governor Mike J. Dunleavy is no friend of the marijuana industry. His choice for a vacancy on the state Marijuana Control Board was a long-time and vocal anti-marijuana activist and was involved in a recent effort to ban marijuana businesses in Fairbanks. The state Legislature ultimately rejected the nominee but the fact that it was by only a single vote demonstrates that Alaska’s political attitude towards cannabis and cannabusiness are neatly bifurcated. The future of the Alaska Marijuana Control Board is itself uncertain. Governor Dunleavy recently abandoned plans to repeal the board this year but he has another three years in office. Whatever else may happen in the 2020 elections, there is a very slim chance of a solidly pro-marijuana legislature being voted in to rein in any attempts to eliminate the board. In the meantime, many of Alaska’s cities and towns are blazing trail with their moderate regulatory approaches for their marijuana industries. Fairbanks is now the first city in the country to allow on premises sale and consumption of marijuana. Anchorage seems sure to follow suit this month. The state continues to collect ever more tax revenue from the cannabis industry. The most recent tax collection report from the state Department of Revenue goes through the end of February and shows $12,308,997 in taxes so far this fiscal year, which ends June 30. This is approximately 10 percent more than in the same period of the previous year. Alaska’s budding marijuana industry still faces an uncertain political future but the entire nation is leaning closer and closer to legalization. Alaska may well end up providing a nonpartisan model for other states and the congress to follow. If you like the content you find in The Swamp please consider making a donation.

Medium.com,Life,She Shoulda Said No / Wild Weed (1949),Cannabis,https://medium.com/@solnikkar/she-should-said-no-wild-weed-1949-d4d3bd87abaf?source=topic_page---------160------------------1," On September 01, 1948, starlet Lila Leeds gained notoriety for being arrested together with Robert Mitchum on charges of marijuana possession. Following a trial on January 10, 1949, they served 60 days in jail. Mitchum’s career wasn’t hurt either by the scandal or by his sentence; Leeds’ miniscule career, however, was nearly over by the time she was offered the starring role in what became known as Wild Weed. Wild Weed was the first film of Franklin Productions, with Richard Kay producing. Kay, who later produced the added U.S. material for Godzilla (1954), gained much press coverage with an AP story dated April 15, 1949: Actress Lila Leeds, who co-starred in that famous marijuana melodrama, is in a hospital today suffering from shock, bruises and a broken right arm suffered in a collision of two expensive cars. The 21-year old blond actress is scheduled to begin work May 5 on a film titled “The Devil’s Weed” dealing with traffic in marijuana. (…) It did not take long for newspapers to start complaining: In the Daily Press from Newport News, Virginia) from April 19 1949, J. Shenton Lodge mentions the forthcoming film: It is already apparent (…), that the motives in Hollywood in this instance are more mercenary than moral, having already announced that the star of the production will be an actress recently released from jail after having served a sentence there on a narcotics change (…) a male companion served a like sentence. The ensuing publicity was nauseating, elevating as it did the convicted culprits to a place of almost hero-worship, and engineered by publicity agents of the accused (….) Something seems to have happened to our American culture that is not good. Somewhere along the way our morals have become muddled. Cut to a semi close-up of Kay in his office, gleefully rubbing his hands. Kay seems to have been either quite ambitious or quite naive, for on the same day filming was supposed to start, May 5, 1949, he submitted a screenplay of the film, then called Evil Weed, to the Breen Office. None too surprisingly, six days later Breen replied in the negative, pointing out that the “basic story is in violation of the Production Code”, namely: The illegal drug traffic must not be portrayed in such a way as to stimulate curiosity concerning the use of, or traffic in, such drugs; nor shall scenes be approved which show the effect of illegal drugs, or their effects, in detail. Meanwhile, according to a Pittsburg Post-Gazette article from April 27, 1949, Lila Leeds had decided not to do the film at all. She was to receive 2.500 US$ for shooting, but “her big money — $750 a week — was to have come from the P.A.’s she was to have made with the finished picture.” However, come May 23, 1949, a Courier-Journal (Louisville, Kentucky) article by Aline Mosby describes the film as already in the can, “shot in seven days on a budget the director prefers not to remember”. Leeds is quoted: “I helped with the script and told the writer what happens at a marijuana party and about jail regulations.” The article goes on to describe the shooting of the jail scene and the efforts of the press agent (“who, in true quickie style, was hired for only the last two days of the picture”): Miss Leeds started wild-eyed and flung her hands over her haggard face while the cameras ground away. She said the jail set was authentic. The scene had one take. “Such intensity she gives her scenes!” said the press agent. “It’s beyond acting. It’s like she’s living her life all over again. “The musical score will get the same treatment that Selznick gave ‘Spellbound,’” he added. “We’re trying to get the same composer, Miklos Rozsa. We want the film to have the ‘Spellbound’ feeling.” Director Sherman Scott, however, prefers it to have “’The Lost Week End’ [sic] of marijuana feeling.” “We really show her beat-up, no glamour,” he said. “Her kid brother commits suicide when he finds out she’s smoking marijuana, and that gets her. The drip of a faucet, the turn of a mop-wringer sound like ‘kid-killer… kid-killer…’” Alas, they didn’t get Rozsa (and I’d be surprised if they even approached him — his fee would probably have exceeded the budget for the whole film), but they did hire Samuel Hoffman and his theremin. The Daily News from New York, July 12, 1949, announced: Samuel Cummins of Eureka Productions says that movie with Leila Leeds is titled Wild Weed and that Bob Mitchum’s brother doesn’t appear in it. Cummins opines that the picture is not only entertaining but has constructive and educational value. (John Mitchum appeared in the other 1949 drug exploitation movie, The Devil’s Sleep, instead, playing a doctor and leaving no impression.) Wild Weed was originally released in July 1949, despite the Breen Office restating that it was “unable to issue you the Association’s certificate of approval” on July 20. Undaunted, Kay went on, though apparently without too much success. Even with it’s “star”, Lila Leeds, appearing on the stage along with it, the picture “Wild Weed”, which shows the evil of marijuana smoking, is laying a great big egg in Los Angeles. Lila gives a 5-minute talk at each showing — and will go on tour with this little epic to several cities.
(Wisconsin State Journal, September 14, 1949) On September 16, members of the Breen office met with Kay, Cummins and a Harry Rebnick “of Fox West Coast”. An internal memo stated: The burden of their request was that they must find some way of getting a certificate for this picture, otherwise they will not be able to get out from under the negative cost. They state that the picture is not sensational enough to play the Main Street theaters and houses of that type. They suggested that they had in mind making certain minor cuts in the picture, having to do largely with the actual smoking of the cigarettes, and wondered if this would remove the Code objection. I explained that the basic Code objection lay in the fact that it showed in detail the effects of drug addiction. These, they admitted, they could probably not delete from the picture. After some discussion they inquired as to the possibility of taking an appeal to the Board of Directors Indeed, Franklin Productions Inc. did appeal, but on November 4, after screening the picture on October 4, it was unanimously voted “to sustain the decision of the Production Code Administration in declining to issue certificate of approval”. Soon afterward, Kroger Babb’s Hallmark Production Inc. (in the business of producing and distributing “enlightening, educational, and entertaining motion pictures”, according to their letterhead) picked up the film. Hallmark didn’t care to bother with the MPAA, retitled the film to She Shoulda Said No! (it also ran as The Devil’s Weed) and presumably, made some changes. The ending has Lila Leeds delivering a long monologue in close-up. However, in the Hallmark version, Leeds’ voice is removed from the soundtrack: All we get is music and a long, superimposed text crawl behind which we can see Leeds talking desperately, but inaudibly — perhaps the film’s clumsiest moment. A prolonged battle with the Pennsylvania state censor ended in 1956 when the Pennsylvania Supreme Court, in “Hallmark Productions, Inc. v. Carroll”, ruled that the state’s censorship was unconstitutional. Cut to a semi close-up of Kroger Babb in his office, gleefully rubbing his hands. Hallmark continued to peddle She Shoulda Said No! for over 20 years; it was shown at least until 1971. The film sold well enough internationally. Foreign titles included Dem Rauschgift verfallen (Germany, 1952), Duivelsgif (Netherlands, 1952), Beyaz Zehir Kurbanlari (Turkey, 1952), Erva de Diablo (Brazil, 1953), Plaisirs Interdits (France, 1954), Djævelen skriver recept (Denmark, 1955) and Narkotikagangster (Sweden, 1956). The British Board of Film Censors gave it an “A” certificate; however, the London, Middlesex and Surrey County Councils banned the film. Meanwhile, Lila Leeds strutted her stuff. The Star-Gazette (Elmira, New York), December 03 1949, tells us that she had peddled a newspaper serial titled “Hollywood Exile” for $1.500, based on her experiences in the celluloid colony, from which she was exiled by the authorities. The story blasts practically everyone she knows in Hollywood except Robert Mitchum, whom she tags “a great guy”. Later, the serial — to be written by a ghostwriter — grew into a proposed book with the promising title “Sex, Marijuana and Me”. The Mercury (Pottstown, Pennsylvania), December 15, 1949, announced that “it will be illustrated with photos showing Lila in the company of such celluloid citizens as Sonny Tufts, Orson Welles and Steve Crane”. Alas, it was not to be, although Leeds’ further misadventures would make news from time to time. Her later history, with scenes of jail, prostitution and the finding of God, would make an exploitation film by itself. Wild Weed’s plot follows the traditional tropes of drug scare movies, but is happy to go the extra mile: After the requisite dire warnings (smoking dope becomes “an invitation to your own murder”) and a Breen-defying montage illustrating how dope cigarettes are passed (Aztec Tomato cans are a swell hiding place), the film introduces ruthless peddler Markey (Alan Baxter) and wastes no time in illustrating the eventual fate of his victims: A couple of youngsters drive out to lover’s lane, get all high and giggly, and end up in an efficient off-screen car accident. We only hear the crash while the camera focuses on a road sign “Drive Safely Today — And Drive Tomorrow”, and it’s to the director’s credit that this cost-saving device doesn’t reek of sheer desperation. In the emergency ward, a disheartened mother tries to pet her daughter, only to find that she has both her legs amputated; the scene fades out on the mother’s scream. After a short scene of cops discussing the case, we are introduced to dancer Anne Lester (Leeds), a good girl, which makes her all the more interesting for Markey. Fate takes its course. Dope makes people giggle, become uninhibited and freak out in scenes which are slightly more realistic than their equivalents in Reefer Madness. Still, a fantasy sequence has Rudolf Friml jr. in the role of a wannabe pianist who can’t even perform “Chopsticks”, imagining himself at the Hollywood Bowl. Anne’s brother kills himself, the cops close in and Anne is taken on the traditional cautionary horror tour to the morgue, the jail and the psychopathic ward. (“This girl was lucky. She committed suicide.”) There is actually a happy end. Nobody could reasonably expect Wild Weed to be anything more than another exploitation quickie, haphazardly put together outside the Hollywood system, the kind of film acted out by non-actors who, perhaps fortunately, were rarely given close-ups, and scripted only to allow some glimpses of barely-clad females. But despite ridiculous moments and dull spots, Wild Weed is actually a better film than such drug-scare oddities as Reefer Madness (1936) or The Devil’s Sleep (1949). It could be the best film directed by Sam Newfield (here working under his “Sherman Scott” alias). This may be small praise, but it is real praise — the film is better-made, and scarier, than, say, The Mad Monster and Dead Men Walk. Cheap and exploitative it is, but made with a sure hand, decent acting, workable dialogue and some stylish photography: It manages moments of sheer “B” eloquence, and if you’re used to the Sam Newfield of drab PRC fillers, you are in for a surprise. Lila Leeds may not have been a great actress, but she is still beyond average for this type of movie, as are reliables like Alan Baxter, Michael Whalen and, in a small role, Jack Elam. Screenwriter Richard H. Landau, a graduate of the Yale school of drama, spent most of his career writing less than illustrious fare like Pharao’s Curse (1957) and Voodoo Island (1957). The most prestigious film he was involved with was probably Back to Bataan (1945); he also adapted Nigel Kneale’s teleplay into the film version of The Quatermass Experiment (1955). By changing the original’s voice recording and flashback depicting the fate of the astronauts into the screening of a film taken with an onboard camera, he might have fathered the “found footage” sub-genre. The score, credited to Raoul Kraushaar, not a composer himself, is melodramatic but serviceable: It’s certainly less obtrusive than a Miklos Rozsa score would have been. Whoever wrote the actual score — there are a few moments which sound like the work of Mort Glickman (cf. Invaders from Mars, also credited to Kraushaar) — was decent enough to keep the theremin in check. I wish I knew more about d.p. Jack Greenhalgh, whose credits range from Reefer Madness to Robot Monster (1953), his last movie, with the occasional minor cult item in between (Tomorrow We Live (1942), Hitler’s Madman (1943), Fear in The Night (1947)). Just as Newfield rose above himself, Greenhalgh’s work for Wild Weed is much above average for the budget level (i.e. it looks like a well-made “B”). Just why everybody bothered to rise to this less than promising occasion is as praiseworthy as it is mysterious, unless you want this comment to end with a dope joke. No, better read some reviews: Chicago Tribune (by “Mae Tinee”): Clumsily directed, with an extremely ordinary cast, the film is definitely second rate. Variety: Scenes at reefer parties are different if nothing else, but even the so-called ‘tea’ adherents overact, but even the so-called “tea” adherents overact. Sherman Scott’s direction is generally very routine. (…) Jack Greenhalgh, who photographed, has some excellent camera effects but sometimes overdoes it with weird lens tricks. New York Times: Never did vice seem so devoid of enchantment. Los Angeles Times: A very sane, yet very absorbing story of drug addiction. Methods of both law enforcement agencies and purveyors of drugs — especially marijuana — are shown, without over-sentimentality and scenery-chewing dramatics on the one hand or preachiness on the other. (…) Some of the marijuana orgies are wild enough to satisfy the thrill seekers and the showing of dope addicts is dramatic; yet the sensational is not exploited at the expense of the truthful balance of the tale’s lesson. Sherman Scott has directed well, and the musical score by Raul Krauschauer [sic!] is effective. Showmen’s Trade Review: Tabloid material has been given a surprisingly good production and, until late in the proceedings, restrained direction by a small company, but sensationalism is finally allowed to enter in scenes of hopeless addicts that are much too strong for any audiences and may meet with some condemnation."

In comes CBD — the hangover cure you’ve been waiting for. Let’s get one thing straight, hangovers are best avoided by limiting your alcohol intake and best treated with sleep and hydration. When avoiding alcohol altogether is not an option, people often turn to a a cup of coffee or a cold shower. Coffee or a cold shower can make you feel a little better, however, adding CBD to the equation can make you feel like your normal self. Here are a few effects of CBD that make it the Ultimate Hangover Cure. By interacting with serotonin receptors in the brain, CBD alleviates both nausea and vomiting when taken in small doses. Cancer patients have went as far to say that CBD has been more effective in treating nausea and vomiting than prescribed pharmaceuticals. A promising new development may be the emergence of CBDA. Early studies of CBDA, the raw, acidic form of CBD, show that it may be an even more potent anti-vomiting treatment than both THC and CBD. If you wake up hungover and are lucky enough to not have feelings of nausea, you may still suffer from headache. This can make it hard to focus and generally difficult to go about your normal day. A 2017 study outlined that although there is no clinical evidence of CBD being used as a headache treatment, it has proven effective at treating similar conditions. As a result, the report concluded that CBD will likely emerge as potential treatment for headache sufferers. An important measure of good health is how your body reacts to oxidative stress. This natural process occurs at the cellular level and results in waste products known as free radicals. Your body’s response is to use antioxidants to stabilize free radicals. If there are too many free radicals and not enough antioxidants, the free radicals can do damage to your cells, protein, and DNA. This can lead to disease. Nutritionist Cassandra Barns explains antioxidants “help to counteract the high free radicals production that your liver will release to detoxify the alcohol intake.” After a night of drinking, your body needs to replenish vitamin and mineral loss. While blueberries and Vitamin C are popular sources of antioxidants, CBD is more powerful! But don’t just take my word for it. While not entirely known by the public, the government has known of its antioxidant properties since a patent was issued to the US Health and Human Services over 15 years ago. The patent states, “cannabinoids have been found to have antioxidant properties…in the treatment of neurodegenerative diseases, such as Alzheimer’s disease, Parkinson’s disease, HIV, and dementia”. I’m no stranger to the occasional hangover, but I struggled to find a reliable source for high-quality CBD products here in Philly. After doing some more exploring, I stumbled upon the city’s first CBD shop — Anthology Wellness. Since then, when it comes to hangovers, my personal favorite remedy is their nano tincture, the first product of its kind. While other CBD products can take up to hour to hit, you begin feeling the effects of this tincture almost immediately. It bypasses first pass metabolism and instead goes straight to your bloodstream. So next time you’re prepping for a big night, check them out to avoid a long ride on the struggle bus."

I’m not an everyday kind of smoker, more like a two-hit wonder. I tip my hat to those of you who can smoke every day and still get shit done. Therefore, I felt like an impostor walking through the cannabis tent at the Earth Day festival. With all sorts of knowledgeable vendors selling all sorts of THC and CBD products to all sorts of knowledgeable consumers, I felt a little out of place. I reluctantly followed my friend to a man with a clipboard, signing people up as potential candidates for a “cannabis study.” He asked my friend how often she smoked and seemed unimpressed when she reported that she partakes a few times a day. He then turned to me and asked me the same question, and I somewhat embarrassingly admitted that I only smoke maybe once or twice a month, if that. Assuming I wouldn’t even be considered for the study, I started to look around for the next appealing thing to check out at this sensory overload festival. However, he seemed much more interested in my answer than hers and continued to ask me questions. I saw him pencil in a star next to my name on his list. Apparently, I was the perfect candidate, because they called me the next day and asked me to be a part of the study. They were looking for healthy people who would already have THC in their system, but who didn’t have an outrageous tolerance built up. It suddenly made sense why most everyone in the cannabis tent that day was automatically ruled out."

Medium.com,Life,Is CBD Oil Legal In All 50 States? | In Which States is CBD Legal?,Cannabis,https://medium.com/@a420x247/is-cbd-oil-legal-in-all-50-states-in-which-states-is-cbd-legal-b99bb1b2ae8a?source=topic_page---------166------------------1," Cannabidiol, or CBD, is fast outshining tetrahydrocannabinol, or THC, in becoming the focal point of scientific attention. CBD, unlike THC, is one of the many non-psychoactive cannabinoids found in cannabis plants. It doesn’t make you stoned and CBD has a horde of medicinal qualities. Research proves CBD safe and unmistakably effective at treating a range of health conditions. Despite the fact that CBD does not impair mental function, it remains an illegal substance under federal marijuana laws. According to the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration, cannabis and all its cannabinoids are Schedule I drugs under the Controlled Substances Act of 1970. It’s considered a substance with no medical value and a high potential for abuse. It shares company with LSD and heroin. Science shows CBD safe. In fact, it proves cannabis plants essential medicine. Regardless of the evidence, until the federal government either decriminalizes marijuana or reclassifies it, CBD remains illegal. In 2018, an Indiana man faced jail time and a $1,000 for carrying CBD oil, which the state’s legislature legalized a month prior. Because of this, the court dismissed his case summarily. Not everyone is so lucky, however. CBD is only legal in those states that have legalized cannabis, whether for medicinal or recreational purposes, or both. At the national level and in states that have yet to join the fray, you can still face criminal charges and punitively indebting fines for being in possession of marijuana or any of its extracts. Media is abuzz about CBD. New studies, new discoveries, new therapeutic uses, and new medical properties are near-daily news. Pot advocates have been hailing this cannabinoid for its ability to fight anxiety, depression, seizures, muscular spasms, chronic pain, and a myriad of other issues. CBD is the latest “it” drug, what the Washington Post calls a “rapidly rising star for its capacity to deliver mental and physical benefits.” From insomnia to epileptic seizures, CBD is fast becoming the go-to solution for health. However, contrary to the underlying and subtle implication in much of these articles, CBD is not “legal in all 50 states.” If it were, why would people still be facing criminal charges just for having it in their possession? Why would law enforcement officers still be raiding shops that sell it? Why would any state legislature decide on its own to legalize CBD products? None of this would happen if it were legal. Many publications claim that, provided the CBD oil contains less than 0.3 percent THC, federal law classifies it as hemp, making it legal to both have and distribute. The 2014 Farm Bill is oft-cited evidence of the legality of hemp-derived CBD. However, the bill itself only very narrowly legalizes a set of growing activities for hemp. It remains hugely restrictive to just about everybody, even scientific researchers. It is possible to grow hemp legally, but only if you are growing it under a state pilot program or if you are cultivating it for scientific study. You can also grow legally under state law, specifically “in which such institution of higher education or state department of agriculture is located and such research occurs.” Certainly, some cultivators are operating under the Farm Bill and supplying a few CBD companies. However, considering how well stocked CBD products are, few come from research hemp. Furthermore, state marijuana laws differ greatly, especially on hemp and CBD. Colorado has a comprehensive industrial hemp program. It is also home to the first ever U.S.-bred certified hemp seed. Strangely, in Massachusetts, where you can grow pot at home, you still need a state license to grow hemp. One of the biggest breakthroughs that has come to CBD is the Farm Bill 2018. This essentially opened up CBD for nation wide legality. It’s still a gray area because cannabis itself is a schedule 1 but the Farm Bill for 2018 opened up hemp farming. This makes it legal as long as it contains 0.3% THC or less. Republican Senator Mitch McConnell was the one who announced the introduction of the Farm Bill 2018 which legalized industrial hemp nationally, at the federal level. Until that progress, the DEA insists that CBD is undoubtedly still illegal. A spokesperson for the agency warned that those violating federal drug law are at “risk of arrest and prosecution.” However, he did note that the agency was not after CBD offenders. In talking to an Indiana newspaper, Rusty Payne, DEA spokesperson, said, “It would not be an appropriate use of federal resources to go after a mother because her child has epileptic seizures and has found something that can help and has helped. Are they breaking the law? Yes, they are. Are we going to break her door down? Absolutely not. And I do not think she will be charged by any U.S. Attorney.” Public opinion is powerful. Experts predict that federal marijuana laws will change soon. CBD oil has been causing a lot of fuss in certain states lately, but nowhere else does it do this better than in Indiana. We are going to use Indiana as our analogy for the few other states because for one, Indiana is one of the most notorious and strictest states when it comes to anything cannabis related (even the cannabis oil for pets). You’re about to see this is the sole reason states are trying and failing to ban CBD. The biggest reason we are using Indiana as an example is because even they can’t succeed in banning a harmless medicine. Oh, and it makes for one hell of a story. In 2017, Indian lawmakers passed a house bill that allowed people to use cannabidiol, so what’s the problem? Well, a lot actually. Shortly after passing the law, police raids started cracking down on hundreds of thousands of hemp-based products even though they contained less than .03 THC. So what the hell is going on here? Well, it all has to do with THC or tetrahydrocannabinol. THC is a cannabinoid along with CBD, and there are a lot more like them — 100+. All cannabinoids in marijuana provide their own medical properties, as well they reinforce the medical properties of their buddies. THC is the only psychoactive cannabinoid — meaning this is the cannabinoid that gets you high, stoned, faded, etc. Take THC out of marijuana, and you’re left with a variety of the Cannabis sativa plant called industrial hemp, which is legal under the new U.S. Farm bill. So how could these raids legally happen — well, they most likely didn’t. The police in Indiana are being vague about it, but shortly after the raids starting occurring they abruptly stopped. When asked “Why?”, it was difficult to lock down an answer. The most common excuse was that the police didn’t understand that there wasn’t any THC in CBD oil products derived from hemp. When they learned they stop — though this carried little weight to shops who were already raided and lost thousands of dollars. However, an email obtained by the Indianapolis Star appears to paint a different picture. In the email, one police commander thought that the new law allowed them to confiscate CBD products if they weren’t being used to treat epilepsy. Why would he think this? Well besides defining CBD as legal once again in Indiana, the 2017 bill creates a registry for individuals that are suffering from treatment-resistant epilepsy. It calls for a registry of treatment-resistant epilepsy because this is such an important component of CBD’s medical properties. The problem with all this is that first, hemp is legal federally under the U.S. Farm bill. Second, in 2014 Indiana passed their own bill legalizing hemp for commercial use in the state. CBD has been legal in Indiana stores for years before these raids happened. Thankfully, for users of CBD oil and those that want to try it, the Indiana CBD fiasco should not be treated as a sign of things to come. For Indiana and a few other states such as Oklahoma, South Carolina, and Alabama, it only makes sense that they would try to conflate marijuana, cannabis, hemp and CBD oil. Hemp is a variety of the Cannabis sativa plant that has less than 0.03% THC making it non-psychoactive. Marijuana is the dried and cured flowers taken from a separate variety of Cannabis sativa that contains notable levels of THC and is psychoactive. Cannabis and words with “canna” in the name does not mean you get stoned. We desperately need to stop thinking that cannabis equals to getting high. Every organism with a vertebrate produces their own cannabinoids called endocannabinoids. They have cannabinoid receptors in their body that are only activated by cannabinoids in both ones our own brain produces and the ones found in plants. This endocannabinoid system plays a vital part in promoting homeostasis. Homeostasis is the process that an organism uses to maintain and stabilize all internal system such as the immune system, nervous system, and all organs. Without cannabinoids we couldn’t function properly. Our sleep patterns would be messed up, our metabolism would constantly be in a state of flux, inflammation would run wild, etc. To ban CBD oil because it has “canna” in the name would mean we need to ban one of the most important physiological systems every mammal has. It sounds ridiculous, but that’s one of the big reason not even Indiana can ban CBD oil. Indiana Shows Why CBD Oil is Safe and Legal to Use Even policymakers and officials in Indiana and the DEA can’t stop CBD oil. In late 2017, a spokesperson for the DEA said they would not arrest anyone and neither should the police, even if the CBD oil is derived from marijuana. This spokesperson, even went as far to say that he would do the same — use CBD oil — if he was a parent and his child needed CBD, and as such he doesn’t blame parents for seeking help. And he’s talking about CBD oil from marijuana, which is a Schedule 1 drug. Police raids have stopped despite Indiana’s Attorney General claims that CBD oil should be taken out of shops and nothing more has happened and most likely nothing will happen except for the sale of CBD oil in shops everywhere. CBD oil’s future in 2018 and on It’s safe to say the fight is over in 2018, CBD oil remained legal despite opponents best attempts in the past couple of years, and now CBD oil is more popular than ever and with a better understanding about how we can benefit from it. The DEA, in particular, is done fighting CBD oil and have recently commented that they have a bigger fish to fry, like the whole opioid epidemic that is taking thousands of lives every year. An opioid epidemic that CBD oil may just help fight. CBD oil has entered into the mainstream and looks to be the medicine that defines health at home — you can even now find cannabis oil for pets, which many pet owners are loving and finding it to be a huge help with medical bills, and promoting a long life.It looks like CBD oil is here to stay. Conclusion It would be a mistake to assume CBD legal in all 50 states. There is also the issue of HIA vs. DEA; a lawsuit filed by a hemp trade association that challenges the agency’s Schedule I classification of CBD. Earlier this year, federal judges at the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals listened to the case. It is clear that corporate attorneys have differing understandings of federal law than the DEA and other agencies do. Regardless of what you hear or read in publications today, just remember that despite its wide availability in some states, CBD oil is not legal in all of them. The law is in flux in many states and very murky, especially since it contradicts federal laws and is therefore open to many interpretations. Make sure CBD is legal in your state before you buy it and do not carry it across a state or national lines."
Medium.com,Life,MIT and Harvard secure $9 million donation designed to assess marijuana impact on health,Cannabis,https://medium.com/@jeffreyhill2/mit-and-harvard-secure-9-million-donation-designed-to-assess-marijuana-impact-on-health-91306771c9d0?source=topic_page---------167------------------1," The Broderick Fund for Phytocannabinoid Research, announced that a $9MM grant will be shared equally by Harvard Medical School and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. The goal: to determine how marijuana affects the brain and behavior. Charles R. “Bob” Broderick, an alumnus of both universities said “For generations we haven’t been able to study this thing for various sorts of societal reasons. That should end now, as well as the prohibitions that are falling around the world.” Sure, Broderick is an investor in the space through his family office UJI Capital, but his academic credentials and intuitive and analytic skills have gotten him where he is. Bob holds a Bachelor of Science and Master of Engineering in computer science from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, and a Master of Arts in East Asian studies from Harvard University. Although Broderick stands to profit if the studies find benefits from marijuana, the universities and the researchers said the donor will have no say in the work process or its results. They also pledged to publish their findings even if they find marijuana doesn’t help or causes harm. Initially Harvard balked at the gift, saying “they didn’t think they could do it”. But after quick reconsideration, a call from Harvard to UJI was made saying Harvard researchers, who already study brain chemicals, would be interested in examining marijuana’s effects. At Harvard, the $4.5 million gift establishes the Charles R. Broderick Phytocannabinoid Research Initiative, involving some 30 basic scientists and clinicians at the medical school and its affiliated hospitals Harvard is looking at studying the effects of marijuana on brain cell function and the connections between brain cells, testing purified ingredients on mice and rats. Researchers at Harvard have been studying natural brain chemicals known as endocannabinoids, which are involved in a variety of functions, including memory, appetite, and stress response. Harvard indicated “Marijuana has about 100 different cannabinoid compounds” which naturally interact with the Endocannabinoid system that all of us have within us. We understand very little about the specific effects of each of them on the nervous system,” said Bruce Bean, Harvard neurobiology professor and one of the project’s researchers. “This is exactly the type of research we need,” said Dr. Peter Grinspoon, a Massachusetts primary care doctor and board member of Doctors for Cannabis Regulation, a group promoting legalization and regulation of marijuana. Whether for or against marijuana, Grinspoon said, “Everybody wants more research.” Marijuana is legal throughout Canada and in 10 US states plus the District of Columbia, and an additional 23 states allow marijuana only for specified medical purposes. But the US government still classifies cannabis as a Class ! Drug: meaning “a dangerous drug with no medicinal value”, making research into its effects extremely difficult. Until recently researchers could work only with marijuana grown at a federal farm in Mississippi, whose plants are less potent than those purchased at dispensaries in states where the drug is legal. The researchers want to truly assess if THC tetrahydrocannabinol, the pshyco-active cannabidiol in marijuana improves cognitive function in people with schizophrenia. They are also looking at how THC as well as another key cannabidiol CBD — affect cognition alone and in combination. MIT indicated they are going to study Marijuana impact on Autism and Huntington’s disease, as well as how marijuana can impact attention and working memory. Of note: Both MIT and Harvard said they have policies in place, requiring that gifts come without strings attached and that researchers have control over their work and its publication. In many other countries, like Israel, and Canada, advanced analytics have brought substantial scientific data which clearly show the combination of Cannabinoids in the Marijuana plant, along with CBD, (also a Cannabinoid) can have significant impact on Epilepsy (the FDA approved GW Pharma’s Epidiolex in June, 2018) a single molecule/single Cannabinoid CBD only product). The research also shows significant impact on Autism, Anxiety, Depression, PTSD and increasingly the evidence in Israel points to major improvements in Colo-rectal Cancer, the #1 global Cancer Killer. Some people challenge Broderick’s motives as “self serving” after all he stands to benefit from positive results from these University studies. Ask yourself the question, what is wrong with spending money on improving Health Outcomes on some of the world’s most challenging disease states. The option is they buy more houses, boats, or planes, and who is that helping????? Of note, The Stanley Brothers built a company called CW Hemp (CWEB.CN), which is a Hemp extract rich in phytocannabinoids and is used to help support calm, focus, recovery from exercise-induced inflammation, and more. The firm is named after Charlotte Figi, who at the age of 3 was having 1–300 grand mal seizures a day due to a type of Epilepsy known as Dravet Syndrome. When they had tried all conventional solutions the Figi’s met the Stanley brothers, one of the state’s largest marijuana growers and dispensary owners. These six brothers were crossbreeding a strain of marijuana also high in CBD and low in THC. The brothers started the Realm of Caring (the ROC), a nonprofit organization that provides cannabis to adults and children suffering from a host of diseases, including epilepsy, cancer, multiple sclerosis and Parkinson’s, who cannot afford this treatment. “We give (cannabis) away for next to free,” Josh Stanley said. “The state won’t allow us to actually give it away, so we give it away for pennies really.” Charlotte gets a dose of the cannabis oil twice a day in her food. They found three to four milligrams of oil per pound of the girl’s body weight stopped the seizures. Charlotte, is thriving. Her seizures were reduced to two to three times per month, almost solely in her sleep. “I literally saw Charlotte’s brain making connections that hadn’t been made in years,” said Charlotte’s dad. “My thought now is, why were we the ones that had to go out and find this cure? This natural cure? How come a doctor didn’t know about this? How come they didn’t make me aware of this?” Well, perhaps the federal government maintaining the Class 1 status, which carries up to a 7 year prison sentence is one of the reasons.

So why are certain states opposed to flipping green? If you’re reading this, cannabis is not going to legalize itself. Cannabis reform is a quantitative battle. It takes an army of people who are passionate enough to incite this type of change. Change also consists of funding to advertise, execute events, facilitate informative meetings in safe spaces, provide travel, and print valuable resources. Before your next complaint or decision to take your next trip to a legal area for relief, here are four ways to advocate for cannabis reform: In summary, there is no better time than now to get involved with the political aspect of the cannabis space if you are unsatisfied. Even after legalization, support is needed to address how you can use and/or sell cannabis. It is imperative to be proactive and not inactive about the causes you care about the most. Are you willing to incite change?"

Medium.com,Life,Why I Started Using CBD,Cannabis,https://medium.com/@queenofhaiku/why-i-started-using-cbd-8565fb01f9b2?source=topic_page---------170------------------1," Those who know me well are aware that I have several chronic illnesses. Most of those illnesses cause pain, which can sometimes be unbearable. There is no cure for any of my chronic illnesses, and I don’t want to take opioids for pain relief. After doing some research, I determined that CBD oil was a good choice for me. Before I go any farther, a disclaimer: I am not a doctor. There is absolutely no way I could possibly predict whether or not CBD would be the right choice for you. I highly recommend that you speak with a medical professional before taking CBD. My purpose for writing this blog post is to share my own, personal, experiences with CBD. Your experience will vary from mine, primarily because it is extremely unlikely that you have all of the same chronic illnesses that I do. Reader’s Digest has an article that provides some information about it. CBD stands for cannabidiol. It is a type of cannabinoid, a family of molecules typically associated with marijuana. CBD is non-psychoactive and non-addictive. Reader’s Digest points out that CBD can come from either marijuana or hemp. (The kind I’m taking comes from hemp). CBD does not get people high. Tetrahydrocannibinol, also called THC, is the chemical in marijuana that gets people high. Hemp lacks that chemical. No one is getting high from CBD, no matter if they are consuming it from edibles, oil, or topical applications. The answer to that question depends on two things: where you live, and whether you are asking about marijuana or hemp. In the United States, federal law says that marijuana is classified as a Schedule I drug under the Controlled Substances Act. In short, this means that anyone in the United States who uses marijuana can run the risk of facing legal consequences for doing so. Some states, like Washington, Colorado and California, have passed ballot initiatives to legalize recreational marijuana. By 2019, more than 30 states have permitted some marijuana use (including for medical marijuana). The federal government, however, still considers marijuana to be illegal, no matter what state a person happens to be in while using or carrying it. One should never assume that they can safely use it without risking legal consequences for doing so. Hemp, on the other hand, is legal. Vox reported in December of 2018 that hemp was legalized when President Trump signed the Farm Bill into law. The Farm Bill contained a provision legalizing hemp, which is a species of cannabis that CBD can be extracted from. The thing to be aware of is that the Drug Enforcement Administration still classifies CBD as illegal (even though it is made from hemp and does not contain THC). The Food and Drug Administration says CBD companies must obtain approval from the FDA. In short, don’t be dumb. Figure out what the laws are regarding CBD where you live. Use your best judgement. Never assume that it is safe to bring pot or CBD with you while traveling from one state to another. Personally, I’m in a good place. California legalized recreational marijuana sales as of January 1, 2018, thanks to how the people of California voted on Proposition 64. The county I live in is, as I write this blog post, actively in the process of issuing permits to a small number of marijuana businesses. Those business are likely to have CBD — without any THC in it — alongside products that have marijuana. (Or, at least, I hope they will). There are a multitude of companies that sell products that contain CBD. My local CVS drug store has a display of topical creams and lotions that contain CBD — and I wasn’t expecting to see it in a big chain store. After doing some research, I decided that it would be best for me to obtain CBD oil. This was harder for me to track down than you might think because I have a ton of food allergies. Many CBD oils are taken sublingual, and include coconut oil (which I am allergic to). It took a while to find one that was allergy-friendly for me. The brand of CBD that I am using came from outside of California (but within the United States). The company is on Instagram, and I was able to ask them if this product contained coconut. I was assured that it does not, and that they use vegetable glycerine instead. The CBD oil I am taking was specifically designed for pain relief. The price of CBD oil can vary (as can the price of other CBD-containing products). You might want to shop around and compare prices. Personally, I’m very happy with what I’m using. I have four chronic illness. Three of them have no cure (and will get worse as time goes by). The other one is borderline anemia, and I’m hoping it will resolve itself after I am in menopause. My severe allergies (to so many things that I could fill a blog post just listing them) can be very painful, especially during Spring or Fall pollen season. There are days when it feels like I’ve been hit in the face with something really heavy and solid. While I do take over the counter allergy medications (and one prescription allergy medication), they don’t always take away the pain my allergies cause me. When the pollen count has been high for a seven or more days in a row — I am in constant pain that simply does not go away until after the pollen calms down. Accupuncture can help ease the pain for a little while — but it is not a cure. I have been diagnosed with rheumatoid arthritis, which can cause my joints to become stiff, sore, and at times very painful. I am taking some supplements that help reduce inflammation. But, there are many times when the weather is cold (or the air conditioning at the grocery store is up too high for me) and my joints start screaming. I’ve also been diagnosed with fibromyalgia. No one seems to have any idea what to do with this, and I’ve never heard anyone so much as mention the hope of a cure. I’ve stumped a specialist who honestly told me he wished he knew how to help me. Fibromyalgia causes muscle aches that can be extraordinarily painful. For me, this happens when I overdue things physically. Sometimes, that means I went outside for a short walk and my fibromyalgia didn’t want me to do that. Other times, stress (both physical and emotional) can result in horrible pain. When I started getting muscle spasms, that were so bad that I was screaming for my husband to bring me a heating pad, I knew I needed to find something that would reliably take away pain. CBD turned out to be the answer (for me). A few drops of CBD stopped the muscle spasms within a very short span of time. I was impressed by how effective it was! The first time I used it was after a really bad muscle spasm started. The pain immediately went away. I was left sweating and with my entire body shaking from the pain — even after the pain subsided. If I had no pain relief, I believe I would have eventually passed out from the pain. Obviously, I don’t want to have that horrifically painful experience happen over and over again without access to effective pain relief. Now, I take CBD at the first sign of pain. It has helped me to be able to have more time where I can be functional and do things like shop for groceries with my husband, do some cleaning at home, or work as a freelance writer. I’m able to get more restful sleep because I don’t wake up with muscle cramps in my legs if I take CBD before bedtime. Again, I am not a doctor, and your experience is very likely to vary from mine. Talk to your health practitioner(s) before taking CBD. I have absolutely no idea how it might affect you. One of the best things about CBD, in my opinion, is that it can reduce pain. This gives people like me an option that is much safer than opioids for pain relief. CBD is non-addictive; opioids are incredibly addictive and the United States has a opioid epidemic. For me, the choice was obvious."
Medium.com,Life,How you can Differentiate Between Hemp and Marijuana,Cannabis,https://medium.com/@devincole2112/how-you-can-differentiate-between-hemp-and-marijuana-dafbe2e7ff22?source=topic_page---------171------------------1," There are two kinds of people in the world: One who thinks that marijuana and hemp are the same things. The second who have lived their whole lives telling people both of them are entirely different. In any case, neither the former ones are alone, neither the latter ones. It is one of the most puzzling questions out there. The credit goes to the misinformation and ignorance surrounding both of them. Some people even go as far as to think that cannabis is the same as hemp and marijuana. That is not the case. All three are very different, and by the end of this article, you will be able to tell the difference between hemp and marijuana. Do keep in mind that this is a complicated topic to explain, but we will try to explain this in the most straightforward words possible. Let’s start To understand the difference between hemp and marijuana, we need to understand what Cannabis is first- considering industrial hemp and marijuana comes from the sub-family of plants of cannabis. Cannabis refers to a group of three plants. All three of them have psychoactive properties. They are Cannabis sativa, Cannabis indica, and Cannabis ruderalis. As cannabis is gaining popularity in the medical field, the name is continually evolving. Some call it the weed; some call it pot and some call it marijuana. People take cannabis for relaxing effects. In some states in the U.S., doctors prescribe it to help people with several medical issues. Cannabis includes 120 compounds. As knowing about each one of them is still a challenging thing to do, there are two of them that are most popular. They are CBD and THC. A lot of people would not be able to tell the difference between hemp and marijuana after looking at it. But if you ask an expert to tell the difference between the two, he will do it within seconds. First of all, the leaves of marijuana are broad. Its buds are dense, and it has a short and bushy appearance. Hemp, on the other hand, has thin leaves that are concentrated at the top. They grow taller and skinnier than marijuana — a few of its branches under its upper portion. One will be able to tell the difference clearly when they compare them side by side. Both are not only different when it comes to appearances, but also because of their chemical composition. The significant difference between both of their chemical composition is a compound called tetrahydrocannabinol, or THC, in short. The psychological effects that a person experiences after consuming marijuana, it is because of THC. On average, a batch of marijuana contains THC, which can be anywhere between 5 to 20%. Other premium marijuana can contain THC contents between 25–30%. When it comes to hemp, the maximum THC content it can contain is 0.3%. It is impossible for a person to get high after consuming hemp considering it won’t produce the psychoactive effects. It is precisely because of this that a lot of countries have deemed hemp legal for medicinal and recreational purposes. Hemp also contains CBD or cannabidiol. Consider it as an antagonist. It makes the effects of THC useless. One of the significant differences between hemp and marijuana is how people grow them, especially the environment. Farmers grow hemp very close to each other, sometimes the distance between them is only 4 inches. It is produced in large multi-acre plots. All climates suit it, and it can take up to 108–120 days to grow completely. Marijuana, on the other hand, requires a particular climate to grow. It needs a carefully managed, humid and warm atmosphere for right growth. If the environment is suitable, it can complete its growth in only 60–90 days. People grow both marijuana and hemp separately. If, for instance, someone is growing marijuana close to a hemp’s field, it could destroy the field of marijuana. Hemp’s pollen directly interacts with marijuana and thus, rendering it is psychoactive part diluted. Since marijuana has a higher percentage of THC, it is popular due to its psychoactive properties. It can be recreational or medicinal. People can smoke it, inhale it, ingest it and even inject it directly into their bodies. Sometimes, people extract THC from the plant, and it is then consumed in a variety of methods- in the form of vaporizers, capsules, edibles and more. The only reason scientists and doctors use hemp is for industrial purposes. People can use them to produce many crucial resources such as paper, clothing, building material, food products and more. And now, since the amazing medical properties of CBD have come out, it is also used to produce products that are THC-free. The most common way people are using hemp is for their wellbeing. There are a lot of benefits including nutritional and health that are associated with hemp, and they are: THC plays a vital role in not only how hemp and marijuana are used, but also in deciding whether the plants are legal or not. Different states or countries have different laws regarding usage, sales, transportation and how farmers cultivate it. It all depends on the THC. Across the United States, the only way for THC-containing hemp to be legal is if it contains 0.3% of THC. In other countries of the world, that limit is 0.2%. Since hemp contains very few amounts of THC, it is legal in most parts of the world, and even if it is not, the legal matters that come with it are negligible. The bottom line is- no, hemp and marijuana are not the same, but yes, both of them come from the But that is the only similarity they have. They are entirely different when it comes to how they appear, what their chemical composition is, how people use them and what type of atmosphere farmers grow them in. Hemp has a lot of benefits which includes providing enough nutrition to the body and other health benefits. Since more and more people are slowly turning towards it to treat medical conditions which require people to spend a lot of energy and money, hemp seems like a great alternative."
Medium.com,Life,One Good Night Does Not a Randomized Trial Make,Cannabis,https://medium.com/1-one-infinity/one-good-night-does-not-a-randomized-trial-make-6b2478f8c1e6?source=topic_page---------172------------------1," If you read my story about whether or not I should have hip replacement surgery, you’ll remember that my orthopedic surgeon suggested I delay surgery for as long as possible and deal with the chronic pain caused by bone grinding on bone with cannabis. I must confess that I didn’t take the suggestion too seriously. I’m not a marijuana user and to be honest, didn’t think Canada’s recent changes in legislation regarding good old Mary-Jane had much (anything) to do with me. However, I had come across information about CBD oil (which is made from the stalks and leaves of the marijuana plant, sometimes referred to in this context as ‘hemp’) when I was writing some blog posts for a client who was infusing CBD oil into a whole bunch of herbal products. Hemp-derived CBD oil doesn’t have any psychoactive properties but does contain certain active ingredients that seem to reduce inflammation and are said to be effective in chronic pain management. Having a science degree, I am all for double-blind studies, randomized trials, and large enough studies that results are actually meaningful. The problem is, there’s no way to patent the marijuana plant gene so large pharmaceutical companies aren’t highly motivated to fund studies when they can’t be guaranteed at least a certain period of time when they can sell products containing their proprietary chemicals. There are studies out there, but they are small, which is part of the reason why the whole CBD/medical marijuana industry has been slow to develop. Here in Canada, now that pot plant derivatives are legal, there’s a whole lot of interest in producing medicinals that take advantage of the healing properties of the big green herb. After my family doctor also advised me to investigate the cannabis option (I am deathly allergic to Aspirin, know all too well how toxic Tylenol can be, and have no interest in becoming an opioid statistic), so I took her advice and her referral and went to see a physician who works one day a week in a local cannabis clinic. That was a fascinating consultation during which said doc rolled his eyes at big pharma and provided a thoughtful and thorough initiation into the world of medical weed. [If you don’t have a handy physician who is up on all this stuff, there are lots of resources out there, including a publication right here on Medium: There is no need to smoke or vape the stuff (a good thing, or that would have been a deal-breaker) and, bonus, often no need to ingest any THC, the particular chemical derived from the flowers and seeds of the plant and which is responsible for the high sought after by recreational users. We consider you to be substance naive. “We consider you to be substance naive,” he informed me (basically, a neophyte when it comes to drug use). I’m also not a very big person, so he suggested we start with a tiny dose of CBD-only oil. A few drops under the tongue half an hour or so before bed and, “we’ll see how you do with that. If that isn’t effective, there are other options.” It turns out that various types of terpenes (the active ingredients in hemp/marijuana plants — THC, CBD, and various others) work synergistically, so sometimes the addition of a small amount of THC can greatly enhance the effect of the CBD. There seems to be a wide range of dosages and combinations to try — all of this is relatively new territory (see the issues with limited testing above). I expected to then go to a dispensary in some back alley somewhere and emerge with a vial in a brown paper bag. Instead, I walked into another room at the clinic, sat down with a consultant, and reviewed options online. In Canada, we are then referred to a producer who is responsible for filling the prescription. Once the order is placed, FedEx gets involved. I followed the requisite steps and day or two later, a package arrived at my front door. That was yesterday. It felt weirdly naughty to be dripping the potion under my tongue. Dutifully, I read all the instructions and cautions (in both official languages) and then, half an hour before bed, put the requisite number of drops under my tongue. I thought it would at least taste medicinal, but there was barely any taste at all. If anything, I detected a hint of something like pine… I didn’t dare swallow. I waited for my face to swell up, my tongue to go numb, to hear angels sing… Something more dramatic than what actually happened, which was nothing. Or, so I thought. There was no detectable response… except, within an hour, my hip didn’t hurt. At all. No ache. No discomfort. There was a blissful absence of pain. So much so, I drifted off into sleep without first having to toss and turn and maneuver a pillow under my knee and flip over and rearrange myself and moan and groan and fidget and sigh in the vague hope I might find a comfortable position. There was none of that. I was sound asleep before I could say, “Come to Mama, Mary-Jane!” I was vaguely aware of thinking, “Well, we’ll see what happens at 2 am,” as I drifted off. Typically, I have been waking up half a dozen times or more during the night, awakened by nagging aches and pains in my hip joint. Usually, it’s bad enough I have to get out of bed, have a drink of water, then crawl back into bed, at which point I go through the whole rearranging my limbs rigamarole all over again. Not last night. I slept like a baby, eight good hours of sleep. One quick bathroom break, but inspired by my bladder and an excessive amount of pre-bedtime water-drinking, not pain. I slipped back into bed and, more impressively, back into sleep. I woke this morning well rested (also unusual) and the pain stayed away until lunchtime at which point the dull ache returned and has been growing steadily more annoying ever since. What to make of this? Could this be a case of being highly suggestible? Intense wishful thinking? The placebo effect? I’m not the only one to wonder about this. Hayley MacMillen wrote about it in this story about CBD as a sleep aid: I don’t know. I am only one day into this whole micro-scale experiment. But I am certainly intrigued. It’s almost bedtime again and I’m quite game for round two. I’ll give this a try for a week and see how things are going and provide you with an update because in the absence of widespread clinical trials, if all we have to go on are case studies and anecdotal evidence, then it behooves me to add my tiny amount of data into the mix. Stay tuned!"
Medium.com,Life,Your 2019 Guide to Investing in Hemp,Cannabis,https://medium.com/@mark_48291/your-2019-guide-to-investing-in-hemp-45f49c3a4369?source=topic_page---------173------------------1," There is no doubt that 2019 is going to be one of the best years to invest in Hemp. With the passing of the Farm bill of 2018, the US legalised Hemp and with it, opened up a potential $22 billion market by 2022. We have long been believers in the potential size of the Hemp market which many analysts now believe could be even bigger than marijuana. So, without further ado, here are some of the best ways to play the hemp market Charlotte’s Web (CSE:CWEB) is the global market leader when it comes to hemp-derived Cannabinoid (CBD) products. The Colorado-based business was founded by the Stanley brothers. The 7 brothers (yup — big family) founded the business as a result of little Charlotte Fiji and her struggle with a very aggressive form of childhood epilepsy. The undisputed market leader in the US with over 14% of the market, Charlotte’s Web have developed unique and protectable IP in the form of various hemp strains that are used to treat a variety of conditions including insomnia, anxiety, stress and inflammation-related pain. The company, founded in 2012, became the largest every hempIPO in 2018 when they raised over $115 million at $7 per share. Since then the share has been a stellar performer, currently trading at over 3 times the IPO price. Their hemp products are made from IP protected strains and are whole-plant based, meaning that the entire plant is processed to produce proprietary extracts that include CBD and all related plant terpenes (flavours) that work together to create the entourage effect. From their humble beginnings offering only one hemp-derived product to market, the Stanley brothers now have over 150 different products offered in over 3,500 retails stores across the US. As if that were not impressive enough, the company also generate 60% of their revenue through their direct-to-consumer e-commerce channel. This means higher margins and control fo the end user. The result — Charlotte’s Web is one of the very few cannabis companies currently generating a profit. For the 9 months ending in September 2018, the company produced over $48 million in revenue (an increase of over 75% on the previous year) and generated a net profit of $16 million. Very few cannabis companies can boast this level of profitability. As the current market leaders, they show no sign of slowing down and relinquishing that title. With the passing of the Farm Bill of 2018 and the booming US demand for CBD wellness products, Charlotte’s Web is one of the best pot stocks to buy in 2019. Our second hemp stock worth investing in 2019 is CV Sciences (OTC:CVSI). Founded in 2010, this vertically integrated company cultivates, manufactures and distributes its CBD-wellness products across the entire US market. The company essentially operates two divisions. A pharmaceutical division and a hemp-derived CBD wellness division. Their pharmaceutical division focusses on the production of synthetic cannabis-focused on the treatment of smokeless tobacco. The drug — CVSI-007 — is still in the preclinical stage and hence is pretty far off from being commercialised. Although this division has much promise, this is not the reason investors should be excited about the company. The real reason is their consumer products division that supplied their PlusCBD wellness brand to the American market. The range covers a wide variety of channels including beauty, nutraceuticals, and vapes. Their reach is impressive and this is evident when investors consider their financial performance. As with Charlotte’s Web, CV Sciences are profitable and growing at hyperbolic speed. For the 9 months ending in September 2018, they reported revenue of $34 million (an increase of over 150% on the corresponding previous period) and generated a gross profit of $24 million. Phenomenally profitable, CV Sciences was the breakout stock of 2018. If there was one issue, it would be the fact that they are probably going to have to raise some capital in the coming months in order to continue to drive growth and expansion. However, to date, they have outperformed analyst’s expectations, and with a solid management team and market presence, and with a potential uplisting to the NASDAQ later this year, there is no doubt that this presents one of the best opportunities for people looking to invest in hemp in 2019. Elixinol (ASX:EXL) represented one of the best stocks to own in 2018, and without a doubt, should be on the best pot stocks to buy in 2019. The company operates three separate divisions covering the industrial hemp, dietary supplements, and emerging medicinal cannabis sector. Elixinol Global is its hemp-derived CBD wellness play. Hemp Foods Australia is their hemp food and seed play, and finally Nunyara, their Australian Medicinal Cannabis play. Elixinol US is their primary revenue driver and main business unit. The Colorado-based business operates as a vertically-integrated producer. They grow and cultivate their own hemp from their operations in Colorado and has contract growing agreements in Oregon and Kentucky. From there they manufacture and distribute their hemp-derived dietary products to the US market and another 40 countries (yeah — you read that right). The first to export oils to Japan and New Zealand, the company continues to grow and expand. And like their peers, the passing of the Farm Bill of 2018 radically increases the potential TAM. This is where the real value lies right now and should continue to drive expansion and performance throughout 2019. The other two divisions operate out of Australia. The Hemp Foods business sells hemp food products and seeds through both retail and wholesale channels. They are constantly bringing new products to market and recently launched a range of Hemp burgers which have quickly gained traction in the market and have encouraged the company to take the products to the US. Watch this space. And finally, their Australian Medicinal Cannabis division. A late-stage applicant with the Office for Drug Control (ODC), the company is all-in when it comes to medicinal cannabis and the potential for growth in the Australian market. The company recently changed the name from Elixinol Australia to Nunyara (a local word for healing) and purchased land for the construction of their medical cultivation facility. The Australian market is very nascent with only 3,500 registered medical patients. However, according to the latest report from Prohibition Partners, this number is set to explode and reach 450,000 by 2028. That’s hyperbolic growth if we’ve ever seen it. They also just acquired a 25% stake in PetReleaf, a hemp-derived CBD product targeted towards (yeah, you guessed it), the pet industry. Many companies are starting to pay attention to this growing industry and why not. Stats showed that in 2017, American spent $13 million on CBD for their pets. This number is expected to grow to $125 million by 2022. That’s serious growth (and that’s in the US alone). This is a hemp investment that offers investors the opportunity for gains over three operating divisions (make that four if we add Rufus and co. in) and if they all perform, this will be one of the best hemp stocks to buy in 2019. If you are considering investing in hemp in 2019, then the above three stocks offer the best potential for significant gains in 2019. The CBD market is booming and growing at over 25% year on year. Industrial hemp has over 25,000 commercial uses and when combined with the $22 billion market potential for CBD, hemp stocks look set to take off in 2019."

If we were in a retail class at any major US or global institution of learning and a student sheepishly asked “what do all these chains have in common?” The professor would say “well, they are all retailers, but beyond that virtually nothing”. After all the examples cut across: major Chain Drug (Walgreen’s, Rite Aid and CVS) Urban Outfitters is a Multi National Retail Lifestyle chain focusing on men’s and women’s fashion; Kiehl’s is a brilliantly positioned efficacious skin care specialty business; Barney’s (despite 2 bankruptcies or because of them) is a an American luxury department store; Albertson’s is the #3 Revenue US Supermarket Chain with $60 Billion in Sales in 2018; Brooklyn Fare, a lovely neighborhood store near Hudson Yards in NYC (with 3 Units in this small but successful chain); Whole Foods, needs no explanation; Willner Chemist in NYC calls themselves “the oldest and largest nutrition focused pharmacy in North America, featuring the broadest selection of supplements and nutraceuticals”. Let me end the suspense — They are all carrying CBD. If you are reading any of the 37 Blog Posts I have put out since Thanksgiving 2018 (that seems like a lifetime ago), you are versed in CBD. Or better yet, if you just walked outside, read a newspaper, listened to the news, walked into a dispensary, a drug store, a bodega, a convenience store, should I go on??? CBD is taking America and a good part of the global retail and DNVB (Digitally Native Vertical world by storm). On 11/27, I wrote my first blog post. I projected Cannabis/CBD would be the fastest growing category for the rest of our “career lifetime”. For those of you who have a sense for my age/energy I think I have a solid 20 good years to make stuff happen. (cleaned up for purposes of propriety). I have run a consulting company for 19 years, and built and operated companies for another 20. I have never made projections that have been more wrong in my entire career. In other environments, or at another time, that would have been costly to myself, my clients, or my companies — but not this time. Because this time, I projected a $22Billion business by 2022 for the combined CBD and THC category. The truth is it could be that number for each, not the combined number. More important, by 2025 you can likely add a “0” to this projection. $220 Billion. You are saying to yourself “your kidding me right?— Jeff, your not even close. Proof — Most of you have quantitative minds, otherwise you wouldn’t read my blog. Well, my freshman Calculus Teacher (yes, 44 years ago, I thought I was going to major in math)would say PROVE IT TO ME- HERE WE GO — In the mature recreational states of Colorado, Oregon and Washington: Cannabis of all kinds have disrupted Big Pharma by 19%. The total US translation of that is $280 Billion, Spirits (the fancy name for alcohol) disrupted by a similar %, as people use Cannabis not alcohol. That equates to another $80 billion. Skin care, (a la Kiehl’s) is next with an unlimited potential to raise the number skyward, beverages are just beginning, and we go on from there! Constellation Brands (makers of Corona and Modelo not to mention the rest of their very broad line of wine and spirits) invested $5billion in Canopy Growth (WEED:CN Toronto) and is selling in the $60 range with a $23billion market cap. Molson/Coors invested heavily Hexo NYSEMKT:HEXO another major LP (legal producer in Canada). Its been called the Green Rush, the latest Gold Rush, some have even called it the next Dot- Com Bust. All of those things may be true. Many will lose, but some will win, and win big!! Right in front of our eyes one of the winners for the next few years is american retail. brick and Mmortar, specialty, and DNVB focused brands. But cause now the tide is rising and “all boats float” NYCBD — A new Radio Show on WOR/Iheart Radio — If this discussion interests you: I am about to start a radio show/podcast on WOR radio in NYC, part of the Iheart Family of radio stations, 8 in NYC, and over 850 Nationally.

Medium.com,Life,Why this 4/20 could be the best one yet for cannabis enterprises,Cannabis,https://medium.com/leafbulb/why-this-4-20-could-be-the-best-one-yet-for-cannabis-enterprises-12af1a15624a?source=topic_page---------178------------------1," While some state-licensed cannabis companies have opened financial service accounts with local banks and credit unions, national banks refuse to do business with them because of restrictive federal financial laws. Thus, bank loans and credit lines from institutions like Chase and Wells Fargo, the financial lifeblood of most small businesses, are not available to legally-operating cannabis companies. This has forced many companies to operate as cash-only enterprises, which pay employees and vendors in cash, prevent customers from using credit or debit cards, and become attractive targets for criminal activity. However, that could all soon change. Last week, a U.S. House of Representatives subcommittee advanced a landmark bill to protect banks serving the cannabis industry. Introduced by Rep Ed Perlmutter (D-CO), the Secure and Fair Enforcement (SAFE) Banking Act would provide federal protection for financial institutions working with state-legal cannabis businesses. This is a tremendous step in the right direction because, currently, a federal banking regulator could punish a bank and its employees for doing business with these same cannabis enterprises. The subcommittee involved, the House Financial Services Committee voted resoundingly in favor of the bill (45 for vs. 15 against) and the full House of Representatives is expected to vote within weeks. According to the Chair of the U.S. House Rules Committee, James McGovern (D-MA), who wields substantial power in determining which bills go to the floor, the full House will most likely vote and pass the bill in the next few weeks. You read that right — Experts say we can expect a vote by 4/20! Regardless of where you stand on legalization, I think we can all agree that it is in the public interest to make banking available to cannabis businesses in states where it is legal — leveling the playing field and improving safety within the industry. This bill will also hold the industry accountable for providing equal opportunity to all demographics. Before voting on the bill, the subcommittee added an amendment that requires federal banking regulators to issue an annual report to Congress, which contains data on the availability of financial services to minority- and women-owned cannabis businesses as well as recommendations on how to expand those services. It’s not all blue dream though, the Republican-controlled Senate has yet to take up the issue. Some Republicans on the committee have voiced their opinion it was premature to address how banks can serve an industry the federal government still considers illegal. Before the bill can be signed into law by the President, it must pass both the House and the Senate. Still, the recent hearing represents the U.S. House of Representatives’ first ever hearing on the issue! As the cannabis industry continues along its growth trajectory, access to banking services is perhaps the most critical challenge facing operators, and this is a huge step in the right direction. So, let’s hope that history doesn’t repeat itself. Last time lawmakers attempted to address the cannabis banking problem was back in 2014. The measure failed to move through the Senate, but much has changed since 2014 and there are reasons to be optimistic: The bill’s champion, Rep Perlmutter said it best, “Today’s hearing is a big deal”! In summary, a brand new, multi-billion-dollar industry has risen up in a few short years, and yet, most federal financial institutions remain reluctant to work with cannabis businesses due to fears of violating federal money laundering laws. That fear has forced the majority of cannabis businesses to operate on a cash-only basis — creating massive security risks, logistical nightmares, and regulatory headaches for all parties involved. Hopefully the full House follows the subcommittee’s recommendation and resoundingly votes to provide federal protection for financial institutions that serve state-authorized marijuana We’ll see come 4/20."

Recreational cannabis is legal in 10 states, and medical cannabis is legal in 33 states in the U.S. Cannabis has come a long way in a short amount of time and is likely here to stay. More than 40 countries around the world have legalized cannabis in some capacity, even the strictest of places, such as Thailand and South Korea have legalized cannabis for medical use. Recreational cannabis has been legalized in two countries; Canada and Uruguay. It is predicted that by 2022, Canada will be generating as much as $6B in cannabis sales. An important point to note is that the legalization of cannabis is occurring through the legislative process. 2/3 Americans now favor legalization and Republicans and Senior Citizens, the two groups most opposed to legalization of cannabis have changed their viewpoints. The FDA has approved a cannabis derived drug. In June of 2018, GW Pharmaceuticals produced Epidiolex, a CBD based medicine to reduce and prevent seizures in children with epilepsy. It is currently the only FDA approved treatment for Dravet syndrome. Cannabis has even made it to Wall Street. More influential cannabis companies have moved to the NYSE. Check out the following: Canopy Growth: (NYSE:CGC), and Aurora Cannabis: (NYSE:ACB. Cannabis stocks are going the IPO route on major U.S. Exchanges and Canadian cannabis stocks are gaining access to traditional banking services. Due to the legalization across the country in Canada, banks now have the ability to offer basic banking services to cannabis companies. Cannabis sales are increasing more and more, but there is a lot more to do for the industry to realize its full potential. There are a number of potential use cases for blockchain across the cannabis industry. Blockchain use cases can be classified as potential solutions to current problems within an organization or industry. A use case is essentially a valid reason for utilizing blockchain technology. While the cannabis industry continues to expand and evolve, it is not without challenges. Recreational and medical cannabis products are facing more product scrutiny than the average product that goes to market, and while cannabis users aren’t questioning the safety of it, federal, and state and local legislations and the FDA have to be able to prove safety for cannabis to compete as a mainstream product in the marketplace. From provenance to tracking consumption, payments, growing methods, consumption results, blockchain has the potential to transform and serve the cannabis industry. Product provenance and illegal manufacturing Although cannabis is becoming legal globally, the black market still remains, and so does the issue of cannabis provenance. In mentioning provenance we are referring to where the cannabis is being sourced from. Where was it grown? What is in each strand? How was it transported to the dispensary? Where was it stored, what temperature? The list can get very long depending on what requirements need to be met. This also applied to cannabis consumption products such as vape pens. Consumers will want some sort of assurance that these products were manufactured and assembled appropriately. Product provenance is not a new concept or new to blockchain. The majority of blockchain use cases involve supply chain and product integrity. Simply, it is just a track and trace mechanism of a good. They key to product provenance is being able to trace from source to customer. If cannabis farmers, suppliers, distributors, dispensaries, etc. are willing to participate in a blockchain ecosystem, then this can be achieved. They key to any blockchain ecosystem is participation across the relevant and necessary parties. The solution has to benefit all parties and provide some incentive for participating. Due to the fact that the cannabis industry is so new, there is not much technology or infrastructure in place, so everybody involved has the potential to benefit. Blockchains inherently provide an immutable, distributed, database for participants to interact on. Each participant can input the information necessary to create an immutable chain of transactions that will make up the product provenance for cannabis. This will give consumers and regulators the peace of mind they are seeking when it comes to the integrity of the cannabis being consumed and sold in the market. Tracking use and consumption While cannabis is legal in many states and countries there are still regulations regarding purchase, use, and sale. These laws are very difficult to enforce. Many stores admit that they are not tracking sales in anyway. Aside from rules and regulations, it is important to track usage and consumption amongst cannabis users. Many users may walk in to a dispensary citing anxiety, trouble sleeping, stress, difficultly eating, etc. and a strand or type of cannabis may be suggested to them. As cannabis becomes more mainstream it would be helpful to know which strands are solving which problems, as well as the amount being consumed. Cannabis buyers can participate in the blockchain ecosystem as well with mobile friendly apps to track their purchases and consumption. Enabling taxation at the state and local level Regardless of, well, everything, there is going to be tax when purchasing cannabis legally. States have been generating billions of revenue for quite some time now, but how much exactly? Should they change? Where is the revenue going? Enabling a blockchain based ecosystem would solidify the sales and revenue numbers and create an immutable trail of sales and tax at the state level. This would be essential for audit purposes as well as determining sales tax. Revenues could also be passed back appropriately. Banking, payments, and digital currency By far the hottest topic when it comes to cannabis is the banking and payments that surround it. Those making money in the cannabis industry cannot just walk into Bank of America or any other commercial bank and open a business account. Proving where the funds originated from would never happen and federal and state laws have yet to find a middle ground. Current state has dispensary owners, farmers, and suppliers keeping large amounts of cash on hand and stored in their homes, safes, and where ever else they can render appropriate. As of late there have been several cannabis digital currencies that have come to market. The currency can be exchanged on various exchanges and platforms and can be liquified if needed. These exchanges and platforms are enabled by blockchain technology and allow all the participants in the ecosystem to facilitate payments to each other. Cannabis consumers can make payments via the digital currencies and as more users participate the value of the coins increase. Although, digital currencies come with their own sets of challenges, it is a viable alternative to keeping cash around until banks become more accepting of the cannabis revenues. Data transparency and analytics As of today, where can data on cannabis products, the industry, farmers, suppliers, etc., be found? Due to the differences between federal and state and local laws, some still view cannabis as illegal, leading to minimal information and statistics throughout the industry. Many businesses and companies are still prohibited to interact with the cannabis industry entirely. Lawyers, consultants, etc., would never be able to do a project with a cannabis company, as law would prohibit it. How can we share data and get access to the information we need? A blockchain enabled ecosystem would provide participants with valuable insights into the cannabis industry. From provenance, to consumption, to tracking, etc., this information would be readily available. Additionally, many blockchain based ecosystems provide detailed and personalized analytics into the participants. This gives insights into what each user is doing as well as what else is occurring the ecosystem. Whether it is product provenance, traceability, consumption, or record to report transactions a distributed database would transform the cannabis industry by providing transparency and integrity across an ecosystem."
Medium.com,Life,Current Legality Status and Future Of Cannabis Worldwide,Cannabis,https://medium.com/@devincole2112/current-legality-status-and-future-of-cannabis-worldwide-11ab0e2d3ba4?source=topic_page---------183------------------1," While no one can correctly predict the future (except by divine revelation from God), it shouldn’t stop us from trying, particularly when it pertains to Cannabis. Although we don’t have time machines or flying cars, technology has dramatically improved, impacting tremendously on human society, forcing it to rapidly adapt too many innovative ideas since the birth of the internet. But, instead of trying to predict where technology will take us, it would be better to consider where CBD legal status will take us in the nearest decades. Yes, we chose this because it has something to do with your health! Whether we like it or not, the green revolution ship has berthed, and medical/recreational cannabis has alighted from the deck into town. With cannabis assuming one or more concrete forms of legality in 29 states across the United States, we are obligated to ascertain what the general public perception of cannabis would be like in 2050, as many people are rushing in to be part of the opportunity and wealth the cannabis industry is providing. Some believe that in the next two to three decades, the views of many people regarding cannabis will change completely. The evidence of this anticipated change in perception is visible for everyone to see by looking at how much people’s ideology about cannabis changed between the periods of 1998–2018. Cannabis has witnessed sporadic legalization, not only in America but also across the globe. It now assumes a legal status for recreational or medical purposes. The huge profit the industry generates has aroused a lot of interest, with investors and users wanting to know what the legal status of cannabis and its industrial evolution would look like in the next 50 years. Besides, the effects of criminalization are still there for all to see. However, when you consider the two scenarios below, you can’t help but find it interesting to ponder what future are we walking into the marijuana industry? If you belong to the school of thought that says medical cannabis is nothing but a clever legal loophole that “crackheads” created to get high, know from henceforth that you’re dead wrong! Now, all plants consist of terpenes. However, when it comes to cannabis, there is a special subcategory of terpenes famously known as “ cannabinoids.” Cannabidiol or CBD, along with tetrahydrocannabinol or THC are the two most widely studied and discussed cannabinoid strains found in cannabis, each having their own medicinal properties. These cannabinoids (particularly with CBD) are remarkable for alleviating symptoms of seriously challenging health conditions like epilepsy and anxiety, which has prompted their popularity among users. While the legal status of marijuana is still a question in many quarters, there was satisfactory evidence that prompted the FDA to approve the use of Epidiolex, a drug by GW Pharma, which became the first cannabis-based pharmaceutical drug in the year, 2018. Living in a world where medical CBD’s non-intoxication properties are accepted en masse, it is not hard to see that many pharmaceutical giants like Merk & Co (MRK) and Novartis (NVS) would process it into medications and sell them-a trend that is already underway. Interested patients could easily pick them up at nearby pharmacies-a trend that is already happening with recent developments in federal laws that are carefully removing many obstacles to CBD legal status. In return, many dispensaries will find it challenging to stay in business because all-new licensing will become the norm to operate as a retail pharmacy. As federal laws continue to favor CBD, it wouldn’t be long before marijuana and whatever side effects it has will make its way to TV, online ads and print media. Moreover, it would become more evident that marijuana side effects are nothing compared to the death-causing, bleeding diarrhea associated with today’s allergy medications. With the cannabis industry estimated to hit $22 billion by 2020, expectations are on the high that the industry is set to experience significant growth in the future. Even if you take out the medical benefits, any drug like marijuana approve for recreational uses will always be a crowd favorite. Every smoker, tweaker, space cadet or vaper can testify of this fact. Thus, if medical usage is eliminated in favor of recreational usage, millions of people will start treating cannabis like alcohol. Now, guess what that means! It means that the likes of Goddady (GDDY) and Anheuser Busch would uneasily be competing with Gigantic Cannabis for the most intriguing Super Bowl84 ads . To put it bluntly, the tie-dye and tacky-pot leaves covered that characterized the 1970s hippie-culture will turn out to be unbelievably chic, as pot leaves cover concert venues, Las Vegas, NASCAR, Times Squares, and more. The use of cannabis by politicians and celebrities will almost become a qualification requirement, and cigar humidors, liquor cabinets and subzero marijuana focus storage would become like conjoined twins. So, regardless of whichever way you look at it to pick your cannabis future, the result will always favor cannabis. And if someone has been asking you a cannabis-related question like, “is CBD oil legal?” Just point him or her to the vast number of states that have legalized cannabis for medical or recreational purpose. As more and more people turn to cannabis usage, it’s only a matter of time that members of the political class will hijack it to score political points in campaign promises. By the time cannabis becomes a significant point in political discourse, considering how valuable it has been to so many people seeking alternative healthcare across the US and the world over, its legal status as an acceptable supplement would be cemented by legislation in the future. With the recent federal laws favoring CBD, the handwriting is already on the wall. It’s no longer a question of its CBD oil legal, or not. Instead, it’s about whether its legal status would be accepted based on the medicinal or recreational use since its growth is already certain-boldly written in the future. Apart from wars and natural disasters, the only reality that defines future success or death of any human-driven trend is people’s reaction. You cannot stop or change the course when people are on a tide heading for what they believe will better their health. CBD has attracted a lot of attention on the media for its anti-inflammatory and non-intoxicating properties. The fact that it is also much recommended by many physicians as a dependable supplement for people undergoing chemotherapy is also one of the many reasons millions of people have come to accept CBD legal status-a confirmation that its future is bright and beautiful."

Medium.com,Life,Why the VA Owes it to Veterans to Study Cannabis,Cannabis,https://medium.com/@jennifergumer/why-the-va-owes-it-to-veterans-to-study-cannabis-74d39757a8d4?source=topic_page---------185------------------1," It’s a sad but well-known fact that combat soldiers suffer disproportionality from Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD). As a result, all too many veterans find it difficult to re-establish happy, healthy, and peaceful lives upon returning from war. To add insult to injury, studies show that less than half of veterans receive the medical care they need. And, perhaps even more unfortunately, the majority of PTSD care that veterans do receive is not evidence based. Consequently, PTSD among veterans often goes un- or under-treated — a fact that significantly contributes to the outsized suicide rate among those that serve our nation. Some veterans suffering from PTSD, however, have reportedly found relief in cannabis. Yet, due to the Schedule 1 status of marijuana, health providers with Veteran Affairs (VA) cannot prescribe medical marijuana to patients. The VA’s website also (somewhat disdainfully) refers to cannabis use among veterans as “an issue of growing concern.” Given the barriers that federal illegality presents to cannabis research, there is limited evidence regarding the safety and efficacy of cannabis to treat PTSD. However, some veterans have found cannabis so effective at alleviating their PTSD that they’ve created an entire lobby focused on securing veteran access to medical cannabis. To validate such anecdotal evidence, the first study testing the safety and efficacy of cannabis to treat PTSD in veterans just completed; the results are forthcoming. While this study, which was sponsored by the non-profit organization the Multidisciplinary Association for Psychedelic Studies (MAPS), is a step in the right direction, the VA should conduct its own related research. In fact, there is a bill currently before Congress that would require the VA to do just that. For the following reasons, lawmakers are (arguably) ethically obliged to pass the VA Medical Cannabis Research Act. First, given that many veterans are known to use cannabis to help alleviate their PTSD symptoms, the government owes the men and women who have served our country the scientific evidence necessary to guide their cannabis use in a way that minimizes risks and maximizes benefits. For this reasons alone, the VA should explore cannabis as a potential treatment for PTSD. But wait, there’s more! The US government arguably has a general, ethical duty do everything possible to treat and heal veterans from the complications of war. Not only have these individuals risked their lives for our country, but they have put themselves in harm’s way pursuant to an ethically dubious recruitment process. Specifically, military enlistment forms fail to mention the mental health risks entailed in military service. There is also no evidence to suggest that these risks are disclosed at any other point during the recruitment process. It therefore seems that consent to military service is not truly informed. Perhaps if the related mental health risks were fully disclosed to recruits, they would be less likely to enlist. At the risk of casting unfounded aspersions, one might suspect that the military intentionally downplays or omits these risk from its recruitment pitch in order to pad its ranks. Combine this possibility with the fact that the military now accepts recruits with pre-existing mental health issues and you have a seriously suspect situation. The government therefore has a particularly acute obligation to do everything in its power to ensure that mental health issues among veterans are addressed. It is therefore incumbent on Congress to pass the VA Medical Cannabis Research Act to compel the VA to study the safety and efficacy of cannabis to treat PTSD. For the men and women who have risked their lives and mental health for our country, it seems like the least our government can do."
Medium.com,Life,Carl’s Jr. Tests Out New CBD Burger,Cannabis,https://medium.com/anavii-market/carls-jr-tests-out-new-cbd-burger-3e25f61220df?source=topic_page---------186------------------1," Carl’s Jr., one of America’s top fast food chains, is testing out a new burger on their menu. What makes this any different than every other burger on their menu? They are adding cannabis to the burger to join in on the CBD craze. Carl’s Jr. has partnered with Bluebird Botanicals, a Denver based CBD company, to bring their Rocky Mountain High Cheeseburger Delight burger to life. The burger will feature a special sauce that is infused with CBD, courtesy of Bluebird Botanicals. The company has been interested in providing customers with menu items that focus on growing interests on health, nutrition, and overall wellness. They believe CBD is the right fit for the occasion. While Carl’s Jr. doesn’t have any plans to make the CBD burger a regular item on their menu,, they are testing it out for just one day only — April 20th — to see how their customer base responds. Senior vice president of Carl Jr.’s marketing team Patty Trevino told CNN earlier this week that “(This) is something that feels right for the brand. We are all about innovation.” The CBD burger will be available at only one of their locations, and was inspired by the release of the Impossible Burger, a meatless alternative burger served earlier this year in January at select Burger King restaurants. The Carl’s Jr. team hopes that this experiment will potentially open new doors for their company and others to innovate within their menus. Currently CBD, a legal substance thanks to the 2018 Farm Bill, still has yet to be regulated in food and beverages. The FDA is set to meet in May for their first hearing about the issue. As customer groups grow younger, restaurants like Carl’s Jr. are looking for new ways to cater to young people’s interests. The CBD craze has just begun, and this may be the first big movement in food to bring CBD to the table."

Medium.com,Life,Cannabis & Pharmaceuticals: Following ThMoney,Cannabis,https://medium.com/@darbyhemp/cannabis-pharmaceuticals-following-thmoney-50df9769fbc2?source=topic_page---------189------------------1," Examine the fine line between Big Cannabis and the mainstream pharmaceutical world to get a better handle on how the situation is unfolding in America. Note: originally published on www.DarbyHemp.com. Preamble What you’re about to read changed my life and it might change yours as well. In the beginning, I was only looking to spread word concerning a recent survey showing medical cannabis users are either completely getting rid of their conventional ‘meds’ or using less. Then, suddenly, I found myself uncovering one of the most important rots of centralization eating away at America’s beating heart. Rest assured though, it’s not all bad news. American income disparity levels as we venture into the 2020s are largely unmatched in history. We’d surpassed the pre-1930’s era Depression back in 2015–2017 [1], if not anytime after the 2008 ‘Crash’ [re: controlled demolition] depending on your perspective. Year by year you can go back and browse financial headlines proclaiming things like, “Nearly Half of Workers Earn Less than $30,000” while the middle class disappears (around the world actually) and the upper echelons of society get unprecedentedly richer — funding evermore radical globalist and corporate agendas. It would seem at this point no matter what aspect of life a magnifying glass is put to, the same relative degrees of economic and political power concentrations exist: medical, our food supply, education, the service industry, agriculture, transportation, energy, mass media and entertainment, etc. While the cannabis community paints itself as a somewhat grassroots independent movement driven politically by ‘We The People’, since 2012 the mainstream industry has really become anything but. Recently some big establishment news being pushed in wake of the 2018 Farm Bill passage, ending federal hemp farming prohibition, yet again proclaims a good percentage of cannabis users are turning away from pharmaceuticals. “A new study by Daniel Kruger of the U-M Institute for Social Research found that 44 percent of medical cannabis users stopped taking a pharmaceutical drug, or used less of one, or both, in favor of cannabis.” [2] Social commentary around this news seems to indicate ‘Big Pharma’ is on the run and scared for its life; that the people are walking away and into the arms of recreational cannabis companies. I have two serious issues with this sentiment: To answer the second question I began following the money and looked at the three biggest companies in the ‘Marijuana’ cannabis sector along with their largest institutional investors. Why institutional investors? We’ll get to that momentarily…I assure you lol. Constellation Brands Inc. Funny how everything in life ties together, because Constellation Brands is in the news recently as well (Jan 4th, 2019), as the Canadian cannabis giant enters the cannabis-hemp industry here in America by building a massive farming and production center in southern New York. None other than U.S. Senate Minority Leader and Democratic Senator from New York Chuck Schumer himself held a briefing to celebrate the announcement [3]. Yes, the same Mr. Schumer who along with House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi, represent headline leadership of the so-called Democratic Party — both at the center of what would end up being one of the longest U.S. government shutdowns on record. Yes, in some ways it’s awesome this big corporation plans on investing upwards of $100-$150 million into their own hemp farming operation and create a few hundreds jobs in New York, but in reality, it’s the very same ‘system’ that’s seized control of America’s economy. Here, let’s keep digging. Aurora Cannabis Where in all of this do you find average everyday Americans benefiting — retail investors? Sure, they’re taking less pharmaceuticals, but it would seem the same financial elite system controls both sides — medical marijuana & conventional pharmaceuticals. Speaking of which, this third one is responsible for cannabis-based pharmaceuticals Epidiolex and Sativex, which is partially being used by the FDA to classify Cannabidiol, or CBD (both from hemp and psychoactive cannabis), as a ‘drug’ or ‘medicine’ — ongoing development. GW Pharmaceuticals Inc. Some other big institutional investors of note for GW Pharmaceuticals Inc. are Morgan Stanley, BlackRock Inc. Bank of America, Wells Fargo and Company, Deutsche Bank, et al. Starting to see a pattern? Now let’s compare this information to three of the biggest pharmaceutical companies in America with their corresponding major institutional shareholders. Merck & Co. Pfizer Inc. GlaxoSmithKline And this is where the story unravels. My trail started with cannabis and pharmaceutical companies, then naturally curiosity begged me to try other things to see if the same names kept coming up. Facebook Scotts Miracle-Gro Du Pont Monsanto Apple Activison Blizzard (Gaming) Amazon PVH Corporation (Clothing) It doesn’t seem to end folks. Until giving up, there are really only two exceptions I found after Googling (Vanguard, BlackRock, StateStreet, JP Morgan, et al.) around on everything I could think of outside the very few who aren’t yet gobbled up — private family companies like Cargill — who’ve kept the majority of all shares away from institutional investors and in the hands of their children and grandchildren, or foreign companies with their own sets of institutional investment giants consuming everything. That last company mentioned above, PVH Corporation, is another perfect example. That one brand actually designs, produces and distributes clothing for a vast amount of brands most consumers mistakenly think are separate from each other on the bottom line. Some of their own and licensed names include: Tommy Hilfiger, Calvin Klein, Van Heusen, Izod, Arrow and Eagle, Geoffrey Beene, Kenneth Cole, Sean John, Michael Kors, Chaps, DKNY, Nautica, Claiborne, and on, and on. Investigate each one of those corporations, and you’re also likely to see Vanguard, BlackRock, State Street Corp, banks, etc. Is the upcoming American hemp clothing industry going to be consumed by them as well? Will this corporate system seize the majority of profits from American hemp flower, fiber, seed, hurd, the tens of thousands of consumer products, along with biofuel? Will they take control of hemp CBD the way they seem to be seizing recreational cannabis? And what’s going on with these institutional investment funds, or Index Funds… here’s how things looked around the summer of 2017: “Institutions own about 78% of the market value of the U.S. broad-market Russell 3000 index, and 80% of the large-cap S&P 500 index. In dollars, that is about $21.7 trillion and $18 trillion, respectively. By comparison, institutions hold about 58% of the companies in the S&P Euro index. Of the 10 largest U.S. companies, institutions own between 70% and 85.8%.” [4] Whoa, these funds control as much money as the current U.S. Deficit of roughly $21 trillion? Hmm… Once you put three of them together, you’re talking about a GDP larger than 1st world nation-state economies. Let’s see what that looks like. Vanguard, BlackRock, and State Street. I’d never even heard of them before, had you? Apparently, well, here’s how one researcher put it in an article for The Conversation in April, 2017: “In a recently published paper, our CORPNET research project comprehensively mapped the ownership of the Big Three. We found that the Big Three, taken together, have become the largest shareholder in 40% of all publicly listed firms in the United States.” [5] They must be inching closer to 50% by now…sheesh, and it gets better: “In the S&P 500 — the benchmark index of America’s largest corporations — the situation is even more extreme. Together, the Big Three are the largest single shareholder in almost 90% of S&P 500 firms…the index in which most people invest.” All these shares translate into immense economic power over corporate America and voting rights along with them. In an early 2015 letter to 500 of their largest holdings (this includes basically everything in our lives), Vanguard CEO of the time F. William Mcnabb said, “In the past, some have mistakenly assumed that our predominantly passive management style suggests a passive attitude with respect to corporate governance. Nothing could be further from the truth.” [6] According to the authors of the piece for The Conversation, the Big Three coordinate this immense power through centralized corporate governance boards, and 90% of their votes revolve around corporate management (and/or against proposals from smaller-time shareholders). If you’ve ever wondered why the American world is almost entirely catering to corporate shareholders, now you know who’s increasingly at the center of it all. These firms hold huge stakes in just about everything at this point, and at such levels, when they call a company’s CEO, they listen! Do you think the average retail investor has this kind of sway, or you and I? No. Look at the state of the economy and everything that’s happened in regards to banks between 2008–2019, then you’ll see clearly who ‘the government’ really represents. Consider these words from a June 2018 article: “The largest owners of these banks are, almost uniformly, the same group of institutional investors. BlackRock is the largest owner of JPMorgan Chase, Citigroup and U.S. Bancorp, and the second largest owner of Bank of America, Wells Fargo, and PNC. Vanguard is the second largest owner of JPMorgan, Citigroup, and U.S. Bancorp, and the third largest owner of Bank of America, Wells Fargo, and PNC…the fraction of U.S. public firms held by institutional investors that simultaneously hold large blocks of other same-industry firms increased from less than 10% in 1980 to about 60% in 2010 and has continued to rise since.” [7] Honestly, I don’t know. Forget about anti-trust enforcement, reasonable regulations to protect common folks, or politicians doing anything anytime soon. However, when it comes to the emerging hemp-cannabis industries, and this includes CBD, textiles, clothing, energy, food, etc., it just takes a little awareness. As an example, one of the core companies at the forefront of the American Hemp CBD industry has and continues to be Charlotte’s Web Holdings, Inc, out of Colorado. They finally went public, but a tiny percentage of the company is held by institutional investors, while the general public — mostly retail investors — own over 80% [8]. There could be plenty of others like them if allowed to prosper. Look for employee-owned and managed cannabis companies. While these very words are being written in mid-2019, the hemp CBD industry is under threat from synthetic cannabinoids flooding the market. [9] Meaning synthetically made cannabinoids which don’t originate from the cannabis plant and are known to be dangerous to human health. Come on, it’s not rocket science, every single solitary aspect of human life has been or is being systematically degraded, eroded, and exploited for corporate gain. Does it really shock anyone to discover a good percentage of products claiming to provide ‘full spectrum’ cannabis extracts are lying, and using this corporate junk? What’s worse, is like pharmaceuticals, most of these synthetic cannabinoids are being produced overseas. As an example, and these findings echo others from research conducted since 2015, in the Nutra Ingredients USA article I just referenced, Flora Research Laboratories tested hemp CBD vape products — nine of the ten contained an ‘undisclosed synthetic cannabinoid’. Sigh…it gets to me sometimes, you know? If the people so choose, we can avoid over-centralization of American Hemp. Why should we? Because anything the corporate system currently mass produces with inorganic petro-chemical plastics, synthetic fibers, or wood can be made more sustainably with hemp; we can supply the nation with nutritious hemp seed-based food stuffs; rejuvenate family farming communities across the nation; we can revolutionize and decentralize the energy sectors and provide a clean non-intoxicating herbal medicine; we can use hemp industries to take back economic and political power through the soil in peace! It’s up to the people though, and where we place our support at the end of the day. Thanks for listening.

Medium.com,Life,The overpromise of pot in Oklahoma,Cannabis,https://medium.com/@FOTP/the-overpromise-of-pot-6de96daf3211?source=topic_page---------190------------------1," Last June, a few weeks before Oklahoma State Question 788 passed, which legalized medical marijuana, I was on KFAQ 1170 Talk Radio with Pat Campbell, discussing the benefits of the bill. I thought it was a no-brainer. A woman called in to say she was against passage, nonetheless, because she was afraid that it would open the floodgates in the state for recreational weed. I remember commenting, my sanctimony primed, that, even if she were right, so what? Did four college sophomores at Oklahoma State University getting high on their front porch of their Stillwater duplex (especially because they were probably already doing so) really derail the importance of a bill that would alleviate the suffering of so many. I feel now as I did then … I think. I’m not a fan of medical marijuana for several reasons. The main issue is the lack of proven medical efficacy. I know there are thousands of anecdotes from people whose pain or anorexia has been diminished by marijuana — and I’m genuinely glad for them. But I’d like to see better powered controlled trials of cannabis products head-to-head with accepted therapeutic agents. Having the FDA weigh in on marijuana’s safety and efficacy would also go a long way toward legitimizing pot’s medicinal use. That’s Dr. John Schumann from an article entitled No, I Won’t Prescribe You Pot. John is president of the University of Oklahoma-Tulsa, and the reason I’m using his first name is because he’s my doctor. I trust him with my life. Not that you have to — or even with your cannabis prescription (not that he’d write you one) — but his point about anecdotal evidence deserves attention. This from a study done by the Alberta College of Family Physicians: What little evidence exists is of poor quality and may not even be representative of the purposes for which medical marijuana is sought. There are significant gaps in information necessary to treat marijuana like other forms of medicine: Dosage standardization and overall quality control may not be in place. Overall effectiveness, contraindications, drug interactions, adverse events and long-terms risks when marijuana is used as medicine are not well understood. And here’s the conclusion from the study. If marijuana is to be treated as medicine, then it needs to meet the same standards of quality, effectiveness, and safety we would expect of any other prescription drug. That standard has not yet been met. Now, sure, part of the reason we don’t know the full effects of weed is because it’s been illegal for years, but this seems like an irresponsible way to make up for lost time. This from a study from the National Institutes of Health: In the context of increasing debates on the merits of medical and recreational cannabis policies, we need a corresponding increase in cannabis research. This from the National Cancer Institute: No ongoing clinical trials of Cannabis as a treatment for cancer in humans were identified in a PubMed search. The only published trial of any cannabinoid in patients with cancer is a small pilot study of intratumoral injection of delta-9-THC in patients with recurrent glioblastoma multiforme, which demonstrated no significant clinical benefit. There was always something of a linguistic bait and switch about the term medical marijuana in the first place, as if putting “medical” in front of “marijuana” gussies up the herb and allows it to sit at the adult table instead of on the laps of those four OSU sophomores on that Stillwater porch trying to get out the seeds. There was, and is, a healthy amount of paranoia, as well, that contends Big Pharma is threatened by the “grass-roots” movement of pot and that is why there is such resistance to medical weed — as if companies like GlaxoSmithKline fear two guys in a Head Shop stocking up on baggies. Or fear anything. SQ788 is the most liberal medical marijuana bill in the country, allowing Oklahoma physicians who sign up with the state to prescribe it (it’s really more a permission slip) to patients, who also have to sign up to receive it. Patient can get as much as is legally allowable — even, alas, for those conditions for which pot does nothing. While there’s good evidence that weed can help nausea during chemotherapy, the relief of some MS symptoms, and some aspects of epilepsy relief — and for the love of Bob Marley, when that’s the case, give these people all they need — there is scant evidence that weed is effective in treating ALS, cancer, Crohn’s disease, epilepsy, seizures, Hepatitis C, AIDS, or even irritable bowel syndrome. Here is this from Spectator Health about the benefits of THC, the main psychoactive ingredient in cannabis, as a front line cancer medicine. There is absolutely no evidence that cannabis has any curative impact on cancers, as organisations like Cancer Research UK and the National Cancer Institute point out. At best it’s cargo-cult science, a superficial veneer of credibility for views incongruent with the evidence. You wouldn’t know that by the current euphoria, though, for those who advocate pot’s medical benefits, like Marijuana Policy Project, can’t get through a paragraph without hyperbole. Seriously ill people should not be subject to arrest and criminal penalties for using medical marijuana. If marijuana can provide relief to those suffering from terrible illnesses like cancer and HIV/AIDS, it is unconscionable to criminalize them for using it. And if Eustace Charleston Haney didn’t sell snake oil, he would have been the most respected man in Hooterville. As it stands, in America, medical marijuana is legal in 31 states, even though on a federal level, marijuana is still a Schedule I controlled substance, the same as cocaine and heroin, meaning doctors like Schumann, even if they want to, can’t prescribe marijuana for fear of losing their licenses and their institutions’ funding — in Tulsa, that includes OU, OSU, St. Francis, and St. John physicians. This federal designation is insane, but it’s the large, dark federal cloud under which states doctors, and institutions have to co-exist. Further, and not to get in the weeds here — and these double entendres are going to kill me — what do you do with this? Marijuana edibles — chocolates, gummies, and other culinary treats laced with tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) — are a relatively small part of the legal marijuana (cannabis) industry in Colorado. Yet they’ve been putting a disproportionate number of people in the hospital. And that’s because, presumably, cannabis, when eaten, takes a longer time to kick in than cannabis that is smoked, meaning some, because of the delay and their own ignorance, eat more than they should, leading to health risks. And what do you do with this? A new study out of King’s College London indicates that someone who uses marijuana every day is three times more likely to develop a psychotic disorder for the first time than someone who has never used it. And that’s just for cannabis with less than 10 percent THC potency, the psychoactive compound in marijuana. Someone who uses marijuana daily with a THC concentration higher than 10 percent — what the kids call “skunk” weed — is nearly five times more likely to develop first-time psychosis. Schizophrenia and bipolar are psychotic disorders; hallucinations and delusions are often experienced during a psychotic episode. My question, then, is were we — and by we, I mean those progressives on the left — so anxious for SQ 788 to pass, so in need of a political win, and so willing to embrace our own preconceived notions of pot that we never stopped to see (or care) if medical science was along for the ride? I’m aware that by not celebrating the success of SQ 788, by even bringing up the research that indicates there might be a problem, puts me — if not in bed with, but certainly — in the same room with the likes of former Attorney General Jeff Sessions, who once said, “Good people don’t smoke marijuana,” which is enough to make me pull out my old Cheech & Chong albums. Methylphenidate, known as Ritalin, is the drug of choice for ADHD (Attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder) or ADD (Attention deficit disorder without the hyperactivity), which can describe every 11-year-old in the country. Sorry. I digress. But why bring up ADHD/ADD? Methylphenidate is, as medical pot will be, a patient-driven phenomena, unlike, say, the drug Losartan, used to combat high blood pressure. Nobody demands hypertension medicine. Doctors take the lead on that. From PsychCentral: Ritalin (also known by its generic name of methylphenidate) use has at least tripled in the past 5 years (1990–1995) and some studies suggest use is up an astounding 500%. Its conclusion: Too many clinicians nowadays are too quick to diagnose ADHD in children based mainly (and often times solely) on the parents’ description of the child’s behavior. Since when did the parents become objective, third-party reporters of such information? Information from parents is necessarily biased toward their inclination of what they believe the problem is. Their description of their children’s behavior, therefore, is likely to reflect their beliefs in any interview with an intake worker or clinician. This is Psychology 101, folks. As of April 1, approximately 143 physicians have registered with the Oklahoma Medical Marijuana Authority to prescribe marijuana for the more than 30,000 Oklahomans who signed up for their medical marijuana licenses. There are, at last count, a dispensary for every 12 patients. That’s good business, but it’s bad medicine. Imagine a situation where a patient, suffering from anxiety, wants weed because she likes the way pot makes her feel, but her doctor, who’s not registered with the Oklahoma Medical Marijuana Authority, feels more comfortable prescribing Fluoxetine because, A) After decades of data, the doctor knows it works, and B) The doctor has reservations about the connection between, say, pot and psychosis. Now in Oklahoma, that patient can simply find an OMMA doctor — just as parents found physicians who were willing to prescribe Ritalin — who agree with her “diagnosis” and will then allow the patient to get as much weed as the law allows and use it however she desires. At some point, though, a patient’s Google search, anecdotal data, and desire for pot should not trump (my last double entendre, I promise) someone with four years of medical school and three or more years of residency. Pot has always been a political, legal, and social construct. That’s a good place for it to say. Let’s leave doctors out of this, for giving pot a medical okay is borderline irresponsible. Liquor, too, has some medical benefits, but we don’t demand endocrinologists prescribe Lagavulin based on the experiences of people who say Scotch is great for their depression and anxiety. If voters want to legalize marijuana for recreational use, I have no objection — provided we put in place a legal framework to make sure that people don’t get hurt. Standardized dosing and measures to assure product consistency would be integral. And we’d need adequate enforcement to make sure that people aren’t impaired when at work or in other situations in which their marijuana use could jeopardize others. If you insist, though, on making the doctors the weed gatekeepers, understand you may not like what they say. But smoking anything — tobacco, marijuana, vapor juice — is not a healthy practice and one I counsel patients to avoid. I hear the arguments about the purity of pot and how it’s ‘more natural’ than manufactured tobacco products. The bottom line is that inhaling burning plant matter into your lungs is a terrible idea — regardless of the herb. The medical marijuana train has not just left the station, it’s pulling in to the Continental Divide — and no sane person wants to go back to the fear-mongering days of Reefer Madness or increased state penalties for pot, so it’s good that those who can benefit from weed, now can — let me repeat that. It’s long past time that people for whom weed can provide relief can get it — but that’s not the same thing as endowing and championing weed with other magical medicinal qualities it hasn’t come close to proving it possesses — no matter how good the hype and hard the struggle was to get here."
Medium.com,Life,Cannabis Event 101: Hosting a Cannabis event in Massachusetts,Cannabis,https://medium.com/eventhi/cannabis-event-101-hosting-a-cannabis-event-in-massachusetts-e4a47af9c3b7?source=topic_page---------191------------------1," While events like the Boston Freedom Rally might give the impression that Massachusetts has been cannabis-friendly for decades, the transition from legalizing medical cannabis use in 2012 to legalizing and implementing adult-use cannabis in the last two years has been gradual and regulations regarding events are slowly gaining traction. The Massachusetts Cannabis Control Commission (CCC) which is in charge of regulating everything from cultivation, production and sales to events, home delivery and consumption, has already held two meetings in January and two more in February that discussed and voted on social consumption regulations. Currently, there is no accepted form of legal public social consumption in Massachusetts. And many cities like Boston have implemented city-wide smoking bans that don’t make distinctions surrounding what substances are being smoked. Massachusetts’ Smoke-free Workplace Law has been in effect for quite some time and defines “smoking” as anything that can be “combusted and inhaled”. This has prevented many business owners from being able to allow smoking of any kind in their establishments during hours of operation. But that hasn’t stopped organizers from finding creative ways to spread cannabis culture throughout the state. Hosting Events: One such exception is the only lounge of its kind in the state, Summit Lounge. Summit Lounge is a licensed social club in Worcester now in its second year of operation. It is a private smoking club that is members-only, and, under Massachusetts law, members-only establishments are exempted from the Smoke-Free Workplace restrictions, allowing them to permit members to smoke anything that is legal under state law. This loophole has proved controversial and has set the bar higher for other clubs who may be looking for similar exemptions with the intent of allowing cannabis consumption. “Even with legalization, the cannabis community didn’t have a space to come together and talk about the issues that they were facing,” recalls Kyle Moon, General Manager of Summit Lounge. The lounge was the answer, allowing a private, social atmosphere that was cannabis-friendly. Anyone who comes to the lounge must become a member, and there are various member tiers, ranging from day-use membership (club fees that are paid each time you visit) to monthly memberships with a mixture of monthly dues and use fees depending on how often you’ll frequent the venue. Controversial as it may be, this loophole has also provided an avenue for organizers like Alva Cedeño to host events like High Tea, a regular meet-up where attendees can come to enjoy a curated cannabis-friendly experience. “The key thing to think about is ticketing for these types of events; You’re not buying cannabis. You’re not buying a ticket to an event where you are going to receive a cannabis product. You are buying a ticket to an experience,” remarks Cedeño of her High Tea events. Each ticket to tea includes a lifetime day-use membership to the Summit Lounge, access to CBD products like coffee, edibles and tea, and a showcase of vendors ranging from cultivators to educators. The lounge works with sponsors and organizers alike to host smoking and non-smoking, community-driven events. Organizers can request an event rental on their website. Other organizers prefer to operate from the comfort of their own venues. Kush Groove, a lifestyle shop in Boston that sells smoke ware, glass and tobacco products, hosts weekly paint nights after hours that allow edible consumption for small groups of 10–15 people. These are private events and attendees must secure an invite, and the ticket cost pays for the paint night experience reminds owner Marcus Johnson-Smith. “You have to keep it private, in private location, after hours and after the business is closed; it is essentially listed as a private event space,” he explains. “We maintain that this is the same way you would have a dinner party with wine and beer and such.” Because Massachusetts law has not outlined a business framework for consumption events, organizers must pay careful attention to the messaging surrounding their events, a point reiterated by fellow organizer Michael Dube, EP of The Cannabis Supper Club and agent to Eric Martin, former NFL Patriots Football Player. “If you use the word cannabis or if you use a whole list of words [related to cannabis], it can be a death sentence for the event,” Dube explains. When he throws events, even with platforms like EventHi that are friendly to cannabis events, Dube must avoid a variety of words that are penalized on platforms like Facebook or Instagram. “People have to be creative about the words that they are using so that they can communicate that it is a cannabis-centric party that might be consumption-friendly, but they have to avoid certain words for it to get the reach. Messaging is key to describing the event.” Many organizers have opted to mostly avoid consumption events in favor of networking and educational events. While these events are officially non-consumption, Dube admits that organizers still have a hard time preventing consumption from happening, even if it isn’t in the venue. Mobile party bus-style vehicles often park outside of events to allow attendees a place to spark up without standing on the sidewalk or in the street. Even with this workarounds, licensed sponsors don’t want part of the consumption scene due to the legal issues. Instead, Dube recommends organizers focus on the experience that is being billed. “I try to throw the nicest parties I possibly can. Beautiful venues. As classy as possible. [These events] help with the normalization and breaking the stigma. [Aim to] have people leaving events thinking, ‘This is nothing like the debauchery that I thought a cannabis party would be.’” Because Dube’s events are explicitly non-consumption and focused on speakers, panels, education and unique experiences, he’s able to attract what he calls “John Q Public,” or the audiences that aren’t immersed in the “industry insider’s club”. “People aren’t going to come based on who is sponsoring but they will definitely come based on the talent that you have there. Speakers, moderators, keynotes, educational sessions, that’s what they come for. They come for that and the networking.” “I try to have activations at events that people aren’t bothering to do,” Dube continues. “CBD is legal and experiential. I’ll have specialized CBD ice cream that is specific to the event and specific CBD mocktails, etc…stuff that your John Q Public that are non-cannabis industry people that attend these events can enjoy.” Admittedly, CBD is appreciated by those new to cannabis but often scoffed at by industry regulars. “The tried and true cannabis industry pros, especially those that might be working for a legal entity but they have been in the industry now for 5, 10, 20 years, they scoff at the whole CBD thing. They don’t scoff at CBD as a concept or as part of the plant-based medicinal stuff, but they scoff at the CBD edibles at the party like, ‘oh that’s cute.’ In the meantime, they know that unless it is an underground party, the only way to do consumption events in Mass is to keep it a secret which means John Q Public has no access and it’s really an insiders club of about 500 people in Massachusetts.” Massachusetts Cannabis Event Quick Facts: Working with Licensed Brands Cedeño’s claim that events are moving more towards education, informational, non-consumption events is supported by the above data. “A lot of the events are open to the public and representatives for licensed brands will come in and talk about products that they have and give out samples out to get consumer awareness; you can give out samples under gifting law even in non-consumption settings.” Others reiterate the trend in non-consumption events but are more hesitant about permitting gifting of cannabis products, commenting on how out-of-state organizers, particularly those from the West Coast, aren’t accustomed to events where cannabis isn’t provided. “The west coast guys push for gift bags etc. but most people that come to these events come packing their own cannabis, so it’s not something where people are showing up and they’re like ‘oh no! no one is handing out weed here. Now I can’t smoke.” And working with licensed brands can prove difficult as the market develops. Unlike California and other markets with mature industries and businesses that can afford to spend marketing dollars, Massachusetts companies are still in their early phases. “When it comes to larger events, even though we have over 50 dispensaries in Massachusetts right now, the sponsorship aspect is a very interesting thing to tackle,” discusses Dube. “The west coast prices for the same level [of sponsorship] I’m asking may be normal there; stuff has matured on the west coast, especially in the last 3–7 years, where profitable licensees are now in a place where they are willing to spend their marketing budgets to align with cannabis events. On the east coast, brands want to attend, but they don’t necessarily want to spend any money on it.” Moon reiterates this point, saying that organizers are still having trouble “finding actual legitimate sponsors, RMDs, adult use dispensaries, etc. Massachusetts is still not at the point where they can really sponsor a space or events like this [that allow consumption].” Similar to markets like California, underground “farmer’s market”-style events are beginning to become less frequent, and are increasingly subject to raids where law enforcement seizes as much product as possible from unlicensed vendors and sponsors. Currently, there is no legal avenue for sales of cannabis products at events. As more and more brands distance themselves from the grey and black markets of years past, the legitimate event industry will continue to grow. With that being said, organizing cannabis events in Massachusetts right now isn’t an easy endeavor. “In Massachusetts, what is difficult right now is doing cost-effective events for most of the people to attend and yet still be able to break even on your event,” Dube concedes. For now, our best advice is to keep the gathering small and private if you’re even thinking of allowing consumption, and you will likely want to avoid smoking as the main modality unless you qualify for exemptions like social clubs and smoking bars. If you’re not sure about consumption, consider an educational event that brings cannabis out into the open for discussion without the burden of potential legal risks of smoking or informing people in secret. Keep your advertising and messaging clear enough that attendees understand but vague enough that you aren’t raising red flags, and make sure that you can prove that an 85% majority of your ads’ audiences are of age. Make sure your guests are following venue and state rules, and consider working with home producers and cultivators that may have excess personal product to gift as samples if you insist on having options for your guests. Lastly, consider partnering with venues rather than paying to use them; organizers like Dube have found that hosting one or two memorable events at non-traditional cannabis venues often brings regular business to those business owners, and can be the basis of a mutually beneficial arrangement.

Medium.com,Life,"Marijuana Has Conquered America, But The War on Pot Is Far From Over",Cannabis,https://medium.com/marijuana-wire/marijuana-has-conquered-america-but-the-war-on-pot-is-far-from-over-56fd5e1553d3?source=topic_page---------192------------------1," The steady drumbeat of news about legalization, decriminalization, and mass expungements of old convictions suggests the golden age of cannabis is upon us. Not so fast, it turns out. Marijuana may have conquered America’s hearts and minds, but the official War on Pot continues to sputter along, defying logic, ruining lives, and begging explanation. A joint smoked on the streets of San Francisco or New York will only get you high. But in many small towns and cities across the country, just the odor of marijuana could lead to a conviction, if for nothing more than possession of paraphernalia. This disunited state of marijuana enforcement across the country is stark and disturbing. In big cities it’s fraying the bonds between police officers and prosecutors. A family feud has broken out in the law enforcement community. For example, under new policies adopted by the Baltimore state’s attorney, you can get caught with 16 pounds of marijuana in your trunk, as did 30-year-old Dwight Chinyee of Winston-Salem in February, and end up as he did — with no charges. Not even a traffic citation. You’ll lose your stash in Baltimore, but not your freedom. This shift to a “hands off” policy on marijuana by big-city prosecutors has spread to most major urban centers and it’s driving cops up the wall. A spokesman for the Maryland regional transit officers union called the Chinyee case “incredibly disturbing”, adding, “There is no doubt this individual will go right back to distributing illegal drugs as soon as he can.” At the same time, multiple bills have been introduced in the Maryland legislature to make recreational cannabis legal. Go figure. An investigator in the DA’s office in one of the nation’s largest metropolitan areas told The Marijuana Times, “The cops just hate us for not prosecuting marijuana busts anymore. They can’t meet their arrest quotas and that’s frustrating the hell out of them.” In another corner of America, in Mississippi, a musician and Oregon medical patient named Patrick Beadle — stopped and found to have three pounds of marijuana in his car — is today sitting in a prison cell sweating out a three-year sentence for possession. Before the ACLU intervened, Beadle had been facing distribution charges that carry a maximum sentence of 40 years. The situation is no less perplexing in places like Pennsylvania’s suburban and rural counties. While pot busts were plunging in Philadelphia, the surrounding counties were packing their courts and jails with marijuana possession cases. Between 2010 and 2016, possession arrests soared by about a third in relatively peaceful Bucks County. Some local municipalities racked up even bigger numbers. As a result, county jails — including Bucks County’s — are so overcrowded that defendants who normally would have been locked up for lack of bail are instead being furloughed to await resolution of their cases at home. “Rising arrests seem to be driven more by a patchwork of policies and priorities that can change dramatically at the township line,” says Philadelphia cannabis columnist, activist, and journalism professor Chris Goldstein. In a column posted to news site Philly.com, Goldstein wrote, “Offenders caught in Pennsylvania’s criminal justice system over a few grams of weed face anything from a friendly discussion, or a ticket, to prosecution, a trial, jail, supervision, or worse; becoming a confidential police informant. It all depends on the attitude of the local police chief, the county district attorney, and more often the local city council.” In non-urban communities where everyone drives, it’s a cinch for police officers to profile and pull over a likely pothead — say, a tattooed young man driving a beater covered with bumper stickers — and smell, or claim to smell, the odor of marijuana. That’s especially so now with the popularity of ever more “dank” strains. Police know that the vast majority of young defendants can’t afford effective counsel and will almost always choose to plead guilty. Cops with the most arrests always get a pat on the back from the chief. Justice in America could hardly be less equal when Mr. Chinyee goes home to resume his life but Mr. Beadle faces years trapped in a crowded prison dorm, his life upended. How is this possible? Isn’t there a constitutional issue here? To find out, The Marijuana Times consulted three constitutional scholars: Daniel C. Richman, a former federal prosecutor and now a law professor at Columbia University; John C. Coffee Jr., director of Columbia Law’s Center on Corporate Governance; and a noted federal appeals court judge who could only speak off the record. All three agreed on a key point. “This is not actually a legal question,” Professor Richman said. “It’s a political question, and it’s a mess. Each state gets to make its own laws and even though the Feds could theoretically pre-empt them, they never do as a matter of policy.” Richman said it’s unlikely there will be a major case that makes its way to the Supreme Court, which might settle the question once and for all. Professor Coffee pointed out that what’s happening today is similar to what followed the end of liquor Prohibition in 1933. “It remained permissible for many states to remain dry. Some did and others permitted the sale of alcohol only at state run stores. This could happen again. Although the Mississippi sentence (Patrick Beadle’s three years) is savage and unjust, do not think that an Oregon gun license is valid in New York.” All politics is local and so, it seems, is justice. One of the under-reported ironies about marijuana and the law is that in jurisdictions where it’s legal and authorities have tried to crack down on the black market, the effort has had the opposite effect. Trying to shut down an illegal cannabis market only makes it bigger. Weedmaps, a cannabis information and ecommerce platform for consumers, recently issued a report on the inverse relationship between aggressive enforcement and the trade in illegal pot. “Our research shows that there is a clear relation between illegal market share and the effectiveness of law enforcement in preventing illegal operators from reopening,” according to Weedmaps’ vice president for government relations, Dustin McDonald. “With a 50 percent or higher illegal market share (Seattle, Portland, Phoenix, and every state where recreational is still illegal), roughly 50 percent of illegal operators that are the subject of police raids will reopen.” The Weedmaps study concluded that the most effective way to drive down illegal market share is for local governments to lower taxes on legal marijuana to make it more competitive, and permit a high ratio of dispensaries per population. The answer is convenience and price, not more arrests. Until that golden age of cannabis finally dawns, equal justice in many American towns will remain a crapshoot."
Medium.com,Life,On cannabis hyperemesis: the disorder caused by chronic marijuana use,Cannabis,https://medium.com/@falsabeh/on-cannabis-hyperemesis-the-disorder-caused-by-chronic-marijuana-use-a88a2c1c2267?source=topic_page---------193------------------1," Our attitude towards marijuana has shifted drastically in the past century. An era of fear-mongering and government intervention has long passed, giving way to a predominantly liberal culture which embraces the drug for both medicinal and recreational use. This increasingly tolerant stance is largely responsible for an unprecedented rise in marijuana use, especially among adolescents and young adults. Medical literature is still catching up with the widespread consumption of marijuana. THC and CBD, the two major components of the drug, act on a wide range of organs including the brain, GI tract, and immune system: a series of targets known collectively as the endocannabinoid system. Although medical science has known about this system since the late 1980s, there is still much left to understand about how chronic marijuana use affects the body. One emerging complication that has just recently been documented is cannabis hyperemesis syndrome. This fascinating disorder suggests that for some users, marijuana is not the benign drug it is often portrayed to be. But it also gives us an important case study to examine topics pertaining to addiction, substance abuse, and compulsive behavior. Cannabis hyperemesis was first described in a 2004 case study involving 9 patients who presented to the emergency room with symptoms of cyclical vomiting: recurring attacks of profuse vomiting, nausea, and abdominal pain. Upon further investigation it was revealed that each patient had been using marijuana multiple times a day for at least a year prior to the onset of symptoms. They were not diagnosed with any psychiatric disorders. Fluid replacement therapy and anti-emetic drugs (emesis refers to vomiting in Latin) were prescribed to the patients as per the standard treatment regimen. But curiously, a hot shower or bath was consistently found to be the most effective treatment, alleviating their symptoms within minutes. This activity quickly became something of a compulsive symptom for the patients: A novel finding was a “compulsive bathing” or washing behaviour noted in nine of 10 patients (X, Y, A, Q, R, J, K, E, and G). These patients would have multiple hot showers or baths on the ward. This ritual became the patients primary preoccupation, with them often waking at night to perform it. Given the patients’ extensive use of marijuana and strange bathing habits, the authors of this 2004 study concluded that their symptoms were not confined to cyclical vomiting. They coined the name cannabis hyperemesis syndrome to describe the condition, which exhibits the following 3 essential features: symptoms of cyclical vomiting, compulsive bathing, and symptom resolution on cannabis cessation. Since this original report, many other studies have been published which document this bizarre disorder. There are two intriguing questions we can ask in light of cannabis hyperemesis. The first is how marijuana, a drug that is frequently prescribed to treat nausea, can have the paradoxical effect of inducing vomiting in high doses. The second is why bathing with hot water should help to alleviate symptoms, an observation which is unique to cannabis hyperemesis and is not found in any other disorders involving vomiting and nausea. The consensus among researchers is that marijuana induces a dysregulation of the hypothalamus, a part of the brain responsible for a variety of autonomic functions including thermoregulation, feeding, and satiety. Like many other parts of the brain, the hypothalamus contains neurons which express CB1 and CB2, the two main receptors of the endocannabinoid system. Why should taking a hot shower alleviate the symptoms of the disorder? One theory involves TRPV1 neurons in the skin, which are responsible for sending information about heat and acute pain to the brain and have been shown to project to the hypothalamus. Stimulating these nerves may somehow be correcting the dysregulation caused by the metabolites of marijuana. Alternatively, washing oneself with hot water may divert blood from the gut and into the skin, causing alterations in the digestive system that ease symptoms of nausea and abdominal pain. As for the paradoxical finding that marijuana induces vomiting, it is suspected that the drug actually has two effects: one on the central nervous system (the brain and spinal cord) and another on the peripheral nervous system (all other nerves in the body). The antiemetic effects of marijuana are caused by its action on the brain, whereas its action on the gut seems to delay gastric emptying, inducing nausea and vomiting. Cannabis hyperemesis may occur under high concentrations of marijuana when the peripheral effects override its more well-known central ones. Two kinds of patients are apparent from the literature on cannabis hyperemesis. The first are ‘responsive’ patients, who understand that marijuana is the cause of their symptoms and promptly abstain from the drug. Due to their cessation of marijuana, symptoms do not return and they are no longer readmitted to the hospital. The second type, however, is more interesting. These patients react poorly to the idea that marijuana is causing their symptoms, sometimes insisting that doctors are simply obligated to advise against the drug. As a result, they are frequently discharged from the hospital only to return weeks or months later for renewed symptoms of debilitating vomiting and abdominal pain. For these patients, the decision to continue using marijuana results in a cyclical pattern of symptoms which researchers have divided into three distinct phases: the prodromal phase, the hyperemetic phase, and the recovery phase. The prodromal phase refers to the onset of symptoms, which usually manifest as nausea especially during the morning and a “fear of vomiting”. In addition, patients may suffer from mild abdominal discomfort. Symptoms become acute during the hyperemetic phase: this is the period when patients usually admit to the hospital, as their vomiting becomes so debilitating that it interferes with their daily lives. Many patients also suffer from nausea and abdominal pain. Patients are known to begin compulsively showering during this phase. In addition, patients typically lose anywhere from 5–10 pounds due to dehydration and loss of appetite. Finally, all symptoms are resolved during the recovery phase, whereupon patients are discharged from the hospital. As symptoms subside, the patient will often regain the weight that was lost during the symptomatic phase. As is standard, doctors inform their patients that abstaining from marijuana is the only way to ensure that their symptoms do not reappear. This cycle of ER visits, debilitating vomiting, and compulsive bathing is repeated over the course of several weeks or months. It can be made even more pronounced when patients continue to smoke during the prodromal phase, believing that marijuana will help their symptoms of nausea. Additionally, THC is highly lipid-soluble and can remain in fat cells for long periods of time. This may produce a so-called ‘reintoxication effect’ whereby blood levels of THC rise when the patient loses weight during the recovery phase. Patients who are caught in this cycle drain an enormous amount of resources from the emergency departments that they choose to visit. One study estimated that the average patient’s overall cost incurred is upwards of $75,000, between fluid replacement therapies, imaging, and boarding. Continued use of marijuana is a lose-lose for both the patients and the hospitals treating them. No doubt, conservative voices will be quick to emphasize the rise of cannabis hyperemesis, a disorder which opposes the popular conception of marijuana as a benign drug. Researchers believe that this diagnosis is being severely underreported due to lack of education. One study showed that the incidence of cannabis hyperemesis has doubled since Colorado legalized the drug in 2015. Moreover, cannabis hyperemesis does suggest that ‘cannabis toxicity’ is a real medical condition. High levels of THC or its secondary products seem to be interfering with with hypothalamus’ ability to regulate temperature and gut activity. As the consumption of marijuana increases globally, it will be important to investigate the long-term impacts of chronic marijuana use, and cannabis hyperemesis is one example of this. However, it’s important for us to take a step back and understand this condition in its context, lest we fall into the all too pervasive tendency to sensationalize. Cannabis hyperemesis only effects those who use marijuana multiple times a day over the course of many years. This represents a very small proportion of overall marijuana consumption. In addition, cannabis hyperemesis seems to have a genetic component. Not every habitual smoker of marijuana develops symptoms, even when use is heavy and sustained. Specifically, researchers have pointed to variations in the P-450 enzyme as a potential factor in one’s likelihood for developing the syndrome. In other words, as a medical phenomenon, cannabis hyperemesis is hardly an epidemic. However, I believe that the disorder can teach us interesting things about how we view addiction and compulsion. Sports gambling is a growing industry with many enthusiastic participants. It can be an exciting hobby for those with a predilection for math and statistics, in addition to those who want to earn some money from their sports expertise. But as we all know, a small proportion of people suffer from a pathological relationship with gambling. Rather than being a positive activity, sports gambling can be a source of significant pain for this group, interfering significantly with their daily life and well-being. At a certain point, we’re willing to venture that their relationship with gambling is indicative of a mental disorder. How can we distinguish between the gambling enthusiast and the gambling addict? The DSM-5, the standard for psychiatric diagnoses in the United States, defines a gambling disorder under the following diagnostic criteria: Descriptive passages like these are common in the DSM-5. An aggregate of a patient’s thoughts and behaviors are catalogued precisely and the diagnosis is given on the basis of these activities — in this case, 4/9 being present. The difference between pathological and non-pathological gambling, then, is whether a person’s engagement with it results in those behaviors or not. But we should be suspicious of this behavior-based approach to mental health. One popular example should suffice here: if a patient comes into a clinic wanting to be cured of his neurotic symptom of counting windows, he shouldn’t be happy if the treatment simply displaces the illness and has him counting cars instead. In other words, there is a dimension of addiction that stands beyond simply the level of activity. When it comes to consuming marijuana, this can be understood as the opportunity cost: what the patient is not doing by choosing to use the drug at any particular time In the case of cannabis hyperemesis, I think we can identify the opportunity cost in the act of compulsively bathing. In other words, the decision to keep using marijuana should be understood as an unwillingness to part with this symptom. What this leaves us with is an inverted conception of cannabis hyperemesis, where the bathing is what drives the smoking, and not the other way around. What is so precious about the act of compulsively bathing? It may be that it gives the patients an illusory notion of control: that their health is in their hands, and thus no critical examination of their marijuana use is necessary. Consequently, their decision to consume marijuana is sustained by the eventuality of this false solution: the anticipation of its arrival is what drives the addict to continue using. The relationship between extreme nausea, compulsive bathing, and symptom resolution in cannabis hyperemesis is a complicated one. I’ve tried to describe the disorder in a way that goes beyond the simple behavior-based standard of the DSM. Cannabis hyperemesis is a fascinating case study on substance abuse and addiction for which further research is necessary. And in the meantime, if you know anyone presenting with symptoms of the disorder, tell them to kindly put the joint down."
Medium.com,Life,Hemp Descheduled in Texas! Paves the way for Senate Bill 1240,Cannabis,https://medium.com/@greenlotushemp/hemp-descheduled-in-texas-paves-the-way-for-senate-bill-1240-b7f422699eab?source=topic_page---------194------------------1," Skip to content On March 15th, John Hellerstedt, Commissioner of the Texas Department of Health and Human Services, signed an amendment to remove hemp from the list of controlled substances. The amendment was signed and sent to the Texas Register for publishing. It will become effective on April 5th (due to a 21 day processing period). That’s right. Hemp is off the list of controlled substances. Effective April 5th, the “legal gray area” around hemp-derived products will become significantly less gray. It’s state law: possessing any product or extract derived from Farm Bill compliant hemp will not constitute a prosecutable offense in the state of Texas. Rogue municipalities and overzealous county prosecutors can forget about pursuing their reactionary, draconian policies against hemp growers, manufacturers and consumers. The refrain that, “We’re just applying the law as it’s written” won’t fly after April 5th. The law is clear. We won. They lost. So let’s set things out very clearly: Decisions have been made. The comment period is over, and the amendment is published in the Texas Register. The deed is done! View the complete letter here. It’s not just the plant. It’s everything. Based on the letter’s description of descheduling as “consistent with federal law,” and the fact that the amendment is positioned as a response to a “review[] of the 2018 Farm Bill,” we have every reason to believe that the DSHS’ definition of “hemp” should align closely with the 2018 Farm Bill’s definition of hemp. Here’s the Farm Bill’s definition: “the Cannabis sativa L. and any part of that plant, including the seeds thereof and all derivatives, extracts, cannabinoids, isomers, acids…with a delta-9 tetrahydrocannabinol concentration of not more than 0.3 percent on a dry weight basis.” Id. Sec. 10113 § 279(a)(1) Notice “extracts” and “cannabinoids.” This explicitly provides for oil extracts and all associated cannabinoids — all the good stuff. Yep, this is big! (Though we expect the FDA to continue to classify CBD isolate as a drug, and therefore within the purview of FDA regulation, hemp oil is essentially liberated. Green Lotus uses full spectrum hemp oil, not CBD isolate.) Check back to this blog for updates, and be sure to stick around to read about Senate Bill 1240, a bill that would establish a regulatory framework for the growing and cultivation of industrial hemp in Texas. We’ve descheduled hemp; now we need to grow it! Green Lotus Hemp is proud to support House Bill 1240, a clear-cut, efficient and sensible proposal that will unleash the productive potential of Texas farmers and benefit millions of Texans searching for low-cost therapeutic alternatives to prescription drugs. Introduced on February 27th, the bipartisan SB 1240 is currently sponsored by five Republicans and two Democrats. The Bill follows blueprints set out by the 2018 Farm Bill, which allow for states to assume “primary regulatory authority”over their hemp production and devise procedures for testing, legal descriptions of land, plant disposal and inspections. Id. § 1 (amending Tex. Agriculture Code § 121.003 (2005)) Should SB 1240 pass, effective of September 1st, 2019, the Texas Department of Agriculture would begin putting together a proposal, or state plan, to submit to the United States Dept. of Agriculture for approval. All hemp growers in the state of Texas would have to apply for, and annually renew, a license to grow hemp within the state. Anyone convicted of a felony in the last ten years would be barred from applying for a license, and any licensed-grower convicted of a felony would lose his or her license as a result. If passed, SB 1240 would amend the legal grey areas that have led to uncertainty throughout the state: Because access to manufacturing and compounding facilities will be a challenge for hemp industry newcomers, Green Lotus Hemp believes that governmental, regulatory and administrative costs related to hemp production should be as low as possible. As for GLH, we already have a well-functioning, farm to bottle supply chain. We want to make sure that other startups have the financial leeway to establish their own best practices. That’s why GLH is excited to see SB 1240’s commitment to minimizing barriers to entry, especially financial ones. A $100 application fee and a $100 fee/per location keep starting costs modest. Annual testing fees are $300 per “plot.” “Plots” include greenhouses and “indoor growing structure[s],” additions that could encourage small-scale cultivation in urban areas. Id. § 1 (amending Tex. Health & Safety § 122.001(5)) Just as the 2018 Farm Bill stopped states from interfering in the interstate commerce of hemp, SB 1240 would similarly block the ambitions of municipalities and counties to enact or enforce additional regulations on hemp farmers. Localities stuck in outdated ways of thinking about hemp would not be able to interfere in the legitimate practices of state-licensed hemp farmers. On the other hand, authorities would have ample power to insure against the possibility of hemp farmers becoming marijuana farmers. The power to conduct random inspections, on top of annual testing, would act as a strong deterrent to the cultivation of illegal drugs. Growers would have the option of testing for THC concentration three different ways, through The Texas Dept. of Agriculture would ultimately retain the discretion to review test results from universities and private labs. This is sensible. Hemp cultivation thrives on cooperation between private business, government and universities. SB 1240 recognizes the importance of this synergistic relationship to the future of ethical hemp production in Texas. Green Lotus Hemp fully and unreservedly supports SB 1240. We stand behind this bipartisan effort to create new jobs, empower farmers and ensure that all Texans have the opportunity to explore the therapeutic power of hemp. To the Texas legislature, our partners and our customers, we say, “Let’s grow together!”"
Medium.com,Life,Your Guide to Legit CBD,Cannabis,https://elemental.medium.com/your-guide-to-legit-cbd-562553672e9d?source=topic_page---------195------------------1," here’s a reason cannabidiol (CBD) is becoming a ubiquitous product nationwide. At the end of last year, health authorities removed hemp — a species of cannabis that doesn’t contain psychoactive qualities — from the controlled substance list, meaning the plant is no longer considered illegal under federal law. Since most CBD products are derived from hemp, that change meant new products could flood the market. And they did. The CBD and cannabis market research firm Brightfield Group says the market for hemp-derived CBD products was about $591 million in 2018 and is on pace to grow into a $22 billion market by 2022. You can now buy CBD-laced cookies at bakeries and CBD face masks at the pharmacy. It’s sold as tinctures at farmers markets and bougie wellness boutiques and infused into cocktails at bars. Walgreens and CVS announced in March they will begin selling CBD sprays, creams, and patches at hundreds of their stores. “There are a million different products that didn’t exist a year ago,” says Anja Charbonneau, the founder and creative director of Broccoli, a print magazine focused on cannabis culture. CBD is closely related to another active phytocannabinoid, tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), and there’s evidence it could provide relief for a range of conditions, including anxiety, insomnia, chronic pain, and arthritis. “Could” is the key word. “The enthusiasm for CBD has outpaced the hardcore scientific evidence in humans,” says Dr. Peter Grinspoon, a primary care physician in the Boston area. Preliminary research and ample anecdotal evidence suggest CBD may tamper down inflammation in the body and quell anxiety, but randomized clinical trials studying the health benefits of CBD in humans are few and far between. That hasn’t stopped companies from connecting the dots anyway. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) sent warning letters in April to three companies — Advanced Spine and Pain LLC, Nutra Pure LLC, and PotNetwork Holdings Inc. — for falsely claiming their products could cure cancer, neurodegenerative conditions, autoimmune diseases, and opioid use disorder. There’s evidence CBD could provide relief for a range of conditions, including anxiety, insomnia, chronic pain, and arthritis. “Could” is the key word. The wider the disconnect grows between vertiginous expectations and science-backed evidence, the higher the probability that CBD will disappoint. The compound is being painted as a cure-all, says Jason DeLand, an advertising executive and the co-founder of Dosist, which makes vapes with CBD and THC. “It’s not.” Which isn’t to say you shouldn’t try it. As chemical compounds go, pure CBD is relatively safe. According to the World Health Organization, CBD does not “appear to have abuse potential or cause harm.” Here’s a guide to navigating the CBD market without getting scammed. The literature on CBD’s effects on humans is sparse. That’s largely because studying cannabis remains a major challenge. While hemp-derived CBD is legal, cannabis remains a Schedule 1 drug, which means the U.S. government restricts its availability for research. The FDA has only approved one drug derived from CBD. Epidiolex from GW Pharmaceuticals was approved in June 2018 to treat rare and severe forms of epilepsy. GW Pharmaceuticals is working on cannabinoid-based treatments for a range of other conditions, including epilepsy, autism, and schizophrenia. The way CBD could be effective for these conditions is how it binds to receptors in the endocannabinoid system — a network in the brain involved in the regulation of functions such as mood, pain, inflammation, and movement — without producing a high. That’s the working theory for now, even though hard evidence is scant. “It depends on what you consider as evidence,” says Grinspoon. “A lot of people swear by it and say it helps them with sleep, anxiety, and pain.” But there is little clinical evidence to back up these anecdotes. While research on animals suggests CBD could be beneficial for anxiety, sleep, pain, and addiction, results in animals don’t always translate to results in humans. Drew Todd, one of the co-founders of the CBD startup Feals, says his company conducted a survey of 5,000 people about their product and amassed plenty of anecdotal evidence that CBD was helping his customers. “If you have anxiety, that feeling of anxiety isn’t there anymore,” he says. “Same for pain or inflammation.” On its site, the company describes its CBD tinctures as “helping people manage anxiety, pain, and sleeplessness.” Now that hemp-derived CBD is legal, Todd says he’s optimistic the company’s marketing will be backed up by clinical research. And according to Grinspoon, such studies are underway. Research into the long-term effects of CBD will have a longer lag time, however. Unlike marijuana-based products — which are subject to state regulations that often require laboratory testing — hemp-derived CBD has little oversight, leaving the onus on the customer. Federal health officials released a report in 2018 that showed 52 people were sickened with nausea and seizures in Utah over a four-month period from synthetic products that were falsely labeled as CBD. Charbonneau, the editor of the cannabis magazine, advises online shoppers to start by visiting companies’ “About” pages on their websites and reading up on them with an eye for information about their farm, where the product is coming from, and who is growing the plant. Products ideally should list on the label the exact amount of CBD as well as a breakdown of any other ingredients. Cannabis plants can absorb heavy metals and pesticides through soil and water; they also might contain THC or other unknown substances. In a 2017 study published in the Journal of the American Medical Association, researchers purchased and tested 84 CBD products sold online and found that 26 percent contained less CBD than labeled. Grinspoon recommends only purchasing CBD products from companies that verify the purity of their products through an independent lab and can provide a certificate of analysis detailing the results. If you’re interested in trying the compound, your best bet is careful experimentation. If you’re purchasing CBD from a store or coffee shop, ask questions, says Raeven Duckett, co-founder of Community Gardens, a cannabis dispensary in Oakland, California. “The people who are serving it to you should be able to tell you that or direct you on where you can find it.” If you live in a state where cannabis is legal, Duckett recommends visiting a licensed dispensary because most have regulations around quality control in place. “Budtenders are usually pretty knowledgeable about the CBD products carried in their store,” she says. If you’re looking to try CBD, there’s a dizzying array of options to choose from, including vapes, joints, gummies, chocolate, tinctures, face masks, and infused lattes. Inhaling CBD is the fastest-acting, according to those familiar with the products, and oil tinctures are a close second. Diluting a tincture by adding it to food or a drink will likely increase the onset period. CBD-only gummies as well as gummies with a high CBD-to-THC ratio are also popular ways to ingest CBD. In general, Duckett says CBD that’s ingested via edibles takes about 90 minutes to activate. There’s also a suite of topical CBD products, including soaps, face masks, and creams. Unlike the other forms of CBD, topicals aren’t absorbed into the bloodstream. Instead, they work by binding to cannabinoid receptors receptors in the skin. While less risky than the other methods, it’s still a good idea to verify that these products contain the amount of CBD they say they do. Unfortunately it’s hard to get granular on how high to go; the research on dosing is slim. Experts advise to start with a dose of CBD of around five milligrams or less and slowly work up from there because, like coffee and alcohol, CBD affects everyone differently. Very high doses are often used in animal studies, says Grinspoon, the Boston-area physician. This is also true in the limited published research on humans. One small study found that 300 milligrams of CBD outperformed a placebo in treating anxiety, and an ongoing study on CBD’s effects on anxiety has people taking up to 800 milligrams a day. Both studies have small sample sizes, and without knowing the long-term side effects of CBD, taking anything approaching that amount is likely unwise. CBD is nonpsychoactive and nonaddictive, and there is no “abuse liability,” says Sumner Burstein, a professor emeritus of biochemistry and molecular pharmacology at the University of Massachusetts Medical School. However, there is evidence CBD affects the way the body metabolizes drugs, which could alter the effects of other medications, like blood thinners. It may be worthwhile to mention to your doctor that you’re taking CBD. Like coffee and alcohol, CBD affects everyone differently. Since CBD is relatively benign and there’s a dearth of scientific-backed advice on dosage, if you’re interested in trying the compound, your best bet is careful experimentation. It’s also wise to temper your expectations. If it helps relieve pain, anxiety, insomnia, or any of the other conditions people use it to treat, that’s great. But experts are skeptical that CBD can actually get rid of any of these health problems on its own. Grinspoon says CBD offers exciting potential, particularly given how safe it appears to be and especially compared with other available treatments for anxiety, insomnia, and pain. “I’m very eager for the science to catch up,” he says."

Medium.com,Life,CBD is the New Kombucha,Cannabis,https://medium.com/@tkmaclean/cbd-is-the-new-kombucha-8df95f5a070d?source=topic_page---------199------------------1," Soon you’ll see something new in the supermarket, sidling up beside your favorite kombucha. You’ve probably heard about them: CBD infused drinks. In late 2018, CBD (cannabidiol) gained a lot of traction. It’s the most well-known compound derived from cannabis, aside from THC, the notorious compound known for its consciousness-bending effects. We know that CBD is safe. Reports of 1500 mg have been documented with no adverse side effects. Like kombucha, ancient cultures have sipped cannabis-drinks for millennia. In India they drink Bhang, a milk-like drink made from cannabis plant leaves. They thought Bhang cured everything from dysentery to speech impediments. And they might be on to something; research has shown that high doses of CBD temper public speaking anxieties. With the signing of the Farm Bill last October, a few opportunistic beverage companies decided CBD was legal enough. Now, they sell drinks online marketed as wellness beverages, hoping to suckle on the overripe Wellness Industry teat, worth over 4 trillion dollars. But let’s clear a few things up. For one, CBD is NOT legal, no matter what you mix it with. The bill removed the compound’s class one drug designation. Still illegal though. Just not heroin-level illegal. The Food and Drug administration hinted recently that they may legalize CBD infused food and drinks one day. Down the road. In a year or two. But why wait a year or two? said every internet entrepreneur ever. Online companies are making bold claims with their CBD refreshments. Recess advertises that their product will provide you clarity and balance. Vybes says their CBD-infused soda will help you, quote, “Achieve homeostasis.” Which leads me to my second clarification. Before you purchase any of these products and taste test, remember that not all CBD extracts are equal. CBD isolates and CBD broad-spectrum compounds are very different. Broad-spectrum compounds don’t just contain CBD, but a range of other cannabinoids and compounds. Cannabis researches claim broad-spectrum (aka full-spectrum) compounds are enhanced by the entourage effect. It’s the difference between Orange Crush (isolate) and the freshly squeezed stuff (broad-spectrum). When you need a dose of vitamin C, what do you drink? Isolates, like the one found in the soda Sprig or the previously mentioned Vybe, require a bigger dose to feel the effects. The likelihood you feel anything from 15mg of CBD isolate is questionable. Sorry, no homeostasis. The only broad-spectrum CBD beverage I know of is New Age Beverages’ Marley brand, Mellow Mood. They believe in the effects of a broad-spectrum CBD compound, having done their own testing in-house. Either way, the US will legalize CBD eventually and the bottled beverage industry knows it. The 6 billion dollar brand Constellations, the company behind Corona beer, have staked 5 billion dollars with major Canadian cannabis producer, Canopy. And they aren’t the only one. The Alkaline bottled water company, WTER, has invested millions into CBD-infused water, too. With CBD projections estimated to reach 22 billion by 2022, the CBD-infused craze will be an ongoing news item. Just know that CBD claims from drink and food companies are unjustified. CBD has a long way to go before we know what it does. Although, does knowing a drink’s effects really change our desire? We know what booze does to us, none of which is good, and it’s never stopped us."
Medium.com,Life,Avoiding Over-Centralization of American Hemp,Cannabis,https://medium.com/@darbyhemp/avoiding-over-centralization-of-american-hemp-52ba91b5bc58?source=topic_page---------200------------------1," As we step into a brand new American era of industrial hemp, it’s important to focus on the core socioeconomic promises of this plant resource — many of which simply aren’t possible with over-centralization. With passage of the 2018 Farm Bill and the Hemp Farming Act of 2018 making hemp farming federally legal again in America after close to a century, it’s absolutely essential we keep the small-to-medium hemp farm and business communities from being gobbled up or destroyed by gargantuan — some would argue out of control — corporate interests. On the rain-soaked afternoon of December 12th, eight days before the signing of the 2018 Farm Bill by President Trump, we received a huge list of links to ubber-excited news releases and recently published articles from a few readers. Here’s a smidgen of the headlines: “Hemp, Inc. Announces Farm Bill Could Drive $20 Billion Hemp Industry” - GlobeNewswire “Congress Releases Farm Bill Report that Would End ‘Era of Hemp Prohibition’ - Natural Products INSIDER “Senate Passes Compromise Farm Bill that Legalizes Industrial Hemp Production” - Augusta Free Press “Senate Passes Farm Bill and Oregon Hemp Industry Sees Boom” - Portland Business Journal Then this one here… “Lawmakers From Both Parties Celebrate Hemp Legalization In The Farm Bill” Along with this one are both from Marijuana Moment… “Senate Votes To Send Hemp Legalization To President Trump’s Desk” They all sound great, but what’s got folks worried behind the scenes is the idea that because of the current state of America while this is rapidly unfolding, the hemp industry (quite different from psychoactive cannabis) will soon be dominated and controlled by a handful of corporate brands who’ve proven beyond any reasonable or rational doubt to NOT have the best interests of the people and our environment at heart. At least not until radical corporate reform is enacted… Point here is, the future of American hemp is anything but certain. On one side you’ve got a growing army of farmers, small-to-medium business owners, and consumers who would likely support them, and on the other side are large brands with politicians, depthless pockets, and global supply chains in the works. After quick exposure and a little research into hemp it’s easy to begin perceiving the plant species as a ‘pure good’ — a 360-degree win — opportunity for everyone from the individual on up to nation states and the earth’s biosphere. And that’s true, whether supported as a… It’s all good! But let’s not be too hasty to believe status quo systems will be benevolent with hemp, because hemp is a benevolent resource. Yes, most supply chains currently laying waste to earth can become more efficient, sustainable and cleaner through hemp, but will this really be adopted? And if it is, will it all be controlled by the same companies? For example, as hemp seed displaces the demand for California almonds, will almond corporations come in and buy out tons of small hemp farms creating many different products so they all just create theirs? Will American hemp seed, fiber, and flower become just another set of pillar under American corporatism in agriculture? Regardless of who gets all the profits, switching to hemp seed from almonds would be great for the land and honeybees, but would this scenario equal a net positive or net negative development for the people of California? Consumers deal with it every time we visit the grocery store. An indicative quote from FarmAid: “U.S. agriculture suffers from abnormally high levels of concentration, meaning just a handful of corporations control nearly all of our food production, processing, and distribution.” Right now, as hemp farming is being legalized and adopted nationwide, nearly every sector in U.S. agriculture is well above the 40% concentration ratio economists believe routes out competition and opens the door to wholesale market abuse. Here’s a rough graph from Farm Aid painting the grim picture. We’re not sure how old this is, but it shows what just four brands control in terms of individual market share: These companies, their land and livestock can benefit from hemp, tremendously, but do they know that? Do they care? Corn for example is going to take a HUGE hit for a variety of reasons thanks to hemp, as will any GMO crop. Meanwhile, livestock animals LOVE feed boosted by hemp seed (hearts, oil, cake, etc.) or hemp gruel, and their meat and eggs end up being of higher nutritional quality. Will these brands take 55–84% control of hemp, or will it go more to the people and our small farming and business communities? We need to work together! Let’s briefly summarize how we see it here in early-to-mid 2019 in terms of the very generalized picture of hemp genetics. The ‘hemp CBD’ application is at risk of becoming the vehicle through which more control and market share is seized. We shouldn’t allow over-centralized corporate interests to legally define industrial hemp or it’s naturally-occurring compounds as ‘medicine’ in the conventional or legally-dominated sense. Because if it’s ‘medicine’ in this sense, that means doctors and pharmaceutical interests are given all power. If it’s just a commercial crop like corn or wheat, it’s not medicine. Even when the endocannabinoid system is considered, for the vast majority of people hemp CBD is merely herbal supplementation; safe, nontoxic, non-addictive and a non-intoxicating alternative. Aside from these facts, the plant can be used to dramatically re-imagine energy, construction, food, and clothing industries just to get started… Don’t forget, the same level of corporate power concentration can be found in the American use of fertilizers, pesticides, and herbicides involved in agriculture…all of which stand to lose a good percent of revenue as industrial hemp requires DRAMATICALLY lower amounts. Where will the industrial hemp industry be in a couple years when it’s as common as flax, or perhaps even corn, peanuts, soy, or wheat? Vast amounts of the capital raised from the demand for hemp could fuel the rise of the greater industrial hemp industry into countless communities! It shouldn’t be allowed to funnel only into a small number of corporate coffers. The four core promises of industrial hemp for the American populace explain why (not to mention the U.N. 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development): 1) A Cleaner Environment Industrial hemp has the potential to replace the need for timber products, petroleum-based plastics and synthetic fibers, and a good percentage of the demand for animal protein. Consider those implications alone and apply various butterfly effects… the plant will also go a LONG way in terms of cleaning up and restoring farmlands and replacing the toxic devastation from crops like soybeans and cotton (thanks to pesticides, herbicides, fertilizers, GMO, etc.). We must safeguard hemp from being tampered with genetically to the point it no longer or barely resembles what we’ve managed to save across the world. We must take steps to ensure the genetics of industrial hemp aren’t distorted to the point it becomes something else entirely and squander perhaps the greatest plant-gift nature’s ever bestowed upon us. Corporate ownership of the hemp plant or any of its natural constituents should be COMPLETELY off the table. 2) Restoring American Agrarianism The last time industrial hemp farming was completely legal and fully-accepted, the majority of families owned or worked on a farm. And, most farms used or grew hemp to some degree — especially when monarchs and government bodies mandated it be grown or during times when it was used as currency for trade (even paying taxes). Hemp can revitalize and repopulate the family farm community from sea to shining sea, especially in the heartland. Not to mention the small-to-medium business world… impossible if concentrated in centrally-controlled farms stretch on from horizon to horizon primarily benefiting a small few. Should major corporations have their share? Absolutely! But, there’s more than enough to go around. American hemp can become a highly-prized commodity, spawning endless consumer goods WE can manufacture and sell to the rest of the world. More on this in #4. 3) Decentralizing Energy Production It’s been said we could satisfy 100% of America’s energy needs with a hemp farm roughly the size of Rhode Island. Over the next decade, hopefully this many acres of hemp are planted for specifically biofuel or biodiesel purposes…but, what good does it do our nation if all that capital goes to one or two energy companies? Hemp-based biomass and energy production will become a tremendous market, and it would be more beneficial if the power were shared and decentralized in many of the same ways we were promised the solar energy market would be. 4) Revitalizing Green American Manufacturing One extremely common fact is hemp can be used to make ‘20,000+’ consumer products from the seed, hurd, fiber and flower. Everything plastic or wood can make! Great, and just picture having the American processing and manufacturing network to supply domestic and global demand for all these products. We should take steps to ensure in coming years that the hemp industry is able to flourish and create millions of jobs along the socioeconomic spectrum — textiles, warehousing, processing, packaging, manufacturing, retail, minimum wage all the way up to unions. Hemp has the potential to recreate an American manufacturing base. Mega-corps shouldn’t be allowed to seize control of hemp farming supply chains, then pay farmers pennies to ship our hemp off to be manufactured elsewhere then sold back to us at inflated prices. Would it be ideal to see publicly-funded cooperative industrial hemp farms become commonplace? Yes. But those are a hardball game in most states for anyone without corporate-level funding or deep connections to local politics…unfortunately. Private businesses are the better option right now for most people who want to get involved, make some money and create jobs through hemp. Consumers need to know why they should support them. Along with the privately-owned farms and private businesses selling everything from shirts to snacks to the world, envision publicly-funded and operated multi-purpose hemp farms outside your town providing inexpensive local food, fiber, cannabinoids, biomass for fuel, etc. to your county. It’s a great thing, and no one disagrees once they’re aware it’s possible. Both publicly-funded and private hemp businesses will enrich this nation and world if they aren’t squashed by over-centralization! Thanks for your time."
Medium.com,Life,US House Committee Advances Bill to Protect Banks Serving Cannabis Industry,Cannabis,https://medium.com/citizen-truth/us-house-committee-advances-bill-to-protect-banks-serving-cannabis-industry-ed8b6a2518d2?source=topic_page---------201------------------1," On Thursday, the House Financial Services Committee voted on a proposed bill that would protect financial institutions that provide services to legally operated cannabis businesses. The bill addresses a much-needed issue for marijuana-related businesses as banks have often stayed away from the industry due to its varying legal status. After amending the bill to allow for providing a safe harbor for insurance companies and give women- and minority-owned organizations better access to financial services, the House Committee voted 45–15 to advance the bill. Ohio Republicans Warren Davidson and Steve Stivers, as well as Democrats Denny Heck of Washington state and Ed Perlmutter of Colorado, initially introduced the bill. Typically, banks are leery of financing cannabis-related businesses since the federal government regards marijuana as illegal. Consequently, many cannabis industries strictly use cash, which leads to criminal concerns such as security issues and money laundering. The proposed bill would help cannabis businesses gain the opportunity to obtain financing and expand their companies — especially those who had previously struggled to obtain funding. Steve Hawkins, executive director of the Marijuana Policy Project, told the Associated Press in a statement: “This is a historic and critical step forward for the nation’s burgeoning cannabis industry. Regardless of where members stand on legalization, they can agree that it is in the public interest to make banking available to cannabis businesses in states where it is legal.” The Credit Union National Association and the American Bankers Association, among other groups, have shown their support for the bill, stating that the discord between state and federal law has put a strain on its members. Having access to conventional banking practices could have a “profound” economic effect on the creation of tax revenues and jobs, according to Kevin Murphy, CEO of Acreage Holdings, a New-York-based multistate company. One aspect of the proposal is that it would not allow officials who regulate federal banking to penalize banks that accommodate businesses in the cannabis industry, as long as they adhere to state laws. Aaron Smith, executive director of the National Cannabis Industry Association, said in a statement: “The SAFE Banking Act would go a long way toward improving safety, transparency, access and justice in the cannabis industry.” According to a report by Marijuana Business Daily, the bill will go to the full House for consideration."
Medium.com,Life,Cryptocurrency May Be The Unique Solution For Cannabis Tax Payments,Cannabis,https://medium.com/@cryptblock/cryptocurrency-may-be-the-unique-solution-for-cannabis-tax-payments-822707c46526?source=topic_page---------202------------------1," This is the time of year when the tax deadlines for numerous countries and states all over the word begin to approach quickly. Since this is happening in such a wide variety of places, it is natural for people to start considering taxes. The potential impact of cryptocurrency on the collection and calculation of taxes must also be considered. Cryptocurrency investments in some areas became taxable going back as far as January of 2018. The impact of taxing cryptocurrency may specifically impact the cannabis market. Approximately ten states in the United States have made recreational marijuana legal. This number increases to about 33 for medical marijuana. In some of the numerous states that have legalized cannabis, a lot of financial institutions will not perform financial transactions involving cannabis businesses because cannabis is still considered a drug. This attitude has caused a lot of issues for businesses dealing with cannabis because they need to pay their taxes. A good example is California. The businesses in this state have been forced to used armored vehicles for the transfer of cash and cannabis to the state councils. Their transactions have been refused by all of the banks. Although the problem seems insurmountable, the solution may be cryptocurrency. One of the California State Assembly members is Phil Ting. He is pushing a bill forward to enable the cannabis industry in the state to remit taxes for the city and county governments through the use of cryptocurrency. This would ensure the tax payment process was secure, stress free and more accountable due to the refusal of the banking institutions to help. Phil Ting spoke of the amount of cash at the stores and warehouses being extremely difficult to keep secure. He believes as dangerous as it is to transfer the product, it is twice as dangerous to transfer all the cash. Phil Ting said a little cannabis store is no different than a little storefront. Both of these stores are located in residential neighborhoods with people living in the area and always around. If anything potentially dangerous or violent occurred, the neighborhoods could suffer the repercussions. Despite the fact the bill has not currently been approved, there is speculation that tax bills could be paid using cryptocurrency as soon as next year. Assemblyman Kevin McCarthy is a Democrat from Sacramento. He is also one of the authors of the bill potentially enabling cryptocurrency such as bitcoin to be used to make tax payments. He believes the need for this proposal is highly significant. He stated the cannabis industry has been restricted from using traditional banking methods. This will not change as long as cannabis is classified at the federal level as a Schedule I narcotic. He spoke of the need for something different that the cash system currently in place for the cannabis operators to pay both their employees and their taxes. He wants to see a federal solution regarding banking for the cannabis industry. He believes cryptocurrency could be one of these solutions. Assemblyman Phil Ting is the lead author for the bill. He sent a short, prepared statement to the Times-Standards stating the issue was a matter of safety. He said there are a lot of things that can go wrong when large amounts of cash are transported. This presents a substantial risk for cannabis businesses when they pay their taxes. He believes cryptocurrency is a cheaper and safer solution for the cannabis industry. He feels if the cost of paying taxes were lowered, this would help combat the activity on the black market while providing the encouragement necessary for more businesses to become licensed. Kevin McCarthy stresses this was an option and not mandatory. He believes people will agree this option is a safer alternative and more viable than having to transport 100K in cash. The Bayshore Mall in Eureka has a cryptocurrency ATM. The issue is it remains unknown how many of the local businesses are accepting cryptocurrency or how often Humboldt County uses the currency. Austin Allison is the Councilman for Eureka City. He has studied the systems used for cryptocurrency. This left him intrigued by the concept. He believes the safety in the cannabis industry prevalent in Humboldt County could be boosted by cryptocurrency. He also said cryptocurrency has not yet become widely accepted. Austin Allison admits cryptocurrency still remains fairly unknown. He believes if the payment solution focused on the technology as opposed to the price fluctuations, the concept would be brilliant. He said there are a lot of computer scientists currently researching the specifics of bitcoin and the potential uses. He added three to five days are required for a bank transfer. Cryptocurrency transactions would speed up this process because payments can be settled in a matter of seconds. He believes the idea is pretty cool. He also feels the issue may be the price fluctuations. Austin Allison said cryptocurrency is similar to commodities like gold because value fluctuations can happen in hours or days. By nature, cryptocurrency is volatile. He additionally stated the performance of cryptocurrency today will be different tomorrow. He stated when payment transfers are made using bitcoin, the cryptocurrency can be purchased at current value then converted back to United States dollars during the same day. He believes this may be the way to get around the fluctuation issues. If the bill passes, this could be a substantial benefit to the industry of cryptocurrency. The chances are good substantial investments would have to be made in cryptocurrency by the cannabis industry in order to pay their taxes. This could lead to a greater adoption of cryptocurrency for a lot of companies in different sectors. Many of the proponents of cryptocurrency believe it may be better than the current banking system. The new bill introduced by California would enable cannabis businesses to pay county and city taxes with cryptocurrency. The idea is to make the process of paying taxes safer for the local cannabis businesses and storefronts. If the potential bill is passed into law, the counties and cities would be able to choose if they wanted to accept cryptocurrencies such as bitcoin from marijuana businesses. According to a report from CBS Sacramento, this could become a reality by 2020. A lot of states including California have already legalized marijuana. Marijuana is also legal in Washington, Oregon, Nevada, Colorado, Alaska, Massachusetts and Vermont. Despite this, the banks are still refusing to have anything to do with the local cannabis businesses. The FDIC or the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation insures the majority of the banks. This prevents the banks from providing any activities or services that are not legal under federal law. The majority of marijuana shops are not legally entitled to perform basic financial operations such as writing checks. This means they have to handle large amounts of cash. This also makes them a very easy target for thieves. When the owner of a cannabis business goes to the tax office, they are carrying a suitcase filled with cash. The bill would eliminate the need to carry cash by making the process of paying taxes easier. The cannabis companies would be able to use cryptocurrency to pay their cultivation and excise taxes. The ability to use third-party digital processors may go into effect by 2020. This would remove the dangers and increase safety for the local neighborhoods as well. It is no longer considered unorthodox to use cryptocurrency to pay taxes. The state of Ohio made this legal in November of 2018. Payments made using bitcoin were accepted by the local tax offices using BitPay, a third-party payment processor. There is a twist to these payments. If the company uses bitcoin to pay their taxes, United States dollars are received by the state. The cryptocurrency is converted by BitPay to fiat and transferred directly to the state of Ohio. According to media reports, only two businesses have used the option to use bitcoin to pay their taxes as of February 19th of 2019. The reports regarding the new opportunity to use cryptocurrency to pay taxes for cannabis businesses is far below expectations. The belief is cryptocurrency should be a popular method for paying fines, fees and taxes. This may become a reality in the future. There are a lot of similarities between the marijuana and cryptocurrency industries. They are both in the earliest development stages, face regulatory and legal issues and are frequently misrepresented by the press. The gap between the cannabis industries and the blockchain must be bridged. The ability of the blockchain to record and track the cannabis process from seed to sale could potentially legitimize the cannabis industry to the regulators. Last year was a representation of the twelve best months for any asset class throughout history on record. The combined market cap when the year began was $17.7 billion. By the end of the year, the valuations for cryptocurrency were almost $600 million. This was a push of over 3,300 percent. The ballooning market cap was increased further by the new coins available on the market. The majority of the gain was from the increase in organic prices for ethereum, bitcoin, litecoin and ripple. Government oversight and the supply chains could be revolutionized by the blockchain. Blockchain is a decentralized, distributed and digital ledger responsible for recording every transaction without the necessity of a financial intermediary. This could potentially change the cannabis industry and revolutionize the industry of financial services. If the banks were not filling the role of a third party for the transactions, the expectations are the fees would significantly drop. The transaction validation of the blockchain is available 24 hours every day and seven days each week. This means payment settlements would be nearly instantaneous. Transactions would no longer require a day to post. The non-currency applications would be of the greatest benefit to the marijuana industry. Emerald Health Therapeutics is a Canadian grower. They have the capability of supporting a maximum of 5.8 million square feet. They have recently announced they are finalizing a joint venture to team with DMG Blockchain Solutions. The company will be called CannaChain Technologies. The focus of the new company will be e-commerce and supply chain solutions for the marijuana industry."
Medium.com,Life,The Public Health Impact of Cannabis’s Fractured Legal Status,Cannabis,https://medium.com/@jennifergumer/the-public-health-impact-of-cannabiss-fractured-legal-status-ffd42a0f0864?source=topic_page---------203------------------1," Over the last several years, cannabis legalization has spread like a weed (pun intended) across the country. As a result, at least some form of cannabis consumption is now legal in all but four states. Despite state legalization, however, cannabis remains a Schedule 1 substance, and therefore highly illegal, under federal law. While it’s unlikely that the federal government will take action against state legal cannabis businesses after remaining on the sidelines for several years, the present conflict between state and federal law creates some significant headaches for the industry. For example, most banks will not accept money from cannabis operators given the application of federal anti-money laundering statutes to profits generated by even state legal cannabis businesses. As a result, the industry conducts its business almost exclusively in cash, which is not only cumbersome but notably dangerous. Federal illegality also precludes cannabis operators from deducting business expenses thus resulting in inordinately high tax bills. While these crippling burdens on the nascent industry are arguably reason enough to change the legal status of cannabis, there are also important public health reasons to do so. Significantly, it is extremely difficult for U.S. researchers to study cannabis due to its federal illegality. For instance, as with all Schedule 1 substances, researchers who wish to work with cannabis must obtain licenses from the Drug Enforcement Agency (DEA). While this requirement in and of itself constitutes a significant barrier to cannabis research, federal law further requires researchers to source their cannabis from a DEA-licensed cultivator. As of this writing, the University of Mississippi is the only DEA-licensed cultivator and therefore the only legal supplier of research cannabis. This restriction, which has been in place since 1970, is problematic for several reasons. First, the limited supply of cannabis for study creates a significant bottleneck in the related research. And, to add insult to injury, Ole’ Miss’s cannabis is of a laughable quality (we’re talking some serious schwag) and notably unrepresentative of the strains people actually consume. Presumably, the government originally erected these roadblocks to cannabis research for fear that the science, if allowed to proceed, would undermine the government’s criminalization narrative, i.e., that cannabis is an extremely dangerous and addictive drug with no therapeutic value. While it’s (arguably) always wrong to suppress science, it’s further pointless in this case given that legalization has hit an apparent tipping point. Regardless, there are pressing ethical and public health reasons not only to facilitate, but to prioritize, cannabis research in light of widespread legalization and consumption. Although cannabis is hardly the devilish substance the federal government once wanted us to believe, none but the staunchest cannabis advocates assert that it’s entirely harmless. For example, studies indicate that about 9% of people who use cannabis develop a problematic relationship with the substance. Evidence also suggests that high potency cannabis can trigger psychosis in those already prone to mental disease. Additionally, cannabis can famously induce paranoia and anxiety even in those without a predisposition to mental illness. More research is therefore needed to further explore these and other risks potentially associated with cannabis so that consumers and policymakers can respectively use and regulate cannabis in a way that better protects individual and public health. For example, research might find that certain strains and/or cannabinoid profiles are more associated with risks such as psychosis and paranoia. Such information could help consumers make smarter decisions regarding the cannabis they purchase and consume. Similarly, policymakers could use such information to regulate or prohibit the sale of higher risk products. Further research may also produce much needed guidance as to how cannabis could be dosed to maximize benefits and minimize undesirable side-effects. Additionally, there is still much to learn about the cannabis plant itself and how it manifests its effects on the mind and body. For instance, although cannabis contains over 100 cannabinoids, only two, THC and CBD, are somewhat understood. Science hasn’t even begun to truly assess the effect of the other cannabinoids let alone how they might interact with each other to produce different highs and therapeutic effects. It is therefore imperative from a public health standpoint that the government not only allow, but ensure, that cannabis research is conducted. In fact, before leaving office, Obama tried to narrow the gap between cannabis research and consumption by allowing other cultivators to become licensed providers of research cannabis. Per the policy, however, the related license applications must be reviewed and approved by the Attorney General. Because Jeff Sessions — a notorious cannabis opponent — took office soon after the policy was enacted, no such application has been approved. And, unless William Barr takes a friendlier view of cannabis research (which seems unlikely given his previous statements regarding cannabis), the resulting bottleneck will likely remain in place. It is therefore incumbent on Congress to change the relevant law so that the necessary research can proceed. In fact, last year, members of Congress introduced a bill titled the Medical Cannabis Research Act of 2018 that would require the Attorney General to license at least three new cultivators of research cannabis a year. The bill, however, which never made it to a committee vote, arguably doesn’t go far enough. Researchers should be able to source their cannabis from any reliable source based on the particular characteristics (e.g., THC v. CBD content) they are interested in studying. Furthermore, it is imperative that researchers are able to access and study the cannabis that individuals actually consume. Only then will researchers be able conduct studies that can appropriately guide the decisions of consumers and policymakers in a way that promotes individual and public health."

et’s face it, weed gets a bad rap. The media is to blame, and I don’t mean #fakenews or anything like that, I mean the cultural outputs of our entertainment industry, from Hollywood to Broadway. Marijuana, long the butt of lazy stoner jokes and Hot Cheeto-laden Netflix binges, has reached a new high: in public acceptance and in how we portray it in the media. ANTI-WEED PROPAGANDA The most famous piece of anti-weed propaganda created was of course yours truly, Reefer Madness. Brought to us from the year 1930 and used for a very long time to enable society to talk trash about marijuana. Disinformation about cannabis was perpetuated, and it quickly became attached to negative ideas and messages. Reefer Madness depicts the story of a couple “living in sin” because they sell marijuana to others, told by a lecturer at an assembly. It builds up to the murder of an innocent woman called Mary, by Ralph (the drug dealer). Ralph and his partner Mae frame Bill, Mary’s boyfriend, into believing he was the murderer because he was under the influence of marijuana. Eventually Ralph goes mad with the continuous use of marijuana and kills another man leading to his arrest and the freedom of Bill. The film ends with the lecturer speaking: “We must work untiringly so that our children are obliged to learn the truth because it is only through knowledge that we can safely protect failing lifts the next tragedy may be that of your daughter or your son or yours or yours or yours!” then the large words TELL YOUR CHILDREN appear on the screen. This clearly shows the mindset society had during this time."

Medium.com,Life,Can High Times Survive in the Age of Vaping?,Cannabis,https://onezero.medium.com/can-the-bible-of-weed-survive-in-the-age-of-vaping-6a1baf1b7e4e?source=topic_page---------207------------------1," a cold Saturday last March, dozens of young men in sweatshirts and graphic tees came to Salem, Massachusetts, with wads of cash to see the first solo exhibition by Bob Snodgrass. The 73-year-old Snodgrass, who arrived wearing his signature tie-dye fisherman’s hat and lavender Lennon sunglasses, is widely considered the godfather of glass pipes and a delegate from a bygone era of stoner culture: a time of sharing joints, eating homemade pot brownies — and reading High Times magazine. For decades, Snodgrass’ intricately crafted bongs were regularly featured in High Times. Just a few years ago, a Snodgrass exhibit would have been catnip for the publication. But it wasn’t until the show wound down, after a group of about 20 men bought their pipes and finished smoking around a communal table, that Ab Hanna, a High Times staff writer, casually stopped by. Hanna joined the magazine two years ago, in the midst of a tumultuous era for High Times and weed journalism at large. Family owned and operated out of New York for decades, the High Times company was purchased in 2017 by private equity firm Oreva Capital for $42 million. The marijuana industry is in the rush of a legalization boom, and everyone from Barneys to Martha Stewart is lining up to get a hit. That includes the media. In the last half decade, a fresh crop of cannabis magazines has flushed the market. Glossies like Broccoli and Kitchen Toke, which often embrace vaping and edibles over joints and bongs, are tapping into the wellness and lifestyle space, all the while distancing themselves from the old stereotypes of stoner culture — stereotypes that High Times has long embodied and embraced. For the first time in its history, High Times magazine now has serious national competition in the marijuana space. To keep up, the company has to walk a thin line between appealing to a large, new — and increasingly female — audience without alienating its longtime readership. In its attempt to do so, High Times has hit some bumps. Over the past two years, more than half of the editorial staff, including veteran editors, was laid off or left, and company revenue has shrunk. The irony for High Times is that in an era of weed acceptance and even legalization, the flagship marijuana publication finds itself in a more precarious position than ever. For several months after the Snodgrass exhibition, I checked the High Times website to see what Hanna had written about it, but I never saw anything. Later, Hanna told me that glass art, once a mainstay of the publication, had become too niche. “It’s something I’d like to cover but… I pay attention to the data and the numbers,” he said. “And when I cover glass art, the audience doesn’t really respond to it.”"
Medium.com,Life,Can Cannabis Cause Paranoia?,Cannabis,https://medium.com/quality-cbd/can-cannabis-cause-paranoia-68b21a9adc8d?source=topic_page---------208------------------1," In today’s culture cannabis is often associated with paranoia, specifically when referring to THC. Images are often conjured of stoners eating trays of brownies while calling the cops. But is there any scientific evidence that backs up this way of thinking? Read on to find out. Before delving into the association between cannabis and paranoia, let’s get a good handle on what paranoia is. Paranoia is defined as feelings and thoughts that are related to persecution, threat or conspiracy. Although having occasional feelings of paranoia is normal, it can also be a symptom of a mental or psychotic disorder. When paranoia affects someone to a point where they are convinced their paranoid thoughts are a reality, this is considered a delusional disorder. A delusional disorder will impact a person’s thoughts but will not affect the way they function in everyday life although it may cause personal relationships to deteriorate. Signs of paranoia include mistrust, suspicion, fear, anger and feelings of betrayal. Behaviors may manifest as mistrust, hypervigilance, difficulty with forgiveness, defensiveness and the inability to relax. THC (tetrahydrocannabinol) is the cannabinoid that is most closely associated with feelings of paranoia. This may be due to its mind altering effects which can make a user think that things are not as they seem. However, not all users report feelings of paranoia, so is there any truth in this? Can these feelings be backed by scientific evidence? Another good question to ask is how prone users who experience paranoia when taking THC are as likely to experience paranoia when they are not affected by the cannabinoid? And, are people who experience paranoia more likely to use THC in general? This may be best answered by the findings of a study conducted by Psychology Today. The study was done along with the University of Oxford, The Institute of Psychiatry at King’s College London and the University of Manchester. The subjects of the study were individuals who had taken cannabis before and were prone to paranoid ways of thinking but had not been diagnosed with a mental disorder. 70% of the subjects were given THC while the other 30% were given a placebo. They were then asked to answer a questionnaire to determine paranoid behavior. Results showed that feelings of paranoia increased in those who were given THC. Those same subjects also experienced anxiety, lowered mood and negative thoughts. Feelings of paranoia wore off as the drug became reduced in the bloodstream. Digging a bit deeper, psychologists involved in the study believe that THC’s negative effects on mood left them feeling vulnerable inviting feelings of worry. When we experience these negative feelings, we try to understand what’s happening to us and our environment can seem like a hostile place prompting paranoia. Of course, not everyone experiences paranoia when using THC. In fact, many people turn to it as a way to treat anxiety and anxiety related disorders like PTSD. So how can THC do both? When cannabinoids enter our system, they bind to receptors in the brain, many of which are located in the amygdala, a part of the brain involved in emotional processing. Its effects can manifest in different ways depending on the individual. For some, it can over excite neural pathways to cause anxiety and paranoia. Researchers are still trying to determine why THC affects different people in different ways. But it has been suggested that it is related to the way THC reacts with the endocannabinoids in our bodies. Endocannabinoids are produced naturally in the body and THC interacts with them to produce a number of effects and benefits. It has been shown that those who have been exposed to excessive stress and trauma have a shortage of endocannabinoids. THC replenishes these endocannabinoids to relieve stress. On the other hand, those who have a normal amount of endocannabinoids may have an excess when THC is introduced which can lead to feelings of anxiety and paranoia. However, there are other factors that can contribute to the likelihood that you will experience paranoia when using THC. Users who are just starting out with THC and have not built up any kind of resistance will be more likely to become paranoid. Other factors like your genetic background, gender, personality and environment can also make you more prone to anxiety in general. Paranoia is also more likely to occur when higher doses are being consumed. Studies have shown that those who took 7.5 milligrams of THC felt a reduction of stress while those who took 12.5 mg reported negative emotions and were more likely to think of tasks as threatening or dangerous. Age is another factor that can affect the amount of paranoia we feel. As we age, our endocannabinoid system changes. So, if you smoked pot in college and it mellowed you out, don’t be surprised to find it causes feelings of paranoia when you pick it back up later in life. THC has long been recognized as a popular cannabinoid that can produce mind altering effects and can also provide benefits in the human body. In more recent times, it’s sister cannabinoid, CBD (cannabidiol) has been become widely recognized for the benefits it can provide as well. CBD is a non-psychoactive cannabinoid which has been shown to reduce anxiety. When used with THC, it can provide a balance that can reduce feelings of paranoia. When CBD enters the body, it reacts with the endocannabinoid system to produce feelings of calmness. It works with the CB1 receptor to increase serotonin levels to increase feelings of happiness. It has shown to be effective in decreasing anxiety in several animal studies. CBD also modulates the receptor signaling associated with THC. It modulates excess cannabinoid activity in the brain that can cause anxiety working to mitigate paranoia that can result from THC overconsumption. The way CBD interacts with THC also has other effects on the high you experience. It enhances its pain relieving abilities but can diminish certain other effects like the munchies, sleepiness and the psychoactive effects it provides. There are several cannabinoids present in the cannabis plant and CBD and THC are not the only ones being recognized for the benefits they can provide. CBG (cannabigerol) is another cannabinoid that turns into other cannabinoids like CBD and THC. When used in its pure form, CBG has similar effects when compared to CBD. It works to reduce anxiety and can also counter the paranoia inducing effects of THC. CBN (cannabinol) is another cannabinoid you may be hearing about more often. It is produced when THC is heated or exposed to oxygen. It works to provide sedative effects and can be especially effective when combined with THC. These effects can work to counter feelings of paranoia and anxiety. Although THC is known to increase feelings of paranoia in some people, it can also provide several benefits. Its ability to increase appetite in cancer patients, relieve pain and promote brain health are just a few of the reasons it can be recommended to improve overall health. If you are using THC for the health benefits it can provide, but are looking to avoid feelings of paranoia, here are some suggestions: · Use the Right Strain: Different strains of THC have different chemical makeups and each one will produce different results in your body. If you are experiencing paranoia with one strain, try using another which may provide more calming effects. In general, using a strain that is low in THC and high in CBD or another balancing cannabinoid should limit paranoia. · Find a Comfortable Setting: Your location will affect feelings of paranoia and anxiety. If you are using THC, do so in a place that is relaxing and that you associate with positive feelings. · Go Easy on the Dosage: Because THC is more likely to cause paranoia when taken at higher doses, it is best to limit your usage to lower doses. If you are taking THC for health issues and are not experiencing the desired results at lower doses, increase the dosage gradually. This will help your body to build up a tolerance which will also reduce paranoia. · Fresh Air: If you are experiencing paranoia while under the influence of THC, fresh air can do wonders in clearing your head. Take a walk in a park or a naturally soothing area taking deep breaths as you do so. · Stay Hydrated: Staying hydrated allows us to think more clearly. Be sure to keep water close by if you are using THC. Tea can be even more effective since it is known for its soothing properties. · Take a Bath or Shower: A bath or shower will give you a moment to collect your thoughts and it will make your body feel better while you do so. THC can provide several health benefits, but it can also lead to feelings of paranoia in many people. To avoid these unpleasant feelings, keep doses low, use THC in a relaxing atmosphere and do your best to counter anxiety inducing effects with other cannabinoids. Good luck finding the balance that is right for you."
Medium.com,Life,Cannabis & Cryptocurrency: Cryptocurrencies Powering The Marijuana Industry,Cannabis,https://medium.com/buidl-school/cannabis-cryptocurrency-cryptocurrencies-powering-the-marijuana-industry-30be27df2d4f?source=topic_page---------209------------------1," 👉 Build Your First Smart Contract On Ethereum With Solidity… If we take a look into the modern world of finances, there are currently two growing markets so unconventional, that they weren’t even considered legal forms of business little over a decade ago: Cannabis and Cryptocurrencies. Both sectors have solidly demonstrated to be more than profitable individually, each with an incredible potential to develop into what might be some of the very best fields to invest in times to come. Human kind is constantly changing and evolving, so it should come as no surprise that products like medical/recreational cannabis or financial alternatives like cryptocurrencies, are well liked nowadays amongst modern societies, consumers and of course, investors. Scientific research has certified medical cannabis as a real contender, when paired against multimillion pharmaceuticals who produce opioid-based drugs. Add the ever growing market of legalised recreational cannabis into the mix, and the final product certainly becomes a force to be reckoned with when considering future investment possibilities. Simultaneously, technological developments in the field of cryptocurrencies, such as complex computer programming and self-developing artificial intelligence, have allowed individuals to become part of an intricate virtual online network. One where they can perform endless financial transactions between themselves, without the participation (nor fees) of third parties like banks or even regular, physical currency. Said advancements in technology also make online finances quite safe due to constantly upgraded verification under untraceable processes of all cryptocurrency transactions. As a result, enthusiasts and investors worldwide are becoming more confident, making cryptocurrencies a market of unstoppable growth, in spite of the volatility it may go through in the process. When it comes to cryptocurrencies and cannabis, you could say the paradigm of art “imitating life or vice versa” could be considered valid. In the modern market of finances, solidly established cryptocurrency developing organizations, as well as more conservative or relatively newcomers to the business, are beginning to explore the world of legal cannabis finances. The same has occurred with different ranking players in the marijuana stock market, who have decided to venture themselves into the cryptocurrency field as investors and/or active participants. Due to the undeniable overlap between these two types of businesses, it’s only natural that they end up merging in various ways. Everyday new cannabis/cryptocurrency “hybrid” companies are coming out with some type of cannabis-related cryptocurrency. What they all seem to have in common is that their surge in popularity (figures), comes from the interests and needs of an ever evolving world. Please join me as we go deeper into ten of the most popular and successful ICO’s / STO’s related to the cannabis market. As one of the earliest cannabis cryptocurrencies to have ever come out, PotCoin was initially launched as a Canadian coin used to pay for marijuana related goods and services. It became the first decentralized cryptocurrency, specifically designed to facilitate payment solution by assisting with inconvenient and complicated banking procedures in the legal cannabis market. It started as a project to capitalize on Colorado´s cannabis legalization movement. They have always tried to be innovative, they even installed a PotCoin Automatic Teller Machine at a Colorado dispensary. PotCoin has also participated in different interesting marketing campaigns, in order to advertise the project worldwide. Their team has partnered with celebrities like Dennis Rodman, who has openly promoted this particular coin, and Charlie Sheen, for whom they developed a whole line of vaporizers and cannabis products called “Sheenius”. You can buy, sell, and trade PotCoin using PotWallet and other crypto exchanges like Bittrex and CoinExchange, Changelly, and their very own PotcoinTrade. FIRST ANNOUNCED: January 21, 2014 MAXIMUM COIN SUPPLY: 420 million MARKET CAP: $4,177,607 WEBSITE: http://www.potcoin.com Together with PotCoin, HempCoin was also among the first 30 currencies developed in 2014. HempCoin is not just for cannabis, as it is built on the source of Bitcoin. It is a highly focused digital currency, designed to be used by medical-recreational dispensaries and marijuana growers, as well as tobacco, cannabis and hemp harvesters. HempCoin has always tried to participate in the marijuana agriculture and farming trade business, to the fullest. It was the first cannabis cryptocurrency created for farmers rather than consumers, its original purpose being to facilitate purchasing farming supplies in bulk through THC coin. In fact, some cultivators have already started using the HempCoin to get paid for their crops. In 2019, HempCoin plans to introduce its own payment platform HempPay, to buy cannabis from dispensaries. HempPay will serve as a website, an app, as well as a cryptocurrency credit card. THC is available as a cryptocurrency for trade on Bittrex, Nova Exchange and qTrade. FIRST ANNOUNCED: January 2014 MAXIMUM COIN SUPPLY: 300 Million MARKET CAP: $3,024,814 WEBSITE: http://hempcoin.org Unlike many of the cannabis cryptocurrencies currently available, Paragon is not for purchasing marijuana. Instead, PRG token was developed to help different marijuana businesses grow. They founded ParagonSpace a cannabis co-working space in Los Angeles. In order for all cannabis companies to pay rent there, Paragon developed ParagonCoin (PRG), the only currency accepted at ParagonSpace, whether you are leasing an office or simply buying some snacks in the facilities. Eventually, Paragon expects their Ethereum-based cryptocurrency to work for business to customer interactions, apart from business to business transactions. Furthermore, the ParagonChain hopes to provide clients with smart contracts that cater to the needs of cannabis companies. This could mean anything from recording cannabis lab testing results, to filling a doctor-issued medical marijuana prescription. The most active exchange trading Paragon is Tidex. Although it is not mineable, detailed transactions of Paragon can be found on block explorers such as etherscan.io, ethplorer.io, and enjinx.io. FIRST ANNOUNCED: August 15, 2017 MAXIMUM COIN SUPPLY: 165 million MARKET CAP: $11,310,140 WEBSITE: https://paragoncoin.com This particular cannabis cryptocurrency operates on the Waves blockchain. Tokes main goal is to remove cash entirely form all weed supply chain and customer transactions. Employees and suppliers in the industry can recive Tokes tokens as payment, instead of accepting exclusively cash or regular currency Tokes is AML and KYC compliant. This means that the Tokes platform abides by anti-money laundering policies and customer financial processes, to prevent money laundering. Apart from streamlining businesses and reducing costs, Tokes provides the same kind of security to a financial institution, compliant to financial industry regulatory authorities. You can purchase TKS tokens, keep them in a Waves blockchain Wallet and use them as currency at authorized dispensaries. Tokes is also designing an app that will allow its users to research crucial information like strains and cost, in addition to locating dispensaries and buying cannabis with just a click. Bittrex is the most active exchange trading Tokes Platform. FIRST ANNOUNCED: November 23, 2016 MAXIMUM COIN SUPPLY: 50 million MARKET CAP: $1,095,138 WEBSITE: https://tokesplatform.org/ DopeCoin was founded by Adam Howell or ‘Dopey’. According him, their “mission is to provide marijuana enthusiasts with a modern and secure way of doing business for the 21’st century”. In other words, DopeCoin’s aim is to work with any sort of weed business, legal or otherwise. In spite of being renamed into DopeCoin Gold, its goal has always been the same since its conception in 2014: Provide consumers with alternatives to buy cannabis anonymously without paying fees for transactions. Furthermore, DOPE allows access to quality advertising channels that meet and serve the needs of the industry. At DopeCoin, whether you are buying cannabis from a licensed dispensary or a black market online shop is irrelevant. Distributors in both the United States and Europe now accept DopeCoin payments. It is possible convert other cryptocurrencies to DopeCoin on Bittrex but DopeCoin has their own cryptocurrency wallet. FIRST ANNOUNCED: February 15, 2014 MAXIMUM COIN SUPPLY: 116.8 million MARKET CAP: $643,521 WEBSITE: http://www.dopecoin.com Another cannabis cryptocurrency that came into being in 2014. Part of CannabisCoin’s main objective is to make both cryptocurrency and cannabis more socially acceptable CannabisCoin was created as a proof-of-work, peer-to-peer open source currency, to simplify payment interactions between business and consumers, by making transactions smoother and easier for medical cannabis dispensaries/customers. Initially, it was created for marijuana patients to acquire their medication. CannabisCoin has certainly focused on its market, making a proposal to convert cryptocurrency directly into marijuana through its “Yes we CANN” promotional campaign. A line of marijuana medication and cannabis strains grown of the specific purpose of exchange at the rate of 1 gram of medication for every CannabisCoin, under the name “CANNdy”. The most active exchanges trading CannabisCoin are Bittrex, Cryptopia and YoBit. Address and transactions of CannabisCoin can be seen on block explorers such as chainz.cryptoid.info FIRST ANNOUNCED: October 19, 2014 MAXIMUM COIN SUPPLY: 106 Million MARKET CAP: $425,348 WEBSITE: http://cannabiscoin.net/ As described by its founders, Cannacoin is “a group of cannabis enthusiasts working towards the future development of cryptocurrency applications related to cannabis production, seed production, extract production, glass blowing facilities, vape and dab station manufacturing, crypto development, and more.” It is an open-source cannabis altcoin that runs on its own decentralized blockchain.

Medium.com,Life,Curating cannabis with your personal data,Cannabis,https://roughdraft.review/curating-cannabis-with-your-personal-data-7853c478a2d7?source=topic_page---------210------------------1," The legalization of an industry that has been operating in the dark for decades, in this case cannabis, means ample newfound opportunity for government and corporate-funded collaboration, development and research. In recent years, Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning have exploded onto the market, whether through products like Google Home and Amazon Alexa, or as means for targeted advertising. The bridging of personalization technology to cannabis would not only push the boundaries of access to alternative medicine, but also promise a boutique experience much like Uber and food-delivery services. Currently, the data that corporations collect through machine learned artificial intelligence is primarily used to better understand its consumers, whether for their own purposes or to sell to other companies. The aim is to drive revenue through targeted advertising, which is based on an individual’s derived profile. Most often, the data stays within corporate powers; the user is unaware of how their data is analyzed and used. In this context, there would be an important shift: the data would become the product that users are purchasing. Imagine, in relations to the cannabis industry, if customers had access to an app that uses an algorithm to recommend the most suitable strain based on their needs calculated from their personal data. In this personalization model, the company directly generates revenue from the consumer by providing a service that involves the analysis of the consumer’s data, which is then given back to the consumer. In the previous model of ad targeting, revenue is generated in layers by throwing ads at an individual that align with their profile in hopes that they are persuaded enough to then act on their consumption. In a 2018 The Guardian article by Arwa Mahdawi, she explains that Spotify helps marketers target consumers with adverts tailored to the mood they’re in through data analytics of “the sort of music you’re listening to, coupled with where and when you’re listening to it, along with third-party data that might be available.” Expanding on this notion, it is likely that data analytics will advance to provide even more accurate examination of one’s mood, insofar as it can even understand the complexities of one’s health status, chemical balances and even predict how an individual will likely be feeling in the near future. We have already been involuntarily inundated with data collecting apps, such as Apple’s default Health, Maps and Calendar apps. A decade from now, the amount of data that individuals will have generated, in combination with technological advancement, will no doubt pave the way for precise diagnosis of one’s emotional and physical conditions. A combination of data from some basic apps alone — such as an exercise tracking app, music app and Internet browsing app — provide copious information about an individual’s physical and emotional states. A quick example: I use a menstrual cycle tracking app that accurately predicts — to the day — when my menstruation will begin and end. Paired with a cannabis app, this could be used to prescribe a strain high in pain relief for the dates of my expected menstruation. Or, to take it one step further, it could also mine my calendar to know that I attend yoga classes, and thus suggest that I go to a studio that offers weed yoga sessions. In a broader sense, it could predict spikes in my stress and depression levels based on upcoming school exam dates, logged in my calendar, and the music I have been listening to. In combination with enhanced personalization, instant-deliverable technology would allow the product to be received just minutes after ordering. This function is crucial, as it keeps prescriptions relevant to your specific needs at that specific time. The service would commission drones to complete a delivery (much like Uber), picking up the goods from the nearest warehouse, privatized distributor, or government-sanctioned pharmacy. A decade ago, same day delivery would have been deemed outrageous, yet Amazon Prime has proved that entirely wrong. A decade from now, deliverables are bound to reach even higher speeds at higher volume. Though data collection summons many ethical concerns regarding privacy, it also provides extensive opportunity to improve our day-to-day lives. If technology can determine that I am sad because Spotify shows that I’ve been listening to Kanye’s 808s & Heartbreak on repeat and Maps reveals that I’m frequenting the cinema for tearjerkers, then we are only a stone’s throw away from technology that can evaluate our most complex medical histories and use it in conjunction with our recreational habits to better prescribe alternative medicines like cannabis. In an ever-growing effervescent digital world, it seems likely that society will continue to latch onto the use of cannabis products — whether as a form of escapism or to counteract the effects of a tirelessly on-the-go world."
Medium.com,Life,"OTD in History… March 22, 1765, Britain institutes the Stamp Act first direct tax on the colonies",Cannabis,https://medium.com/@BonnieKGoodman/otd-in-history-march-22-1765-britain-institutes-the-stamp-act-first-direct-tax-on-the-colonies-beaad0272c97?source=topic_page---------211------------------1," By Bonnie K. Goodman, BA, MLIS On this day in history March 22, 1765, Britain implements the Stamp Act the first direct tax on the American colonies, taxing and forcing a stamp to be placed on any paper sold or used in the colonies. This was the third tax Britain imposed on the colonies to pay for the debt Britain incurred during the Seven Years’ War (1756–1763) with France fought in the colonies as the French-Indian War. Britain took over the Indian population from the French in the Allegheny Mountains, the natives were hostile to British colonists and Britain decided it needed to maintain a standing army in the colonies as a defense. In 1763, in Pontiac’s Rebellion, Ottawa chief Pontiac led an uprising with tribes all over the frontier from the North in the Great Lakes to the South and Mexico defending their “hunting grounds.” The uprising made Britain need to keep at least 10,000 troops at all times, which would cost £220,000 per year. (Findling, 65) In 1763, Britain issued the proclamation of 1763 that forbade colonists from settling beyond the Appalachian Mountains. A separate agreement would create a boundary with the natives and then gradually colonists would be able to settle in the west. Colonists objected but as historian Thomas C. Mackey notes, “Instead of viewing the Line and the troops as a beneficial measure, the colonials viewed the policy as an affront to their own interests.” (Findling, 65) Britain looked to cover the cost of the standing army and the debt from the war with France, which now stood at £147 million. Prime Minister George Grenville decided to look to the colonies to carry the burden particularly taxing imports. After years of the monarchy and the Board of Trade’s policy of salutary neglect, Britain looked to tax the colonies. Britain had the war debt and huge expanse of territory to deal with now and the costs associated with its administration and defense. The young monarch King George III, looked to counter policies of his predecessor and wanted to take a harder stance on the colonies. Grenville agreed because he wanted to reduce the debt at any “means possible.” (Findling, 60) However, Grenville did not force to the colonies to pay the entire war debt from the French-Indian War and he also imposed new taxes in Britain. Grenville believed it was within the rights of Parliament to tax the colonies. Historians John E. Findling and Frank W. Thackeray in their book Events That Changed America in the Eighteenth Century point out, “The chain of events that led ultimately to the American Revolution began in 1763, during Grenville’s ministry.” (Findling, 60) First, in 1763, Grenville had Parliament pass An Act for the Encouragement of Officers Making Seizures, creating a new vice-admiralty court in Halifax to enforce customs and punish smugglers. Then the British Parliament added new taxes and passed the Sugar Act in 1764 imposing duties on “foreign sugar, textiles, coffee, indigo, rum, wine.” (Remini, 32) The Sugar Act replaced the Molasses Act of 1733, that act was not enforced as the Sugar Act was being “rigorously enforced.” Grenville had the tax lowered by half from “six pence to three pence” believing he would end with more fund s without the ability to smuggle, bribe and circumvent the tax. (Findling, 67) While Britain looked to gain “£45,000 annually” from the colonies with the duties. Colonists would rather boycott out of principle the items including liquors and colonial favorite Madeira wine from Portugal. The Sugar Act of 1764 marked a drastic change in Britain’s relationship with the North American colonies but also the empire. Historian Robert Remini claims, “The Sugar Act was not simply a customs duty but a program that threatened to disrupt American trade and the livelihood of thousands.” (Remini, 32) Mackey goes further arguing, “The Sugar Act of 1764 must be recognized as the point when British colonial policy regarding the North American colonies altered…. With the Sugar Act, Parliament deliberately taxed the colonies to raise revenue for the empire — an action not previously undertaken by Parliament. In addition, colonials had to pay the tax, a tax dictated by Parliament and not approved by their own local colonial governments. This parliamentary action was new. It marked a turning point in imperial relations both for what it actually achieved (the Sugar Act actually raised far less revenue than Grenville had hoped it would) and for the many questions it raised about the relationship of colonies (potentially any colonies throughout Britain’s worldwide empire) to Parliament and the Crown. Britain’s Sugar Act did not seek merely to regulate commerce between the home country and its overseas colonies; it sought to raise revenue for the empire.” (Findling, 67–68) Not enough in 1765, the British Parliament passed the Stamp Act the first direct tax on the colonies. When Grenville first introduced the Sugar Act on March 9, 1764, he also floated the idea of a stamp act to Parliament, proposing, “it may be proper to charge certain Stamp duties in the said Colonies and Plantations.” (Middlekauff, 70) Grenville remained vague throughout the spring of 1764 and did not have the Secretary of State for the Southern Department notify colonial governors before presenting the act to Parliament as was usual procedure. Grenville ignored giving the colonies the chance to create their own taxes as historian Robert Middlekauff points out in his book The Glorious Cause: The American Revolution, 1763–1789 “what Grenville had in mind was taxation by Parliament. (Middlekauff, 71) On February 6, 1765, Grenville appeared before Parliament about the creation of a stamp act. There was little debate in the House of Commons with the only representative speaking out against the act, Colonel Isaac Barré had served in the colonies, he had firsthand knowledge and defended the colonists calling them “those Sons of Liberty.” (Findling, 69) Thomas Whately wrote the act presented to Parliament on February 13, 1765, where it had its first reading, the act received its second reading on February 15. By then “colonies and colonial agents” sent “petitions,” to stop or “postpone” the bill but Grenville ignored the colonies. On February 17, 1765, the House of Commons passed the bill with a 205 to 49 vote, and on March 8, the House of Lords unanimously passed the bill and George III gave royal approval on March 22, 1765. (Findling, 70) The tax in the form of a stamp impressed in the paper would be levied on all paper items including “newspapers, legal documents, contracts, playing cards, marriage licenses, land deeds,” among others. (Remini, 32) The Stamp Act also affected “cards, dice, pamphlets, newspapers, and almanacs.” The act affected the legal profession the most but also “merchants and businessmen, journalists, and clergymen,” with attorney licenses costing the most at £10. (Findling, 60, 69) Colonists could not escape the tax and although mostly not that much it was the principle of Parliament taxing them. (Findling, 70) The Stamp Act would go into effect on November 1, 1765. The act also had a religious provision stating, the act would cover legal documents associated with “exercising ecclesiastical jurisdiction,” which led many colonists to fear that Britain intended to impose Anglican Bishops on them. Britain further imposed and inconvenienced the colonists by issuing the Quartering Act on March 24, 1765. The act would require colonists to provide provisions and “lodging for troops stationed” in their areas. The troops could take and use unused buildings such as inns. Colonists would be forced to do so without any compensation. New York was most affected because the military headquarters were located in the colony. The colonist felt their freedom was threatened in that they were required to pay for a standing army and that army could be used to enforced Parliament laws including the Stamp Act. As Mackey explains, “In this way, then, the Quartering Act threatened the colonists’ property and their rights, and coming on the heels of the Stamp Act, the Quartering Act appeared part of a plan to use troops to impose parliamentary taxes on them.” (Findling, 70) Colonists resisted and protested the act. On May 30 and 31, 1765, young lawyer Patrick Henry in the Virginia House of Burgesses introduced resolutions against the Stamp Act and Britain taxing the colonies in a stirring speech on the House floor. Henry wrote, “Resolved, Therefore that the General Assembly of this Colony have the only and sole exclusive Right and Power to lay Taxes and Impositions upon the inhabitants of this Colony and that every Attempt to vest such Power in any Person or Persons whatsoever other than the General Assembly aforesaid has a manifest Tendency to destroy British as well as American freedom.” (Middlekauf, 81) Henry’s impassioned argument caused dissension with the Speaker of the House even stopping him for what he believed was a treasonous argument, Henry, however, did not back down from his resolutions or his position on Parliament taxing the colonies and interring in their autonomy. The newspapers reprinted Virginia’s resolutions and urged their state legislatures to do the same. By the end of 1865, eight colonial lower houses passed similar resolutions against the Stamp Act and the Parliament imposing taxes on the colonies. They boycotted, trade with Britain fell £300,000. Two groups formed to protest, the Sons of Liberty and the Daughters of Liberty. Colonists became violent; the Sons of Liberty forced stamp collectors to resign, turned the locals against stamp supporters and politicians and burned the stamped paper. The violence and riots were so widespread and went unpunished. On August 14, 1765, Boston merchants the Loyal Nine, who opposed the tax and later became the Sons of Liberty, led a mob to attack the home of Andrew Oliver, the Massachusetts stamp tax collector. They burned an effigy of Oliver, then attacked his home with him in it vowing to kill him, until he escaped, then they destroyed his home stealing or burning all his furnishing and even the architectural trimmings of his home. (Findling, 64) On August 26–27, 1765, riots broke first at the customs and admiralty offices at the lieutenant governor and chief justice of Massachusetts Thomas Hutchinson’s home. Hutchinson defended his brother-in-law Oliver during the protests and was a representative of the crown, historians Edmund S. and Helen M. Morgan claim, “a friend of the Stamp Act and the enemy of colonial rights.” (Findling, 64) Hutchinson’s home was one of the finest homes in Boston, an example of the classical style. Hutchinson fled but the rioters stole anything they could carry and destroyed the rest, including silver, furnishing and Hutchinson’s private papers. The rioters went on the roof but it took them hours to destroy the cupola and make a hole in the roof. (Findling, 60–61) Riots continued in the colonies until November and they forced most stamp collectors to quit, while colonial importers refused to pay English merchants and trade with them while the act was valid. On June 8, 1765, The Massachusetts legislature suggested a “general meeting” with delegates from each colony to “to consider of a general and united, dutiful, loyal and humble Representation of their Condition” and to “meet and to take action against the Stamp Act.” (Remini, 32, Findling, 72) Otis would go to coin the phrase “Taxation without representation is tyranny,” which represented the colonists’ struggle. From October 7 to 25, 1765, nine of the twelve colonies met in New York as the Stamp Act Congress with 27 delegates in attendance. Among the colonies attending were Massachusetts, Connecticut, Rhode Island, New York, New Jersey, Pennsylvania, Delaware, Maryland, and South Carolina. John Dickinson of Pennsylvania wrote the “Declaration of Rights and Grievances,” with “thirteen grievances.” (Findling, 73) The declaration urged Parliament to repeal the act and expressed that only their elected state legislature could tax them and not parliament beginning the revolutionary cries of no taxation without representation. The third resolution specifically stated, “That it is inseparately essential to the Freedom of a People, and the undoubted Right of Englishmen, that no Taxes be imposed on them, but with their own Consent, given personally, or by their Representatives.” (Findling, 73) Remini explains, “Thus the delegates to this Stamp Act Congress represented a collection of individual and distinct entities who considered themselves as having rights and powers as Englishmen by which they had full power to enact legislation for the benefit of the people living in their respective colonies.” (Remini, 38) The colonies still pledged allegiance to the crown but at the same time claimed it and Parliament had no right to tax them a contradiction that would take time for the colonies to clarify this contradiction on jurisdiction. The pamphleteers were more to the point as Middlekauf, “The colonists were English, and Englishmen could be governed only by their own consent given through their representatives.” (Middlekauf, 125) The colonists understood that Parliament had a right to exert control over trade but internal taxes should be up to the colonies and their representative government. The infringement on this right led to the colonial rebellion and protests, which the colonies intended to go further if the act was enforced and not repealed. In Britain, Benjamin Franklin “warned Parliament” if they enforce the act with “troops” there will be a “rebellion.” (Remini, 33) Middlekauf notes that “the prolonged crisis that began with the passage of the Stamp Act” led colonial “hard working freemen” to become “committed to constitutional government.” (Middlekauf, 135) A turning point was the appointment of a new Prime Minister Charles Watson-Wentworth, the Marquis of Rockingham, who was more sympathetic to the colonists than Grenville. Additionally, English merchants suffered the most from the protests and boycotts and “pressured” Parliament to repeal the act. The Stamp Act was becoming more of a hindrance and to enforce it Parliament realized military force would be necessary and counterproductive. Early on February 22, 1766, the House of Commons repealed the Stamp Act; the Declaratory bill was compensation to Parliament for repealing the Stamp Act. The House of Commons passed the repeal with a vote of 275 to 167, however, they “unanimously passed” the Declaratory Act proclaiming their authority to tax the colonies. (Findling, 74) The act declared that the colonies “ have been, are, and of right ought to be, subordinate unto and dependent upon the imperial Crown and Parliament of Great Britain” and Parliament had the “full power and authority . . . to bind the colonies and people of America, subjects of the crown of Great Britain, in all cases whatsoever.” (Nevins, 70; Remini, 33) When news of the repeal reached the colonies it was May 1766, and King George III birthday. The colonists celebrated with hearing or being concerned about the Declaratory Act that put the colonies in peril of new taxes by the British Parliament. There were barbeques and drank beer freely, New York’s assembly commissioned an “equestrian statue of George III,” and “a statue of William Pitt,” who passed the repeal through parliament. At a Massachusetts celebration future founding father and president John Adams observed “these affairs ‘tinge the minds of the people; they impregnate them with the sentiments of liberty; they render the people fond of their leaders in the cause, and averse and bitter against all opponents.’” (Findling, 62) In the next decade, the colonies would be faced with Parliament further attempting to exert their influence to tax them. However, the Stamp Act Congress would serve as a forerunner to the Continental Congress, which would ultimately lead to independence. As Mackey indicates, “The Stamp Act crisis succeeded in one other important area: it unified the previously disparate colonies in ways they had never experienced before. Instead of believing that each colony’s primary tie was to Great Britain, the Stamp Act crisis and the Stamp Act Congress suggested that intercolonial issues were of primary importance.” (Findling, 75) Historians Edmund S. Morgan and Helen M. Morgan in their classic and definitive book, The Stamp Act Crisis: Prologue to Revolution, claim the significance in the Stamp Act and the colonial reaction is that “social movements must ultimately be measured by their impact on politics, on law, and on the constitutions that direct lawmaking and politics. In the ideas and ideals that animate politics and find their way into laws and constitutions, we discover a people’s understanding of themselves, including the crucial ideas that enable them to think of themselves as a people… For a collection of human beings to be or become a people, to learn to see themselves as a people, is not a simple matter. The ideas generated by the Stamp Act crisis were crucial to the creation of that vision among Americans of all kinds.” (Morgan, viii) The convening of the Stamp Congress, Franklin’s warning and the colonies reaction proved that colonies could rally and rebellion was possible if Parliament continued to exercise their right to taxation without representation on the colonies. Just over a decade, later the colonies would have enough, they would unite to form the First and Second Continental Congresses and their military rebellion would lead the start of the American Revolution. The “Shot Heard Round the World” with the first Battles of Lexington and Concord on April 19, 1775, and then a year later on July 2, 1776, they would declare independence as the United States of America.

Medium.com,Life,What Is CBD Oil?,Cannabis,https://medium.com/genius-labs-cbd-wholesale/what-is-cbd-oil-cea1274b2b99?source=topic_page---------212------------------1," There are many different components to the cannabis plant. In fact, there are over 400 different chemical compounds in cannabis or marijuana - and they are just the ones we know about. Although cannabis contains many active constituents such as terpenes and flavonoids, the compounds that most modern science is concerned about are cannabinoids. They are the most mysterious and complex aspects of the plant, and it is using these cannabinoids that we create CBD oil among a myriad of other products. CBD, along with other cannabinoids, account for a lot of the therapeutic characteristics of cannabis as a plant. It is one of the most well known and well studied cannabinoids, and is being investigated for its anti cancer, anti-inflammatory and anti-seizure properties — just to name a few. And in case you had not already gathered, this cannabinoid is the main ingredient in CBD oil. Although humans have been cultivating cannabis for millenia and harvesting it for its remedial properties, we did not isolate CBD until the 1940s. It came about in the laboratory of American organic chemist, Roger Adams. However, although aware that he had isolated a compound from cannabis, he was unable to identify exactly which compound it was. Later, in the 1960s, Raphael Mechoulam, Israeli chemist, isolated CBD and defined its chemical structure. By the time the chemical structure of CBD was well known in medical circles, it had already been outlawed across the USA. The War On Drugs saw the end of CBD as a remedial substance until most recently, when the inquiry into its efficacy as a medical substance came back into question. In 2003, CBD was first patented by the US government, and in 2018, the Farm Bill was finally signed, making hemp-derived CBD legal across the country. The chemical structure of CBD is not unlike its famous counterpart, THC — which is probably why Roger Adams had no idea what he had isolated. It is almost exactly the same as THC, only that CBD contains an additional hydroxyl group where THC’s cyclic ring would otherwise have been. CBD is synthesized within the cannabis plant in a number of steps. The chemical starts out as a combination of geranyl pyrophosphate and olivetolic acid. For these two to bind together, an enzyme-catalysed chemical reaction takes place, resulting in a cannabigerolic acid (CBGA) molecule. The final step takes place when a large number of CBDA synthase molecules are present, finally converting CBGA into cannabidiol carboxylic acid (CBDA). CBDA is simply CBD with an additional carboxylic acid. The transformation from CBDA to CBD takes place after something decarboxylation (removal of the carboxylic acid). This generally takes place upon consumption, as heating promotes decarboxylation, such as in the case of smoking. However, it may also be decarboxylated prior to consumption, such as putting cannabis in the oven prior to making edibles. In any case, heat is required to convert CBDA to CBD. CBD is arguably more complicated in its mechanism of action than THC. This is because it does not follow the conventional pathway into the endocannabinoid system the same way that THC does. Rather, it uses multiple different pathways and exerts its actions in a much more peripheral manner. The endocannabinoid system is the main target of ingested cannabinoids. It is made up of cannabinoid receptors that live all over the nervous system, the immune system, the skin and the stomach, among many other places. However, CBD does not have a particular affinity for cannabinoid receptors and does not trigger them the same way that THC does. CBD binds to technically non-binding sites on the cannabinoid receptor, inhibiting its action. This makes CBD an antagonist to the CB1 receptor, unlike THC which stimulates it as an agonist. This is important, because inhibition of these receptors plays a role in maintaining normal brain activity. For example, CBD’s inhibitory behavior on CB1 receptor stops the release of glutamate, an excitatory neurotransmitter. THe reduction of glutamate between neurons reduces seizures, giving CBD great potential as a treatment for epilepsy. In another example, CBD inhibits the action of enzyme, FAAH. This enzyme is responsible for the reuptake of anandamide, a natural endocannabinoid that plays a role in memory, appetite and mood. By inhibiting the behavior of this enzyme, anandamide levels are increased in the brain. This is a positive response, as anandamide is considered to be a “bliss” neurotransmitter. Essentially, CBD affects the human endocannabinoid system. However, it doesn’t generally do so by exciting it. This is more the work of THC. Rather, CBD’s effects are contrary to that, inhibiting many excitatory actions of the endocannabinoid system. This can restore an endocannabinoid system and rectify dysfunctions, many of which lead to debilitating conditions such as depression, Crohn’s disease and anxiety. CBD oil is a relatively new invention, even if cannabis has been used by humans for millennia. The conventional way to extract cannabinoids was using alcohol, in which case all cannabinoids, terpenoids and flavonoids made it into the final product. However, thanks to modern technology, we are now able to create a CBD product that is entirely THC-free. There are many different ways to extract CBD from the hemp or marijuana plant. The most common way is by using a solvent such as CO2 or butane. Cannabinoids, including CBD and THC, are not soluble in water, meaning an appropriate solvent must be chosen. Usually, the solvent is pushed through the plant material under high pressure. The product is an oily like substance, rich with cannabinoids, terpenes, terpenoids and flavonoids. However, for pure CBD oil, this is not the last step. The last step is involved and complicated, requiring CBD to be removed from the rest of the compounds in the plant material. Finally, when all other compounds have been removed, CBD is all that remains, looking much like a mineral such as salt. This is called CBD isolate, and is basically pure CBD. This is then dissolved into consumable oils such as medium-chain triglycerides (MCT) or fractionated coconut oil. It is then ready for consumption. Sometimes, CBD is extracted from hemp, in which case the final step is not entirely necessary. This is because hemp is naturally devoid of THC or contains negligible amounts (less than .3%). Marijuana, on the other hand, is rich with THC and other cannabinoids, making it necessary to remove THC in the extraction process. When CBD oil is created from hemp, it is not completely necessary to arrive at CBD isolate. Rather, the oily substance that remains after extraction is called full-spectrum. As well as CBD, it contains the terpenes present in hemp as well as the flavonoids. These are therapeutic in their own right, and for many consumers, a full-spectrum product is desirable. However, if CBD is being extracted from marijuana, then it is important to take the additional step to remove THC. This ensures a product that is non-psychoactive and contains higher volumes of CBD. CBD has a myriad of medical applications in the human body. This is because its target is the main regulating system of the human body: the endocannabinoid system. This is essentially why CBD is able to target so many different pathologies in the body. Rather than targeting a specific organ, it moves through the system which regulates the body, affecting many different aspects of the human body all at once. It is also non-psychoactive, making it a viable option to those who are THC sensitive such as elderly and children. CBD may have the following medical applications: In general, many of the conditions that afflict modern society are caused by one of the factors on this list. For example, rheumatoid arthritis and fibromyalgia are caused by lengthy exposure to chronic inflammation. Although CBD is not necessarily listed as a medical intervention for rheumatoid arthritis, it may benefit those who have it because of its anti-inflammatory properties. These potent therapeutic qualities of CBD make it a potential medicine for many different kinds of ailments. There are many different ways to use CBD, all of them having different purposes and varying effects. Most are acquainted with CBD oil, an oily liquid that is taken sublingually. However, CBD may also be consumed as an edible, as CBD isolate, it may be vaporized or applied as a topical treatment. Each method of consumption has different results. For example, edible CBD takes longer to take effect but the effects may last much longer. Consuming it in this way also causes a large percentage of cannabinoids to be lost to metabolic processes. On the other hand, vaporizing CBD takes effect immediately but more constant doses may be required. It’s worth noting that consuming it in this way causes the greatest bioavailability (less cannabinoids are lost to physiological processes). CBD isolate is a powdery, crystal like substance that is almost 100% purity. It is the purest form of CBD, and can be consumed as it is or mixed into food or liquid. Finally, as the name suggests, topical application of CBD takes place on the skin. It may be applied on sore muscles or open wounds, having an anti-inflammatory and antimicrobial effect externally. Despite knowing so much about CBD, we certainly do not know it all. As the legalization movement spreads across the USA, we expect that more research will take place and our understanding will grow of this complex cannabinoid. The more we learn and understand, the more we will be able to appropriately apply CBD as a medicine to specific pathologies."

Medium.com,Life,Weed The People,Cannabis,https://medium.com/@chrisyoumans/weed-the-people-ed2946333f0d?source=topic_page---------214------------------1," When I was a senior in high school during the late 1980s, in a small Central California city not too far from where @DevinCow might presumably reside, marijuana was plentiful. So plentiful, in fact, that just about everybody in my core group of friends had at least tried it. One 30-something neighbor kept a bag of bud in his garage freezer, right behind the half-gallon brick of mint chip ice cream. A carpool mom down the street escorted us kids to weekend soccer games in a giant Ford Econoline van conversion that occasionally reeked of weed and Nag Champa. My bestie expertly rolled joints in the middle of a public park with little more than a few dried out nugs, a pack of zig-zags, and a well-worn dollar bill. Yes, the green rush was in full effect, and almost a decade before my home state would first legalize the plant for medical patients. But, to be honest, I wasn’t much of a fan of cannabis back then. One or two hits of who-knows-what strain it was, and I’d be feeling pretty good. But three or more and I was quickly ushered into a dark state of paranoia and social anxiety. I started to avoid the intense internalized pressure of an adolescent puff-puff-pass session, and was soon relegated to the ranks of the nerds and geeks. My bestie still came around, as we’d been tight since seventh grade, but my weekend adventures became more limited and painfully ordinary. Sure, there were the random unsupervised parties at some schoolmate’s house whose folks had gone out of town and left him or her to keep an eye on things for the duration. But my taste for strange alcoholic concoctions in ubiquitous red Solo cups wasn’t any more developed in those days than my body’s tolerance for THC. Maybe I just needed to tattoo a big “L” on my forehead and embrace my lot in life. Oh, the petty problems of a white, middle class, suburban dork! Little did I know then how much marijuana had been, and would continue to be, a lightning rod in the court of public opinion. We were all aware that it was illegal, of course, but none of us seemed even vaguely concerned that we’d be in too much trouble if we were caught. After all, so many of the adult role models among us had been teenagers themselves in a generation swept up in the political turmoil, violence, and global threats of the 1960s. People turned to weed as a way of self-medicating their deep-seated angst (and for a lot of less ominous and more fun reasons too). Yet conservative leadership devised a way to demonize this natural remedy as a scourge on any civil society and, in passing sinister laws with ridiculous criminal penalties, kept millions of predominantly already disadvantaged minorities from realizing their full promise and potential as U.S. citizens. It was, in retrospect, sadly not much different from today’s America. While it’s fair to say that in 2019 we enjoy a much more relaxed attitude toward pot, given the now epic majority of states that allow its medicinal or fully recreational use, there’s still a ton of misinformation out there. I’m no longer surprised by the legions of social media lemmings who wax poetic about all sorts of crazy, rationally disprovable crap; and I try to limit my exposure to as little of it as possible. But in a world where electronic screens now dominate much of our waking moments, seeds of manipulation are much easier to sow and take root than perhaps ever before in modern society. The largest and most detrimental of these being the ones that traffic fear. Nowadays I’m all aboard the terpenoid train, and I’m happy to tell just about anybody who’s willing to hear me out. Having had the good fortune to live in a legal state during the past several years, and with access to an outstanding and seemingly endless number of options for experiencing and experimenting with the efficacy of this healing herb, I can’t and won’t ever go back to the dark ages. The truth about cannabis is that it’s somewhat of a miracle cure, at least in the sense that it’s been used medicinally by humankind for centuries to achieve overwhelmingly positive outcomes. No, it’s probably not for everyone. But now that Canada, Israel, and other forward-thinking nations are conducting extensive and scientifically valid research on the endocannabinoid system, as well as the specific reactive compounds in weed’s many varieties, we’re not long until there’s some comprehensive, legitimized data to prove what many of us 100 percent know to be accurate. What we users also recognize is that we’re all growing indubitably disenchanted with government forces, on either extreme of the increasingly polarized bureaucratic spectrum, that are working to undermine the full acceptance of cannabis and its exponential potential to help people live happier, more productive, and less worrisome lives. I’ll spare everyone my pontification on subjects like the ways alcohol, tobacco, opioids, and other legal drugs have destroyed some of our friends and families; how we live in a democracy heavily tilted toward keeping its most disenfranchised citizens forever down and out; or an exposé on the pathetic and wholly terrifying chapter of our country’s history we’re currently watching unfold by the hour on our networked devices. Instead, from the dweeb who once couldn’t fully appreciate the power of pot, I’ll simply say to anyone who might judge me… absolutely nothing. You’re not worth compromising my zen and faith that the lion’s share of us in this world will get it right. Cannabis can help move society in a much more sustainable, and dare I say phenomenally pleasant direction. That green wave is already in motion. But we can’t stop fighting for change. It’s up to all who agree, to educate others and help eradicate any remaining stigma toward cannabis. We must resist complacency, apathy, or taking the recent and remarkable progress for granted. History obviously can and does repeat. Let’s commit to be on the side of it that made the planet better for both our own and future generations. Because we never backed down and never stopped advocating for every adult citizen’s right to safe, affordable, and robust access to weed. Peace."

As legalization sweeps across the United States and other countries around the world, the industry is suddenly faced with a new problem that didn’t exist before — competition. How can a small edibles entrepreneur compete with Silicon Valley backed start-ups? What about when CBD is readily available at CVS? We saw this same question emerge during the 2000s when app development was booming. Apps and digital products of varying degrees of practicality and usefulness flooded the market, no one really knew where any of it was going, somehow everyone but you was getting rich, and our idea of what a digital experience drastically changed. If you tried to tell someone in the 90s that you were starting a company that allowed strangers from the internet to come sleep in your home, people would have looked at you like you were insane. Now that company is Airbnb. The big differentiator in the tech industry became user experience (UX). The idea was simple and yet difficult to execute–know your users better than anyone else, design experiences they really want, make your products easy to use, and your users will love you. So what can the cannabis industry learn from the recent successes and failures of the tech boom of the last decade? To avoid a price war with CVS brand CBD differentiate with your customer experience. From boutique experiences designed for connoisseurs to the local neighborhood weed shop, know your customer and cater to their particular issues. Give your customers a flawless experience, with solutions designed for their actual problems. Not convinced? Here’s 10 Reasons why the Cannabis and Hemp Industry need customer experience designers (CX). If you found this interesting, give us some claps!

The optimal CBD dosage varies from one individual to another, and finding the right dose for you requires some self-experimentation. The process works something like this:"

Medium.com,Life,5 Things Cannabusiness Owners Should Expect From Federal Marijuana Legalization — TheBluntness,Cannabis,https://medium.com/@thebluntness1/5-things-cannabusiness-owners-should-expect-from-federal-marijuana-legalization-thebluntness-cea462364001?source=topic_page---------221------------------1," Written by Sunshine Lencho With the passing of the Farm Bill in 2018, many business owners have their eye on the “marijuana legalization” prize — expecting that as early as 2020 we may do the unthinkable as a nation: legalize marijuana. While it’s anyone’s guess as to when, there are a few lessons from the legalization of hemp that we can carry over to marijuana discussions to help plan and predict what federal legalization will bring. 1. Legalization Will Not Be Instant When the Farm Bill passed last year, many business owners and consumers assumed that “CBD is legal” and therefore launched full steam ahead towards a new market in cannabinoids that previously weren’t available. And, predictably, they’re now encountering a myriad of issues on the local and national level with hemp-based products. For those of you who aren’t familiar with the Farm Bill, here’s a quick summary: Hemp is defined as cannabis sativa (same plant as cannabis/marijuana) containing less than 0.3% THC (the psychoactive ingredient). After being cultivated from the early years of our democracy, hemp was made illegal and could not be grown or sold except in limited circumstances. With the passage of the 2018 Farm Bill, Congress removed hemp from the definition of marijuana under the Controlled Substances Act and set up a structure for taxing, regulating, and enforcing state and federal hemp laws. The lead agency is the federal Department of Agriculture, however, state hemp programs are permitted to seek federal approval (rather than be preempted by federal law) once the system is set up. We’re still waiting on the implementation of the Farm Bill. Many of you may have noticed that there is enforcement against hemp-CBD based products. This is because while hemp is no longer federally illegal, the actual trade in hemp — interstate commerce — requires several steps before we see a robust hemp-based marketplace. Similarly, we will need to see the various agencies involved in regulating consumer products (think: tobacco, alcohol, and food) launch rulemaking and provide for public feedback before there is anything close to a regulated federal marketplace. And, as those of us who have reviewed federal regulations in the past know, the process is far from simple, the regulations can be onerous (3 columns of 8 pt font per page for hundreds of pages), and there will be far more than industry at the table to shape federal rules on advertising, packaging, dosage and form factors. 2. The Taxes Will Impact the Speed to Lawful, Regulated Markets As was seen in Washington and is we’re now seeing in California — the tax rate set will impact not only consumer appetite for purchasing regulated products, but it will be a potential barrier to entry for those individuals that fed the nation’s demand for cannabis. In Washington and California we see a state tax of nearly 40–50%. This translates into sticker shock for consumers in California, who, prior to the “legalization” of cannabis saw low prices and a wider variety of goods available. Pricing drives choice, and despite the promise of clean, tested cannabis, ultimately the same consumer that felt comfortable going to their bike messenger delivery service prior to legalization is shopping for value, not values. And as we’ve seen in California, the regulated marketplace cannot currently compete with those prices. Adding on the proposed 10–20% seen in some Federal bills would truly create a challenge to those state markets. 3. Licenses Will Be Required Like alcohol, cannabis operations will be a privilege that is afforded those who are able to meet federal standards. While we have yet to see a definitive piece of legislation be debated in congress, the various bills (REFER, Tax Marijuana Like Alcohol, Marijuana Justice Act) provide for such things as who may be qualified to operate a cannabis business, how the federal agencies are to regulate and tax such businesses, and how the transition from the 20-something state-legal markets to a fully federal system will occur. Entrepreneurs and investors alike should pay close attention to the substance of federal legalization bills proposed as that may be the death or growth of your business model/investment. 4. There Will Be More Regulations Currently, operators in the state-legal marijuana marketplace deal with only their state agencies. In states like Washington and Michigan, they are regulated by a single agency. In California, in contrast, we deal with three separate agencies that sometimes promulgate conflicting rules and that individually released hundreds of pages of regulations. Add to that the fact that state regulations seem to change semi-annually (in California’s case they changed six times in one year) we can only expect Federal regulations in the early years of marijuana legalization to be as extensive. As seen with hemp, there will be a lead agency (some proposals place marijuana at the federal level in the Department of Treasury). However, the substance of the regulations will come from sister agencies like the Department of Agriculture and Food and Drug Administration (and possibly the CDC) as they have the expertise in cultivation and safe product production. What will be interesting to see is how the various federal agencies tasked with regulating the extant cannabis industry in the separate states will allow for the continued operation of those industries as federal rules are taking shape. To be sure, there will not be an overnight legalization of trafficking products from one state to the other (the definition of interstate commerce) however it is to be seen whether the existing regulations and products will be permitted by the federal authorities come rule-making. What is clear, though, is the need for industry to take part in educating federal agencies on the form factors, consumption practices and quality assurance standards already in place. We cannot count on our elected officials to have that bandwidth and we should assume that the federal employees at these agencies have absolutely no familiarity with our businesses. 5. The Competition Will Be Global With the U.S. lagging behind our neighbors to the north and south on its cannabis policy, we will likely see importation of brands and goods from Canada and Mexico once we have federal legalization. For those of you unfamiliar with what’s happened in Canada, you should know that (1) Canadians have had access to capital markets in their nation for a few years now allowing for their companies to raise funds while state-legal businesses in the United States have been struggling to find banking solutions, (2) they started adult sales in the fall of 2018 and (3) this came after years of having a lawful medical market where patients received their cannabis products by royal mail. Brands in Canada will have an easier time coming to the U.S. given their regulated market required GMP standards of production, has had time to develop testing standards and will have had the benefit of U.S. and other tourism visiting the cannabis-friendly provincial shops and lounges. Here’s hoping the Canadian government grants reciprocity and we can trade cross border when the time comes!

Medium.com,Life,Getting starting in the marijuana industry. Everything you need to know to open up a dispensary.,Cannabis,https://medium.com/@alexseo/getting-starting-in-the-marijuana-industry-everything-you-need-to-know-to-open-up-a-dispensary-8b7af445ecc6?source=topic_page---------222------------------1," Interested in starting a business in the cannabis industry? I can’t blame you — business is booming and there’s the potential to make huge profits as this sector continues to grow exponentially. Over half of the United States already have legalized cannabis in some form — that’s 29 states plus the District of Columbia. Many states have only legalized cannabis for medical use, but that’s gradually changing as well. Currently, one in five Americans lives in a state where they can use cannabis recreationally, without a doctor’s note. In 2016, marijuana sales in North America grew by a massive 30 percent, and sales are projected to reach $20.2 billion by 2021. This is a huge deal, especially considering the industry is still in its infantile stages. There are still many gaps waiting to be filled by those who are forward-thinking and innovative enough to realize this is a once-in-a-generation opportunity. That said, the path to a successful cannabis business is not a smooth and easy one to navigate — it’s full of confusing laws and regulations, steep taxes, and many other unforeseeable roadblocks and hoops to jump through. That’s why we asked cannabis industry experts (who already have successful and profitable businesses!) for their top advice on starting a “cannabusiness.” Their tips and information will give you a clearer road map and allow you to be more prepared for your exciting journey ahead. When starting a business in any industry, having a unique idea that fills an unmet need is crucial to becoming a success. First, you’ll need to decide which sector of the marijuana industry to go into. Generally, when someone thinks about types of cannabis businesses, dispensaries and grow operations usually come to mind. Many see huge dispensaries in Colorado, for example, raking in big bucks. But this can actually be the riskiest business area to choose, with the tightest profit margins. As the legal use of marijuana continues to grow across the U.S., the price of weed will continue to go down, leaving those with grow-ops and dispensaries with fewer profits as time goes on. They’re also the ones to be hit hardest with a sea of strict rules and regulations. On top of all of that, banks still refuse to work with businesses that grow or distribute marijuana because it is still illegal under federal law. This is sure to change eventually, but for now, you will still need to fundraise enough capital without any loan assistance. How much? Many states require proof of at least $1 million in available cash to obtain a dispensary license. You should also keep in mind that you won’t be able to keep your profits safely stored in a bank account. All businesses that directly deal with cannabis are forced to keep their capital in cold hard cash, which is obviously highly inconvenient and dangerous — though some have been getting around this issue using cryptocurrencies like bitcoin to keep their funds more secure. But the cannabis industry is much more than just grow operations and dispensaries. If you’re a foodie, perhaps look into making a unique edibles line. There are even people opening up “bud and breakfasts” — cannabis-friendly lodging (some even provide marijuana-infused oil massage — sign me up!). But truly, the least risky kind of cannabis business to start is one that doesn’t directly touch the controversial plant at all. According to the Controlled Substances Act, the bulk of the regulations for businesses in the cannabis industry are only applicable to cannabis growers, processors, and sellers. This is why ancillary marijuana businesses are doing so well — they aren’t burdened with all the red tape and high taxes. From hydroponics and cultivation products to professional training and education, consultancies, media companies, the plethora of new technologies — the list is endless, and so are the opportunities. If you’re technical and a savvy inventor, you could design a product that helps marijuana user process or ingest their medicine — think about all the fancy vape pens that have been coming out, or the rosin presses that easily extract solvent-free oil from bud or trim. Alex Collins, CEO of Sapling, a Utah-based marketing strategy firm focused on early-mid-stage development amongst firms in the cannabis industry, explains how essential a viable business idea is for aspiring cannabis entrepreneurs: “When considering starting a business in the cannabis industry, entrepreneurs must first ensure their concept is legally viable and offers a unique solution for the space. Too frequently, a concept is exciting but cannot be supported within the legal framework or is simply a recycled concept that is reliant upon ‘first mover’ advantage in their jurisdiction. For long-term scalable success, a company must be able to withstand the dynamic regulations and business factors in this rapidly changing space.” Marijuana Business Daily put out a useful chart showing the profitability of each type of cannabis business — take a look here. Once you have a winning idea, it’s vital to know who is going to be interested in your products or services and to deeply understand their particular wants and needs. “When starting a cannabis business, two things are crucial: understanding the unique challenges of this industry and understanding your consumer base and the unmet need you are filling for them. The cannabis industry is unlike any industry you have ever worked in, and the regulatory, supply chain, banking, taxation, advertising, and stigma aspects of the business eat your profits and draw your attention away from core aspects of your business. The legal cannabis space is becoming crowded and targeted consumer segmentation is increasingly important, so it’s key to understand who your core consumers are and what they want from their products.” So get out there and do research on how you can ensure your future customers are happy and satisfied with what you offer them. Really get to know and understand them. Build a relationship with them. Do this, and you will develop a loyal consumer base. Krista Whitley, CEO of Altitude Products, a Las Vegas-based conglomerate of cannabis companies such as Social Media Unicorn, a canna-brand marketing and sales agency, and the Vegas Weekend Box, a monthly variety box of Las Vegas’ top cannabis products, agrees that a good relationship with your consumers is essential: “Success in the cannabis industry is uniquely tied to the connection and brand that leadership has with the local cannabis community. It doesn’t matter if you’re starting your cannabis business in Washington, Colorado, or Maine; you should start by building authentic relationships with your local cannabis community.” Even if you have a brilliant business plan, plenty of funding, and excited consumers that want what you’re offering, if you don’t play by the rules, you’re going to get shut down, get hefty fines, and could even go to jail. Let’s try to avoid that, yes? The laws, rules, and regulations for opening a cannabis business are incredibly confusing and complex. It’s recommended to hire an experienced attorney to aid you in navigating this process to make sure your business is legit. Each state has different laws, so go here for a handy state-by-state guide. “Both medical and adult-use businesses require, in most states, a license to operate, which is generally valid in just one state. Thus, your plan needs to comply with state law. The application process will give you a roadmap and likely where you can operate,” explains Norman Olson, director of marketing and Business Affairs at Hightech Extracts, an engineering company developing systems for the manufacturing of extract-based products. “Funding and differentiating your service or brand will definitely help. Pick any consultant you engage only after thorough reference and background checks. Smoking a joint does not make you a cannabis expert!” If you are irresponsible with your new cannabusiness, not only can this cause huge problems for you, but also for the cannabis industry as a whole. When businesses are performing reckless practices, it hurts the reputation of this new industry that still has many negative stigmas against it from the wider public. Arnaud Dumas de Rauly, chief strategy officer for The Blinc Group, the first business incubator for brands specializing in vaporizer and cannabis consumption technologies, advises new cannabis-related businesses to understand the space and pay close attention to industry best practices: “The cannabis industry is new and not yet fully regulated, making it very important for people entering the space to get in touch with their local institutions and industry groups and follow their guidance wisely. The vaping industry was in a similar position a few years ago, and it’s now facing huge regulatory challenges, some specifically caused by entrepreneurs that didn’t take the time to do things right when first setting up their businesses, such as not acquiring licenses, using bad branding, labeling, and sales channels, and marketing to children. For the cannabis industry to grow properly, it’ll need to avoid giving extra ammunition to regulatory agencies and opposition groups that seek to destroy it.” With any startup, investment capital is crucial to getting your business plan off the ground. Some investors don’t want to put their money into cannabis businesses since it’s still illegal under federal law. And, as stated earlier, forget about asking the bank to fund your marijuana business. Focus on finding some great private investors. While some are still wary, there are many investors out there excited about how fast the marijuana industry is exploding with growth, and they want in on the action. Look here and here for starters. Dr. Andrew Kerklaan, president and founder of Dr. Kerklaan Therapeutics, a robust line of doctor-designed, lab-tested, patient-approved cannabis products that provide pain relief, sleep aid, PMS relief, and skin health, agrees: “The days of bootstrapping a start-up in the cannabis industry are quickly coming to an end, if not already over. My advice is to raise smart money with investors who can bring experience and expertise from other industries to the table. Raise enough capital to quickly be able to compete.” It’s a very exciting time to get involved in the cannabis industry. There are boundless opportunities to collaborate with a huge variety of businesses. Hopefully, now you have more of a solid idea of what it takes to start a business in the marijuana industry. Those willing to work hard and play by the rules have the potential to be extremely successful. Follow these guidelines and you will be well on your way to having a profitable business in the cannabis industry. Good luck!

Medium.com,Life,7 Days of CBD,Cannabis,https://medium.com/@victoriamyr/7-days-of-cbd-9996e7bcaaa6?source=topic_page---------224------------------1," If you’ve done any reading into CBD products, you may have noticed that the marketing surrounding it is enthusiastic. They make it sound like a cure-all wonder drug. Allegedly, it reduces pain, calms anxiety, lifts your mood, and may be effective in treating a bunch of conditions. It’s supposed to improve focus and make you just plain feel better, all without any of the psychoactive effects associated with its cousin, THC. As weed has become legalized where I live, CBD products have become much more widely accessible, and socially acceptable. There are teas, gummies, and tinctures. Many brands have popped up targeting women, using the same crisp fonts and soft millennial pinks that I recognize from cool girl beauty and athleisure products. It’s a deliberate move away from stoner culture, making it feel clean, luxurious, and wellness-focused. The packages might as well have ‘#selfcare’ printed right on them. The price tag also helps give it that upscale, GOOP-esque feeling. It still seems absurd to pay $30/bag for gummy worms, or $15/cup of lavender tea. It also makes it difficult to price-shop when fancy boutiques optimize their search results better than companies that have been operating underground via word of mouth for years. Still, I must admit that their marketing is working on me, because when a new CBD boutique opened up a few blocks from my house, it didn’t take me long to start seriously considering trying it. I wanted to see if it would help me decompress faster after work, so that instead of wanting to lay in my bed watching Netflix I could get more creative projects done in the evenings. Could CBD cure my burnout? Since so many sources are so passionately enthusiastic about CBD, without listing any downsides, I decided to do some research first. It just can’t possibly be that good. Nothing is that good- sex isn’t even that good. Some studies are available, mostly focusing on pain and anxiety, neither of which are things I struggle with on a daily basis. I saw positive results and few side effects, but I was still unconvinced. Many of these studies were financed by people with stakes in CBD or cannabis production, and very few excluded THC from the mix. They also didn’t really focus on what I needed from the product, and there’s a lot of conflicting information about things like tolerance, and long term effects. It’s hard to tell where the marketing ends and where the truth begins. So, there was only one thing to do: try it myself. Regardless of whether or not it would be a miracle cure for me, everyone seemed to agree that it is safe. I considered what delivery method would work best for my experiment, and ended up with a tincture (CBD diluted in a carrier oil). That way, I could easily control the dosage, and use it in different ways, like putting it in tea, or mixing it into my body lotion. I opted for the lowest concentration, just to be safe. Reviewers on the website complained that they couldn’t feel the effects of the tincture several times more concentrated (and several times more expensive) than the “starter” one I’d picked, so I figured there was no risk of overdoing it. I first tried it on a weekend morning. I put a single drop into my morning tea, despite the dosage instructions suggesting half a dropper-full. I figured I would start small, and then slowly up the dose until I felt something. I wasn’t really expecting to feel anything, since it’s supposed to be non-psychoactive. I thought I would just feel a little sharper and a little calmer, like I’d just had a really good workout or a really good sleep. I had my cup of tea, and then went to a local coffee shop to write. By the time I got out the door about 15 minutes later, I was definitely feeling something. The best way to describe it might be ‘floaty’. My body was relaxed, but not overly so, and I felt a little disconnected and foggy. Maybe that was what other people felt when they described being calmer, but I wasn’t a fan. Still, it wasn’t so uncomfortable that I thought it would be distracting, so I settled into my coffee shop seat with my latte and got to work. In retrospect, maybe the caffeine was a bad idea. About an hour in I began to feel anxious. All the research I’d done said that CBD was supposed to ease anxiety, but that wasn’t the effect it had on me. It came in waves, just a creeping sense that something wasn’t right. I didn’t know what I should be worried about, only that I should be worried. I don’t typically feel a lot of anxiety, even with coffee, so I knew this was mostly the CBD’s fault (even if I had accidentally stumbled on a bad combination). Still, the anxiety wasn’t overpowering, it was the haziness that bothered me. I left the coffee shop after a decent amount of work and let myself chill out for the rest of the morning until it wore off. The effects lasted about 4–5 hours. By 1pm I felt normal again. This was not what I had been lead to expect for my first experience. Nevertheless, I decided to keep going. I took a break for a few days, and decided to try as tiny of a drop as I could manage in my morning tea again. This time, the effects were different. The anxiety was less noticeable this time, as were any relaxation effects in my body. I still felt the tiniest bit hazy, like my thoughts were just two seconds too slow. It wasn’t noticeable to anyone else; I didn’t feel drunk or high. It was just not what I wanted. On the other hand, I seemed to notice everything just a little bit more. Sounds were crisper. I could feel all the tension I store between my shoulder blades much more clearly. Eating was distinctly unpleasant. Halfway through a pack of pretzels, I suddenly felt overwhelmed by the taste. I couldn’t eat the salad that I’d packed for lunch because the kale was so incredibly bitter. Had I taken the wrong thing? Maybe the tincture I had bought, despite the reputable-looking storefront and professionally designed packaging, wasn’t processed correctly and that was why I was feeling the ill-effects. So, I checked up a little more. The company I tried processed their oil from hemp and not from marijuana, so it wasn’t that I was accidentally getting some THC into my system. And again, I’d taken much lower of a dose than they recommended, at the lowest concentration. I shouldn’t have felt anything. I can only conclude that I’m somehow abnormally sensitive. I kept going with my tiny daily dose. I’d read mixed reviews about building a tolerance (some say you need less as you go, some say it works like everything else and you need more), but I decided that maybe I just needed to get used to the haziness and try to find some positives. I switched to trying it topically instead. Based on the reading that I’ve done, applying it to the skin is supposed to be more potent than ingesting. Personally, I found it the opposite. I rubbed one drop on my wrists, like a perfume, and then wiped off any excess, limiting my dose further. This worked much better for me. I just felt relaxed. Not intensely relaxed, not like I was glued to the couch, just like I’d finished a good workout. There was very little haziness, and the buzz of anxiety in the back of my brain was gone. This was what I had been hoping for, even though the effects were very minimal. I tried it before work, after work, and before bed if I felt like I wouldn’t be able to sleep. I wasn’t brave enough to up my dose any more, for fear of accidentally triggering some severe anxiety. Overall, I was unimpressed. My choices either seemed to be to feel next to nothing, or to feel just a little too much. It didn’t help me focus any more, and didn’t make me feel any more pleasant. CBD did not cure my burnout, or anything else, but I don’t regret trying it. As for what I’ll do with the rest of my bottle of tincture — maybe I’ll keep experimenting. Maybe I’ll leave it on my shelf to eventually give away to a friend who finds it has a more positive effect on them. Disappointingly, I think the answer here is that I have to treat the cause of my burn out, because this won’t cure my symptoms."
Medium.com,Life,CBD is Breaking Down Marijuana Stereotypes,Cannabis,https://medium.com/@stephanie.j.zhu/cbd-is-breaking-down-marijuana-stereotypes-eb7643258c51?source=topic_page---------225------------------1," Embodying health and wellness, CBD offers physiological health benefits that bring relief without any psycho-active trippy mind alterations. In this way, cannabis empowers, uplifts, and unlocks people’s true potential and their highest vibrational way of living. And as marijuana enters the realm of legality, CBD will pioneer the path of building its reputation as a powerful, medicinal, healing plant. CBD is vastly different from its cousin, THC. With no mind-altering effects, it heals by tapping into physiological receptors in the body’s endocannabinoid system to reduce inflammation, relieve stress, and promote relaxation. Because of the way it affects the body instead of the mind, CBD is tamer and can be more overtly viewed as medicinal than THC. The latter could be lumped into the category of other mind-altering substances, such as alcohol or psychedelic drugs. This is what scares people and allows them to construct marijuana as a harmful substance. But the very same plant can offer serious relief from pain by tackling endocannabinoid receptors in the body, and even has been successfully used to treat seizures. The first FDA-approved prescription cannabidiol, Epiodolex®, is CBD only and geared towards helping seizures. How’s that for its healing prowess? This is the future of cannabis. As it becomes legalized by more and more states, the scene of cannabis is rapidly changing. There are more and more regulations, creating more hoops for those who traditionally dabbled in the scene as an underground market. This makes cannabis more reputable overall. Working within the legal system is what will bring faith and confidence to those who have previously been skeptics. It makes our jobs as consumers important, to use our purchasing power to support the brands who are paving this new age of cannabis."

Medium.com,Life,Can CBD Help Relieve the Symptoms of Arthritis?,Cannabis,https://medium.com/quality-cbd/can-cbd-help-relieve-the-symptoms-of-arthritis-98ac655adb1d?source=topic_page---------227------------------1," Millions of people in the world suffer with arthritis. There is no cure for arthritis, but there are treatments that can help relieve some of the pain and inflammation associated with the condition. CBD is a compound that is derived from the cannabis plant. Research has shown strong evidence for CBD health benefits to those afflicted with conditions and diseases that can affect quality of life. It’s ability to reduce pain and inflammation make it a promising treatment for those living with arthritis. Arthritis is a condition characterized by inflammation of the joints. It can affect one or multiple joints. Arthritis is commonly associated with age and most people get arthritis in their senior years but it can affect people of all ages, even children. It is more common in women and people that are obese. There are over 100 different types of arthritis, but the most common types are osteoarthritis (OA) and rheumatoid arthritis (RA). Osteoarthritis is the most common type of arthritis. It’s a degenerative joint disorder that occurs as cartilage in the joints begins to break down. This causes the bones to rub together leading to pain and inflammation. RA is an autoimmune disorder. Autoimmune disorders occur when the body attacks itself. In the case of RA, the body sees the soft lining around the joint as a threat, similar to a virus or bacteria, and it attacks it. The attack causes fluid to accumulate within the joint. This results in stiffness, pain and inflammation. People with RA may also experience fatigue, insomnia, fevers, a loss of appetite and may become anemic. CBD is effective at treating arthritis because it reduces the two symptoms commonly associated with the condition, pain and inflammation. Here is a bit about how it works. When CBD enters your body, it attaches itself to specialized receptors in your brain and immune system. One of these receptors, the CB2 receptor, plays a role in the immune system that is directly connected to pain and inflammation. When CBD attaches itself to the CB2 receptor it sets off signals in the body which allow it, along with the body’s natural cannabinoids, to reduce pain and inflammation. This is the reason why CBD is an effective pain relief treatment and it was supported in several studies. A 2008 review looked at studies conducted between the late 1980’s and 2007. The conclusion was that CBD is effective in overall pain management without causing adverse side effects. They also noted that CBD was beneficial in treating insomnia associated with chronic pain. Similarly, a 2010 review looked at studies that have been conducted regarding CBD’s effects on inflammation. It was found that CBD and other cannabinoids have shown potential to be used as an anti-inflammatory agent specifically targeting CB2 receptors to mediate immunosuppressive results without unwanted side effects. Therefore, CBD can play a significant role in treating conditions and diseases associated with chronic inflammation. In addition to research that has been conducted to determine how effective CBD can be in treating pain and inflammation, other studies have been made to specifically determine how effective CBD can be in treating arthritis. Here are some examples of what has been found. A 2011 study studied a rat model in determining how synthetic CBD analog, O-1602 acts with the GPR55 receptor to decrease induced inflammatory joint pain. The study showed that GPR55 receptors were affected in a way that promoted movement making synthetic CBD and natural CBD a promising treatment option. A 2014 review studied the involvement of the endocannabinoid system in osteoarthritis pain. The conclusion was that there is evidence that cannabinoids may have therapeutic value in osteoarthritis management. A 2016 study looked at how topical CBD can reduce pain related behaviors in a rat model of arthritis with promising results. A 2017 study looked at early phase inflammation due to osteoarthritis in a rat model. Results showed that CBD could be effective in preventing pain and nerve damage due to the condition. Both OA and RA cause pain and inflammation, but, because RA also affects the autoimmune system, CBD can work on a deeper level to provide other benefits. When CBD enters the body, it works closely with the Endocannabinoid System. This is a system that has effects on appetite, metabolic heath, thermoregulation, eye health, mood memory and more. One therapeutic application of the Endocannabinoid System is its effect on the immune system. This is also known as immune-cannabinoid modulation. Simply stated, it means the Endocannabinoid System can regulate the overall function of the immune system. When cannabinoids, like CBD, enter the body, their interaction with CB receptors effects the Endocannabinoid System in various ways. Although scientists are still discovering ways CBD and other cannabinoids can benefit the human body, it has been determined that they can suppress the immune system to reduce inflammatory responses in patients with autoimmune diseases like RA. CBD has also been shown to be effective in suppression of T-cells. T-cells are key components of the immune cell infiltrate detected in the joint cells of RA patients. This is good news for RA sufferers who are looking for an effective pain treatment. Because RA affects the immune system, it can also cause fatigue and insomnia. CBD can help minimize these symptoms as well. Although some report fatigue to be a side effect of CBD use, it has been looked at as a treatment for chronic fatigue illnesses. One study determined that CBD could diminish the activity of brain cells called glia that can lead to central sensitization. Central sensitization is the condition that leads to a hypersensitive nervous system that is a major feature of many chronic fatigue illnesses. Although you might not think fatigue and insomnia go hand in hand, autoimmune diseases often cause an imbalance in the body that make the two an unfortunate combination. While CBD can be mildly alerting, several patients with sleep issues have reported that when taken a few hours before bedtime, it can have a balancing effect to facilitate a good night’s sleep. One study conducted in 2006 showed the cannabinoid to be effective in modulating sleep in rats making it a promising treatment that can work to improve sleep patterns in those suffering with insomnia due to RA and other chronic illnesses. Of course, CBD is not the only way you can treat arthritis. There are many other treatments that have been proven to be effective in the past. However, many of these treatments lead to unpleasant side effects. Here are some treatments that are currently used for arthritis as well as some risks you should be aware of. Acetaminophen: This is a cheap treatment that is easy on the stomach and approved for heart health, but it can be damaging to the liver, especially when combined with alcohol. It also does not relieve inflammation. Opioids: These are strong pain killers that can make you dizzy, sleepy and constipated, but worst of all, they are highly addictive and responsible for several deaths each year. NSAIDs: These are effective anti-inflammatories but they can increase the risk of a stroke or heart attack. They may also lead to stomach bleed. Corticosteroids: These work like the natural cortisol hormone in your body to give you relief from pain and inflammation, but possible side effects can include glaucoma, cataracts, fluid retention, mood and behavior changes, high fat and sugar levels, increased appetite and thinning bones and skin. DMARDs: These are disease modifying antirheumatic drugs that suppress your immune system to slow the disease and joint damage. DMARDs can be traditional, biological and targeted and each come with their individual side effects that can range from moderate to severe. CBD stands out from other treatments in that it rarely causes any side effects. Even in the rare cases of CBD side effects, those tend to be less severe and life threatening when compared to other treatments. However, you should be aware of several CBD side effects that can affect different people in different ways and some common symptoms include: · Anxiety · Changes in appetite · Changes in mood · Diarrhea · Dizziness · Drowsiness · Dry mouth · Nausea · Vomiting CBD can be taken as a liquid tincture, in capsules or edibles or applied topically to affected areas. All of these can be effective for arthritis pain and it may be a matter of trial and error before you find the method that is best for you. It is recommended that you start in low doses and increase as needed. Arthritis is a condition that can greatly affect quality of life. It can inhibit movement to the point where it is almost impossible to perform even the most basic functions. While scientists still struggle to find a cure, it’s nice to know that a natural remedy like CBD can work to provide relief from pain and inflammation without any serious side effects."

Medium.com,Life,Recreational Cannabis & Medicinal Cannabis: What’s The Difference?,Cannabis,https://medium.com/@ravinderdeolcom/recreational-cannabis-medicinal-cannabis-whats-the-difference-49cc918afde0?source=topic_page---------230------------------1," It is undeniable that marijuana’s popularity and acceptance have grown exponentially over the last decade. Nowadays, people can legally choose from endless amounts of strains, as well as a wide variety of derived products. In the present marijuana market, running out of options is not an option. Fragrant marijuana flower buds, highly condensed extracts, flavorful transparent oils and cannabis infused edibles, are just some of the many consumables currently available at any dispensary or online shop. In order to find out why marijuana’s success is increasing at a seemingly unstoppable pace, we must truly comprehend how cannabis works. Because of thorough studies related to the plant’s properties, major breakthroughs have been reached in regards to its development and market penetration. Consequently, consumers have benefited greatly from such scientific and technological achievements in the field of cannabis research. Although marijuana has been used as natural medicine around the world for thousands of years, cannabis became (in)famous in modern societies due its psychoactive effect when smoked. Nevertheless, marijuana’s attributes are so vast, that they are still being discovered to this day. At the same time, the range of products that keep coming out on a regular basis, make it more than difficult to keep up with the latest products and trends. Medical marijuana is certainly one which has had a greater reach in recent times. Scientifically proven evidence (data which was duly verified by various third parties), has made it impossible for big pharmaceuticals to deny the healing qualities of cannabis. As a result, regular consumers and newcomers alike are now confidently turning to marijuana, as more and more people realize it is actually a safe and efficient alternative to opioid-based drugs. This has caused an unavoidable growth in cannabis consumption, to a point it would be safe to say that medical marijuana has attained the same level of popularity and acceptance as recreational cannabis, if not higher. It is imperative to differentiate medical from recreational marijuana. The more differences are found, the more certified products could be developed for specific target audiences; thus, benefiting everyone involved in the process like consumers, manufacturers and retailers. There are over 100 components present in cannabis called “cannabinoids”, to which our neural system could react. In fact, the human body produces and processes different types of cannabinoids through what is known as the endocannabinoid system (a fascinating, yet extensive subject). However, there are only two active cannabinoids in marijuana, which determine its kind. Recreational cannabis has a considerable THC (Tetrahydrocannabinol) percentage, while medical marijuana carries a larger CBD (Cannabidiol) content. THC is responsible for the psychoactive effect recreational cannabis is popular for. As logic dictates, a greater THC content means more potency, so the development of incredibly powerful THC concentrates and refined extracts should come as no surprise. Even some cannabis flower strains can now reach an impressive 25% THC content, when the general average is roughly 8–13%. For more experienced users, there are options that can meet and surpass any tolerance level. THC concentrates and distillates can reach astounding THC concentration approved levels of up to 75% and 99% respectively. Recreational cannabis can be smoked, vaporized, dabbed or even ingested, it all depends on the consumer’s preference in relation to product and consumption method, but the effects tend to be the same. A stronger concentration simply represents a more intense experience for the user. The most common effects caused by recreational cannabis are: euphoria, relaxation and sharpening of the senses. Some might even experience an increase in libido. Although THC abuse may cause side effects like short-term memory loss, paranoia, distortions in the perception of time/space or impairment to operate heavy machinery, they all seem like a cheap price for consumers to pay. Especially, knowing that practically any pleasurable behavior feels more enjoyable, when done under the influence of recreational cannabis. Eating gourmet food or a greasy snack, drinking a cup of coffee or a pint of beer, listening to good music or to interesting people, watching a gripping movie or a close sports match, even sleeping; most recreational cannabis users quickly learn that THC can easily adapt to their favorite activity, whichever it might be. As a result, people become more open to others, creating bonds that can overcome barriers like culture and language. Many claim that recreational cannabis, apart from being fun, helps consumers develop their creative side. An incredibly large number of famous musicians, actors, writers and artists from all walks of life, have reportedly created some of their greatest work while under the influence of psychoactive cannabis. Recreational marijuana stimulates creativity quite simply because it allows the mind to relax and wander carefreely. Due to marijuana’s capacity to induce a deep relaxation state, it is considered advisable to treat physical and psychological issues like severe stress. An ailment that can be technically categorized as a clinical condition, which would cause any marijuana used during its treatment to be considered as medical. This brings us to our next issue in order: medical marijuana. Although medical marijuana can be found and consumed in the exact same ways as recreational cannabis, it is aimed at a different kind of user. There might be THC present in some medical cannabis products, but it will always be in minimal amounts. In many cases there is no THC (Tetrahydrocannabinol) present in medicinal cannabis consumables at all. CBD has no psychoactive qualities, it is strictly responsible for providing cannabis with its numerous medicinal properties. Cannabidiol rightfully became popular when it was discovered that it reduced the frequency, length and severity of seizures in epileptic patients. Due to the fact that CBD works as an anxiolytic and antipsychotic (it blocks THC´s psychoactive quality), it helps treat insomnia, migraine, anxiety, depression, PTSD and bipolar. CBD (Cannabidiol) has so many therapeutic attributes that it could be considered the “Swiss army knife” of medicinal plants. It also works wonders as an anti-inflammatory for sore muscles, joints and bones, making it perfect to treat conditions like arthritis, osteoporosis, rheumatism or just a plain backache. By preventing nausea and building up an appetite in users (recreational cannabis causes that effect too), cannabidiol can help patients cope with the aftermath of chemotherapy or radiotherapy. In addition, CBD has beneficial effects on the cardiovascular system. Recent studies demonstrate that cannabidiol can help regulate blood pressure on well rested patients, under regular conditions. Similar research was conducted on patients who were put through different stress tests. In both cases, results showed clear evidence of how CBD actually lowers high blood pressure by controlling and reducing sudden increases in blood pressure. Cannabidiol is known to carry certain antioxidants, which have been proven to help treat and prevent heart conditions. The antioxidant quality of CBD serves as the perfect treatment to deter fibrosis and cell death caused by oxidative stress (A.K.A. Attenuating Oxidative/Nitrosative Stress). Furthermore, researchers found that due to CBD´s anti-inflammatory qualities, dangerous cardiac inflammation could be reduced. If that weren’t enough, the relationship between the human endocannabinoid system and cannabinoids like CBD, is more powerful than what was initially reported. Since cannabidiol can interact with the nervous system and brain receptors, experts have reached the conclusion that CBD could serve as a potential alternative to deter neurodegenerative diseases. Although further research is necessary, a great deal of independent studies have shown promising results about cannabidiol’s neuroprotective properties, to potentially treat or prevent Alzheimer´s and Multiple Sclerosis, among other neurodegenerative diseases. Even diabetic conditions could be effectively treated through medical marijuana, making CBD an exceptional alternative for those who are more prone suffer from any of the aforementioned conditions. In other words, senior adults. Seniors could reap the benefits of medical marijuana without the psychoactive effect produced by THC. Nowadays, dispensaries retail various medical cannabis strains with impressive CBD concentration levels of up to 25% and a low THC content cannabis flower. One of the greatest things about CBD is that it can be completely isolated into a THC free concentrate, in case the patient is not interested in consuming any amount of THC whatsoever. Cannabidiol can be extracted so thoroughly, that the final product is completely tasteless and odorless. Because of the neutral flavor and scent it achieves during the extraction process, CBD concentrates and oils are ideal to be added to edibles, without modifying a consumable’s taste nor smell. Orally ingested CBD is a great substitute for either smoking or vaporizing, making it an advisable form of intaking medication for all kinds of patients. Isolated CBD is so harmless, even children suffering from any of the symptoms listed above could be prescribed with medical marijuana by a certified pediatrician. Investigators and developers have taken it an even further step, by creating edible products for pets so they can also cease the therapeutic benefits of CBD, without the psychoactivity caused by THC. Ingesting marijuana causes a more powerful effect than smoking or vaporizing it, meaning less medication is needed. As a result, more money is saved. On the other hand, it is impossible to overdo ingested CBD, taking a large dose only means medication will last longer. Recreational cannabis enthusiasts should be careful when dealing with edibles though. Many are not aware that the effect of orally ingested marijuana is much stronger and they could pay the consequences of overmedicating on THC edibles. Nothing too serious, just a very intense episode some even enjoy. Recreational and medical cannabis, can be extracted and distilled into potent, odorless and tasteless concentrates to be smoked, vaporized or ingested. Nevertheless, a groundbreaking finding made in 1998 baptized as “The Entourage Effect” indicated that for cannabis to reach optimal performance, most of its elements should be present during consumption. Scientists have gone as far as to say that even the process of choosing a strain, plays an important part in the way marijuana performs on the user. Be that as it may, what all researchers agree on is that cannabinoids do determine the effects of consuming cannabis in any form. Fragrance and taste are of paramount importance for a more pleasurable an effective result. In cannabis flower, terpenes are those microscopic viscous hairs that can be seen in most marijuana macro photography pieces, which are responsible for the flower´s scent and flavor. Thanks to technological breakthroughs in the development of both medical and recreational marihuana concentrates, terpenes which are normally lost during rough extraction procedures, can now be added back to a finished product. Terpenes are crucial to improve not only flavor nor smell, but also the overall experience of consuming cannabis. It’s pretty much like enjoying a good wine. You could have a shot of whole grain alcohol to feel tipsy right away, or in turn, you could have a nice glass of your favorite wine, while appreciating its aroma and savoring its rich body as you inhale and exhale. You will get tipsy too but the process will certainly be more gratifying. Cannabis consumption should be based on what kind of experience you are looking to have. Recreational cannabis causes more of a “mental high”, while medical marijuana is more associated to a “body high” Some have even compared cannabis to an automobile, THC being the accelerator and CBD the brakes. However, the theory of The Entourage Effect dictates that a balance between marijuana’s elements is necessary. That includes cannabinoids. Products derived from hybrid strains have had a recent surge in popularity, precisely because of that imperative search for the right combination between cannabinoids and terpenes. Cannabis is, without a doubt, the gift from nature that keeps on giving. Every day, new properties, benefits and uses for different kinds of cannabis are being discovered. At the same time, new lines of strains and products are being developed. This makes understanding marijuana and the way our body reacts to it of extreme relevance. It will represent more than a financial advantage (an informed consumer knows how to invest on medication efficiently), the end result will be a more wholesome and beneficial experience for everyone. Therefore, we should do nothing but embrace the fact that cannabis just might be the medicine the world needs to heal."

o, yes. I have a confession to make. I, Jason Budd, have been using cannabis quite happily for over 20 years. Starting out as a way to have fun and socialize, it soon became important to me for other purposes in life. While studying, it helped me get through difficult times, and it was easy for my body to metabolize and recover from. Not only was it a much better option than getting drunk in bars and clubs, it also made working out in the gym far more fun. Can anyone relate to that? Cannabis is still such a taboo, it’s often hard to tell. Few people seem willing to open up about it — have you noticed? Dear Mary Jane has also been my go-to solution whenever I’m ill — from skin rashes to aches and pains from playing competitive sport. Since the results were so good for me and friends of mine, the lack of official recognition of its medical benefits baffled me for years. In the famous words of Andy Dufresne from Shawshank Redemption, “how could they be so obtuse?” O
fficial objections to cannabis never dampened my belief in its benefits, and I began to question the intentions behind them. Matters became clearer when the UK government sacked Professor Nutt from his position as Chief Drug Adviser after he recommended that cannabis was less harmful than alcohol and tobacco. It then became obvious that scientific evidence on cannabis has been long ignored for reasons of political expediency. Now in my mid-40s, I still love cannabis and all the benefits it provides. I just don’t like the feeling of getting stoned (high). I want different things from this plant now that I’m getting a bit older. Although THC affects everyone in different ways, it no longer holds the same appeal to me as it once did — especially at artificially high levels. The strains have been getting stronger and stronger in the space of just a few years, and that’s why I switched to CBD cannabis only. Apart from being legally available in some EU Member States, including Italy, Austria and Slovenia, here are some of the rather astonishing benefits I noticed: I used to put tobacco in my joints for two reasons only — one was to help the joint burn and the second was to “dilute” the joint so it wasn’t so strong. Having smoked tobacco since I was in my late teens, I was never able to shake the habit until I transferred to smoking just CBD. Now the taste of tobacco makes me retch and heave, ending my tumultuous relationship with the real evil weed once and for all. I have even progressed further and vape CBD buds too. I do feel much better for it. Ever since I was young, I found social situations awkward. Avoiding parties and gatherings became my modus operandi. Smoking cannabis joints would only make me feel more reticent and catatonic, mainly because of the high levels of THC in the strains of cannabis that are popular on the black market. However, now that CBD joints have become possible, I certainly feel much more relaxed and comfortable around others. No creeping paranoia or irrational concerns about things that may or may not be happening. This can be exhausting and, quite frankly, I’m very happy it’s not something I have to deal with anymore. Feeling calm around others is an unexpected benefit to CBD, and one of the most valuable. One key worry that high-THC cannabis users have is that they won’t be able to sleep quickly and deeply if they switch to the legal CBD option. However CBD vaping helps me sleep just as well, which is critical for me and so many others out there. Like many, I think sleeping pills are dangerous and so avoid them for that reason. For years, though, I would never be able to sleep properly unless I’d smoked at least half a joint. Now, with a couple of vapes of CBD weed, I feel that calming and relaxing feeling coursing through my body, but without the mind spinning high. Just mention those three little letters “THC” to your friend, colleague or neighbor and just see the look of shock on their faces. Despite being completely irrational, this reflex response makes the mainstream acceptance of the wonderful cannabis plant even more difficult. However, if you talk about CBD, you’ll see that very same person’s eyes light up. We are talking about two different cannabinoids in the exact same plant, but the reaction you get for each is startling different. That’s quite critical when you think about it — finally all of our friends and family can understand what the big fuss is all about! The more perceptive among us can also see that CBD cannabis is a vital stepping stone on the way to getting THC cannabis widely available all over the world. If cannabis companies such as Vutra, Responsible Pot, EasyJoint and others around the European Union can prove they can handle 0.2% THC safely, then the question is whether that limit can now be raised to 1%. This is the current threshold in Switzerland, a non-EU country that often serves as an excellent template for how the EU should do things. From there, you have a solid basis for mainstream European society’s acceptance of cannabis with normal levels of THC. CBD cannabis buds (and oils too) are helping me sleep better and feel less anxious. They are helping in my efforts to quit tobacco. These incredible buds are also accelerating the mainstream acceptance of cannabis, and in a regulated, taxable, trackable, accountable and fully tested environment. So, what’s to like and not to like? Let me know your experiences with CBD buds/oils in the comments below!"
Medium.com,Life,2018 Hemp Report Reveals Huge Expansion To US Hemp Acres,Cannabis,https://medium.com/@ministryofhemp/2018-hemp-report-reveals-huge-expansion-to-us-hemp-acres-aafd67150497?source=topic_page---------233------------------1," 2018 was one hell of a year for the hemp industry. Besides the triumph that is federal legalization, hemp more than tripled in acreage across the United States. These impressive facts can be found in the 2018 U.S. Hemp Crop Report, released late last month by Vote Hemp, a leading hemp advocacy organization. When it comes to this recent report, Erica Steenstra, president of Vote Hemp, told Nebraska’s KTIC Radio news: “We’ve seen hemp cultivation significantly expand in the U.S. in 2018, with over triple the number of acres planted in hemp compared to last year and the addition of 4 more states with hemp programs. Now that we have lifted federal prohibition on hemp farming, it’s time to invest our energy in expanding hemp cultivation and the market for hemp products across the country so that all can reap the benefits of this versatile, historic American crop.” Just months ago, experts were claiming sales of hemp products may reach $2 billion by 2022. However, with this current hemp report and the optimism federal legalization brings, there’s a good chance that number will grow rapidly. The truth of the matter is many more people are opening up to CBD and other hemp products as the stigma around the plant falls away. The more people to do so, the more demand will naturally appear. Similarly to last year’s report, we’re going to take a look at the leading states and see the progress they’ve made since 2017. Comparing Vote Hemp’s 2018 report with last year’s hemp acreage reveals incredible growth in just one year. Overall hemp acreage increased from 25,713 to 78,176, with the total number of hemp growing states up to 23 from 19 states. The total number of hemp licenses issued across all states more than doubled, from 1,456 in 2017 to 3,546 in 2018. More universities also got involved with hemp research. In 2017, 32 universities took part in hemp research, while 40 had hemp research programs in 2018. In addition to the sheer increase in U.S. hemp acres between 2018 and 2017, the top hemp growing states also shifted from year to year. Colorado was the top hemp growing state in 2017, with 9,700 acres grown. At the time, we expected the state to maintain its lead into the future. Instead, an unexpected contender came forward to claim that prize in 2018. The 2018 hemp report revealed a historic year in hemp growing. Not only have certain states made incredible progress but the entire country tripled its hemp output, along with more than doubling the number of licenses issued. In 2018, 5 states made huge leaps when it came to hemp acreage. By observing their individual success, we can get a sense of how other states can make the best of the recent Farm Bill and increase their hemp production in 2019 and beyond. Tennessee made a significant leap this year in terms of their involvement in the hemp industry. The state went from farming 200 acres of hemp in 2017 to a staggering 3,338 this past year. The reason for this leap is due to Tennessee’s Department of Agriculture allowing for more industrial hemp projects and licenses to be issued. Part of the reason for their permissive attitude has to do with the state’s rich history with the crop. Though Kentucky no longer ranks as high on this list, they’ve more than doubled their hemp production within the last year. Kentucky has been a leading state for much of the industry’s recent endeavors due to the fact that it was one of the first to embrace pilot hemp programs. Despite the state’s conservative history, many former tobacco farmers now grow hemp. The state’s legislators, including Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, were instrumental in passing nationwide hemp legalization through the Farm Bill. It comes as no surprise to see Oregon ranking high on our list. For some time, it’s been one of the most forward-thinking cannabis states across the country. Even before the 2018 Farm Bill, Oregon’s lenient hemp growing program allowed any farmer or business to apply to grow or handle hemp. Last year, Oregon ranked in at #2 for producing 3,469 acres of hemp. This year, their efforts have given them nearly 8,000 acres. Last year, we claimed, “for years to come, it seems as though Colorado is going to lead the hemp industry.” Though we were wrong, there’s no doubt the Centennial State gave its best effort in trying to stay true to our claim. Colorado more than doubled its hemp acres from 2017’s 9,700 acres of hemp. In 2018, Montana took the grand prize not only in most acres of hemp grown but in how much expansion its made since 2017. In the year prior, the first year that Montana allowed hemp, the Treasure State grew a mere 542 acres of hemp. This past year, they’ve more multiplied their hemp production by more than 40 times! This increase is truly an incredible feat not just for the state but the industry as a whole. The interesting part of it all is Montana didn’t change their rules or regulation to cause this growth. The same license was necessary each year and cost around $450. Yet, due to a massive increase in the number of farmers desiring to grow hemp, Montana ranks number one on this year’s list. It’s truly mindblowing to think about how far the hemp industry come just since 2014. Throughout that time, we went from a complete prohibition to over 75,000 acres of the plant being grown across the nation. It should be noted the other states which have made tremendous progress throughout 2018: These numbers reveal the ongoing and inevitable rise of this industry. Though experts long predicted a U.S. hemp boom, this Hemp Crop Report comprehensively shows how rapidly the hemp industry is rising. With total hemp legalization underway across the United States, there’s no telling how much progress is coming. All we do know is it’s bound to be another milestone year in 2019."

Medium.com,Life,What Is CBD and Can It Really Help Your Anxiety?,Cannabis,https://medium.com/right-as-rain/what-is-cbd-and-can-it-really-help-your-anxiety-b5e80d45a826?source=topic_page---------235------------------1," In the world of health and wellness trends, these three letters are generating a ton of buzz: CBD. No, CBD isn’t the name of a new fad diet or some hip workout regimen. It’s short for cannabidiol, one of more than 100 naturally occurring compounds found in marijuana and hemp. But unlike the THC-laced joints and edibles that typically come to mind when you think of cannabis, CBD is not mind-altering, meaning it doesn’t give you the high you might get from weed. Proponents say CBD can instead treat seizures that don’t respond to traditional medications, and may help treat anxiety, pain and inflammation. Think of it this way: If THC is the bad boy of marijuana, CBD is more like the wholesome cousin who brings you chicken noodle soup when you’re sick. Nowadays, you can find a slew of CBD-infused wellness products everywhere from recreational pot shops to your neighborhood drugstore, hair salon or spa. There are CBD oils, lotions, bath bombs, coffees, candies and — believe it or not — pet treats. It’s so trendy right now that even celebrities like squeaky-clean actress Mandy Moore have gone on the record to gush about the stuff. All this hype has resulted in some major payoff. During 2018, the CBD industry grew by 80 percent in the United States and is now worth an estimated $591 million. That’s no small feat considering cannabis products, including CBD items, are still technically illegal on the federal level. “I think when recreational cannabis use was legalized in 2012, it opened a dialogue and curiosity about using a plant that was so vilified in the public,” explains Beatriz Carlini, Ph.D., a senior research scientist at the University of Washington’s Alcohol & Drug Abuse Institute and affiliate associate professor in the School of Public Health. “Coupled with an industry that is for-profit, and therefore very interested in mainstreaming cannabis, CBD was brought to people’s attention.” Although using CBD for wellness purposes has grown exponentially as of late, many people still paint it with the same brush as marijuana. That’s unfair, Carlini says, because CBD doesn’t have anything to do with the undesirable paranoia or increased anxiety you might get from the weed available in most retail stores. In fact, the opposite is true. “What CBD does is it helps to buffer the high that the THC component of the plant gives,” she explains. “This is a very important quality for those who need to consume THC for pain, inflammation or to control nausea — you can get your medicine without getting high.” The reason that non-medical marijuana users get high and sometimes feel those negative effects is because most of the weed available to purchase has very little CBD in it. “Throughout the years as cannabis is used more and more for its properties to alter our consciousness, the plant was genetically bred to minimize the CBD and increase the THC,” Carlini says. “The cannabis varieties that you find in the legal stores these days typically have a very low percentage of CBD and a very high percentage of THC. They are way, way stronger than they used to be.” Cannabis stigma aside, it’s easy to understand why some skeptics are quick to dismiss CBD’s purported benefits. I mean, come on. Can rubbing a CBD ointment into your skin or swallowing a drop of CBD oil really help ease anxiety or relieve chronic pain? In theory, yes, Carlini says — with the caveat that much more research needs to be done to say for sure. Remember those more than 100 naturally occurring compounds that are found in marijuana? Turns out your body produces its own similar compounds called endocannabinoids, including CBD and THC equivalents. That means you already have endocannabinoid receptor sites within your central nervous system that help regulate various physiological and cognitive functions, such as mood, pain sensation, appetite, memory and more. “Both CBD and THC, when they go into our system, they bind with our natural endocannabinoid system,” Carlini explains. “This basically enhances what our bodies should produce. For people who might have a deficiency of these natural occurring endocannabinoids, this may help.” The safety and effectiveness of any given CBD product, though, is still unknown. One of the biggest issues with CBD products right now, Carlini says, is the lack of scientific data supporting the wellness claims and the lack of federal regulation. As is the case for the vitamins and supplements industry, CBD items exist in a buyer-beware market. Some products contain much less CBD than the label states. In one review of CBD items available to purchase, only 30 percent of the products were actually labeled correctly. “These products are all there to help us feel better, but they may work or they may not,” Carlini explains. “It’s the result of unregulated product lines. At this point in time, there is no requirement to test CBD for pesticides or contaminants before it goes to the market, which is a huge issue for anyone, particularly if you are ill. It’s important to do good research to be sure the manufacturer has ethical standards.” When labeled and used correctly, CBD can potentially treat various ailments, but more research is needed to truly understand how it can affect the body, its side effects and what medications it may interact with. A huge hurdle for solid CBD research is the compound’s association with marijuana, which is classified as a top-level schedule 1 drug in the United States. As a result, cannabis studies have largely been restricted to research done on animals or in other countries, which may have different strains of cannabis and are not necessarily valid in the U.S. Despite all this, some tentative steps forward are underway. In June 2018, the FDA approved a drug containing purified CBD to help treat seizures in children suffering from two severe epilepsy disorders. Carlini says this may only be the beginning. “Clinical trials and studies are happening right now that involve testing CBD for treatment of different ailments,” she notes. “You have trials around the globe to test if CBD helps with anxiety, psychosis, autism, Parkinson’s disease, Crohn’s disease, alcohol use disorder, opioid use, cocaine and more. There is a huge amount of potential for CBD that we just don’t know yet.”"
Medium.com,Life,Quitting Tobacco with “Tea”,Cannabis,https://medium.com/jason-budd/quitting-tobacco-with-tea-4f693a43e377?source=topic_page---------236------------------1," Having recently tried to do everything I can go give up smoking tobacco, I wanted to see if I could find a less damaging alternative. I’m not going to lie — it’s been tough. Shaking the evil weed has been a lifelong obsession, and the tokers out there know just what I’m talking about. So there I was. At a loose end and with some free time last Sunday, I headed down to the local shops in my home town of Ljubljana. My mission? To find myself something non-tobacco based to smoke legally (and without getting high). Friends of mine had recommended that I should actually look for some good “tea” if I wanted to find an innovative smoke. Yes, you heard that right. Some of the best smokes out there are actually now being marketed as something you’d normally leave seep for 3–5 minutes in boiling water. Intrigued, I decided to see if there was any truth to this tea-tattle. Mornarska My experiment began with the very first herbal tea I could find on the supermarket shelves. That honor went to the fabulously named “Mornarska Herbal Tea from Adria” made by Fino Isolana. At the ripe old size of 40g, I purchased it for the very reasonable price of 4 euros. Their “tea” contains a selection of herbs: lavender, mint, olive leaf, St. John’s Wort, heather, common mallow and laurel (bay leaf). First thing I did was check that these herbs could all be smoked, and I found the answers to my questions here. All seemed fine to me, but always check these things out for yourself. The medicinal effects referred to in my research were an added bonus. Although tricky to roll quickly without a grinder (and of course my rolling under time pressure could be improved), it was an absolutely wonderful smoke. Not only did it burn well and evenly, with little encouragement, the aromas were fragrant and rich. You know what it made me think of? Lying on the beach, smelling pine trees, with zephyrs of citrus and Mediterranean herbs wafting around me. It felt regal, in all honesty, but one was more than enough for a day. Lemon Haze Keen to find more of this incredible, er, tea, I nipped into my local Petrol petrol station to see if I could find any other “beverages” to smoke and savour. This time I opted for Lemon Haze by Vutra. With the company name actually Serbian slang for “weed”, it could not really be any clearer as to what this really is. Nicely packaged, each sachet features a transparent section, helping visibility and promoting an open and positive approach. Not sure how that works with deterioration in sunlight, but that’s a balancing act. With a great aroma, I found it to be a very nice smoke indeed. It states on the packet that CBD levels are less than 10%, which indicates that it’s a natural level (which should be encouraged). Be Hempy I decided to keep on going. My adventures took me to LeClerc in Rudnik, south Ljubljana, where I chanced upon a packet of “Konplijin caj” by a company called Be Hempy. Another cannabis product, I asked the sales assistant if there was any THC in there. She said the level was 0.2% but my Slovene wasn’t good enough to understand why that wasn’t stated on the packet. I guess it is such a small amount, it barely matters. As soon as I opened the bag, I was hit by an invigorating fresh blast of greenery. Low quality buds, there were quite a few more seeds in this tea than in the Vutra. The taste was quite different, but nevertheless an extremely pleasant smoke. It tasted a bit like weed, but perhaps something you’d find growing accidentally somewhere not particularly suitable. Know what I mean? Very filling though — like the Mornarska, I think I would only be able to smoke one of these “teas” a day as it is very rich and flavorsome. So there you have it. That’s all the teas I’ve smoked so far, but there are many more available in Slovenia and other countries throughout the world. I’ll continue to add them here as I find them. I still don’t feel like smoking tobacco, which is good. If anything, those days are even further behind me than ever. While I’m busy trying to find other teas to sample, I’d be interested to hear your views on what’s available in Slovenia and the surrounding countries to smoke/vape (under whatever legal classification applies). Let me know your feedback in the comments below."

Medium.com,Life,CBD and Pets: Is my dog going to be high?,Cannabis,https://medium.com/tail-talk/cbd-and-pets-is-my-dog-going-to-be-high-29f192828d9e?source=topic_page---------238------------------1," As a holistic veterinarian, one of the most common questions I get from my pet parents is about CBD. There are constant news stories on how CBD cured seizures, cured cancer or helped someone’s anxiety. Of course hearing all of these success stories will naturally make someone want to use it on their pets. So how does this translate over to our pet’s health and helping their ailments? Let’s start at the beginning — what is CBD? Cannabidiol (CBD) is a naturally occurring compound found in the resinous flower of cannabis. There are about 100 cannabinoids present in the plant, and the two most common are the CBD and THC molecules. CBD is the non-psychoactive molecule, and THC is the psychoactive molecule that gives people their “high”. The psychoactive effect from THC comes from the way it binds with receptors in the brain, which are known as endocannabinoids. CBD also interacts with these receptors but does not directly bind with them, which is why you do not get “high” from CBD alone. All mammals (any animal with a backbone) have an endocannabinoid system. This system plays a crucial role in regulating a broad range of physiological processes in the body. There are two receptors present that are affected by THC and CBD. CB1 receptors are present in the central nervous system. CB2 receptors are present in the peripheral nervous system, immune and lymphatic system. We can use different ratios of THC and CBD to affect different organ systems based on how they interact with these two different receptors, which is pretty amazing! The endocannabinoid system needs to be in balance, or in homeostasis, otherwise disease results. Some of the common conditions CBD is being used for include chronic pain, anxiety, seizures and inflammation. We are finally starting to see research coming from universities on pets to show how CBD can help osteoarthritis and seizures. Unfortunately due to the federal law, veterinarians are still not allowed to prescribe or recommend it. In Colorado, we can help with harm reduction though, so if a client brings up CBD to the veterinarian, we can discuss it openly and honestly. So make sure your vet knows if you are using it on your pet, and if they disagree or do not know enough, find someone who can help you! This brings me to how do you know what to use and how to use it?! There are so many products available commercially. Being in Colorado, the market is saturated with everyone making their own products. Also, I find that a lot of sellers are telling pet owners to dose their pets like they would for themselves, which is not correct and can create problems. In addition, there can be interactions with other medications. CBD is metabolized by the liver and it upregulates certain enzymes. When a human ingests an edible, the amount of THC present actually doubles due to the liver metabolism that occurs! The metabolism can be delayed, which means that person may not feel the effects until later and ingest another edible. Now they may have potentially ingested 4x the dose they wanted! Snooze time! This is important to keep in mind for our pets though. We are not using large doses of CBD, but they may be on drugs that are metabolized through the liver and there could be other adverse side effects. It is important to work with a veterinarian that can monitor what is happening and make the right adjustments to the amount of CBD being used and even other medication dosages. Back to products! There are so many choices! So how do you pick a product that is quality and not going to harm your pet? Once again, work with your veterinarian but here are a few criteria that are important: Just like with our food, there are a lot of pesticides being used. You do not want to be putting more chemicals into our pets. The cancer rate is already higher than it has ever been, and this is probably partly due to the amount of chemicals and pollution that we are exposed to every day. Cheaper is definitely not better in this industry. The amount of times I have seen pet parents wasting money on products that did not have anywhere close to a therapeutic dose in the product is sad. Make sure that you know how much CBD is actually present in the product. The company should make it very easy to measure and calculate the amount needed for whatever condition is being treated. You should be able to obtain this information off of the product or on the company’s website. If you cannot find this information easily on the website, the company should be more than happy to provide it if you give them a phone call or email. This information will tell you how many cannabinoids are present, has a residual solvent test, pesticide test and terpene profile. This form of the product is much easier to dose and adjust for animals and is usually more effective. You always want to start on the lower end of dosing for animals and you can work your way up to the therapeutic dosage to make sure your pet tolerates it. CBD is very safe for pets! Choose “full spectrum” hemp-rich CBD products. Full spectrum means it includes a variety of cannabis compounds, including a small amount of THC (0.3% or less) in keeping with the legal definition of hemp. The cannabis compounds work synergistically in the body to provide the therapeutic effects you want. This is also what keeps herbal medicine more safe than conventional medication, because the natural compounds balance each other in the body. CBD is a hot topic right now, but you shouldn’t have to navigate this big world alone! There are veterinarians, like myself, who are knowledgeable and willing to help so you can help your pet achieve optimal health and well-being. There are so many natural options available for treating medical conditions, and I look forward to helping these become more available for pet parents so we can help our pets live longer and healthier lives."
Medium.com,Life,How good is the evidence for medical marijuana?,Cannabis,https://medium.com/@wayne.haythorn/how-good-is-the-evidence-for-medical-marijuana-449bc71f924a?source=topic_page---------239------------------1," People are making extravagant claims for medical marijuana. In first-person stories, patients tell of using cannabis extract to cure stage 4 cancers and childhood epilepsy. The cures are miraculous and enthusiasts seem to think it works for everything. Most of these claims are not accepted by established medicine. In 2017 a committee of the National Academy of Sciences reviewed the scientific research on cannabis as medicine. They studied 24 conditions and found conclusive evidence that cannabis is effective for only one (chemotherapy-induced nausea). This was enough to repudiate federal policy, which is based on the claim that marijuana has no medical use, but it is a tiny fraction of what medical marijuana is being used to treat. The Academy defines “conclusive evidence” as multiple, successful, randomized controlled trials on humans. Controlled experiments on humans — clinical trials — are “the gold standard” for medical knowledge. The evidence for medical marijuana is mostly “preclinical” — things like patient reports, cell biology, experiments on mice, and statistical studies comparing marijuana users with nonusers. This is not because marijuana failed to work in clinical trials. The trials have not been done, due to a decision made 45 years ago. In 1974, the Journal of the National Cancer Institute reported that chemicals from marijuana suppress cancer in mice. These results were reported in the Washington Post: After this research was completed, but before it appeared in the Post, Congress put marijuana research under control of the National Institute on Drug Abuse. To study cannabis medicine on humans, a researcher must get a variety of permits from the FDA, DEA and NIDA, and get the marijuana from a NIDA-licensed supplier. The DEA and NIDA took the position that by law marijuana is a schedule 1 drug, meaning it has no medical use, so NIDA wouldn’t approve studies of its medical use. This didn’t stop research — it just meant no trials on humans. Laboratory science has been legal all along. In fact NIDA was mandated to conduct research into marijuana, so NIH, NIDA, and other government agencies have funded marijuana research for all of these years. They funded a lot of fraudulent scare mongering, but also a lot of good basic research. You can give marijuana to mice, or drop THC onto cells in a petri dish, or examine mothers in Jamaica who smoke while they’re pregnant. The only thing you can’t do is have an FDA trial to develop a medicine for humans, in other words, you can’t do clinical trials. This has created a situation that scientifically trained people are not used to thinking about. Behind the dam created by the prohibition on FDA trials, a vast lake of preclinical evidence has built up. The National Academy of Sciences committee found 10,759 articles related to cannabis medicine, but almost no clinical trials. Normal science requires controlled experiments to establish reliable knowledge, so despite over 10,000 articles the Academy concluded there isn’t much high-quality evidence for cannabis medicine. Without clinical trials, the evidence for cannabis medicine remains inadequate. At the same time, the mass of preclinical data is overwhelming. Let’s look, for example, at traumatic brain injury (TBI). In the body, natural cannabinoid levels rise after brain damage. Is this part of the damage, or part of the body’s protective response? Three recent survey articles describe the actions of cannabinoids for TBI and stroke (here, here, and here). Together these reviews summarize nearly 400 original studies showing protective effects of cannabinoids. Many people who are killed by brain trauma don’t die right away, instead they die days or weeks later from what is called secondary injury. After the primary trauma, damaged neurons spill glutamate, free radicals, and inflammatory signals into the intercellular space. This sets off a chain reaction that causes more damage than the original injury, involving oxidation, inflammation, loss of blood vessel integrity and cell death. Cannabinoids have been shown to mitigate all of the processes of secondary damage. All of them. Cannabinoids protect against: These results have been shown in cell cultures, in mice, rats, guinea pigs, and pig pigs. They’ve been studied in mice that are genetically engineered not to have cannabis receptors. The treatments tested include plant cannabinoids, animal endocannabinoids, a variety of synthetics, and blocking three different enzymes that break cannabinoids down. This variety of treatments has been tested and found to work for severe mechanical trauma, repetitive mild trauma, fluid percussion injury, occlusion of the carotid artery, and neurological damage caused by HIV virus. How does all of this relate to quality of life for the animals? Most of the animal studies measured post-trauma outcome variables. Treatment with cannabinoids produced smaller infarcts, better learning and memory, less motor deficit, less anxiety, and fewer seizures. In recovery, cannabinoids promote neurogenesis — that is, healing — around the infarct and in the hippocampus. Normally, if a handful of studies show that a drug impacts a single mechanism of injury, clinical trials will follow. In the case of marijuana, hundreds of studies show that for TBI and stroke cannabinoids regulate all of the mechanisms of secondary injury and produce better outcomes. These effects have been shown multiple times using a variety of experimental treatments. So we know it’s good for mice. Does it work on humans? Patients say it does, but suppose we ignore them by chanting “anecdotal” or “they just want to get high”? What about science, with numbers? Two observational studies have been done. Many hospitals screen emergency room patients for illicit drugs. Two studies have examined hospital records to see how marijuana in the blood affects the course of brain trauma. Among patients admitted for intracerebral hemorrhage, those who tested positive for cannabis presented milder symptoms and had less disability on discharge. For traumatic brain injury, patients who screened positive for cannabinoids were significantly more likely to survive the injury: Overall mortality was 9.9 per cent (44); however, mortality in the THC(+) group (2.4% [two]) was significantly decreased compared with the THC(-) group (11.5% [42]; P = 0.012). So used recreationally, without any planning or medical supervision, THC is associated with milder symptoms, less disability, and an 80% reduction in mortality rate. According to this data, we would save 4500 lives a year in the U.S. if medical science could deploy the drug as effectively as the average stoner. But neither of these studies meet the gold standard. They are based on observation rather than a controlled experiment, so they show correlation and not causation. According to normal science, marijuana users might have something else in common that is causing their better outcomes. But hundreds of preclinical studies tell us that the cannabinoids are responsible for the improved outcomes. With all due respect for the gold standard, to say “there is no evidence that cannabis is medicine” is a willful failure to think about the actual evidence. The ban on clinical trials certainly hurts us. With this mass of preclinical evidence, we know that some cannabis therapy will be a lifesaver for TBI, but without clinical trials we don’t know what that therapy is. The body’s cannabinoid system is complex — it has been evolving for more than 540 million years. The plant is a pharmaceutical laboratory in itself. THC and CBD, the two main plant cannabinoids, have shown both opposing and synergistic effects. We need clinical trials to sort out dosage, which cannabinoids to use, and how they interact with other drugs. At this time, the only practical knowledge we have is in the experience of doctors and nurses who took the risk of practicing with this medicine. Practitioner knowledge in medical marijuana states is far ahead of the published science. Trials are coming. In Israel, where cannabis science is legal, drug companies are capitalizing on their advantage. In 2017, 120 trials were underway for cannabis medicine. Scientifically validated knowledge will be here in a few years. Until then, I suggest you find an experienced practitioner, and use the only approach that’s known to be better than medical marijuana: don’t hit your head."

eed, hemp, marijuana, pot, ganja and reefer. These are all different names for arguably the most controversial drug of the generation. The legalization of marijuana has become a controversial topic in American society with enormous amounts of both approval and opposition. Currently, medicinal marijuana is legal in 32 states, while recreational marijuana is legal in 10 states, plus the District of Columbia. In light of these recent marijuana-law reforms, one can only ponder the question: With so much support for the drug, how and why did it become illegal in the first place? The answer, however, is not so simple. Lee Fang’s “The Real Reason Pot Is Still Illegal” is an article from The Nation that assesses this very question and explains its connection with the dubious actions of people and companies in power. Years of misconception and misdirection from the American government and major pharmaceutical corporations have given the public a false depiction of what marijuana really is and its possible benefits for society. For a society that prides itself on the prohibition of drugs, we certainly cannot get enough of them. One only has to step foot in a Starbucks to be engulfed into a world of drugs. Coffee’s most notorious ingredient, caffeine, as well as alcohol, and nicotine, are all examples of extremely addictive drugs that are sold practically everywhere. These drugs can be sold and used with no punishment from the law because they are completely legal. There is also, however, a wide array of illegal drugs, such as marijuana — but it was not always that way. Before assessing the current laws around marijuana, it is of utmost importance to consider how the drug became illegal in the first place. In the 18th century, marijuana was legal and had a multitude of recognized health benefits from Europeans and Anglo-Saxons, such as the ability to decrease seizures and alleviate pain without causing physical dependence (Little). Unfortunately, during the turn of the century, the average American’s perception of cannabis shifted. Why? Because of racist and xenophobic sentiments. Around the time of the 1910 Mexican Revolution, there became an influx of Mexican immigrants into the country, and a correlating influx of fears and prejudices about these newcomers from the American people and government. One of these fears happened to be the customary means of intoxication for Mexicans: marijuana. Soon, the “dangers” of cannabis became common knowledge, and lies were spread to the general public: Police officers in Texas claimed that marijuana incited violent crimes, aroused a ‘lust for blood,’ and gave its users ‘superhuman strength.’ Rumors spread that Mexicans were distributing this ‘killer weed’ to unsuspecting American schoolchildren (Schlosser). There were many other measures to ensure the public fed into the lies about marijuana, such as the movie “Reefer Madness”, which warned parents about the dangers of the “deadly reefer”. Despite the lack of any evidence to support these claims, states began outlawing marijuana, and with the help of the Marihuana Tax Act of 1937, the drug became banned nationwide — regardless of objections from the American Medical Association in regard to its medical usage (Little). After years of disdain, marijuana is again becoming a prominent conversation topic, as it is constantly seen in the news regarding the increase in legalization and decriminalization amongst states and counties all over the nation. People have begun to question the xenophobic foundation of marijuana prohibition and advocate for change; however, that change is confronted with its own roadblocks of this day and age. After uncovering the racist and illegitimate reasons for cannabis prohibition, another question must be asked. Why is it that marijuana is still illegal today? The article, “The Real Reason Pot Is Still Illegal”, by Lee Fang, explores the real rationale behind Marijuana’s legal status, and sheds light on big pharmaceutical companies, such as Purdue Pharma, who have spent decades combating marijuana reform. Fang opens up the article briskly, introducing to his readers the people who are largely responsible for keeping pot illegal: opioid manufacturers and pharmaceutical companies. Despite the common arguments presented by anti-marijuana reformists, such as an increased rate of crime and addiction, Fang states that in actuality that is not the case: The opponents of marijuana law reform argue that such measures pose significant dangers, from increased crime and juvenile delinquency to addiction and death. But legalization’s biggest threat is to the bottom line of these same special interests, which reap significant monetary advantages from pot prohibition that are rarely acknowledged in public debate (Fang). Fang argues that the people who are putting the most resources into stopping the legalization of the drug, marijuana, are actually creators of their own, much deadlier drug. Hydrocodone, Oxycodone, and fentanyl are all examples of opioids, strong and highly addictive painkillers that come from the opium poppy and are manufactured by large corporations, such as Purdue Pharma and Janssen Pharmaceuticals (Fang). These companies often try to paint themselves in a good light but have been caught and sued for doing extremely shady things. The opiods that these companies produce are the most dangerous and abused drugs in America with over 16,000 annual deaths related to addiction and overdose (Fang). With this statistic in mind, it would be more than expected for companies like Purdue Pharma to use all of their resources to fight this epidemic — but unfortunately that is not the case. Purdue Pharma has actually done the complete opposite, paying millions of dollars in fines for deceptive marketing meant to decrease the known addictive properties of OxyContin, and illegally encouraging doctors to overprescribe it. The rationale behind these immoral decisions are simple — money, money, and money. These companies will go to drastic measures to ensure their business is set on non-stop production. This also means that these powerful companies will strive to eliminate competition in the industry, and because marijuana can alleviate pain without addiction, it becomes clear why these pharmaceutical corporations want to keep cannabis illegal. It would come as no surprise then, that many anti-marijuana organizations, such as CADCA (Community Anti-Drug Coalitions of America), and the Partnership for Drug Free Kids, rely heavily on funding from pharmaceutical companies. The largest donors for the Partnership for Drug Free Kids includes the maker of OxyContin, Purdue Pharma, and the makers of Vicodin, Abbott Laboratories (Fang). Today, the stigma behind the “dangers” of marijuana are not influenced by racism, but rather by power and money. Despite its relatively untold history, marijuana continues to become a more prevalent topic everyday. After years of prohibition, the general perception of cannabis is beginning to change and its medical benefits are once again being reaped. Marijuana has a wide variety of health benefits and has been praised for being an effective muscle relaxant, as well as easing chronic pain, nerve pain, multiple sclerosis, and even tremors in Parkinson’s disease (Grinspoon). A drug this beneficial and non-addictive could hold the key to the future of American healthcare and well-being in general. Although the past has looked dark and bleak, the future is beginning to look green and leafy.

Medium.com,Life,What Are The Differences Between CBD & THC? The Most Comprehensive Guide Ever!,Cannabis,https://medium.com/@ravinderdeolcom/what-are-the-differences-between-cbd-thc-the-most-comprehensive-guide-ever-b4472d7438dc?source=topic_page---------242------------------1," With cannabis legalisation in full swing in many countries, almost everyone wants to know the differences between CBD and THC. The good news is that people are finally embracing cannabis for what it really is — an extraordinary medicinal herb — but the bad news is that the misinformation surrounding the plant refuses to die. For instance, some believe that CBD is the best thing since sliced bread while THC is evil, but they couldn’t be further from the truth. They are quick to pit the two against each other and compare, but you’ll find out soon that it isn’t necessary. Whether you want to use cannabis for its THC or CBD, our aim is to help you make educated decisions. Read on to know the differences between CBD and THC and how both or either of them can enhance your life. Millions of users have used cannabis for its potency for decades now. The demand for THC — tetrahydrocannabinol — is now at an all-time high (no pun intended) and breeders try to keep up by producing high-THC strains one after the other. THC is a cannabinoid derived from the cannabis plant and is responsible for generating psychoactive effects. Although some people love the effects, it’s not everyone’s cup of tea, and that’s why others prefer high-CBD strains. Now, CBD — cannabidiol — is also a cannabinoid just like THC sans the psychoactive effects. Both the cannabinoids are beneficial medicinally, but none of this would make sense if you aren’t familiar with the ECS, which brings us to the next question… The endocannabinoid system (ECS) is an indispensable physiologic system regulating the human body. Surprisingly, you’re unlikely to hear about it unless you’re trying to understand the medicinal benefits of marijuana. Even at school, children are taught about other systems in the human body, and many people including your local physicians are clueless about the ECS. Well, that’s because a scientist, Dr. Matsuda, discovered the ECS recently in the 90s. Ironically, they stumbled upon the ECS when they were trying to explore how THC affected the human body. They found a vast network of receptors located in the brain and other parts of the body. Without these cannabinoid receptors, the point of understanding the differences between THC and CBD would be moot because the human body would be incapable of interacting with CBD and THC. The ECS regulates the most important functions of the body including fertility. It balances the equilibrium, otherwise known as homeostasis. To explain the ECS in layman terms, think of how you drink your coffee. You don’t want it extremely hot or cold, but you prefer a temperature somewhere in between. The ECS performs in the same way — it prevents cells from going out of control and regulates a much-needed balance. When scientists discovered the ECS, it was shocking to know that the cannabinoid receptors interacted primarily with THC. Later, the discovery of another receptor led to the same findings. The association between these receptors — CB1 and CB2 — and the ECS is synonymous to a lock and key. What’s the point of a lock when there’s no key? Similarly, if the ECS is the lock, THC receptors work as keys to unlock them. No matter how special we humans imagine we are, note that these receptors are found not only in humans but in animals as well. As researchers worked further to discern the relationship between the receptors found in cannabis and in the human body, they found they communicated through signals. While the receptors found in the body are called endocannabinoids, the ones found in cannabis are called phytocannabinoids. And, since this entire network was discovered due to cannabis, it was aptly named as the endocannabinoid system. The discovery revealed that our systems were designed intricately to interact with cannabis. Scientists had found the keys to the locks, after all. To understand the role of THC, it’s important to analyze the receptors. CB1 Receptors — These receptors are found in abundance in the spinal cord and brain. They are highly concentrated in areas associated with behavior such as the hypothalamus. They also regulate appetite and other key functions like fertility. CB2 Receptors — These receptors are typically concentrated in the immune and nervous system. They work like the body’s defense against diseases and other issues that may affect health. So, how does THC play a role in all this, you ask? Well, THC binds with the CB1 receptors — a perfect key to the lock, indeed. In fact, the human body produces its own cannabinoids known as endocannabinoids. A deficiency or reduction of endocannabinoids results in a disorder known as endocannabinoid deficiency. No prizes for guessing that the deficiency can be averted by supplementing the body with cannabinoid medicines. The natural endocannabinoids — neurotransmitters — produced by the body are called Anandamide and 2-AG (2-arachidonoylglycerol). While Anandamide (named after Ananda, meaning bliss in Sanskrit) is found in other areas of the body, 2-AG is found primarily in the brain. Cannabinoids naturally generated by the body are called endocannabinoids, but the ones produced by other sources like cannabis are called exogenous cannabinoids (THC and CBD). The big difference between endo and exogenous cannabinoids is that THC and CBD are present for longer durations, unlike Anandamide that’s short-lived. THC activates the ECS much better than the endocannabinoids produced by the body itself. The ECS gains strength to work better and maintain homeostasis. THC binds with both CB1 and CB2 receptors and mimics natural endocannabinoids. Although THC is mostly known for producing psychoactive effects, it has many more benefits. THC is not meant only to get you “high” but it helps with severe issues like asthma, nausea, appetite reduction and other problems. Research also shows its potential to relieve side effects of cancer. The biggest difference between CBD and THC is the fact that CBD does NOT bind to receptors in the way THC operates. Instead, it binds with other non-cannabinoid receptors. And, remember that Anandamide is short-lived? Well, it’s because fatty acids like FAAH break them down as soon as they are released. Incredibly, CBD inhibits the fatty-acid-amide-hydrolase (FAAH) to slow down the process. To put it simply, CBD indirectly extends the life span of adenosine and anandamide. It is also known to activate serotonin receptors to produce anti-anxiety effects. A single look at the molecular formula of both THC and CBD will tell you that they are very similar. With the same formula, C21H30O2, it looks like they are identical to each other, but a closer look will display the evident differences. THC shows a cyclic ring whereas CBD displays a hydroxyl group. You’re now aware of the CB1 receptor found in the peripheral and central nervous system and the brain. THC binds very quickly to these receptors while CBD does not. THC not only binds to it but also stimulates the receptor, leading to psychotropic effects. However, CBD, with a low affinity to bind to it, changes the shape of the receptor. To explain this simply, it means that CBD counteracts the side effects of THC. It also comes in the way of other endogenous cannabinoids stimulating the CB1 receptor. Therefore, it doesn’t have the tendency to generate any psychoactive effects. A similarity both the cannabinoids share is that they are activated only when induced to heat. For instance, if you bake cannabis edibles without heating marijuana first, you’re bound to end up with something that tastes like grass. It’s like baking cookies with any plant, and you’re likely to taste the green matter present in the plant. However, heating the herb — known as decarboxylation — activates the cannabinoids and the process not only makes the edibles tastier but effective as well. THCA is broken down to THC, and CBDA is reduced to CBD. Not that raw cannabis is completely ineffective, but that’s a topic for another day. Coming to the chemical properties, both CBD and THC aren’t very soluble in water. However, they display good solubility in other organic solvents. They also dissolve in fat quickly, which is why butter or other fats work well in combination with both cannabinoids in edibles. THC has the ability to bind to plastic and glass as well. Thus, the way you store THC really matters, especially if you don’t want it to break down quickly. With all this talk about THC and CBD, you’re probably wondering as to what happens if you consume only THC. In the 90s, THC levels of marijuana strains weren’t as high as they are today. On a good day, you’d probably find cannabis with only 3–5 percent THC. While some cannabis enthusiasts love the feeling of a “high” or the psychotropic effects of THC, it’s not appealing to everyone. For such people, the best option is to consume CBD. One can consume THC not only by smoking or ingesting marijuana edibles but also through concentrates. Concentrates — extracts as they are commonly known — are derived from the buds of the cannabis plant. Typically, modern cannabis strains contain anywhere from 10 to 25 percent of THC, but extracts consist of more than 60 percent THC. Some extracts go as far as 90 percent! While THC is medicinally effective and high concentrations relieve pain immediately, one must remember that a little goes a long way. A sudden onslaught of THC on the body can be accompanied by side effects such as paranoia and anxiety. It also makes the user drowsy since THC is known to alleviate insomnia. Research on cannabis is progressing quickly now, thanks to the legalization movement spreading worldwide. A lot of it has to do with CBD, and even recreational users that loved the psychoactive effects of THC are flocking in droves to use CBD-rich products. Today, there are a variety of ways to consume only CBD without even the slightest hint of THC. As explained in detail above, THC is certainly not the evil it’s purported to be. However, some people cannot stand THC regardless of the dosage. To consume only CBD, you can ingest CBD products such as gels, capsules, oils, and strains with only CBD in them. When you use CBD, it generates several effects through various molecular pathways. According to studies, it is confirmed that CBD boasts of about 65 pathways! What this means is that it has the potential to improve several processes in the body without getting you high. CBD is known to reduce anxiety. It operates mainly by triggering the serotonin receptor (5-HT1A) that is known to improve several neurological and biological processes including vomiting, nausea, sleep reduction, and reduce addiction. Serotonin is also a neurotransmitter meant to transmit chemical messages to the brain and it can be both inhibitory and excitatory, depending on the message. CBD works exceptionally well by activating this particular receptor, but what’s incredible is that works even better when it’s in a raw form. This means that even CBDA (raw cannabis before decarboxylation) contains properties that inhibit nausea and anxiety. CBD also works miracles by interacting with TRPV1 receptors to induce therapeutic effects. TRPV1 receptors enhance the effects of many medicinal herbs, and CBD successfully activates the receptor to increase its analgesic properties. Considering the medicinal benefits of both the cannabinoids, it makes sense to use both of them in tandem. Naturally, it’s apparent that the effects are enhanced when they are both combined. But, how do they work together? Research suggests that CBD and THC work hand-in-hand to heal the body. From the brain to the immune system, the medicinal effects are multifold. When combined, it works in a way known as the entourage effect. This means that if you combine both THC and CBD equally, they work to increase the effects together. Ingesting or smoking only THC can be great, but it has some unappealing effects such as paranoia. Consuming only CBD is amazing, but you lose out on the benefits of THC. However, if they are both present, CBD inhibits THC’s effect on the CB1 receptor and reduces the psychoactive high. For this reason, CBD is known as a negative allosteric modular because it limits THC’s ability to induce harsh psychotropic effects. CBD interacts more with CB2 receptors found in the skin and peripheral organs of the body and since it contains calming properties it reduces conditions including anxiety and inflammation. It also negates THC’s side effects. The entire combination works to balance the experience. THC is wonderful to relieve pain, and CBD improves THC’s performance to a great extent. CBD may not do everything directly, but the benefits are amazing considering that they occur as a consequence of its mechanisms. THC CBD Like everything else in life, overdoing or abusing anything might backfire in the future. Similarly, high doses of THC can be detrimental if you’re not used to it. Beginners should be cautious while experimenting recreationally with high-THC strains or extracts because it might interfere with the natural endocannabinoids produced by the body. High levels of THC may also induce paranoia and anxiety although the effects last only for a while. It may be hard to believe but even CBD can have a few side effects. Of course, it differs from one individual to another. It may also be possible due to the fact that some people cannot tolerate marijuana in any form. Regardless of why it happens, CBD can impart side effects including diarrhea, anxiety and sleep deprivation for some people. THC and CBD are cannabinoids with similar characteristics, but CBD doesn’t affect you psychologically like THC. No matter how they help, it’s important to start with low doses initially, as even natural substances can have consequences if they are abused. It’s recommended that you consult your physician before consuming both of the cannabinoids. Despite the fact that both CBD and THC work best when combined, there’s a huge interest in products containing only CBD or THC. Many people still believe that THC should be eliminated completely to enjoy the medicinal benefits, but evidence proves that it’s very unlikely to work. It’s incredible to realize that the human body is designed to receive cannabis, so why not gain the benefits as a whole instead of trying to separate the components? It just creates an imbalance that puts everything else in jeopardy."
Medium.com,Life,Can CBD Help Beat Cancer?,Cannabis,https://medium.com/@geniuscbd/can-cbd-help-beat-cancer-e32e82d198de?source=topic_page---------243------------------1," Any form of cannabis, whether it be CBD or THC, as a treatment for cancer is a controversial topic in the world media. There are many success stories and much anecdotal evidence, but the lack of clinical research makes it very difficult for cannabis to be accepted as a medically valid form of cancer treatment. That doesn’t mean that there aren’t people out there doing research, but most of it is privately funded as government-funded organizations such as NIDA are more interested in researching the harmful effects of cannabis. So we have taken the liberty of finding the research for you. And without making sweeping generalizations, it looks promising. Nothing in this article is medical advice, but rather a review of the research that is available for discerning people to make their own decision about cancer treatment. One of the biggest factors that scientists are looking for when they do research for potential cancer drugs is its effect on cell proliferation. This is because cancerous cells proliferate uncontrollably. Cannabinoids exhibit antiproliferative qualities, meaning that they can halt the proliferation of cancer cells in the body. In the study cited above, cannabinoids have shown antiproliferative properties in breast cancer, lung cancer, prostate cancer, skin cancer, pancreatic cancer, bone cancer, lymphoma and more. What’s particularly interesting is that in each cancer, CBD acts as a proliferative agent using different biological mechanisms. Depending on the type of cancer, other cannabinoids might also be antiproliferative. It all depends on whether the particular tissue is lined with cannabinoid receptors or not. It’s important to realize that CBD and other cannabinoids can slow the growth of cancers, although their power to cause the death of cancer cells is still being investigated. With that being said, studies have revealed the antiangiogenic properties of CBD in particular. Angiogenesis is the formation of new blood vessels, which is what vasculates a tumor and gives it an opportunity to continue growing. CBD’s antiangiogenic properties inhibit the growth of new blood cells, therefore directly cutting off blood supply to a tumor. There is still much research being conducted about CBD and other cannabinoids’ potential in being anti-tumor agents. To be an anti-tumor agent, a compound should decrease the overall size of the cancer if not removing it entirely. One such study is this one, conducted in the year 2000, where the mechanism of action for cannabinoids in cancer treatment was investigated. In this study, THC got most of the attention. They found that THC causes cell death in cancers, making it potentially anti-tumor, with more investigation required for CBD. Another major topic in cancer treatment that the cannabis industry often neglects is the way that cannabinoids can work in tandem with conventional therapies such as chemotherapy. For cancer patients undergoing chemotherapy, the biggest discomforts are often the side effects of chemotherapy itself. CBD can assist a person with some of the negative side-effects of chemotherapy and essentially, help a person through the process. Nausea is one of the biggest side-effects of chemotherapy. Both CBD and THC are antiemetic compounds, meaning they reduce nausea and vomiting. This is one way that CBD can help someone beat cancer, even if it is only a secondary line of treatment in conjunction with chemotherapy. The same is true of sleep, anxiety, and mood. CBD can enhance a person’s mood, assist them into sleep and decrease sensations of anxiety related to being a cancer patient. We often underestimate the power of these symptoms, the ways that they affect the liveliness of a patient and at the root of it, the will to survive. Sometimes, when CBD helps a person beat cancer, it is not necessarily because it cured the cancer itself. It may have assisted a person through the journey of chemotherapy with minimal negative side-effects. This is invaluable as so many cancer patients describe the side-effects of chemotherapy as intolerable and the worst part of their journey to heal cancer. There are many cancer patients out there who overcame cancer by using CBD in conjunction with traditional, biomedical techniques such as chemotherapy. Even though science is working its way towards a true, valid explanation of how CBD might assist in cancer recovery, there simply isn’t enough evidence out there to make cancer patients abandon chemotherapy and work exclusively with cannabinoids. So yes — some people are using CBD and other cannabinoids exclusively to cure themselves of cancer. But that doesn’t mean that everybody should do the same. At the very least, CBD can offer a real, tangible, effective way of managing the symptoms of cancer and of chemotherapy. In this way, it truly can help a person beat cancer. Until governments begin to approve randomized controlled trials for the treatment of cancer with cannabinoids, it is going to be difficult for CBD to break through as a medically viable option. While for many of us, the writing is on the wall, the medical industry requires scientific knowledge for it to make sweeping claims about how cannabinoids can treat cancer. It’s something we all look forward to in the future: understanding exactly what causes cancer and how cannabinoids can play a role in destroying it."
Medium.com,Life,"CBD Benefits, Crack Drown and Everything You Need to Know",Cannabis,https://medium.com/@healthyhappylifestyle/cbd-benefits-crack-drown-and-everything-you-need-to-know-d788d82616e4?source=topic_page---------244------------------1," There has been a rise in the use of CBD in the last couple of years. CBD has shown tremendous success when used as an alternative treatment for common ailments. The boom has come with its own challenges. New York City, in particular, has been at the center of the CBD boom but it might come to an end as there have been crackdowns by health officials. New York City’s Department of Health paid a visit to one of the biggest CBD-infused pastry shops that sell bakery products. According to the Eater, the officials from the health department confiscated edibles worth around $1000 from Cat Fat Kitchen. The problem is not isolated to New York alone. According to Maines health officials, CBD edibles have been banned as it is not a federally approved food additive. The component itself is still legal to sell and includes oil, lotion, and vape. The use of CBD is currently in a grey area when it comes to legality in most states. The Drug Enforcement Agency still insists that CBD is illegal since it is derived from Cannabis. This is a contrasting opinion with that of the Food and Drug Administration Authority which has approved the use of CBD prescription drug that is legally sold in North America. FDA is clear on the use of CBD oil. It states that CBD can’t be used as a dietary supplement. It also can’t be sold in foods deemed to be crossing state lines. The fact that the law is very clear on what shouldn’t be sold doesn’t mean it doesn’t happen. New York, for example, is full of restaurants where you can get CBD-laden smoothies, coffee, and sometimes even dog treats. There are no formal regulations in place which is likely to result in chaos. It is surprising that most of the CBD products are not sold in secret. Some places even advertise the products that they’re offering. In both Maine and New York, CBD can be sold legally as long as it is not in an edible form. Most cities and states across the country are very interested in regulating CBD when it comes to the edible form. Fat Cat Kitchen is not going to be the last crackdown as there are many establishments that openly sell CBD edibles. CBD has become a popular topic especially in states where Marijuana use is legalized. CBD oil has been credited as a treatment for many medical ailments. Despite the lack of proper regulations in place, CBD has the potential to be a reliable alternative treatment for many diseases. CBD (Cannabidiol) is extracted from buds and flowers of the hemp or marijuana plant. It does not contain any form of intoxication which is synonymous with Marijuana. CBD oils use is currently legal in 30 States. There are 17 additional states that have CBD specific laws on the books. CBD has been touted as a multipurpose molecule. It has the potential for being an alternative treatment for people who don’t like the harsh side effects of pharmaceutical drugs. CBD synchs with how the human body function on a biological level. It can provide relief from depression, inflammation, anxiety, and chronic pain. There has been extensive research some sponsored by the U.S. government which shows the potential use of CBD as a treatment option for a wide range of maladies. CBD interacts with the body differently compared to THC. One way the CBD interacts with the human body is through mimicking endogenous cannabinoids compounds which are naturally occurring. The discovery of the endocannabinoid system has helped doctors understand diseases better. As a result, the implication is a better understanding of how THC and CBD interact with the body. The endocannabinoid system plays a crucial role in regulating the most important physiological processes that are crucial and affect our everyday experience. It can alter the mood, intestinal fortitude, blood pressure, bone density, immune activity, pain experience, glucose metabolism and so much more. When the endocannabinoid system is not functioning well, a person is more susceptible to diseases. Regulating the endocannabinoid system can prevent a lot of diseases experienced by the human body. CBD helps in regulating the endocannabinoid system by slowing and in some cases stopping the disease progression. There has been a lot of excitement on pharmaceutical CBD and the potential it presents. It was not until 25th July 2018 when the FDA recognized CBD as real medicine when they approved the use of Epidiolex. The drug is almost pure in the formulation and is used to treat Dravet syndrome and seizure disorders. Cannabis and CBD oil are still on the FDA’s list of schedule 1 which contains illegal narcotics. Epidiolex could be seen as expensive and people would rather look for alternatives elsewhere. The use of CBD oil is another grey area when it comes to jurisdiction in law. The dilemma currently being witnessed in Texas goes to show the altercation between legal authorities and sellers. CBD oil sellers continue to trade despite having been warned by the chief Tarrant County prosecutor. According to the Tarrant District Attorney’s office, the use of CBD oil is only allowed to be used by those who suffer from intractable epilepsy. Those who are selling or buying CBD oil are breaking the law according to District Attorney Sharen Wilson. The sellers have vowed to continue engaging in the trade and are not afraid of being arrested. CBD oil is made by extracting from the cannabis plant the diluting it with a carrier like hemp seed oil or coconut oil. It has been gaining momentum in the wellness and health world with some studies showing that it can provide relief from chronic pain. Below are some of the benefits you could get from using CBD oil CBD oil can provide almost immediate pain relief from major ailments. The parent plant has been used to provide relief since time immemorial. Recent studies have shown that components like CBD in Marijuana are the ones responsible for providing relief. CBD reduces pain interacting with the endocannabinoid receptor activity and with the neurotransmitters as well. The endocannabinoid system is responsible for the mood of a person. Depression and anxiety are some of the common mental disorders that affect millions of Americans every year. According to statistics from the World Health Organization, depression is the biggest contributor to disability in the world. Treating anxiety and depression might not work and they could also have adverse side effects. CBD oil has been effectively used to treat children with insomnia and post-traumatic stress disorder. CBD oil is also not as addictive as other pharmaceutical treatment options. CBD oil can be used to alleviate cancer-related symptoms and also help in coping with the side effects that come with treatment like vomiting, nausea, and constant pain. There are drugs that are recommended for distressing the symptoms but they are not always effective. That is why some people would opt for alternative options like CBD oil. CBD oil helps in reducing the vomiting and nausea that comes as a result of chemotherapy. Acne can become a menace to treat and affects close to 9% of the population. Some of the common causes of acne include underlying inflammation problems, excessive production of sebum, genetics, bacteria, and oily secretions which may lead to skin blockage. Studies have shown that CBD oil can be used as an acne treatment due to its anti-inflammatory properties. There was a test tube study that was done which found out CBD helped in preventing the sebaceous glands from producing excessive sebum by exerting anti-inflammatory actions. Even though the results look promising, a lot more studies need to be done. There are some studies that have shown that CBD oil could benefit heart health. High blood pressure comes with a number of hazardous health conditions like metabolic syndrome, stroke, and heart attack. CBD act as a natural treatment for high blood pressure since it directly impacts the endocannabinoid system in the body. Studies have shown that CBD oil has a much better effect when it comes to reducing blood pressure compared to placebo. The stress and anxiety-reducing properties can also help in reducing high blood pressure in the body. CBD can be used as a therapeutic alternative when it comes to substance abuse treatment. The non- psychoactive element is sometimes overlooked when choosing CBD as an alternative treatment. There are studies that show CBD can modify circuits in the brain that contribute to substance abuse. CBD oil has the ability to reduce morphine and heroin dependence. It can also be used to prevent relapses which is common among drug addicts. It has little side effects and the fact that it is not addictive makes a good therapy option for substance abuse treatment. Many people see CBD as a miracle alternative, which is not the case. As much as a lot of people could benefit from using CBD, legal access still remains a challenge. There is also the concern that CBD alone might not be as effective as a treatment alternative. Hemp has been fully legalized and there are some people who are of the opinion the same applies to CBD. There is a thin line between what’s legal and what’s not when it comes to state jurisdiction. The majority of the states have legalized CBD products but not cannabis or THC in general. Marijuana is illegal on the federal level but legal in some states. This means that businesses that deal with cannabis cannot transport related products across state lines. Companies that deal with CBD products usually supply them in the form of lotions, pills, or oils. The DEA has been cracking down on companies and issuing “cease and desist” letters from making claims that CBD is a dietary supplement. The reason why the DEA has refused to acknowledge CBD as a dietary supplement is because the parent plant has been authorized for investigation. Even with the scientifically proven benefits of CBD, the rules and regulation are not very clear for both sellers and buyers. The recent crackdown on CBD edibles goes to show how why it is important to put lasting legal frameworks in place. A lot more research also needs to be done on the benefits of CBD oil. It has the potential to treat a myriad of ailments."

Medium.com,Life,The Cost of Prohibition: How Marijuana Charges have Burdened Americans,Cannabis,https://medium.com/@nelliottfc/the-cost-of-prohibition-how-marijuana-charges-have-burdened-americans-986cda15eaa1?source=topic_page---------246------------------1," The national political discourse is rapidly evolving on issues once thought to be fringe. Ideas like Medicare-for-All, tuition-free college and heavily taxing the rich were considered taboo not too long ago, yet today they all enjoy majority support, according to most polling numbers. Another policy that has surged in popularity is the idea of repealing the prohibition of marijuana, and legalizing it for recreational use. According to recent polling from Gallup, 64% of Americans support legalizing cannabis on a federal level. This polling also reflects a sprouting bipartisan consensus, with a majority of Democrats, Independents and Republicans favoring the idea. Marijuana legalization is also quickly becoming a common-sense position for many candidates running for office. As of this writing, every candidate in the 2020 Democratic primary field supports the legalization of cannabis. While the groundswell of support for ending prohibition is encouraging for the future of American drug policy, legalization is only a fraction of the sweeping systemic change required to alter criminal justice reform in this country. Much has been made of the tax revenue that would ensue the creation of a new cannabis market, and rightfully so; however, less discussed are the economic burdens that would dissipate as a result of structural reform of the criminal justice system. Statistics from 2017 reveal that 659,700 people were arrested on marijuana-related charges, more than 90 percent of whom were apprehended for simple possession. According to a 2013 estimate from the American Civil Liberties Union, an average arrest for marijuana costs taxpayers $750. This means that each year, taxpayers foot a bill of nearly half a billion dollars for simple possession arrests. These inflated numbers swell even more when the scope is expanded to analyze all drug arrests and incarceration. Overall, 1,632,921 people were arrested in 2017 for drug charges, more than 85 percent of whom were seized simply for possession. In addition to the costs of arrest, there is also the obvious disparity of implementation against minority communities, particularly among African-Americans and Latinos. Even in states that have legalized marijuana for recreational use, arrests are still commonplace in these groups. Using Washington, D.C. as an example, data has shown a significant drop in the number of overall arrests, but apprehensions persist for petty violations of its laws. Following the imposition of Initiative 71 in the district, arrest rates for marijuana plummeted across all racial groups, however a vast disparity remains. According to data from 2016, African-Americans are still four times more likely to face apprehension for petty violations such as public consumption, possession and distribution. This theme of racial disparity also extends to the processes of prosecution and incarceration. While exact data on marijuana sentencing is difficult to gauge, what is available is an indictment of a slanted criminal justice system. According to data from the Drug Policy Alliance, White people comprise a solid majority of the U.S. population, they make up a disproportionate percentage of the American prison system. The above chart shows a clear imbalance in terms of ethnic composition of the penal system’s drug offenders. The costs that entail the War on Drugs are, as one would imagine, astronomical. D.P.A. estimates that taxpayers shell out more than 47 billion dollars between arrests, incarceration, legal fees and funding criminal justice apparatuses. Despite the crippling costs of the War on Drugs, the most damaging factor is lifetime punishment that offenders face. After serving their time and spending exorbitant amounts of money on legal fees, drug offenders are left with a hypothetical scarlet letter on their permanent record. Their career prospects are dashed because employers may be hesitant to hire them, they will face pernicious trials for things as simple as a bank loan, and their options for renting will be severely limited. Marijuana legalization will certainly be a cornerstone of any successful Democratic primary competitor in 2020, and it will certainly make for riveting debate. Yet these aspirations should expand the horizon to include a broader discussion on existing drug policies and criminal justice reform, en masse. Fortunately for drug offenders, support for these policies is snowballing, and with bipartisan zeal."
Medium.com,Life,Moving On From Civil Disobedience,Cannabis,https://medium.com/@JungleStrike/moving-on-from-civil-disobedience-9febefa9c5f6?source=topic_page---------247------------------1," We’re almost 4 months from the coming into force day of the cannabis legalization bill, C-45. There are some persistent issues, the most notable being the lack of supply many Canadians are facing. On the plus side however, the sky didn’t fall, and we didn't enter a constitutional crisis (one of the many dire predictions made by the Senate Conservative caucus). There remain many battles to be fought, but it’s likely a large part of those will be in the court system for the next decade or so. So, what now? That probably depends whether you lean towards civil disobedience or creative compliance. For a long time the cannabis legalization movement has had much of the former and far less of the latter. The two terms share something in common, opposing the orthodoxy of following rules and regulations to the letter. Civil disobedience would have you outright break a law, the magnitude of defiance is almost more important than the act itself. Creative compliance is the inverse, the service or product you’re offering is the focus, not focusing on the apparatus of the state but what you’re actually achieving. Your particular position on that spectrum is probably decided by whether you feel more change can be wrought from the inside or the outside. We’re the first G7 country to have our system of government decide that enough constituents favour the end of the drug war when it comes to cannabis, and that’s pretty big. On a national scale, ignoring machinations such as global UN drug treaties, even proponents of laissez-faire regulatory systems would agree with ‘it should be legal to consume and possess cannabis’ as the end goal. The details, of course, are where things go sideways. Our advertising restrictions are best described as draconian, and public consumption issues exist all across the country. The problems with public consumption warrant their own piece, and the ridiculousness of policies such as banning edibles in public places illustrate the issue quite well. So why would you ever want to try and comply with this current system? The answer lies in how legalization spread in Canada. Beginning with Section 56 Exemptions, essentially permission from the government for you to break one of their laws, medical access is how cannabis started to be normalized in Canada. Many former prohibitionists have been swayed to at least support medical cannabis usage by seeing its impact on a seriously ill family member or friend. The root of this support, and the issue advocated for is the legality of cannabis for a specific audience. Recreational legalization just means that your audience has grown exponentially bigger to be just about everyone. When your audience changes you have to adapt to them just as a public speaker does. Recreational cannabis will be normalized as it becomes more ubiquitous, and that generally means as it becomes more legal. You can look to the way CBD products are treated, there’s misconceptions both that it’s legal to buy and legal to sell non-regulated products from consumers and retailers. Different from the concept of civil disobedience popularized by April 20th celebrations, the idea isn't that it’s illegal to do, but that the natural assumptions of a portion of the population is that it would be legal. Arguments for legalization from advocates can be powerful, but nothing makes an impact quite like feedback from constituents who have never spoken about cannabis before for more legality. How do we get there with the rest of the plant? How about taking a cannabis plant on a plane trip? Amanda Siebert, prolific cannabis journalist and best-selling author recently took a hemp plant through airport security on the way to Calgary. Not what a majority of cannabis connoisseurs would go for, but the fan leaves on the plant are the same as its THC-rich sibling. To the average person, it’s what was forbidden until October 17th, 2018. When society at large sees as cannabis in more places like airport security, that normalization process will expand beyond the current social graphs it occupies. More people will start questioning why a substance closer to coffee than alcohol has draconian restrictions placed on it in many different ways. I’m not sure the era of civil disobedience is completely over when it comes to cannabis, the first challenges against what amounts to a complete prohibition on regular cannabis usage for some drivers are already underway in the court system. It does seem like we should now be considering creative compliance as the first place to go. Not because our regime of legalization is perfect, but because in the broadest possible terms the most radical cannabis activist agrees with the government’s position. Once you get over the fundamental disagreement over legality, the work is in redefining what the details of legal cannabis look like. Reinforcing George Santayana’s famous bit of philosophy, we have chosen to forget the past of alcohol prohibition and condemned ourselves to repeat the draconian restrictions of that time. The good news is that things eventually got better, and today at least in British Columbia you can buy a bottle of wine along with your dinner preparations at the grocery store. Things will eventually get better with cannabis, and we can make eventually come a lot sooner when our primary association with cannabis is not the novelty of it being legal but it being something that you would be likely to encounter in your travels."

Medium.com,Life,"If This Is Millennials’ Favorite Stock, I Feel Sorry for Them",Cannabis,https://medium.com/the-motley-fool/if-this-is-millennials-favorite-stock-i-feel-sorry-for-them-ab4237bdeb2e?source=topic_page---------251------------------1," The marijuana industry is budding before our eyes. Last year, Canada became the first industrialized country in the world to give the green light to recreational marijuana, validating the industry’s business model and demonstrating that legal cannabis will be here for many decades to come. To Canada’s south, we’ve now seen two-thirds of all U.S. states legalize marijuana in some capacity, with 10 states allowing for legal adult consumption. To boot, the Food and Drug Administration approved its very first cannabis-derived drug, and President Trump signed the Farm Bill into law in December, legalizing hemp and hemp-based cannabidiol products. Although it’s an industry that’ll find consumers of all ages, support for the cannabis industry primarily comes from the younger generation. I’m looking at you, millennials. Back in April 2018, the independent Quinnipiac University conducted a study and found that 63% of respondents favored legalizing pot nationwide. However, support for legalization was just 43% for seniors aged 65 and up, and 63% for those aged 50 to 64. Comparably, 82% of millennials aged 18 to 34 were in favor of legalization. But what you may not realize is just how enamored millennials really are with marijuana. Markets Insider, a division of Business Insider, reported this past week that more people own shares of Aurora Cannabis (NYSE:ACB) than Apple on Robinhood, a free trading app that’s particularly popular among millennials. According to Markets Insider data, 247,157 Robinhood users own shares of Aurora Cannabis in their accounts, up 20,000 from the previous week. Meanwhile, Apple, which had held the top position for almost three months, fell to second with 237,050 shareholders. For added context, Aurora Cannabis was only the 22nd most popular stock on Robinhood in October, when Aurora Cannabis uplisted from the over-the-counter exchange to the New York Stock Exchange. Why Aurora Cannabis? To begin with, it’s on track to be the largest producer of cannabis once it’s running on all cylinders. Currently producing at an annual run rate of 100,000 kilograms a year, the company has suggested it’s capable of producing more than 500,000 kilos at its peak. However, this language was used prior to the completion of its ICC Labs acquisition in South America, which added 92,000 square feet of existing capacity and approximately 1.1 million square feet of under-construction greenhouses. In my view, around 700,000 kilograms at its peak is more likely. As a top-producing grower, Aurora should attract plenty of long-term supply deals. The company also looks ripe for a partnership. In September, it was reported that Coca-Cola (NYSE:KO) was in discussion with Aurora to either make an equity investment or forge a joint venture. Coca-Cola isn’t oblivious to the fact that cannabidiol-infused beverages could be a hot commodity throughout North America in the years to come, and finding a large partner is pertinent to reaching this market. Ultimately, Coca-Cola walked away without a deal and has suggested it’ll be monitoring the industry from the sidelines. But if Aurora was drawing interest from Coca-Cola, a partnership with a brand-name beverage company is coming probably sooner than later. Aurora Cannabis also has breadth and product diversity on its side. It has a presence in close to two dozen countries and is actively working on moving beyond its reliance on dried cannabis flower. It’s introduced a line of softgel capsules, intends to enter the infused beverage market later this year (when Canada gives alternative consumption options the green light), and has plans to enter the U.S. hemp market in the months to come. These alternative cannabis products are the key to higher operating margins. So, millennials have chosen a surefire winner, right? Well, not exactly. To be honest, I feel pretty bad for millennials if they’re choosing Aurora Cannabis over thousands of other potential investments. Since the beginning of 2018, Aurora Cannabis’ market cap has increased by a whopping 138%. This is the result of it purchasing CanniMed Therapeutics for $852 million, acquiring MedReleaf for $2.5 billion, and buying ICC Labs for $221 million. But the company’s share price has declined by 3% over that same time frame — an underperformance of 141 percentage points. How does a gap this large get created? The simple answer is share-based dilution. Until recently, Canadian pot stocks had little to no access to basic banking services. This meant no nondilutive forms of financing, such as lines of credit or loans. Needing cash to expand their growing capacity and finance acquisitions, most marijuana stocks turned to bought-deal offerings. This is where common stock, convertible debentures, stock options, and/or warrants are sold to raise capital. The good news is that issuing shares has been successful in raising capital for the industry. The bad news is that it’s crushed shareholders, as is evidenced in this instance. Because Aurora Cannabis is contending with persistent net cash outflows, it’s relied on issuing stock to cover its acquisitions, as well as, in large part, to fund its operational expansion. With the exception of a small cash component in the CanniMed deal, all of its other big acquisitions have been financed by issuing shares. In less than five years, the company’s outstanding share count has ballooned from 16 million to what’ll likely be 1 billion-plus within the next quarter or two. This type of dilution is killing investor value, and it’ll have a largely negative impact on earnings per share. Even if Aurora Cannabis is able to generate an operating profit in the quarters to come, its ballooning share count will ensure that it translates into a not-so-meaningful earnings-per-share figure. It could take years before Aurora Cannabis is valued at a forward price-to-earnings ratio that’s even remotely palatable to fundamentally focused investors. Needless to say, this investor believes millennials could be sorely disappointed with their favorite stock."
Medium.com,Life,What the Schizophrenic Legal Status of CBD Reveals About the Underlying Madness of the Controlled…,Cannabis,https://medium.com/@jennifergumer/what-the-schizophrenic-legal-status-of-cbd-reveals-about-the-underlying-madness-of-the-controlled-dbce44de5989?source=topic_page---------252------------------1," There has been much confusion in the United States regarding the legal status of cannabidiol (CBD), a non-psychoactive component of cannabis. As an attorney in this space, clients frequently ask whether CBD is saddled with the same Schedule 1 designation as cannabis. Unfortunately, I must deploy the frustratingly lawyerly response of “it depends”. Before getting into the nuances of the complex legal status of CBD, let me first provide a bit of background regarding how we regulate drugs in the United States. Following the increased use of mind-expanding substances such as cannabis and LSD in the sixties, the Nixon administration passed the Controlled Substances Act (CSA), which places drugs into one of five schedules (Schedule I — V). Schedule I, the strictest category, is reserved for drugs that: 1) have a high potential for abuse; 2) have no therapeutic value; and 3) cannot be administered safely in a medical setting. Despite substantial evidence indicating the relative safety and therapeutic potential of psychedelics and cannabis, these substances were immediately relegated to Schedule I. This rather vexing disregard for science was explained years later by a former Nixon advisor who reported that the administration was motivated not by a concern that cannabis and LSD threatened public health but by a desire to undermine the anti-war and black empowerment movements: “[B]y criminalizing [these substances] heavily, we could disrupt those communities…We could arrest their leaders, raid their homes, break up their meetings, and vilify them night after night on the evening news. Did we know we were lying about the drugs? Of course we did.” The resulting mockery of science and public health is perfectly epitomized by the CSA’s treatment of CBD. The Drug Enforcement Agency (DEA) has made clear that CBD is branded with the same scarlet “S1” as cannabis — a designation that seems particularly absurd for CBD. As noted above, CBD is not psychoactive and therefore has little potential for abuse. Additionally, CBD is thought to be at least somewhat effective in treating inflammation, Parkinson’s, Alzheimer’s, anxiety, depression, and epilepsy (no therapeutic value my a**!). In fact, CBD is the active ingredient in a pharmaceutical drug, Epidiolex, which was recently approved by the FDA to treat two forms of epilepsy. Per the CSA, the DEA was required to reschedule the drug since Schedule 1 substances by definition have no appropriate medical applications. Although some hoped that the DEA would reschedule CBD more generally, it instead created a special carve-out for Epidiolex in Schedule V (i.e., the lowest designation possible) while leaving all other incarnations of CBD in Schedule 1. One might ask: how can the same compound be at once be a dangerous drug of abuse and an effective therapy that poses the same level of risk as cough syrup? The answer is “it can’t” but such is the Kafkaesque nature of the way we regulate drugs in America. But wait…there’s more! There is yet a third legal classification of CBD resulting from the recent passage of the 2018 Farm Bill, which legalizes hemp (i.e., cannabis containing less than .3% THC per dried weight). Under this law, CBD derived from hemp is exempt from the Schedule 1 classification of cannabis and cannabis-derived CBD. However, in establishing this exemption, the law doesn’t actually reschedule hemp-derived CBD such that it is no longer controlled by the CSA at all. To summarize, CBD is currently subject to three simultaneous characterizations under the law: 1) a drug that is as dangerous as heroin with no medicinal value; 2) an approved therapy that poses the same risk as cough medicine; and 3) a substance that is so innocuous that it doesn’t even warrant classification under the CSA. Such an outcome defies logic and makes painfully obvious that the CSA is not in fact based on scientific evidence nor is it truly concerned with public health and well-being. Lets therefore hold up the schizophrenic legal status of CBD as a poster-child for why it’s time to end the madness and revisit how we regulate drugs in our country."
Medium.com,Life,How CBD Can Improve All Aspects of Health,Cannabis,https://medium.com/@loyalnyk/how-cbd-can-improve-all-aspects-of-health-cecf0bc0741f?source=topic_page---------253------------------1," The therapeutic properties of cannabis have been known for thousands of years, and the plant is referenced several times in Ayurvedic texts. However, the modern world, and especially the West, has displayed an unfortunate resistance to natural, plant-based medicines over the past hundred years, and has only recently shown signs of reversing this detrimental approach. The main drawback of cannabis as a medicine has been its psychoactive effects, but today’s science is giving us a more in-depth herb about how the herb affects us, and which chemicals are responsible for what. In the 1960s, the discovery of delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) confirmed that only a limited part of cannabis is psychoactive, and that there are a number of other non-intoxicating chemicals which are teeming with unique health benefits. The most popular of these is cannabidiol (CBD), a cannabinoid that plays a regulatory role in the endocannabinoid system (ECS). The ECS has been an essential discovery for medical research, as we know now that the network has been in the bodies of humans and other life forms for millions of years. Indeed, with not yet three decades of research on the ECS, we cannot currently appreciate its true impact, but its influence over immune system function, bone health, cognition, perception of pain, appetite, mood and stress levels is not in doubt. When we take CBD, therefore, we help to regulate all of these areas, in a few different ways. Studies have shown, that in the ECS at least, CBD produces a mostly indirect effect, although the cannabinoid also affects other systems. Let’s delve deeper into how CBD can be used to improve our health. Cannabis has always been a questionable treatment for mental health, as the psychoactive effects are notorious for causing unpredictability. Some find that an altered state of mind allows them to look inwards, take new perspectives on problematic matters and remove mental blockages, while others experience heightened levels of anxiety that just makes them feel worse. While CBD cannot provide mental relief through psychoactivity, the substance does offer subtler and more reliable psychological improvements which are quickly noticeable and build time. For example, the most significant chemical effect CBD has is connecting with fatty acid-binding proteins (FABPs) to prevent anandamide reuptake. Anandamide is the body’s naturally generated THC and stopping degradation of this endocannabinoid helps to boost mood. Anandamide is not as potent as THC but binding to CB1 receptors produces an uplifting effect while increasing motivation. All CBD products — except for creams which are not ingested into the bloodstream — can be used for mood enhancement purposes. The fastest but shortest improvements can be derived from CBD concentrates, tinctures and Veedverks e-liquids, while a slower, but more extended mood boost can be obtained with edibles, concentrates and syrups. CBD also helps to reduce fear response and relieve symptoms of anxiety, by acting outside of the ECS. A recent study found that CBD — and the endocannabinoid 2-Arachidonoylglycerol (2-AG) is a positive allosteric modulator of the GABA-A receptor. The investigation, published in the peer-reviewed Pharmacological Research, suggested this could explain CBD’s anxiolytic and anticonvulsant properties. A well-functioning immune system serves to protect the body from dangerous viruses and bacteria, but when out of control, can sabotage our health with high levels of inflammation. Treating inflammation and moderating immune system response is tricky, but ECS research is providing us with fresh solutions. Studies have shown that CB2 receptors are present on white blood cells and in immune tissues, and that activating these can have an immunomodulatory effect. CBD is an antagonist of the CB2 receptor but instigates an anti-inflammatory effect via anandamide-mediated activation. 2-AG is also noted for its anti-inflammatory properties. Managing inflammation with CBD could potentially help to treat arthritis, irritable bowel syndrome and inflammatory bowel disease. THC is an agonist of the CB2 receptor and therefore can reduce inflammation directly, but the emergence of a non-psychoactive, cannabis-based anti-inflammatory means that many more patients could benefit. The most effective method of managing arthritis may be with a pain cream or muscle rub, as this engages the most relevant CB2 receptors. For more internal inflammation and autoimmune diseases, capsules and edibles should deliver more potent and sustained relief. It is great news that natural healing remedies of cannabis are starting to be embraced once again — after all, this knowledge has been known for millennia.

Medium.com,Life,Why You Can’t Grow Weed in Canada That Won’t Get You High,Cannabis,https://medium.com/@jdmoffatt/why-you-cant-grow-weed-in-canada-that-won-t-get-you-high-49a57bb5b9d4?source=topic_page---------254------------------1," If you’re a Canadian wanting to grow cannabis containing high amounts of cannabidiol (CBD) and trace amounts (under 1%) of tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), you can’t. Well, you can, but you’re technically committing a crime. That’s right: Grandma’s hemp garden for her achy bones is an indictable offence carrying a fine of up to $5,000 and/or imprisonment of up to six months– unless she got her seeds from a legal source. The problem? There isn’t a legal source right now. And it isn’t clear when there will be one. Under Health Canada’s Access to Cannabis for Medical Purposes Regulations (ACMPR), the only legal way to obtain seeds for a personal medical grow is through one of the country’s Licensed Producers (LPs)– companies like Tweed, Aurora, and Canna Farms. If you grow cannabis that, as the Cannabis Act puts it, “is from a seed or plant material that [you] know is illicit cannabis,” you’re committing an indictable offence. Which is a problem because, as of now, no LP in Canada is offering seeds that won’t get you high. With the federal legalization of cannabis on Oct. 17, 2018, everyone’s attention has been on the ‘green rush’ surrounding recreational cannabis. And why not: Canada’s only the second nation in the world to legalize cannabis for recreational use. It’s a big deal. But there’s still a need for affordable and consistent access to medical cannabis for those with serious health conditions, and right now that access isn’t being adequately provided. I should know: I’m an ACMPR-licensed grower, and I’m not able to legally purchase seeds that won’t get me high. I’ve been living with chronic illness for about seven years, and CBD is the first medication that’s had any impact on the severe pain I deal with. But when I first started taking CBD, I had to limit my dosage because I couldn’t afford the products LPs were selling. When you need an effective dose of 60–100 milligrams of CBD daily, it gets expensive. (About $300–500 CAD a month.) And when your income is a government disability cheque, it’s a choice between pain relief or paying bills. Growing CBD has changed my life. (It’s pretty easy to grow, too.) Being able to make CBD with just soil, water, and light means I’m able to take an effective dose, stay within my budget, and ultimately provide myself a quality of life every person with chronic illness deserves. If Canadians need an example of why it’s important for medical patients to have legal access to seeds, I’m it. In an email response from Health Canada, senior media relations advisor Tammy Jarbeau noted that “As of January 14, 2019, there are 69 licence holders authorized to sell seeds [and] plants.” That sounds like a lot, but after subtracting the multiple licenses held by some LPs, there’s around 51 left that medical patients can contact. I phoned every one of those LPs to see if they sold anything to medical patients, and the results were frustrating. Because when Health Canada says there’s 69 LPs authorized to sell seeds, what they’re not saying is that it’s really only five LPs that have something, and none have high-CBD strains that won’t get you high. Which means that if you want to grow high-CBD cannabis in Canada, you have to find your seeds from somewhere other than an LP. Since being able to buy high-CBD seeds from an LP is impossible, and buying seeds from anywhere other than an LP is an indictable offence, Health Canada has a provision in its regulations to get around its regulations. From Health Canada’s email: “It is not prohibited for an adult individual to distribute up to four cannabis plants to another adult, provided that the plants are not flowering, or have buds on them… It is also not prohibited to distribute up to 30 cannabis plant seeds, provided that the seeds were lawfully obtained.” Health Canada says the intent of this legal workaround is to avoid criminalizing “the small-scale sharing of cannabis plants and seeds between adults, such as family members, friends or neighbours,” which is important, because we shouldn’t make criminals out of people sharing seeds. But offering this provision as a solution for those seeking a legal source of high-CBD strains ignores the current ACMPR landscape: unlike high-THC strains, it’s really hard to find high-CBD seeds ‘through the grapevine’ unless you’re connected to the right people. And besides that, medical patients shouldn’t have to go on strain-hunting expeditions to treat their conditions. That’s the antithesis of what legalization was supposed to bring to Canadians. As for me? I’m still searching for those seeds that Health Canada thinks my family members, friends, and neighbors are waiting to gift me. So if you’re reading this and know me, I have to ask: Why are you keeping those Charlotte’s Web cuttings out of my reach?"
Medium.com,Life,Is Australia moving toward marijuana legalisation?,Cannabis,https://medium.com/@louisarthuroneill/is-australia-moving-toward-marijuana-legalisation-c92cbf5eec8f?source=topic_page---------255------------------1," It seemed Australia was poised to follow the increasing number of countries which have legalised marijuana, when medicinal marijuana became legal in Australia in 2016. This was a promising sign for Australians, known for being the largest consumers of Marijuana on the planet, that soon they too may be able to witness the end of the ‘War on Drugs.’ Since then, however, little progress has been made by way of legalisation. This is despite Canada’s recent legalisation of marijuana, along with Uruguay and now, over half the states in the US. Marijuana has been illegal in Australia since 1928 and today remains largely the same, with the exception of decriminalisation in the ACT, SA and NT, whereby offenders will likely face a fine or penalty upon possession. However in Victoria, New South Wales, Tasmania, Queensland, and Western Australia, use and supply of cannabis is criminally prohibited. In response to attempts to legalise cannabis in May 2018, Australia’s Minister of Health, Greg Hunt maintained that marijuana legalisation is “dangerous and medically irresponsible.” This hard-line approach to drug criminalisation, however, seems to have done little to dissuade the Oceania region, within which Australia sits alongside New Zealand. The Oceania region comprises roughly 15% of total global marijuana consumption. According to the Australian Institute for Health and Welfare, tolerance for regular adult cannabis use among the Australian general population rose from 9.8% in 2013 to 14.5% in 2016, and 85% of Australians favoured the use of cannabis for medicinal purposes, rising from 69% in 2013. And marijuana use shows no signs of abating, not just in Australia but globally. In the US, 12 percent of adults, which equates to one in every eight people, said they were regular users of marijuana. This is up from 7 percent in 2013. While the laws have yet to change, the conversation grows louder surrounding cannabis and the potential market for it in Australia. The Australian National University’s 30-year election study found that a majority of Australians are now in favour of recreational marijuana legalisation. And, in May 2018, Senators David Leyonhjelm and Richard Di Natale put their cases forward for marijuana legalisation. Leyonhjelm introduced a bill which in essence would remove all barriers to marijuana consumption in Australia, taking a civil liberties approach to his argument, stating that ‘adults should be free to make their own choices as long as they do not harm others’. The Greens took a different tact, and approached their case by focusing on the failed effects of the War on Drugs, specifically as it comes to marijuana use. As the studies show, Australia remains the world’s largest consumer of cannabis despite the drugs current legal status. This, the Greens argue, highlights that the ‘War on Drugs’ does little to discourage drug use. The Greens advocate an education model towards marijuana and other drugs, suggesting that the best method would be to teach people appropriate practices around drug use in order to minimise harm and misuse. And just across the pond, in New Zealand, the Greens have gained power through a coalition with the Labour Party which has allowed them to push for a Cannabis Referendum in 2020, where the country must reach a decision on the drugs legal status. It is likely this will lead to the legalisation of marijuana in New Zealand, with polls showing that a majority of citizens are in favour of legalisation. If this is indeed the case, and marijuana is legalised in New Zealand, Australia may have to take another look at their drug policies, and whether or not they should be revised. Among the Greens are many others who consider the War on Drugs to be an abysmal failure, mostly in terms of government expenditure. While Australia spends roughly $1 billion each year on enforcing marijuana prohibition, the country could be instead earning billions through legalisation and taxation of cannabis. A report from New Frontier Data estimates the cannabis industry in the US could generate $131.8 billion in federal tax revenue and add 1.1 million jobs by 2025 if it’s legalized for adult use in all 50 states. However, despite the evidence to the contrary, it looks as though the Australian government will for the moment clutch to the status quo. Though many expect the tide will turn in the years to come, and are preparing for what they believe is a burgeoning cannabis market in Australia. Several businesses have emerged with aims to import or produce cannabis such as AusCann, Cann Group, GD Pharma, LeafCann, Little Green Pharma and more who all eagerly await the thumbs up on marijuana legalisation. And according to Rhys Cohan from Cannabis Consulting Australia, even if one were to exclude recreational marijuana use, there are still many opportunities surrounding medicinal marijuana. “There are opportunities in transport and logistics, packaging and labelling, policy and procedure development, HR and labour hire, product research and development, finance and insurance … the list goes on.” Medicinal marijuana has been found to help with many health issues such as chronic pain, glaucoma, epilepsy, arthritic pains and many more, all of which may be treated or benefit from use of the drug. The firm known as Prohibition Partners recently released a report which estimates that the nation’s legal medicinal cannabis market, currently valued at $17.7 million annually, could jump to $1.2 billion by 2024 and then $3 billion by 2028. It seems that more countries are implementing a laissez-faire approach with regards to drug policy, specifically marijuana, and those that have are already reaping the benefits. Canada is estimated to generate $8bn through their recent marijuana legalisation, and it is estimated that in North America alone, cannabis sales will reach above $20bn by 2021. The Australian public and market are ready for cannabis legalisation, with much to gain, and ostensibly little to lose. How long until Australia follows suit? How much longer will Australia continue to wade through the detritus of the failed War on Drugs? Many suspect, the wait will not be long at all."
Medium.com,Life,Are Those Avocados Indoor?,Cannabis,https://medium.com/@tinabugg99/are-those-avocados-indoor-6696b1d4ee55?source=topic_page---------256------------------1," A
quick trip to your local produce section reveals that Mother Nature has blessed us not only with a variety of lovely plants to enjoy in many ways, but also with fertile soil and temperate climates in which to cultivate her bounty. In our society, with its devotion to sustainability, small-craft artisans, and locally sourced food and beverage options, we have a new set of standards to ingest only the most naturally (if not organically) raised fare. So when was the last time you approached the staff at Whole Foods and asked, “are these avocados indoor, because I only eat indoor avocados?” I can only assume that very few of us, if any at all, have asked that question about any of our produce… ever. Why then, would we treat our cannabis differently? F
irst thing’s first, I am not knocking indoor grown cannabis, nor am I implying that indoor cannabis is some kind of artificial, GMO, or highly processed alternative to outdoor. I happen to enjoy cannabis grown in all environments. When, however, did we as consumers, as an industry, and as a society allow ourselves to be convinced that sun-grown cannabis (or the stigmatic “outdoor”) is somehow sub-par to its greenhouse and indoor counterparts? It
is not the intention of this writing to answer all of these questions, but simply to ask questions that begin exploring how we can be so devoted to only the most natural produce, and turn our noses up at cannabis grown the very same way as berries, tomatoes, and the ever popular avocados. In short, are there more factors to consider when buying cannabis than simply where and how it was grown? O
k, let’s set up some context. I am writing this from California’s beautiful San Francisco Bay Area where there are daily farmers markets, and every menu boasts locally sourced, organic ingredients. Californians also have nearly infinite access to the beautiful, crystalline nugs that flow from the hills of the Emerald Triangle and beyond like milk and honey, yet we hear time and time again… “I only buy indoor cannabis.” I can appreciate that other states with legal markets in this fine country of ours may not have climates and terroirs so magnificently suited to outdoor cannabis cultivation, in which case, indoor cultivation allows for everyone to access top quality buds, but for states like California… why would we limit ourselves? Cannabis is a plant, an agricultural product like oranges, wheat, grapes etc. While there are some exceptions, plants tend to grow outside. When it comes to cannabis, there are pros and cons to all cultivation styles, but for now, let’s explore some pros of sun-grown. L
et’s start with light. “Scientists report that cannabinoid and terpene production is greatest in ambient light. Natural light is much more complex than what even the best grow lights can mimic. Unlike indoor plants, outdoor cannabis is exposed to a full spectrum of light from the sun, moon, and stars… It’s impossible to duplicate nature’s supreme design when growing cannabis indoors.” So let’s give a shout out to natural light for providing us a full spectrum to encourage cannabinoid and terpene maturity. I would also be remiss if I did not mention that anytime we can grow more photosynthesizing plants outside, we are providing ourselves with better air quality and helping to reduce the dreaded greenhouse gases that eat away at our atmosphere, but I digress. So
why does this full spectrum matter? We as consumers tend to have a grasp on how cannabinoids like THC and CBD can be helpful (and fun) supplements to our lifestyles, but many of us are still just scratching the surface of what terpenes can do. We may already know that terpenes provide us with the the pleasant odors we love like fresh cut grass, oranges, cloves, and of course, that sweet, gassy, or skunky aroma that wafts into our faces when we pop open that eighth of dankness we just brought home from the local shop, but fun fact, terpenes also have therapeutic properties. Limonene, for instance, is said to reduce stress and anxiety, while Myrcene is said to have sedative effects (think “couch-lock”). As legalization allows for more research into these delightful phytochemicals, we discover myriad benefits previously unknown. W
ell, what about potency? It may be true that indoor cannabis can be more potent than sun-grown, but is potency the determining factor in quality? Sometimes we may find ourselves unsure of how to purchase cannabis and just default to the first logical choice. We may say to ourselves, “THC is the psychoactive cannabinoid, and I want to get the most “bhang ” (see what I did there?) for my buck, therefore… more THC must equal better quality.” The truth is, our body chemistries are as unique to each individual as our fingerprints. Therefore our unique physiology plays a vital role in how we will react to each strain and its unique physiology. Think about it… if you are riddled with anxiety in social situations and you just want to calm your nerves a bit, is it in your best interest to smoke the strongest strain available and find yourself too high to talk? With that in mind, perhaps we should really be asking ourselves while browsing the cornucopia at our local dispensary not, “which is the strongest option,” but “which of these is best suited to me and my needs?” L
astly, let’s just touch on price. Isn’t it just a bit ironic that “organic,” produce tends to be more expensive than its counterparts while with cannabis, it tends to be the sun-grown options that are far less pricey than others, why is that? Well, for starters, it is less expensive to grow cannabis outdoors, where the light is free, and that savings gets passed onto consumers. Next, several observations of consumer buying patterns reveal that we tend to “naively” assume that higher price = higher quality, and lower price = lower quality because we simply do not have enough information about the product. I am not saying that premium priced indoor cannabis is of lower quality than its price tag suggests. I am, however, asking if sun-grown cannabis could actually be of a better quality than its price indicates? C
ircling back to where we started, if we as consumers are so devoted to this all-natural, non-GMO, organic lifestyle, why would cannabis be any different? Now that we have begun to explore potency, physiology and price, we may now arm ourselves with a more informed approach to cannabis buying than before. There are so many factors that can play into this type of decision that one should feel encouraged to try a variety of terpene profiles, strengths and growing styles/environments before simply stating “I only buy indoor”, or “I only buy 20% THC or higher”, or “I only buy the premium priced options.” On a final note, I leave you with the immortal words of Thomas Carlyle: “Variety is the condition of harmony.”"

Medium.com,Life,A Comprehensive Guide to High CBD Strains,Cannabis,https://medium.com/@kataustinwriting/a-comprehensive-guide-to-high-cbd-strains-dbcfe580ca07?source=topic_page---------258------------------1," Cannabis is nothing new, with proof of its existence dating back over 12,000 years. While cannabis was often noted for its medicinal effects by Viking doctors, Egyptian Pharaohs, and Chinese emperors, nobody could have predicted medical advancements of today. We now know that the health benefits can be attributed to the 144 cannabinoids and other terpenes in the cannabis plant. One specifically, cannabidiol (CBD), was discovered in the 1940’s and is showing increasing evidence of its health advantages. Now, CBD is being used by people all over the world to help manage mild to chronic health conditions. Each strain of cannabis contains different amounts of these cannabinoids and terpenes, giving them each their own unique medicinal qualities. Hemp varieties of the plant contain little to no THC, but usually, contain high amounts of CBD. Alternatively, there are strains from the Indica and Sativa species that contain high amounts of CBD with low to moderate amounts of THC. These strains are great for people who wish to reap the potential benefits of cannabidiol without experiencing any extreme psychoactive effects. High CBD cannabis strains can be smoked, vaporized, or processed with extraction techniques to create a number of products that will allow you to utilize the cannabidiol. These high CBD strains are great for anyone who wants to add cannabidiol to their daily routine but prefer smoking as their go-to ingestion method. They are also useful for anyone looking to cultivate their own CBD products at home, like homemade oil extracts or edibles. The CBD:THC ratio refers to the amount of cannabidiol compared to the amount of tetrahydrocannabinol in cannabis-derived products. It is important to pay close attention to this ratio when choosing a product or cannabis strain because CBD and THC have different effects on the body. THC is responsible for the psychoactive effects related to marijuana. While there is evidence regarding its potential medicinal benefits, many people prefer to avoid these effects, typically referred to as a “high” feeling. In some cases, the psychoactive effects are very useful, but they are not necessary to reap the potential benefits of cannabis. Cannabis products are available in a range of different ratios, and understanding these ratios and what they mean is the first step to choosing the best product for you. The ratio will help determine if a product is considered THC heavy, CBD heavy, or balanced. A cannabis product with a 0:1 ratio is THC heavy, with almost nonexistent CBD levels. Another THC heavy option is 1:3, which still includes the psychoactive effects but uses cannabidiol to level out some of the undesirable side effects, like anxiety or paranoia. CBD heavy strains may have ratios like 2:1 or 3:1 and feature little to no psychoactive effects. However, higher CBD ratios like 1:0 or 25:1 are often sought out for their many potential benefits and have no psychoactive effects. When choosing a cannabis product you should always consult your doctor. He or she will be able to help you decide which type of cannabis product is right for you and walk you through the potential risks and benefits of different CBD:THC ratios. While many people do seek out marijuana strains high in CBD, small amounts of THC may work to complement the effects of cannabidiol. Cannabidiol offers a range of potential benefits that aren’t present (or are less abundant) in THC. The unearthing of these benefits has pushed many people to consider CBD, including those who would have never considered marijuana before. While there is still much more research to be done, many studies have concluded that CBD may be helpful for managing many conditions ranging from mild to severe. There are too many potential benefits to list them all, but some of the most popular uses include: Indica dominant strains come from the plant Cannabis Indica, which is known for its short stature and fat leaves. The cannabis flower harvested from this plant is often linked to feelings of euphoria and relaxation that ease anxiety and stress.

Medium.com,Life,Common CBD Side Effects & Why They Occur,Cannabis,https://medium.com/@kataustinwriting/common-cbd-side-effects-why-they-occur-cf449cc9b1d1?source=topic_page---------259------------------1," With all the recent buzz, more and more people are turning to CBD as a holistic treatment and replacement to prescription medication. But cannabidiol isn’t sold like a bottle of pills, so the uses, directions, and side effects are not always available on the side of the bottle. Potential cannabidiol users turn to other sources to do their homework on the all natural supplement. Most often you will find good reviews, but occasionally someone experiences adverse side effects after using CBD products. The question is: Are these side effects a result of the cannabidiol itself or just the result of user error? The answer isn’t so straightforward. According to most scientific research, the side effects related to cannabidiol are mild. More severe side effects could be a result of misuse, interactions with current medications, or synthetic additives in your CBD products. One Reddit user, millo31, described his unpleasant experience in detail. After trying a friend’s vape, he found the effects to be the opposite of what he had hoped. The vape didn’t contain pure CBD oil, but instead was a mixture of a “CBD additive” and vape oil. He reported feeling “high,” but not the relaxing high many people associate with cannabis. He went on to explain that this high feeling was intense, resulting in visuals, loss of motor control, back and neck aches, and a slew of other undesirable side effects. His experience led him straight to the internet, where he looked for answers concerning the additive. After a quick Google search he found a news report. This news report showed that other teens in his area had ended up hospitalized from the same product. Fortunately for millo31, his terrifying trip only lasted about 15 minutes before he was feeling back to normal. The entire experience left him pretty shaken up, which probably explains his cautionary Reddit post title “STAY AWAY FROM GREEN MIST ‘CBD’ ADDITIVE.” These results are not what users are seeking when they look to CBD to treat their arthritis, anxiety, pain, and other chronic conditions. Scrolling through the thread confirmed what you may suspect: Green Mist CBD Additive is a synthetic product. These synthetic products are lab cultivated versions of the cannabinoids naturally found in the cannabis plant, but they often have very different effects. Although these products are not regulated by the FDA (therefore the company is not required to divulge this information) a little digging confirmed that the product has caused quite the uprise in Madison, Mississippi. The company’s website doesn’t have a single ingredient list in sight, and just 5 months after the Reddit thread was created, these “CBD” products have been removed from the site entirely. CBD (the real kind, not synthetic) has been increasingly popular in recent years, with many people turning to it as their first choice for managing a variety of health conditions, and sometimes even as a replacement for prescription medications. Before you make the jump to cannabidiol, do the research and speak with your doctor to cover all of your bases. You should look at the potential benefits, dosing methods and sizes, additives, purities, and, of course, the risks involved with taking CBD. Before hopping straight to cannabidiol, you should take a look at its source. Cannabis has been stigmatized for decades, but the basis for this stigma against the all-natural plant is mostly based on misunderstanding and fear mongering. Claims of death due to cannabis consumption have been debunked, and over the years many studies have uncovered hundreds of medicinal uses for the plant. In 2017, Drugs of Abuse, published by the United States Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) stated that there have been no confirmed reports of death linked to an overdose of marijuana. Some people frown upon marijuana use because of the associated “high,” which many people consider to be much less debilitating than the effects of alcohol. Marijuana does contain THC, a cannabinoid known for its psychoactive effects. As with any recreational substance, cannabis should be used responsibly. It should be noted that people are turning to CBD specifically because it does not cause any psychoactive effects. There is no high associated with cannabidiol, and the cannabinoid still carries many of the medicinal properties associated with the cannabis plant. As a result, many people choose cannabidiol over traditional medical marijuana. CBD that is extracted directly from a variety of the cannabis plant and contains no additives is thought to be just as safe as cannabis itself. There are many different cannabidiol products on the market, each with different additive, purity, and potency factors. Unfortunately, some companies have leaned toward cashing in on the CBD market by providing lower quality products that may have synthetic additives, which is what led to millo31’s cautionary tale on Reddit. Other types of CBD products may not be low in quality, but do contain other naturally occurring compounds besides cannabidiol. It is important to note that in many cases the negative side effects could be related to any one of these additives, and is less likely to be related strictly to cannabidiol. The best way to avoid these side effects (or at least be able to pinpoint the cause if they happen to you) is to look for a company that provides total transparency about their product. Even though CBD is not regulated by the FDA, legitimate CBD manufacturers pay for a third-party laboratory to run tests on their products. These tests generally look at the quality of the CBD oil and provide information regarding potency, cannabinoid and terpene profiles, and purity. When purchasing a CBD product, you should have full access to a list of ingredients and any third-party test results. If you are unsure or think that you may be sensitive to any of these products, you should look for a product with higher purity. Avoid any synthetic additives and understand that any other additive (including natural additives) may have its own set of risks unrelated to cannabidiol. There is still much research to be done concerning the side effects of CBD. This makes it difficult to give any definite answers. When you delve into the world of online reviews, you will find lots of positive responses about the healthful benefits of CBD. Every so often, though, you will see a complaint or warning of adverse side effects. Generally, these side effects are mild and usually have a simple resolve. To help you make an educated decision for your health, below is a list the most commonly reported side effects related to CBD. These are some of the common experiences of others users or pulled from relevant studies that may explain what caused these side effects and how to avoid them. A look at some of the most recent studies regarding the safety of cannabidiol helps support these side effects. A study titled An Update on Safety and Side Effects of Cannabidiol: A Review of Clinical Data and Relevant Animal Studies pulls information from several studies over the years. The conclusion shows that in patients using CBD to treat epilepsy and psychotic disorders the most common side effects were diarrhea, loss of appetite, weight changes, and tiredness. Overall, the general safety profile of cannabidiol was confirmed. Most of the evidence suggests that cannabidiol products are just as safe as their source and that adverse side effects are generally related to improper dosing, other drug interactions, or nasty additives. There is a lack of medical evidence confirming any serious side effects and many studies that consistently suggest its wide range of health benefits. As a result, more and more doctors and medical and health institutions are supporting widespread use of CBD. If you are considering trying CBD or have noticed any strange or adverse reactions from your dose, consult your doctor. He or she will be able to help you pinpoint the problem, adjust your dose as needed, or recommend other options if CBD is not right for you."

Medium.com,Life,Chick and Egg: Redux,Cannabis,https://medium.com/@addictiondocMD/chick-and-egg-redux-d25e4d22ca58?source=topic_page---------263------------------1," I while ago I wrote a piece call The Chicken and The Egg looking at the modern bias caused by the assumption that drugs cause addiction. Everything associated with drugs, including the disease of addiction, is seen as a consequence of drug use rather than a possible cause of drug use. Well, that piece was mostly a thought experiment. I didn’t have any more evidence to say the assumption was wrong than those who put forward the assumption had, which is to say, none at all. All that changed recently. From the November 2018 issue of the journal Addiction comes an interesting prospective study looking at exactly this issue. The authors described how they designed the study to show if cannabis use in teenagers caused their association with other cannabis using youth or conduct problems. They seemed to fully expect that this is exactly what they’d find. But the picture is very different. In fact, a picture is exactly what they gave us. The authors point out that most in the field expect the associations to follow this picture: In the modern cultural narrative, cannabis use causes compulsive cannabis use (because the drug is addictive) and leads to cannabis use disorder. In addition, cannabis use leads people to hang around others who use the drug, because people willing to do illegal things congregate and they will share their criminal tendencies, leading to conduct problems. Everything caused by the drug. Their results were not what most expected however. It turned out that cannabis use wasn’t the root of all evil. If you’ve been following my web series or read my book, you’ll know that I favor a biological view of addiction as a primary brain illness that is largely genetic. I would expect symptoms before drug use. While the authors didn’t actually look for what I’d consider symptoms of addiction, they did look at conduct problems. One would expect that an early non-drug attempt to feel better from addiction symptoms might lead some to conduct problems, so the picture they found is very interesting. Rather than model A, they found model B: It turns out that rather than cannabis causing conduct problems, it’s the conduct problems that are there first. This doesn’t prove my model, but it is consistent with it. The last part, that of cannabis use disorder following cannabis use, also doesn’t argue for cannabis (or any other drug) causing addiction. Cannabis use disorder is a drug based syndrome defined in a book put out by the American Psychiatric Association based on a paradigm that was first published by them in 1981. This paradigm was created before the first neurobiological understanding of addiction as a single primary illness and has never been changed in spite of the evidence. In short any drug use disorder requires the drug to have been used prior to diagnosis. Cannabis use prior to cannabis use disorder diagnosis in this paper is an artifact of a man-made system, not a discovery of a natural cause and effect relationship. In those who have addiction, and have previously used problematic conduct to feel better and who also find that cannabis works, it is natural to assume that their addiction would likely come to involve cannabis as well. The authors’ paper won’t get much notice because it goes against the current popular narrative. It may be trotted out as pro-cannabis legalization evidence, but that would just limit its contribution to our understanding of which came first, the chicken or the egg. **************************************************************** Dr Wetsman is an addiction psychiatrist living in New Orleans.

Fierce advocates of pot will name it as a gentle herb useful as a panacea for all diseases, while nervous detractors will claim it to be an addictive narcotic that will bring on all sorts of inequity. For someone who isn’t a researcher it can be difficult to find real information regarding cannabis. The difficulty is doubled when the loudest and most numerous voices are the ones of misinformation. Typically you would expect journals such as The New York Times, The Wall Street Journal, and the New Yorker to publish high-quality, well researched articles about current events. However, in this past week these journals have published pieces not up to their current standard of journalism, all about the unanswered questions regarding the potential risks of cannabis. Is Marijuana as Safe as We Think? — Malcolm Gladwell
What The Advocates of Legalizing Pot Don’t Want You to Know — Alex Berenson
Marijuana is More Dangerous Than You Think– Alex Berenson I’ll let you know of my biases up front. I advocate marijuana legalization. I believe that the War on Drugs is a waste of taxpayer resources and has caused more damage to society than drugs do. But more than anything, I believe that people will continue to take drugs recreationally, and that legitimate research needs to be done on the effects. Potential users need to make informed decisions, and doctors need to know how cannabis can affect users’ health. This is particularly important with marijuana becoming a growing industry in the states where it has become legalized. Science and such industries don’t always mix well, as in the case of Big Tobacco and alcohol, where harmful effects are downplayed and outright lied about. Being an advocate for legalization actually makes me care more about access to good information, especially if it means that it could demonstrate cannabis to have unsafe qualities. I don’t want people I care about, and people in the different communities within which I exist, to hurt themselves. I’ve seen many friends succumb to mental illness or addiction, and witnessing party culture excess is enough to make me roll my eyes when people begin to evangelize cannabis as the answer. It’s fortunate that we live in a renaissance of cannabis research, where nearly every day new data is brought forth revealing risks, benefits, and new questions. For example, we now know that it is in fact true that CBD oil decreases epileptic seizures, long-term heavy marijuana use can raise the risk of developing psychosis, and that there are huge discrepancies between the reported concentration of THC and CBD in dispensary cannabis. Cannabis doesn’t affect all users equally, not all people experience pleasant effects, and the dosage can be highly variable even within a single strain. There are heaps of new data regarding cannabis’s effects ranging from beneficial to potentially harmful, for both heavy and occasional users. People need to be aware of the risks and benefits based on such careful studies, and it is all the more important in the age of the looming Big Cannabis. In the face of so much data, why would three major news sources known for their journalistic integrity publish nearly cookie-cutter versions of the same story regarding cannabis, all citing the same researcher, Alex Berenson? Let’s start with Malcolm Gladwell’s New Yorker piece, because he is famous for his surprising finds and clever articles. Gladwell asks an important question: Can cannabis can trigger psychosis? He brings up an excellent point, that there is much we don’t know about a substance that we’ve barely been able to study, due to its fairly recent legalization. But any information he describes regarding cannabis, mental health, and ultimately violence, is almost completely taken from from Alex Berenson’s book, “Tell Your Children: The Truth About Marijuana, Mental Illness, and Violence.” Alex Berenson is the writer of the other two stories, one in the New York Times and the other in the Wall Street Journal. It should raise a flag that a writer such as Gladwell, known for his in-depth articles, would take so much basis from a single source. But using Berenson’s data he jumps to dramatic conclusions. He starts with perfectly reasonable suggestions of how little we know about the side effects of cannabis, links it to increases in diagnoses of schizophrenia, and ultimately, suggests that it is responsible for a misrepresented increase in violent crime in Washington State. It is a seductive mixture of truth and misinformation tied to an alarming concept. Gladwell writes how the incidence of schizophrenia in northern Finland, Denmark, and the US has dramatically increased since 2000 and 2006, and he correlates this with rising use of cannabis. The problem is that mental health disorders in general have been on the rise, not just schizophrenia, and this is all over the world, not just in countries that have seen an increase in cannabis use. A quick Wikipedia glance shows that Finland and Denmark both have some of the lowest usage of cannabis in the world, numbers in the single digits, compared to the US (16.2%) and Canada (32.7). But while I could not find any data on the increase in schizophrenia diagnoses in Canada since 2000, what I did find is a study by Marie-Jose Dealberto, with a focus that schizophrenia tends to be common among Canadian immigrants. It posits that a deficiency in Vitamin D may be the culprit when one moves to a region of higher latitudes. The point is not that Vitamin D is the culprit, but rather that the rise of schizophrenia can have multiple factors and linking it directly to increased cannabis use amounts to statistical bunk. Gladwell uses an unnamed study that correlates violence among high school students with marijuana use to imply that Washington State’s rise in crime from 2014–2017 is due to marijuana legalization. Gladwell claims that Washington State saw a 40% rise in aggravated assault and murder. Washington’s increase in those crimes in actuality is closer to 6%. The combination of Gladwell’s wild exaggeration and his next paragraph should evoke images from the zombie film, “28 Days Later”: “Berenson, though, finds it strange that, at a time when Washington may have exposed its population to higher levels of what is widely assumed to be a calming substance, its citizens began turning on one another with increased aggression.” The correlation of cannabis, mental illness, and violence continue as themes in the articles by Alex Berenson. One piece is in the New York Times and the other in the Wall Street Journal. But even the most cursory examination puts Berenson’s data into question. Berenson states that the murder rate has gone up in states where pot has been legalized, not just Washington State. But while overall the rate of violent crime in the US has gone down, many other states without legal pot such as Texas, Alabama, and Kansas, have also risen. In fact, numerous large cities all across the US have experienced a substantial rise in violent crime post 2016. Minneapolis, Tampa, New York City are a few, but the cities overall are in states both with and without cannabis legalization. In the Wall Street Journal, Berenson describes a study done on British and Chinese men that supposedly demonstrates a link between cannabis use and violence:
https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5617870/ It mentions that violent British men misuse cannabis far more than Chinese men, but both groups use huge amounts of alcohol and other drugs as well. What is most telling about Berenson and the type of information he is willing to use is this sentence alone, from the Wall Street Journal: “But for centuries, people all over the world have understood that cannabis causes mental illness and violence — just as they’ve known that opiates cause addiction and overdose. Hard data on the relationship between marijuana and madness dates back 150 years, to British asylum registers in India.”

To consider that Victorian era asylums, known for admitting women for “hysteria”, in a British colony known for its racist policies dismissing local customs and diverse culture, as “Hard Data” should alone demonstrate Berenson’s poor scientific standards and low regard for truth. It is outright negligent and unethical to add what amounts to statistical noise to questions of such importance. We need articles with serious research to see the link between cannabis use and mental illness, and if it can, in fact trigger some mentally ill people to become violent. We need actual data to help people determine whether it’s safe for them as individuals to use cannabis. People with a mental illness seeking relief need to know if cannabis may worsen their condition. People at high risk for schizophrenia need real information as to whether occasional use can trigger it in the same way as heavy regular use can. But these questions won’t be answered by journalists like Malcolm Gladwell or Alex Berenson. These writers seek to either profit from their sensationalist drivel, or to stoke 50-year old fears once more in a country that’s finally performing real science."
Medium.com,Life,8 Cannabis Trends to Watch in 2019,Cannabis,https://medium.com/@garybizzo/8-cannabis-trends-to-watch-in-2019-88062350edfd?source=topic_page---------265------------------1," Originally published by Gary Bizzo on Equities.com Everyone and their dog are trying to figure out the next big trend in marijuana so they can capitalize on it. To me, the opportunities have been supplanted by big corporations and if you think you can ‘buy into’ the stock buying craze and make big bucks you’re a couple of years behind. Meanwhile the world is watching as societal norms are being turned on their head, corporations are clamouring to get a piece and traditional industries are bending all their rules and philosophies. According to a Deloitte report, our society is “in transition and industry is poised for growth.” No kidding, it doesn’t take rocket science to realize that what Baby Boomers have been buying illegally for years is now the new business for all to get into — unless you live in America. Yes, everyone is looking at Canada to see if the new legal framework will work or blow up in our faces. People are watching to see what industries are spawned from the devil marijuana seed and what legal/social/policy and regulatory issues will come up because of its legalization in 2018. One major social benefit is converting former criminals to legitimate business people. I figure it’s replacing one bad egg for another with no moral compass. So, the big marijuana experiment, on a large scale, is opening new opportunities for 2019 but it will be mainly for those huge corporations that have a lot of resources to throw around. I remember not that long ago listening to an Aurora Cannabis (ACB:CA) VP tell me they had over $80M in the bank. They still hadn’t licensed dispensaries back then. Recently Aurora spent over $3.5 billion gobbling up every marijuana related company they could from CanniMed to MedRelief and ICC. Some of the trends are not difficult to forecast but not hard to spot: Consolidation by companies like Aurora is bound to happen when people and banks are opening their wallets and the product demand is exceeding production. Craft industries have been acquired just to clear out the field. It’s common in other industries to cull the small fry and consume them for the small innovation they may bring to the market. We all know smoking is a dying trend — people want vaporizers or are moving to edibles and beverages. Some of the latest data from Arcview Market Research shows that California cannabis consumers alone spent $180 million on THC-infused food and beverages in 2017. One can assume that consolidated acquisition will be in these industries in advance of edible legalization in 2019. Meanwhile edible manufacturers are the new ‘drug dealers’ in Canada. My big surprize in 2017 was traditional banks and big brokerage houses denying their investments in marijuana while buying up as much as they could. The traditional industries are going to expand this trend in 2019 and big pharma and bevcos will finally attempt to grab lions share of the market. The rumour in 2018 that Coca Cola was in talks with Aurora sent everyone abuzz. It will happen in 2019. One must not confuse the picture of a drugged out hippie smoking a joint with the ‘new’ industry. Sure everyone is on the ‘let’s get high’ rush but the big news is the medical marijuana/health benefits coming out of the research. Imagine Pepsi or Corona beer infused with cannabis that will be healthy. The pharmaceutical companies already know the pain relief benefits of cannabis use. Their money is on the non-hallucinogenic benefits of cannabis. The trend will be major partnerships rather than buyouts. Medical research will trend in 2019. Millennial’s are leading the way with the need to understand the benefits and effects of MJ use. The social collateral obtained by finding innovative health uses of marijuana will be profound and probably legitimize its use to the rest of the world still teetering on the edge of acceptance. The concern for, and ecological awareness is coming to the fore in a big way. The pesticide giants have been given notice. There is no place in a marijuana joint for the stuff cigarette manufacturers have been stuffing people’s lung forever. Research and education will take on new meaning as ways to improve, capitalize and predict how cannabis can change the way we live. Laws are changing in 2019. One of Canada’s big issues came up with drunk driving laws. Are you incapacitated after smoking marijuana? Of course, unless you are a user and you will say it makes you more focused — ha! Being under the influence of cannabis is difficult to prove and the law has been changed recently to allow police to request breathalyser tests on drivers for any reason. Border laws? Ouch, what a conundrum! Four years ago a good friend was at the US border going home to Dan Diego where he owns a home and works. He was asked if he had ever been convicted of a drug offence. Being Canadian and unable to tell a lie he admitted that 40+ years ago in his teens he was caught with a joint and convicted. He candidly went on that years later he was ‘pardoned’. The border official reminded him that a Canadian pardon meant diddly and he was denied entry. He lost his $250k engineering job, cost him $25,000 in legal fees and six months of his life but he did get back to his home. Back to the current, anyone can be in the same boat. It’s now legal to carry cannabis on an airplane for Canadian domestic flights but cross the border — wham! While the US adamantly refuses to change border rules there will need to be concessions. Wait until the first big celebrity hits the border with a joint. It’s also very strange that in an open free society and the Internet is as it is for non-censorship that when one looks up information on marijuana, you will be censored by US websites. They ask for your birthdate and you must agree that you are over 18. It’s easier to watch pornography. Canada is poised to be, not only, the first G7 country to legalize cannabis but it will be the largest exporter and research market in 2019. It’s a changing world and while conservatives may find it reprehensible that pot is legal, to some the benefits are too many to argue. Unfortunately while some US states are now legal it will need 30+ states for federal law to reflect the will of the people. The world is watching Canada!

Medium.com,Life,Can the State Help Oakland’s Equity Program? | East Bay Express,Cannabis,https://medium.com/@ebanksrusby/can-the-state-help-oaklands-equity-program-east-bay-express-466674f5088b?source=topic_page---------266------------------1," By Nisha Balaram and Erin Banks Rusby Oakland resident Felicia Shaw has been crafting topical products, like cannabis body butter, for almost eight years in Oakland. And this year, Shaw’s business received a boost from Oakland’s cannabis equity program: She received a coveted spot in the equity permit program, which is designed to help people once targeted by the War on Drugs to get a leg up in the booming legal cannabis industry. But Shaw said that other equity program applicants are struggling due to the cost of entering the industry. “I’ve seen people I’ve worked with for years — seen them fall by the wayside,” said Shaw, who is the founder and CEO of Mystic Herbal Care. Since Californians voted to legalize cannabis in November 2016, a handful of California cities have created cannabis equity programs aimed at ensuring that people of color get a foothold in the industry, since communities of color disproportionately suffered from over-policing and profiling during the Drug War. But Oakland’s program has come under fire for not providing necessary financial support for equity participants. Oakland, however, is looking to get help from the California Cannabis Equity Act of 2018, which Gov. Jerry Brown signed into law in September. The law, also known as Senate Bill 1294, allows the four cities that have adopted or created cannabis equity programs — Oakland, San Francisco, Sacramento, and Los Angeles — to apply for priority funding from a $10 million state fund. The funds can then be used to assist equity program participants launch their businesses. But while the new fund has the potential to help address a fundamental shortcoming in Oakland’s equity program, cannabis entrepreneurs and those familiar with the industry say that some financial obstacles could still be tough to overcome, including California’s expensive rental market and other capital needs associated with starting a cannabis business. “The goal is to give folks a leg up so that they too can benefit from this industry,” said Rodney Holcombe, a lawyer with the nonprofit Drug Policy Alliance, a New York-based nonprofit aiming to end the War on Drugs and a key supporter of the bill. “There’s still a need for capital.” The new state funding can be used to support local equity applicants at cities’ discretion to cover program needs, such as waiving licensing fees, providing business loans to entrepreneurs, and offering trainings to businesses about how to comply with local and state laws. In a statement emailed to the Express, state Sen. Steven Bradford, D-Gardena, author of SB 1294, said his legislation is designed to create an “inclusive industry,” before the cannabis market “is flooded with wealthy, predominately white, entrepreneurs.” Greg Minor, the assistant to the Oakland City Administrator who is involved with cannabis and special permitting projects, said the city plans to apply for funding under SB 1294. Eugene Hillsman, deputy director of San Francisco’s Office of Cannabis, said that receiving funding from SB 1294 is “an opportunity that San Francisco will seek aggressively.” The city of Sacramento is considering applying for funding when its program officially begins, said Joe Devlin, chief of Cannabis and Policy Enforcement for the City of Sacramento. And Cat Packer, executive director of the Los Angeles Department of Cannabis Regulation, wrote in an email to the Express that the city hopes to use SB 1294 to help fund and support cannabis businesses. Advocates say equity programs can help level the playing field in the cannabis industry and allow underfunded entrepreneurs to compete with well-moneyed business interests. Each of the California equity programs requires that applicants fall under a certain income threshold. In Oakland, for example, applicants must earn below 80 percent of the city’s average median income. The equity programs also typically require applicants to meet additional criteria. In Oakland, applicants must have either a cannabis-related conviction or have lived for 10 of the past 20 years in a police beat with a disproportionately high number of cannabis-related arrests. In San Francisco, applicants need to meet three out of six additional criteria, such as losing housing in the city after 1995 “due to eviction, foreclosure, or subsidy cancellation.” But starting a cannabis business still depends on access to cash. Because cannabis is still a federally designated Schedule I drug, equity applicants can’t get loans from traditional banks. This limits where people can get the capital they need to get their business off the ground, because running a cannabis operation includes lots of start-up costs, from workforce training to business marketing. “You either have to have a ton of money, or be able to be supported by the state or some individual to start,” Holcombe said. Startup costs can be high in California, ranging from half a million to $2 million, said Allan Steiner of Green Rush Consulting, a consulting firm that advises cannabis entrepreneurs. Costs depend on the type of cannabis business. Those that process plant material, like cultivation and manufacturing, are more costly, while delivery companies are less expensive to launch. Oakland’s equity program opened its loan application process in November, and the loans differ from traditional loans, said Minor. “We don’t require any credit history in order to qualify for our loans,” he explained. The loans are also zero interest, though the first repayment is required after 30 days, a provision consistent with other microloan programs, Minor said. The loan program is a tiered model in which applicants can apply for different levels of funding depending on where they are in the process of establishing their business. Individual loans range from $5,000 to $50,000 and the maximum amount an Oakland Equity Applicant can borrow is $100,000. Additional state funding could help the city’s money go even further, said Zachary Knox, vice chair of the Oakland Cannabis Regulatory Commission. The demand is huge — an estimated 600 applicants are vying for money from a $3 million loan budget, he said. “Any support that we can get statewide makes the program run even stronger,” Knox said. He added that loans alone can’t provide enough financial support to program participants, because getting a start in the industry is so capital intensive. Shaw also noted that it can be hard for people to even get a bank account to receive a loan or to navigate cumbersome paperwork. “At first, I just used to do this thing, and now I have to climb this mountain,” Shaw said. “Why not just wait for an investor?” In addition to capital costs, cannabis entrepreneurs and experts expressed interest in using funding from SB 1294 to help defray the costs associated with complying with cannabis state regulations. “The biggest issue for everyone has been the chaotic regulatory process,” said Leslie Valencia, an independent researcher and consultant specializing in cannabis equity. Just trying to be in compliance with these changing regulations is tough on entrepreneurs, she said. LeVar Eddy, an African-American cannabis entrepreneur looking to start his cultivation business in the Bay Area, described having to navigate quickly changing packaging and labeling regulations earlier this year. Packaging of the final product now requires you to be able to see the actual cannabis, which wasn’t previously the case. “When you make changes that quickly, and you’ve already bought packaging that’s no longer viable, that is a huge cost,” said Eddy, who lives in Hayward, which does not yet have an equity program. Oakland’s cannabis industry also faces high rent costs and a lack of available space within areas zoned for cannabis businesses, also known as permitted zones. “It’s real estate — that’s what it’s boiling down to. If you don’t have a location, what do you expect a city or state to do?” Shaw said. “It’s almost like digging for gold. If you get that nugget, you better hold on to it.” Kaine Cherry, a policy fellow at the Hood Incubator, a nonprofit working to increase Black and Brown participation in the industry, points to SB 1294’s permissive language as being a sign that program administrators can be creative with how they use funds to address financial pressures that equity applicants face, including offsetting real estate costs. “There’s room for flexibility if it meets the need of an equity applicant,” Cherry said. Oakland’s program also has a physical bottleneck in that the city only processes and awards a limited number of applications. “Nothing costs money like waiting,” Steiner said. “When you’re trying to go through the permitting process or stamp process, it’ll take at least a year to get through if you’re lucky.” Funds from the Cannabis Equity Act can be used to hire new staff or consultants, though no more than 10 percent of funding can be used for those purposes. In addition to providing funding, SB 1294 requires equity programs to report certain details to the Bureau of Cannabis Control, such as how grant money is used and criteria for selecting equity applicants. Cherry said the Cannabis Equity Act is beneficial in that it forces cities to maintain their programs. “In order to get any of the grants from that pool, you have to have an equity program, Cherry said. “It will incentivize more equity programs, since there aren’t many in the context of California.” Regardless of the challenges it faces, Oakland has had a head start on other equity programs. “The thing that the city of Oakland did right is when they put out the cannabis program, the equity program was at the beginning,” said La Wanda Knox, a consultant with Make Green Go, Oakland’s official technical assistance program for cannabis entrepreneurs. “It was intertwined with the program versus being an afterthought.”"

Medium.com,Life,Do you Believe in “CBD Only?”,Cannabis,https://medium.com/@redactiondesormeaux/do-you-believe-in-cbd-only-45a4ec75551c?source=topic_page---------268------------------1," As CBD products grow in popularity, some studies are claiming that the cannabinoid needs to be combined with THC to activate its medicinal properties. In 2018, cannabidiol (CBD) has been a hot topic for discussion among weed enthusiasts. This non-psychoactive marijuana component can allegedly help people suffering from multiple conditions such as inflammation, pain, spasms, anxiety, seizures, psychosis, and more. Moreover, Donald Trump signed the Farm Bill on December 20th, 2018. This bill will legalize the industrial use of hemp, a cannabis plant producing CBD and low amounts of delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), the cannabinoid known for providing the feeling of intoxication. Given the hype surrounding the consumption of CBD among millennials for therapeutic purposes, this law will likely lead large corporations to promote products made from hemp. Nonetheless, some studies claim that CBD needs to be combined with other cannabinoids to provide relief to users. Hence, this would drastically undermine the medicinal potential of hemp and promote the use of marijuana-derived products. A McGill University study recently demonstrated that CBD acts on different receptors from those affected by THC. Small doses of cannabidiol administered for seven days to animal subjects successfully alleviated anxiety and pain, symptoms that are often related to chronic or neuropathic conditions. According to Dr. Gabriella Gobbi, the lead author of the study, the findings “elucidate the mechanism of action of CBD and show that it can be used as medicine without the dangerous side effects of the THC.” The U.S. Food & Drug Administration (FDA) also seems to believe in the effectiveness of CBD as a valid treatment for some diseases. On June 25th, 2018, the FDA approbated Epidiolex, which is the first FDA-approved drug containing purified cannabinoids derived from the cannabis plant. The FDA News Release states that “Epidiolex (cannabidiol) [CBD] oral solution [can be used] for the treatment of seizures associated with two rare and severe forms of epilepsy, Lennox-Gastaut syndrome and Dravet syndrome, in patients two years of age and older.” Billy Dunn, director of the Division of Neurology Products (DNP) in the FDA’s Center for Drug Evaluation and Research, believes that this purified CBD drug “will provide a significant and needed improvement in the therapeutic approach to caring for people with this condition.” Some evidence indicates that CBD requires other marijuana components like THC or cannabinol (CBN) to release its medicinal effect, even if it is in small quantities. The “entourage effect” theory supposes that cannabinoids are more effective when used symbiotically and explains why many promoters of medical marijuana claim that CBD-rich is superior to pure CBD. A study published in September 2018 examined the difference in efficiency between CBD-rich extracts and purified CBD products to treat epilepsy. Overall, the researchers found that “there were more reports of improvement from patients treated with CBD-rich extracts (318/447, 71%) than patients treated with purified CBD (81/223, 36%)” and that CBD-rich extracts seemed to cause less adverse effects than purified CBD. However, there was no statistical disparity of improvement between treatments for individuals who reported at least a 50% reduction in the frequencies of seizures. While delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol is still stigmatized because of its psychoactive side effects, some products have CBD/THC ratios ranging between 1:1 and 30:1, which can neutralize the potential undesired consequences of THC. By 2022, the CBD market is expected to be 40 times bigger. Many businesses are trying to jump on the bandwagon and deliver cannabidiol products to the public, as the demand will probably skyrocket in the upcoming years, especially since the approval of the Farm Bill. With this booming popularity comes certain risks such as mislabeling of “CBD branded” products sold online. A study conducted in 2017 revealed that among 84 analyzed products, 26% of them contained less cannabidiol than advertised and 21% of them had some THC. Is pure CBD the Holy Grail of the cannabinoids or an over-hyped placebo? Only time will tell, but as usual, the truth is probably somewhere in the middle.

Guida The kitchen counter is covered in green. Two pounds of neon-bright, high-grade reefer next to its equivalent in cash, stacks of twenties totaling $8000. But three young men and one young lady, all white-Hispanic college students, are growing a bit apprehensive. The bud counts twenty grams short. “Razzmatazz,” the dealer, cocks a doubting sneer as he lets the buyer in the $80 Armani T-shirt know “when that was weighed out before you came, it was on point.” But the Armani guy’s electronic Tanita scale doesn’t lie; the “judge” reads 276 grams, just a little off. Still, for this price, no one takes a slack bag. A tense discussion ensues about appropriate compensation. Fortunately the girl finds the derelict nugget on the floor before the boys get rowdy. It must have fallen … “Sure,” Razzmatazz quips. The deal is done, everyone’s happy. Razz counts his money and instructs the buyers to be on their way: “Get the fuck out of my house,” he snarls in jest, sort of. The bunch packs into a brand-new Ford Explorer parked outside the West Kendall home and speeds recklessly away, not giving the young kids playing on the quiet neighborhood street much time to move out of the way. With that over, Razzmatazz prepares to spark a Cheech and Chong blunt not much smaller than a Little League baseball bat. He made some money and has about an hour to relax, puff on herb by the pool before his mom shows up. He offers me a toke but I decline. “Pussy,” he disses me. I wonder out loud if the time will come when Razz sets his sights on a career that’s a little less illegal. He lets me know he intends to do something worthwhile with his life, not just deal. The 22-year-old Christopher Columbus High graduate from an upper-middle-class family takes music engineering classes at Miami-Dade Community College, helps around the house, and cooks for his two little sisters when his mother is away — which is a lot (she works). He wants to be a sound engineer or concert promoter in the future. In the meantime, he sells pot. It ain’t Lucy & Desi anymore
The images of drug dealers in popular culture are often limited to hard-knock street thugs or kingpin drug lords — either a former hustler like Ice-T, the platitude-pusher with the urban drawl, or made men in Petrocelli suits and platinum bracelets, like John Gotti or Willie Falcon. But selling drugs isn’t always motivated by survival or criminal ambition, especially when dealing marijuana. So don’t leave out privileged and middle-class suburban youth, like these kids from the pleasant environs of Kendall and Coral Gables, decamped from inner-city pressure all their lives. They sell pot for the high times, and the easy money ($40,000 to $60,000 a year), and the coolness of it — not to mention the convenience of zipping only a quarter of a mile in Dad’s Jeep Cherokee to do business. “Kicking” pot also does wonders for the preppie dealers’ popularity, whether it’s welcome or not. Given that a friend with weed is a friend indeed, dealers find themselves surrounded by tagalongs. That gets old quick. “My house turned into a hang for natural-born losers looking for a free high,” Razz complains. “My girlfriend eventually sent my ‘satellites’ to hell; my mom might’ve, but she’s never home.” That take-charge girlfriend, we’ll call her “Double L,” shows up at Razz’s place as he credits her disposition, and right on time to finish off the dack. Double L is just off work, a receptionist at a downtown marketing firm, and she’s soon joined by a friend who’s on her way to her job, tutoring little kids at an afterschool program in Kendall. They take turns on the jibber’s fumes. Two young ladies dressed in pantsuits, carefully inhaling: enough to make Bill Clinton blush. Double’s friend coughs a bit, giggles, and declares herself ready to go educate (and tolerate) her group of fourth-graders. (Apparently anytime is right for getting high.) “We don’t really party on pot,” Double explains. “We drink when we go out and smoke when there’s nothing to do, or when we want to do nothing. This is a downtime drug.” There’s always plenty of downtime for potheads (work is definitely downtime). When they need an “adhesive” (as in Band-Aid) for boredom, it’s Razz they consult. Strangely enough, with almost as many girls smoking, there aren’t as many buying. Razz attributes that to the guys who willingly spark them up. “Ask my girlfriend when was the last time she or her friends gave me money for all the weed they smoke,” Razz implores. Double doesn’t waste time letting him know that “you have to get me high so I can deal with all your bullshit,” followed by a sideswiping stare. That’s the end of that. Razz makes plain that “the people I flip bags to are mostly guys who come by every other day for a half-eighth [of an ounce] so they can go home, get high, play video games, and jerk off. I wouldn’t say they’re losers or anything, ’cause I like them, they always have exact change.” And they’re loyal customers who value the convenience of an “around-the-way” (neighborhood) hook-up. Suburban Miami-Dade is not considered a hotbed of narcotic activity, but it’s not Langley, Virginia either. Young entrepreneurs continually feed the demand for drugs in communities such as Kendall and Coral Gables, places where users can readily afford and always want the “good stuff.” Guys like Razzmatazz secure themselves enough dough and free headstash to keep their finances straight and minds twisted. He long ago quit his “real” job — working as a real estate office assistant — though he occasionally takes temp gigs to explain the abundance of disposable income. He now nets between $3000 and $4000 a month from serving chronic. He hangs at home, dealing between classes, then spends a few hundred a week on new Kenneth Cole shoes or suede jackets along with what he blows in South Beach clubs or at Coconut Grove watering holes. But he realizes, “I gotta start saving.” Razz’s income comes almost entirely from moving pot. He only sells “krypie,” a potent, limey, seedless version of weed likened to bright-green kryptonite. “This is what killed Superman,” Razz points out matter-of-factly. He has a stoner’s sense of humor, reciting half-wit observations amusing mostly to himself. Taking advantage of his mother’s long work hours, Razz sells from their home. He considers it much safer than meeting buyers on the street. He says cops are on the lookout for transactions between suspicious people at places like gas stations and shopping malls. He sees up to ten people daily whenever he’s stocked, which is most of the time (a week or two every couple of months is devoted to replenishing his stash and cooling off). On the days he’s available, he moves between one and two ounces. That’s $300 to $600 on an average day, $100 to $200 of that profit, and mostly selling $15 gerbers (grams) or $25 dollar half-eighters (half-eighth of an ounce). Lately, though, he’s been kicking large amounts, like today’s transaction, cutting back the profit margin but easing up on the hassles that come with nickel-and-diming his inventory. He says he could easily move twice as much, but believes “the more [indiscriminately] you sell, the more strange people you have calling you in the middle of the night or showing up at your door. And too many customers ask for a “spot,” saying they’ll owe me whenever they’re short; before I know it, hundreds of dollars are on the street, a lot of which I won’t get back.” So Razz is more careful now: “I used to have anyone come over and buy; now, if I don’t know you, you better come with someone I do, or we can’t do business.” Friends and regulars only then, though today’s deal involved friends of friends. He recounts the time when a buyer, a thirtysomething Cuban refugee with a teenage girlfriend, came for “a lot of pot.” The man, who’d bought from Razz before, had someone knock on the front door in the middle of the deal. When Razz went to answer, no one was there. Back in his bedroom, the Cuban, his jailbait, and a pound and a half of smoke worth $6000 were gone. His sliding glass floor-to-ceiling window was open. That didn’t make him sweat nearly as much as the time someone broke in, trying for the whole stash. Razz came home to a busted door (there was no alarm), and found his closet empty, nothing taken but bud. His judgment was clearly clouded by frustration and a daily dope fix, because he foolishly decided to call the cops. A police officer arrived about the same time his mom did, and he concluded the burglars likely broke in to steal drugs. Only a lack of evidence prevented Razz from being charged, but now the police knew about him. His mother wasn’t surprised by the hypothesis — what her son does for a living isn’t the best-kept secret. Many of his visiting “pals” pass by for only minutes at a time. And the names of those who owe him money, the ones he remembers anyway, go up on a Fisher-Price chalkboard in his room, along with how much they owe and for how many grams: Chacho, $50–3.5 grams; Narciso — $100–7 grams. Not to mention undisguised smoking sessions even when she’s home and bitching. While she chastises his “job,” no one, not even Razz, remembers her ever telling him to stop. She knows a thing or two about pot dealers: Her husband (Razz’s father) — we’ll call him Julio — is in federal prison in Butner, North Carolina doing a long bit; he was busted driving more than $150,000 worth of Happy Relaxin’ Puffin’ Stuff cross-country in a Winnebago, à la ex-Dallas Cowboy Nate Newton. The pot, evidently, never falls too far from the plant. In the name of the father
Razz emulates his father, an eccentric man who played guitar in an acid-rock band in the Seventies; had a room full of stuffed endangered animals, including a spotted owl, a grizzly bear, and a Florida panther; and handed Razz a surprise on his seventeenth birthday: a quarter-pound of grass for him and his friends to float out on. Razz says his father, who’s been at Butner for five years, blames himself for what his son does, but won’t come down on him. No one in his family will. Razz is the man of the house now; he says that fact dawned on him when he had to sell off his dad’s animal collection to black-market buyers arranged by “friends” of the family. The huge house they were living in, two stories on an acre and a half in East Kendall, was leased out to a couple for “financial necessity” after Julio went down hard. (Ironically the couple who leased it used part of the space to grow weed, something the family found out when cops — needling them about it — told them about the eventual bust.) Fortunately family finances have stabilized. Razz’s new home is a more modest but polished three-bedroom house. His mother runs a thriving travel agency now, as opposed to the failed attempts at legitimate work she and her husband had tried before. But Razz will drop a grand on her night table every now and again, no questions asked. She doesn’t like to speak about any of this, in fact she wishes none of it was being written down, but she does share one thought: “What my son does with his life, I have no control over. Kids today can do what they want, they know what’s right and wrong.” The truth is, Razz’s occupation doesn’t bother her too much — unless it invades her house. Like the punk who took Razz off. He turned out to be an old classmate named Bobby, who’d dropped by earlier that day to “cap,” but passed when he heard Razz was going out, seeing the perfect opportunity to score free weed. Bobby was caught the same night by the cops — he was found parked at the intersection of Coral Way and 87th Avenue, asleep at the wheel from too many Rohypnol (sedative) tablets; he had the pot, a scale, and the tools he used to break into Razz’s place on the passenger seat beside him. (After a night in jail, Bobby served a few months of community service.) Special Investigations Sgt. Manuel Castro, an officer with the Miami Police Department for 23 years, says most arrests involving marijuana fall into cops’ laps — like the Bobby case. “You’d think they’d all be careful, but they’re not. The dealers assume no one notices their behavior until a suspicious neighbor reports them. We depend on a lot of outside tips, and poor decisions by offenders, for pot arrests,” Castro notes. Many of these kids don’t think they’re getting in over their heads, until they start robbing each other. Then the seriousness of their actions can blow up in their faces. Last February, a twenty-year-old head altar boy, Ibrahim Khoury, was allegedly fatally shot by eighteen-year-old Andres Carvajalino in Coral Gables, according to Miami Herald reports. The victim was there to protect his cousin George Khoury, the purported dealer, from shady punks. Someone should have been keeping an eye on him. The cousins met with Carvajalino and two of his friends in a lot off US 1, then tried to take off when a gun was pulled on them. The shooter, a Killian High dropout, was attempting to steal an ounce of pot worth $300. He shot Khoury through the heart, according to the reports. Carvajalino is currently on trial, the death penalty looming. Without getting arrested or shot, Razz learned a lesson from the take-off, but he still had to make up the money he’d lost — his grower supplies bud “on the arm” (no money up front): “I freaked out. I called him to explain that I got jacked,” Razz remembers. “He just had me work it off; for two weeks I was selling pot and turning over all the profit.” It wasn’t too hard. Pot is the most popular drug in suburbia. It’s clean, like the kids using and selling it. Pot users smoke regularly, whereas users of designer drugs like Ecstasy, or cokeheads, or junkies, are — on this level — weekend warriors, according to Razz, who admits to moving some Ecstasy and mescaline once in a while. Drugs like cocaine (now called “butter”) are much less in demand, and are much riskier in terms of jail time, so it doesn’t make much sense to sell them. “If you want to make flow [high profits], cocaine is a good way to cash in,” he admits, “but butterheads are wigged-out customers who’ll call you at 5:00 a.m. Sunday morning,” and that’s just a drag. “And cops don’t let you go after finding coke in your car like they might with pot,” Razz says. He’s been caught and released several times with stern lectures and warnings. He was arrested for possession once, when police found fifteen grams in his car after pulling him over for a traffic violation. That was still five grams short of felony weight, so he spent one night in jail and took part in a county “diversion” program. The program, usually optioned to first offenders, put Razz through “boring-as-hell self-help videos and group counseling.” But he loved the free doughnuts. Still none of this stops him from selling dope, at least for now. The pot supply is endless. The federal National Institute on Drug Abuse (NIDA) tracked a steady rise in marijuana consumption by high school seniors through the Nineties, and estimated that less than a quarter of them smoked in 1992 — the year Dr. Dre released The Chronic, his epic statement on the subject. More than a third use now (15 million between the ages of 15 and 24 nationally; 100,000 in Miami-Dade). By contrast, Sgt. Castro explains that “drugs like Ecstasy, cocaine, and the popular but banned prescription painkiller, Rohypnol, are mostly produced in the Netherlands, Colombia, or Mexico and smuggled into the U.S. When a large shipment is intercepted by agencies like the Port Authority, it affects the availability and price of the current supply.” He adds that pot can be homegrown in back yards and inside houses around the U.S., so prices are stable. According to the Domestic Cannabis Eradication and Suppression Program, funded by the federal Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA), over 70 percent of the marijuana sold in the U.S. is cultivated domestically. “I think I’ve spoken to maybe two people who’ve never gotten high,” Razz swears. What catches the attention of researchers is the fact that pot use increased most significantly over the past ten years among white adolescents living in suburban areas whose family incomes are in excess of $80,000 per year. NIDA says 48 percent (seven million in the U.S.; 50,000 locally) admitted to smoking in 2000, as compared to 28 percent in 1990. The common notion of scoring drugs still has these nice kids wandering through the inner city looking for street-corner pushers every time they want a sack. Wrong. If that were the case, there would be plenty of private-school jits getting jacked by hoods or roped by cops (both know white kids driving new rides in shit hoods aren’t sociology students). “When a kid gets busted in a place like the ‘zero’ part of the Grove or Goulds, it’s because they’re looking for crack, heroin, or coke,” Razz affirms. No. The deal is, nice homes, green grass (the kind that grows on lawns) are the new pot turf. Razz says he competes with “countless” dealers throughout Kendall, Coral Gables, Westchester, and South Miami, and describes them as “ordinary people who take up kicking to other ordinaries because none of them want to deal with real criminals.” He remembers as a high school freshman eight years ago that “you might have to wait around for a day for good krypie or you had to find someone who was a crook, because there weren’t as many people kicking as there are now.” So enterprising smokers with no scruples have taken a chance of making a buck off the smokers around them — their schoolmates, friends, and family. As they cap more, they sell to more people, so it’s in the veins of the dream-clean, safe neighborhoods of America. Lotta Razzes out there. Supply-side buddy
It helps a dealer like Razz to have a friend for a grower. The usual pot “farmer” in Miami-Dade — outside the collegiate market, according to Sgt. Castro — is Hispanic and middle-aged. But Razz’s guy is Kiki, a graduate of a prestigious prep school, Belen Jesuit, who lives on his own in South Miami and isn’t very much older. Like many growers in the preppy pot market, he uses the attic in his apartment to crop pot with all the latest technology. Kiki leads a life that’s normal to the naked eye. He works a full-time job in sales, likes to hang at Tobacco Road, and has had no brushes with the law other than speeding. Unlike Razz, who, with his ghetto fade and judicious tats, hits some middle ground between clean-cut and cool, Kiki is practically J. Crew preppy, a Cuban version of Michael Keaton. He wears his hair short, shirt tucked in, and the face of his leather-strapped watch is turned under his wrist. “A real stand-up guy,” Razz told me on the way to K’s crib, in an attempt to sound Soprano. In Kiki’s apartment, the aroma of herb is hard to hide, even with periodic sprays of Ozium. But the place gives no hint of funny business aside from the unmistakable scent. In fact I’ve never seen such a tidy bachelor pad before. Up in the attic, though, he unveils the sixteen plants he is currently raising like a proud parent. Whoever says that money doesn’t grow on trees has never seen a pot farm. Advances in hydroponics (indoor cultivation of plants without soil) are primarily to thank, or blame, depending on how you look at it. Hydroponics have significantly changed the way pot is grown, especially in Florida where outdoor farming has stammered and indoor growth is shooting up. The DEA lists us as one of the top five indoor-pot-producing states, based on the agency’s seizures in 2001, along with Oregon, California, Kentucky (now you know where the bluegrass comes from), and Washington. Many younger growers start off with a walk-in closet, but Kiki’s attic is the suitable six-foot-five. A beginner can build a closet system capable of sustaining between eight and sixteen small plants. All he would need is a 400-watt high-pressure sodium or metal halide bulb (for simulating the sun), a ballast (miniature transformer), rock wool or buckets to grow the plants in, and a reservoir dripping system to feed them. The most expensive component would be the ballast and bulb, and they only cost $150-$200 at any electrical supply store. For a few hundred extra, growers can get fancy with the addition of PH meters to measure the growing medium’s acidity ($50-$100), carbon dioxide regulators for sustaining sufficient CO2 levels ($120), and other accessories to increase yield and speed growth; the amateur can put together the basic system for about $600 at any hydroponics specialty store. Gold Coast Hydroponics on Bird Road and 71st Avenue is endorsed by the dealers I talked with, and is one of five hydroponics equipment outlets in Miami-Dade. “Just make sure you say you’re growing tomatoes,” Kiki warns. He says a small system with ten to fifteen plants will yield between three and four pounds of dope in about five to six months. That’s almost $16,000 for a starter system! More daring entrepreneurs rent out entire apartments or houses to grow ten or twenty times as much with multiple units using the most sophisticated hydroponics money can buy. Kiki says profit isn’t what prompted him to grow, though. He’s a ferventsmoker, someone who spent anywhere from $100 to $200 on pot a week. Eight hundred a month was a rough nut on a young kid, so he began selling, and he’d hardly sold more than a few bags before he began growing. After moving out on his own a few years ago, Kiki learned “farming” through a friend with a closet full of sprouting weed. “I just wanted to smoke for free. I enjoyed sparking people up and I thought it would be cool to have a small system, but I soon cropped enough to make [real] money. So I expanded,” Kiki explains. Kiki’s from a well-to-do Cuban family with a house in Coral Gables who suspect him of growing or dealing pot about as much as they think he’s a terrorist. Unlike Razz, his partner in crime, he doesn’t publicize his green habit, especially near his family. He almost did once, when he hid pictures of his crop in a photo album and accidentally left it on his parents’ kitchen table. He hurried back to find his mom looking through the photos on the next-to-last page of the album, where unmistakable images of marijuana were stacked behind a picture of his girlfriend. “I took the album and ran, saying I was in a hurry,” Kiki recalls. It wasn’t a sense of guilt that had him conniving. He wasn’t sorry for the porno magazines he kept under his bed either, but he didn’t leave those out for his mom to see. He doesn’t think what he does now is wrong in any way other than acknowledging he’s breaking the law. It’s a hobby for him, a hobby that nets him about $50,000 a year, tax-free. Doesn’t a young man with a college education, a job, and not another ounce of inclination toward criminal behavior find himself conflicted with the laws against his home business? He says, “No, it’s a stupid law and the risks I’m willing to take. I like bud.” And he smokes it. Don’t get high off your own supply — that’s a line from Scarface to these guys, not a rule of thumb. “That’s the attitude plenty of young start-up pot growers and dealers have,” Sgt. Castro believes. “They begin as smokers who want pot for themselves and end up with enough to sell, [and] it goes on from there. And whenever we bust these people they always try to explain that their stash is for personal use, as if that makes having a few pounds of marijuana okay,” Castro says with a befuddled shrug. You’d think dealers with such an avid affection for reefer would be idealistic on the issues surrounding decriminalization. But this isn’t flower-power time. Idealism has been replaced with pragmatism and an all-about-the-Benjamins outlook. As far as revolutions go, Razz says he’s “read about those in history class.” Dealing is a business and smoking is a pastime for him, not a counterculture component. Besides, today’s burnout doesn’t always fit a particular anti-authoritarian bill: Many wear Dockers, go to church, and vote Republican, or at least intend to (like Kiki). Involving themselves politically in defense of getting high doesn’t go beyond righteous chitchat while passing a joint around. Kiki believes toking “is not as harmful as the government’s anti-pot hoopla says it is, but not as easy on my mind and body as I’d like it to be.” Razz couldn’t care less about the political state of pot smoking. Legalization would hurt his revenue anyway. Dealers don’t typically apply for membership with NORML, the National Organization for Reform of Marijuana Laws. And in regard to dope’s effect on his health, Razz replies, “If I thought about how bad Big Macs are for me, I’d become a vegetarian.” That reminds him — he’s got the munchies and a trip to McDonald’s is in order. Sgt. Castro admits the police’s focus on stamping out harder drugs and the easy time courts often give convicted pot dealers with no criminal history has a lot to do with the amount of growing going on. He says the first-time-convicted pot dealer will not see any significant jail time. “There is a notion [current] that marijuana activity is not as bad as Ecstasy and cocaine,” Castro acknowledges. DEA Public Information Officer Joseph Kilmer concurs, “The priority of law-enforcement agencies now is in fighting the trafficking of cocaine, Ecstasy, and heroin, because of the significantly higher damage these drugs do. Then comes marijuana.” And they don’t profile pot dealers either: Kilmer says, “There is no type of pot dealer, it can be anyone.” Don’t think the DEA isn’t busting pot kickers, though. For a crime that’s admittedly low on the hit list, it still gets after domestic pot growing. In 2001 the DEA seized over 30 metric tons of marijuana in Florida alone. Its Domestic Eradication Program sniffed out 551 grow sites, destroyed over 28,000 plants with an estimated value of $28.2 million. It booked 325 cultivators. How much is actually consumed and produced in the U.S. is unknown because agents speculate that seized crops and arrested dealers make up a small portion of domestic production. But new growers pick up where the busted ones leave off. The Office of National Drug Control Policy released a study last year speculating that in 2000, Americans spent an estimated $10.4 billion to consume 1009 metric tons of marijuana. Dealers and cops on the street say that’s a low-ball assumption. New studies are saying that these dealers should have a harder time getting rid of pot. The National Center on Addiction and Substance Abuse released a study last month estimating only 25 percent of 1000 teens polled admit to smoking marijuana. The same study says teens find pot easier to purchase than cigarettes. The study was conducted as a survey of fourteen- to seventeen-year-olds, a grouping that is misleading, considering most published reports on pot use divide younger adolescents from older ones more prone to smoking. Research by NIDA also points to a decline in pot use overall this year, but it’s only down one percentage point from 49.2 percent of high school seniors who had used marijuana in 2000. “No one is doing less of anything,” Sgt. Castro scoffs. “You’d be surprised how many people are growing throughout different neighborhoods in Miami-Dade. The police aren’t going to get to most of them.” In fact Castro says there is no strategy that can be applied to weeding (pun intended) out pot growing or dealing, like there is for other drugs. “The wealth of our resources goes into fighting cocaine and Ecstasy trafficking primarily,” he explains. Besides, it’s hard to infiltrate the new pot rings. He notes their fraternal and social structure as obstacles for police intelligence, where independent distributors and their buddies take the place of the organized criminals who run most other rackets with a high per-capita markup. As Castro mentioned, cops depend on tips from neighbors (not FPL, as many believe) and occasional police helicopter sweeps of suspected areas using infrared sensors called Fleers, which detect heat from growers’ lamps, to find pot houses. Even that is not enough to obtain a search warrant, though. Their best aid comes from the complacency of the growers themselves. “One guy we had an eye on came out of his house smoking a joint and had marijuana on the front seat of his car, giving us enough reason to go into his house; half of it was partitioned off for growing,” Castro explains. Last March, according to Castro, Metro-Dade Police officers busted a hydroponics lab that took up a full two-story house off West Kendall Drive. The neighbors grew suspicious when the scent of flowering pot plants began causing contact highs — even local pets were acting goofy. When the police came to check, the owner was watering his lawn. An officer approached just to ask questions, not enter the home. The man pushed the cop to the ground and ran into the house, escaping through the back. Police followed and found over 150 plants. Razz believes there isn’t much the police can do to stop pot growing or selling because of the profit margins involved. And he keeps the profit coming by using conventional marketing and wholesaling methods for his unconventional business. Sometimes Razz’s inventory will dry, and Kiki’s harvest won’t be ready on time, but clients still need weed. Razz will refer them to other dealers he knows for the time being (usually kids who bought enough from him to sell some later, not real rivals). He doesn’t worry about losing customers, because his weed is so good — Kiki’s green thumb almost always produces funk bud, luscious “haze” or “northern lights” sprung from Cannibis Cup seeds brought back from Amsterdam by friends. Razz never has dirty “shwag” (junk smoke) for sale. He says a lot of other dealers will buy dank or premature pot at a discount and sell it at a full retail price, but they don’t keep loyal customers. Some dealers increase the weight of their stash by spraying it down with water or fruit juice (which enhances fragrance), so customers pay more for less. Razz advertises untampered merchandise. Kiki uses a meticulous curing method, rotating buds through aeration and incubation periods for as long as two weeks after they’re cut, ensuring dense, crystal-covered buds. Razz also emphasizes convenience when he sells, never putting his buyers on a mission to cap; he’s reliable, serves quality, and his transactions are no-hassle — so what could be bad? Whenever he “re-ups” after dry spells, he throws telemarketing campaigns, calling up his regulars and letting them know a new shipment has arrived. He’s like a store manager who strives for customer satisfaction, and Kiki is the manufacturer, determined to put out a product of the highest quality. “When you have the best bud in town and a dealer who knows enough reefer aficionados to sell to?” Kiki offers. Razz compares street value to wholesale prices for pot like the Nightly Business Report. Prices vary from state to state but Florida, thanks to so many local suppliers, has relatively low-cost numbers for potent marijuana compared to places like the Midwest, where growing conditions outside are difficult and most of the pot is imported from the West Coast or the South. An ounce of top-shelf krypie in St. Louis, where it’s called “kind” bud, might have anywhere from $50 to $150 of tax applied to it, selling for up to $450, according to regional price listings on marijuana.com. “Even when I travel to Gainesville or Tallahassee, I’ll add as much as twenty percent tax to bags I sell. They just don’t have a lot of krypie around and they get tired of ‘regs,’” Razz explains. “Regs” is traditional grass grown in soil, in which female plants (the ones that are smoked) are not separated from male plants, resulting in seeds that halt THC (the active ingredient) production. The high from regs is dull and numbing compared to the sharp, floating sensation given off by krypie, which tastes tangier, a much more pleasant smoke. The Miami market has not seen price inflation like other parts of the country have. Prices have been steady for a decade (although Razz says the biggest Doral dealer has begun selling ounces for $350). Down here, the minimum unit commonly sold on the street is a gram (a nickel bag for you old-timers). Razz says a gram of potent sinsemella (which means without seeds), or krypie, goes for $15 to $20. An eighth of an ounce, or 3.5 grams, sells for $50. When someone buys a half-ounce, or 14 grams, they begin to get a little more bang for their buck, $150. “A beginning dealer, usually the younger kids, will buy an ounce for $300. When they break it up and sell it by the gram it brings back $400, making $100 on top of that $300 investment,” Razz says. “Now when you move up to capping a quarter-pound [four ounces] for $1000 you can make up to $600 profit, so it pays to buy more. Your relationship with your supplier helps too.” Razz says it’s best to find your own grower, although that can be difficult because secrecy is the name of the dealing game. A lot of growers are willing to dispense their supply with no money down. The dealer returns the asking price to the grower minus his profit, which is basically commission. “Growers never want to go out and sell … too risky. They find a group of people they can trust to move it,” Razz says. “They employ a sales team; if you get complicated too many times, like when I got jacked, they stop answering your calls.” But Kiki calls Razz back because he prefers to keep working with the same person. “If too many people find out [about you], [then] you should stop,” Kiki says, adding that he’ll probably quit soon thanks to the growing numbers who know about his attic. Razz says he plans to stop selling pot too, At Some Point … We all laugh. “There’s too much to pass up, though,” Razz exults. “I know the right people, not vicious Miami Vice criminals, but average Joes who happen to have a grow room in back of the crib and want to make some extra flow …” It all comes back to the smoking. There is a certain satisfaction for these guys knowing that what begins in Kiki’s attic, and gets sold at Razz’s front door, ends up elevating young minds around town. It’s what amuses them most during a hazy session, as coughing and laughing squeeze out of their bellies and a fat dack is on the run. They share a toke for the money and the fun of being two red-eyed, stoned dealers who could pass for ordinary, upstanding citizens, because, in many ways, they are. They enjoy a functional partnership. Kiki needs someone he trusts, and Razz, living at home, needs a grower who’s careful. They go back up to Kiki’s attic to survey the next harvest. Kiki guesses three weeks before it’s ready. Razz wants them down as soon as possible. “Come on dog, we gotta move on this one,” he exclaims, playfully shoving his grower. “See the hairs on the plant, they’re still white, not red, so stop pushing me, man,” Kiki tells Razz. “But I am the pusher man!” Razz raps while prancing out of the room. Kiki rolls his eyes. The hilarity of the moment is interrupted by the car-alarm ring of Razz’s cell phone. A customer. Some kid Razz used to play baseball with: “Meet me at my crib, I’ll be there in ten minutes…. Yeah, at 6:15.” Since he’s high as a kite and his timing sense is warped, Razz underestimates the rush-hour traffic that will make the trip from South Miami to West Kendall more like forty minutes, not ten. When he arrives at his house, the buyer is sitting in his front yard and his mom is standing at the door. “This kid has been waiting for you but he doesn’t know why he’s here,” his mother points out dryly. “Come on Mom, you know why he’s here,” Razz replies, as the kid’s face turns bright red. “He’s here to pick up a Little League bat,” Razz continues. His mom doesn’t find him funny, but she goes on inside, without saying a word. Originally published at www.miaminewtimes.com on October 24, 2002."
Medium.com,Life,2018 Farm Bill Legalizes Hemp In USA,Cannabis,https://medium.com/@ministryofhemp/2018-farm-bill-legalizes-hemp-in-usa-d96d0e8b2dc5?source=topic_page---------270------------------1," The United States just legalized hemp. Pres. Donald Trump signed the Agriculture Improvement Act of 2018, better known as the 2018 Farm Bill, earlier today. This omnibus bill includes numerous programs and policy changes, not all of which are related to agriculture. For hemp supporters and industry professionals, it’s a cause for celebration. Hemp is now out of reach of the Drug Enforcement Administration and, with a few notable exceptions, closer to being treated like any other crop. “It’s been a long time coming and a lot of people have put a lot of effort in to get [legal hemp] to happen,” said Courtney Moran, founding principle of Earth Law, LLC, a firm that specializes in hemp law. Spearheaded this year by Sen. Mitch McConnell, the hemp legalization amendment was inspired by previous efforts from Rep. James Comer, and decades of advocacy work by hemp supporters nationwide. Legalizing hemp had bipartisan support in both the House and Senate. Legislators softened the most problematic clause in the amendment, which bans some people with felony drug convictions from participating in the hemp industry, during negotiations between the two chambers. One remaining uncertainty is CBD oil, the massively popular healing supplement made from hemp. Now out of reach of the DEA, negotiations with the Food & Drug Administration over the supplement’s legality could be complex. “We’re feeling terrific but the battle is not over,” said Jonathan Miller, general counsel to the U.S. Hemp Roundtable, an industry advocacy organization. “We’ve got state laws that we need to deal with, we’ve got the FDA issues looming.” Legalizing hemp in the U.S. marks a major change for American agriculture itself. We expect to cover numerous aspects of this law in the coming days, but this article offers an overview of the major changes and what we can expect next from legal hemp in the United States. Hemp in all its forms — whether used as food, medicine, or textile — represents one of the first crops domesticated by humans. Then, the war on drugs brought about negative associations with psychoactive cannabis (“marijuana”) that spilled over onto hemp, marijuana’s close cousin. The result was decades of prohibition in the U.S., broken only for a brief period of hemp growing during World War II. In 2014, Pres. Barack Obama signed a previous version of the Farm Bill which partially legalized hemp under state-based research programs. In 2017, 19 states grew a total of 25,713 acres of hemp in the U.S. However, laws vary greatly even among hemp growing states. Most hemp is still imported, while a gray cloud of legal uncertainty hung over the industry due to ongoing policies tying hemp to federal drug prohibition. Until now, the Drug Enforcement Administration argued that industrial hemp is essentially identical to psychoactive cannabis, and therefore a “Schedule I substance” under the Controlled Substances Act. Schedule I substances face the strictest penalties for use and are considered to have no benefit to humanity, despite the numerous benefits of all forms of cannabis. The 2018 Farm Bill completely removes hemp and anything made from hemp from the Controlled Substances Act. “They have no right or authorization to ever be involved in this again,” Miller told us. Advocates hope this will improve numerous policies that hurt the industry. Some vendors, especially those selling CBD oil, face legal threats. Hemp businesses routinely struggle to access banking, advertising, and other services. Ari Sherman, president of Evo Hemp, a leading vendor of U.S.-grown hemp foods, expressed his frustration with the status quo. “We’re the only product in the grocery store that can’t be advertised,” said Sherman. Attitudes are already changing. Even before being signed into law, the 2018 Farm Bill inspired the Alabama state attorney general to back off from plans to prosecute CBD stores. Regulation of hemp will now fall under the USDA, which will set national policies for the crop. The Farm Bill does allow states to set more restrictive regulations, including banning hemp growing. It also protects the rights of Native American tribes to grow, or not grow, hemp on their lands. However, neither tribes nor states can interfere with interstate commerce surrounding hemp. “People have been afraid that if they ship [hemp] from Colorado to Washington, what are they going to do in Idaho?” Miller said. Under the new law, “Idaho will still have to let it come through.” The definition of industrial hemp will remain unchanged from the 2014 Farm Bill. Only cannabis with less than 0.3 percent THC will qualify as legal industrial hemp. THC, the main cannabinoidin psychoactive cannabis which makes people “feel high,” occurs in all forms of the plant but in very low levels in industrial hemp. Under current regulations, farmers must destroy destroy the entire harvest if their hemp tests at 0.4 percent or higher. “As a Kentucky hemp farmer and processor, it is very important to me this law has passed; Kentucky farmers, and farmers across the entire U.S. will now have the ability to grow this versatile crop.” said Brian Furnish, Director of Farming & Global Production at Ananda Hemp in Cynthiana, Kentucky, Sen. McConnell’s home state. Though the Farm Bill is now law, legalizing hemp won’t happen overnight. Until the Department of Agriculture finalizes its hemp policies, the rules of the 2014 Farm Bill will continue to officially apply. “We hope [the USDA] look to the guidance of well-developed pilot programs, in particular Oregon and also Colorado and Kentucky,” Moran said. “Look to their guidance and [don’t] make it overly restrictive as the goal is to really open up access to farmers throughout the United States.” The most controversial part of the hemp legalization amendment to the Farm Bill was a clause which banned people with felony drug convictions from participating in the industry. The legal hemp amendment originally passed by the Senate banned anyone with a felony drug conviction from participating in the hemp industry. People like Veronica Carpio, who has been a Colorado hemp grower since 2014 but also has a past psychoactive cannabis conviction, could have been forced out of an industry they helped to create. Ministry of Hemp was one of the first media outlets to report on this hemp felony ban. Carpio told us that attention from reporters, and subsequent pressure from parts of the hemp industry, resulted in an important change to the new law. Moran told us Sen. Ron Wyden was a strong advocate for a compromise. But the felony ban remains in a modified form. “I think it’s tragically unfair,” Carpio told us. “I’m fairly devastated over it actually.” Under the compromise, now incorporated into the final law, the felony ban exempts anyone already growing under a 2014 Farm Bill-compliant state hemp program. Additionally, anyone whose conviction took place more than 10 years ago may grow hemp. Carpio is grateful that her business is not likely to face any interruption, but she still condemned what she sees as an unfair restriction on hemp, which makes it unlike any other crop. She’s also concerned that the ban will disproportionately affect black people, and other marginalized groups, who tend to be arrested for drug crimes more often. “Why should I, and others that were under the 2014 Farm Bill, why are we getting exceptions?” she asked. “I know I should be happier about [the compromise] but I’m not, it should have been removed completely.” In addition, she suggested this clause and others in the bill could create unnecessary government surveillance and monitoring of hemp growers. The most popular application for hemp in the U.S. is CBD oil. CBD, or cannabidiol, has numerous benefits from easing symptoms of stress to reducing epileptic seizures. U.S. sales of CBD products reached $190 million in 2017. At the same time, the market is currently completely unregulated, making it challenging for consumers to separate quality CBD products from snake oil. Hemp supporters argued that CBD products were protected by the 2014 Farm Bill and other legal precedents, but the DEA often disagreed. Though 2018 Farm Bill explicitly removes any product made from legal hemp from DEA oversight, the FDA regulates anything intended for human consumption. That includes CBD oil. Moran noted that under the Farm Bill, “the FDA still has the complete authority that they do under the Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act.” So far, the FDA has limited itself to targeting CBD vendors that make illegal health claims about their products. The FDA classifies everyday CBD products as nutritional supplements and bans vendors from claiming hemp extract treats any health conditions. “The next step for the hemp CBD industry is that we need to self regulate CBD products to ensure they are safe, well tested, and properly labeled,” said Joseph Dowling, CEO of CV Sciences, maker of PlusCBD Oil, in a statement sent by email. Many industry experts believe the FDA will face pressure to develop regulations around CBD products with the passage of the Farm Bill. Another factor is the recent approval of Epidiolex, a prescription epilepsy drug made from CBD derived from psychoactive cannabis. The approval of Epidiolex marks the first time the FDA officially recognized the medical value of cannabis. Still, some worry that it could lead to a crackdown on access to over-the-counter CBD supplements. This is a complex and developing aspect of the 2018 Farm Bill and hemp legalization that we intend to cover in more depth in the future. Until then, CBD consumers should rest assured that their favorite supplement is likely to remain available. With CBD generating millions in profits and benefitting thousands of consumers, the FDA faces immense financial and popular pressure to keep this supplement available. “The wind is at our back,” Miller said. “The public loves hemp-derived CBD so it’s only a matter of time.” While CBD helps people feel better, and hemp can generate immense profits for both farmers and hemp companies, the benefits of legal hemp go deeper. Hemp can heal the soil, requires almost no pesticides and only moderate watering compared to other crops. Hemp fabric is a more sustainable alternative to cotton, and the woody core of industrial hemp plants can be made into hempcrete, a sustainable building material with numerous remarkable qualities. While Miller cautioned that hemp is “no panacea,” he noted that Europe is already making increasing use of hemp plastic. “It’s biodegradeable and renewable,” he said. “Just imagine if that can be replicated on a mass scale what that could mean for the environment.” Moran agreed: “[The environment] is the most important aspect of all of this. … The reason I have been an advocate for the past 10 years and why I have focused my entire education and career on industrial hemp legalization is because this plant can do amazing things for the earth, for the soil.” Sherman suggested this could be a moment with international significance. Evo Hemp’s attempts to encourage hemp farming in foreign countries often faced resistance from officials afraid of U.S. government retaliation. That could be on the verge of changing. “All of these countries around the world are going to open up their hemp policies,” he predicted."
Medium.com,Life,"MMJ — Lets step back a minute, how did we get here?",Cannabis,https://medium.com/@jeffreyhill2/mmj-lets-step-back-a-minute-how-did-we-get-here-2d9a509c6a71?source=topic_page---------271------------------1," I have recently had a lot of very smart folks challenge the progress of Cannabis (MMJ) and CBD. With several questions like: 1) isn’t it still a “gateway drug”? 2) Isn’t it just about the government looking for more revenue sources? 3) What do they mean when they say MMJ laws disproportionately impact minorities; 4) Will there continue to be a black market once MMJ is legalized. For additional detail please read my previous white papers on this site. This piece attempts to provide perspective on these issues. 1) The Gateway issue — MMJ has been considered a “gateway drug” for years, with no rationale for that POV except everyone that does hard drugs started on MMJ. For years MMJ and Hemp, until last Thursday’s Farm Bill signing by the president, have been lumped together as a “class 1” drug violation at the federal level. Class 1 means NO MEDICINAL VALUE. (It includes Heroin, LSD, Opiates, MMJ etc). Does that make sense? Lets look at some facts: a) it is now medicinally legal in 33 states; b) it has shown quantitative improvements in health outcomes for Epileptics (Epidiolex has been approved by the FDA); Autism; Anxiety; Inflammation/Arthritis (both Rheumatoid, and Osteo) and I could go on. Israel’s studies on the impact of certain strains on Cancer is totally breakthrough and is being studied throughout SE Asia, and Canada, and many universities all over the world including the US. The 2014 Farm Bill allowed our Universities to do extensive studies on the medicinal value of MMJ and CBD and the positive results are fully documented. 2) The need for money at the state level is often the final reason for a yes vote - Many political folks don’t understand the medicinal value, but they do understand the tax impact. They are watching the $1.3 Billion in incremental tax revenue in the 4 largest recreational MMJ states, and want “their fair share”. 3) Impact on the Penile System — Since it is a class 1 federal violation, MMJ possession is a felony. New York, where I live, is a 3 strike state, you can currently be in prison for the rest of your life from MMJ possession and sale. At a cost of $80,000/ year for a single prisoner in a penitentiary, that’s a lot of lives destroyed and a lot of money spent to lock these folks up for something that is medicinally legal in 33 states and recreationally legal in 11. 4) Racial issue — The governor of NY, Andrew Cuomo, refers to it as a biased racial issue. While I don’t want to get into the race issue, people in jail for MMJ possession are disproportionately of color. Think of this. In recreational states, a visitor of a family member in jail for a multiple year sentence for MMJ possession is likely to go past restaurants, bars, dispensaries and pubs all selling CBD/THC yet their son, daughter, friend is in jail for years for what is no longer considered an illegal offense. So do those families think the system is fair. Why wouldn’t the states rethink the prison sentences for MMJ only violators. It’s no longer illegal in those states. But if the inmate sent MMJ in the mail, or took it across a state line, they are in Federal Violation, which carries a felony sentence. Is that fair?? 5) Cost vs black market — Many people use a THC delivery service to get their MMJ direct to home/apartments. These are often bespoke delivery services, who come to your home with curated product in multiple formats like oil, flower, and edibles. Not only is the product of high quality from a knowledgeable “sales person”, but the product is 30% less than at a dispensary. What’s more, In NYC and many other cities, there is an entire underground business of fully curated multi course MMJ dinners done by brilliant chefs with a price point of as much as $200/head and more. Governor Cuomo decriminalized MMJ in NY, so there are no more prison sentences, going forward, for possession of small quantities. Legal access (currently through a dispensary) is heavily taxed and the supply/demand equation works to the advantage of the dispensary. The result: very high prices and often the knowledge level is quite low from the so called pharmacists or “Bud-tenders” as dispensary sales people are often called. (eg Medmen on 5th ave and 37th, one of 6 dispensaries in NYC proper). To be fair, in mature states like Colorado, Washington, California, Oregon, etc. dispensary personnel are very knowledgeable but that is not the case everywhere. Net, MMJ and CBD are: 1) proven to provide quantitative improvements in health outcomes of patients suffering from very troubling disease states; and 2) capable of generating a lot of tax income at the state level. So why is MMJ still federally illegal? Answer: Politics, ignorance, and lobbying. Change is difficult to effect, especially when the stakes are so high. Hope this helps"
Medium.com,Life,Conservative Alaska is leading the nation in progressive Marijuana laws.,Cannabis,https://blog.usejournal.com/conservative-alaska-is-leading-the-nation-in-progressive-marijuana-laws-7c50df446387?source=topic_page---------272------------------1," Four years ago Alaska became the third American state to vote in favor of legalizing recreational marijuana. I worked in Alaskan politics at the time and can tell you that a Yes vote was not guaranteed. I confess to pessimism at the time, I didn’t expect it to pass, and I found the subsequent discussions in the legislature (about how best to regulate marijuana pursuant to the will of the voters) asinine, embarrassing, and unlikely to produce a viable industry that could compete with the black market. I was wrong and for the last three years Alaska has led the nation in a culturally, politically, and economically rational approach to legal weed. State workers who would like to partake face no consequences for what they do off the job, just like with alcohol-leave it at home. TSA officials in at least one Alaskan airport allow travelers to board with up to an ounce of weed and Alaskan marijuana businesses can coordinate with law enforcement and transportation officials to fly pounds of bud for sale or testing in other parts of the state. Since voter approval in 2014, Alaska’s industry has grown quickly, and is on track to total over $200 million dollars this year as prices are dropping and sales continue to grow. Alaska has hosted the Cannabis Classic twice and the cannabis culture and industry in the state is gaining national prominence. 2018 has been another historic year for the marijuana industry in the Last Frontier. Alaska has taken two radical steps in it’s approach to cannabis, the people who use it, and the businesses that offer it. One is nigh unprecedented anywhere in the country. The other is also groundbreaking for the state and arguably the more important for the future of the $55 billion industry around the country, with implications for other countries with legal pot, like Canada, where US banking and customs rules can effect marijuana industry practices in those countries. As of right now, because financial institutions generally refuse to deal with cannabis operations, you cannot use a credit card or debit card to buy legal weed in a legally operated dispensary anywhere in the country. Legal cannabis business owners, while technically not prohibited from getting credit or opening account with any financial institutions, have found it very difficult to do so. Banks, credit unions, and credit card companies are understandably reluctant to accept money from any business that breaks federal law, which all marijuana dispensaries, growers, and distributors are technically doing. This is but one of the many obstacles the industry faces. Slowly however, perhaps buoyed by the federal government’s lack of interest in prosecuting the thousands of cannabis businesses operating in 33 states, over 400 financial institutions have been openly accepting accounts with marijuana-related businesses, according to a report from the Treasury Department’s Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN). Credit Union One, an Alaskan credit union headquartered in Anchorage serving the whole state, in November announced the creation of a pilot program to provide financial services at Alaskan marijuana businesses. CEO and president of the credit union, James Wileman said that “We will begin offering banking services to the under-served marijuana related businesses that operate in our great state.” Wileman correctly pointed out that the absence of financial services for these businesses “has flooded our streets with cash resulting in a community safety issue.” Almost all cannabis businesses across the country are cash only enterprises, I’m sure the safety implications for the businesses and their employers is obvious, theft and armed robbery is a constant fear. Alaska’s State Division of Banking and Securities has so far said nothing about Credit Union One’s plans and it seems the 49th State is on track to put another hole in the dam of marijuana prohibition. While not as big a dam-buster as the opening of financial services for cannabis, Alaska just last week may have made a monumental step forward in the normalization of marijuana and those who use it. On December 20th, Alaska’s Marijuana Control Board approved regulations allowing public consumption of marijuana in approved retailers. There are more steps to be taken before Alaskans or tourists in Alaska can walk into a weed dispensary and light a joint, like in an Amsterdam coffeeshop, but should the regulations pass legal review, and Lt. Governor Kevin Meyer ends up signing off, Alaska will be the first step with statewide rules permitting businesses to offer pot-smoking on premises. In 2016 Denver, Colorado, passed a law permitting on-site use in licensed businesses but the city applied such a host of byzantine and cumbersome regulations that in two years only one such facility exists in the whole city. Alaska is heavy on allowing local control over marijuana policies so the potential for at least one city or municipality to duplicate Denver’s regulatory failure is there but the state has a history of doing things their own way and regulators seem earnestly set on honoring the intent of the voters in 2014. Alaska voted for Trump, every member of their congressional delegation is a Republican, they just denied their Independent governor a second term in favor of a very conservative Republican, and the state legislature has been more red than blue for most of the last thirty years including this one. But Alaska does things different than the Lower-48, marijuana reformers and industry-representatives, lawmakers, and regulators around the country should take note."

Medium.com,Life,Cannabis: A Psychedelic Medicine?,Cannabis,https://medium.com/@leo_raderman/cannabis-a-psychedelic-medicine-c72de93ede05?source=topic_page---------274------------------1," Published in Common Ground Magazine (December 2018/January 2019) By Leo Raderman Michael Pollan’s How to Change Your Mind: What the New Science of Psychedelics Teaches Us About Consciousness, Dying, Addiction, Depression, and Transcendence marks a watershed moment for so-called psychedelic medicine. As the book shot to #4 on the New York Times nonfiction list, the best-selling author’s treatise on psychedelics stoked an emerging cultural conversation about these substances to a level not seen since the 1960s. With a flash that began with his NYT Opinion piece, “My Adventures with the Trip Doctors,” Pollan has shed light onto a nascent psychedelic renaissance that encompasses intentions, understandings, and practices so widely varied as to include bureaucrats in Silver Spring, Maryland (home to the Federal Drug Administration), and shamanic elders in the Amazonian jungle alike. The question now being explored is Can currently illegal psychoactive agents such as MDMA, psilocybin, ibogaine, LSD, ayahuasca, and 5-MEO-DMT be used to facilitate psycho-spiritual healing, especially where traditional pharmaceuticals have failed? The search for answers may demand an uncommon convergence of tradition and science, subjective experience and objective data, patient-initiated self-healing and doctor-prescribed treatments. Most participants in this renaissance — individuals choosing of their own accord to seek healing through psychedelics — approach them from the vantage point of tradition. More specifically, they experience psychedelics within the tradition of shamanism, which understands them to be sacred medicine, activating spirits and energies within and without. For example, there is a trend of discreet ayahuasca ceremonies taking place weekly around the San Francisco Bay Area and other major cities. At such ceremonies, would be “psychonauts” step into a cultural framework and belief system that holds that certain plants, when ingested, imbue their particular intelligence and healing potency. The skilled shaman, working within a ceremonial context — often with specific forms of music and sound — assists the plant’s intelligence with his or her own knowing, while calling upon the guidance of other varied spirits, be they human (ancestral), animal, or plant. Kathleen Harrison, a sacramental medicine elder, writes in Cannabis and Spirituality: An Explorer’s Guide to an Ancient Plant Spirit Ally, “Western culture has rediscovered shamanism as a model, and the concept of plants as a kind of conscious ‘people’ has been revived. Some refer to the soul of the plant, and others to the persona or personality that the species seems to present. This has especially been adopted, or experienced, in the case of powerful psychedelic species.” It would be more precise to say that a still relatively small slice of Western culture has rediscovered shamanism. From the perspective of mainstream medicine, those participating in the shamanic use of psychedelic medicine indulge in varied kinds of risk, notably, the possibility of having difficult psychological experiences, as well as the risks associated with skirting U.S. laws. Pollan faced these risks head on in his journalistic and personal exploration, beginning his journey as something of a fearful skeptic and emerging as, if not quite a hopeful evangelist, then at least as a vocal advocate for further study. If psychedelic medicine is to become mainstream, it must be made legal. And if it is to be made legal, it must be proven not only effective but also reliable. This is where the cultural convergence begins. While indigenous shamanic tradition holds vast experience with sacred plant medicines, it is the gathering of data by science that holds the key to widespread adoption. We rely on science to answer critical questions such as How do psychedelics work on our biological systems? What do they do to our brain chemistry? Do they consistently provide relief from particular kinds of mental anguish? And most importantly, Are they safe? In the last decade, researchers at major universities across the world have stepped up the inquiry into these questions, utilizing imaging technologies like MRI to discern the effect of psychedelics on brain activity, and exploring the use of various psychedelics as treatment for depression, anxiety, addiction, and more. The Santa Cruz-based nonprofit MAPS (the Multidisciplinary Association for Psychedelic Studies) successfully has been leading the charge to gain FDA approval of MDMA for the treatment of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). Similarly, the privately owned British company Compass Pathways is pursuing the use of psilocybin to treat depression. If these organizations succeed, we could see doctors prescribing these substances to select patient populations within the next few years. As legal research on psychedelics and efforts toward their legalization move forward, an important question goes not only unanswered, but for the most part unasked: Can cannabis, the most prevalent and by far most popular form of plant medicine (already legal for medical use in 32 states and fully decriminalized in 11) be considered a psychedelic? During a recent Harvard Medical School panel called “Psychedelic Medicine: From Tradition to Science,” Rick Doblin, the Founder and Executive director of MAPS, answered with an unequivocal yes, saying, “I believe cannabis is a psychedelic.” Doblin is not alone in his understanding that cannabis has “mind-manifesting” properties similar to, if not as extreme as, other plants carrying the psychedelic moniker. It has a long history of use as a sacred medicine in other cultures. Chris Bennett, a cannabis scholar, writes in Cannabis and Spirituality that the “Chinese pharmacopeia RhYa, compiled in the fifteenth century BCE, contains the earliest reference to cannabis for shamanistic purposes.” Bennet goes on to detail references to the spiritual use of cannabis during the formative eras of Taoism, Hinduism, and Tantric Buddhism. To this day, he notes, “It is in current religious use among indigenous peoples in the Americas, including the Tepecanos of Northwestern Mexico, who call it Rosa Maria and occasionally use it as a substitute for peyote in their religious rituals.” In the United States cannabis has a long history of (illegal) recreational use. Recently it has been recognized as having potential medicinal value in the treatment of specific conditions ranging from chronic pain to anxiety disorders. A third approach remains largely unexplored, as, in the United States today, the spiritual, shamanistic use of cannabis has been all but lost. We now have an opportunity to re-sacralize cannabis, to partake of it as sacred medicine, as a psychedelic medicine. The eminent psychiatrist Stanislav Grof, an early pioneer in psychedelic research and a founder of Transpersonal Psychology, coined the term “holotropic” to reference a subset of experiences in expanded states of consciousness. In holotropic states, Grof observes, an “inner healing intelligence” emerges that guides us “toward wholeness.” With regard to using psychedelic medicine to elicit holotropic states, Grof strongly emphasizes the importance of 1) prior-to-experience preparation, 2) the process of the experience itself, and 3) the post-experience integration conducted afterward. Taken in the context of cannabis, one can smoke a joint to help offset the monotony of a routine task, enhance the thrill of playing video games, or add to the exuberance of live music at a concert. Such uses are unlikely to engender holotropic experiences, but smoking the same joint with a healing intention, within a well-held ceremonial space, very well might. Grof’s counsel on the importance of preparation, process, and integration should not be underestimated — they promote beneficial experience, while helping to abate the potential of the kinds of psychologically trying incidents that some people report when using cannabis. Cannabis as psychedelic medicine, like all plant medicines, is both most powerful and safest when used with an experienced guide holding space Sound healing is an increasingly popular modality of deep listening and delivery of vibrationally appropriate music and sound. When buttressed with the holotropic practices designed by Grof to keep safe people entering expanded states of consciousness, it offers an opportunity to explore cannabis in a contemporary ceremonial space. In my personal experience with ceremonies combining the elements of community, intentionally crafted music and sound, and cannabis, participants frequently report deep healing experiences. Those who facilitate the use of cannabis within a ceremonial, shamanistic, or neo-shamanistic framework are contributing to a cohering narrative begun by indigenous cultures, which paints a picture of the soul of the plant. They understand that cannabis has the potential to help people process, clear heavy or negative or pressing energy, and experience a deeper sense of connection to themselves, others, and, in many cases, Spirit itself. They know cannabis is capable of acting as potent medicine for healing and transformation. And, of course, they counsel prudence as regards frequency and dosage — too much of either generally not being a good thing. Given that the plant now can often be found legally in many of the United States (federal law notwithstanding), the re-sacralization of cannabis represents an important opportunity worthy of deeper investigation as we move further into an expanding psychedelic renaissance, pursuing effective, safe, and accessible psychedelic medicine."
Medium.com,Life,5 Reasons Marijuana Stocks Could Lose You Money in 2019,Cannabis,https://medium.com/the-motley-fool/5-reasons-marijuana-stocks-could-lose-you-money-in-2019-f72345c94175?source=topic_page---------275------------------1," This has been a year to remember for the cannabis industry. In October, Canada became the first industrialized country in the world to legalize recreational marijuana, paving the way for billions of dollars in added annual sales once the industry is fully up to speed. This legalization brings legitimacy to the table and should, over the long run, attract big investment dollars and partnerships. We also witnessed plenty of success in the United States, with residents in two additional states voting to legalize medical pot in November. In total, 32 states have given the green light to medical marijuana in the U.S., along with 10 that allow adult-use weed. And yet despite this success, marijuana stocks themselves have had a miserable year. The very first publicly traded pot ETF, the Horizons Marijuana Life Sciences ETF, has lost around a third of its value since the year began. Worse yet, things may not improve much in 2019. Here are five reasons pot stocks could deliver another subpar performance in 2019. For starters, operating results actually matter now that cannabis is legal in Canada, and that’s not necessarily a good thing for an industry that’s thrived on promises to expand capacity, grow product portfolios, and forge partnerships. With the need to actually deliver on the bottom line, many pot stocks will likely disappoint Wall Street and investors. For example, Canopy Growth (NYSE:CGC) is widely viewed as the premier cannabis name on Wall Street. It’ll likely slot in as the second-largest grower by peak annual yield at 500,000 kilograms, boasts a major investment partner in Constellation Brands (NYSE:STZ), has what’s arguably the most recognized brand throughout all of Canada (Tweed), and has a bounty of sales channels at its disposal. And yet it’s probably going to lose money hand over fist in fiscal 2019. That’s because Canopy Growth is in the process of completing its capacity expansion, marketing its brands, extending its reach to new markets, and making acquisitions. Even with rapid sales growth, Canopy is liable to lose a lot of money on an operating basis in the near term. In Canopy Growth’s most recent quarter, it recorded a whopping operating loss of 214.6 million Canadian dollars, which ballooned even further to more than CA$330 million once one-time benefits and costs were included. Fiscal year-to-date losses are now up to CA$421.6 million. While investors were previously able to turn a blind eye to such poor operating performances, that’s not going to be an option in 2019. Sure, marijuana stocks are increasing their production capacity at a very rapid pace, but there’s no guarantee that they’ll be able to plant their crops or sell their harvest anytime soon. That’s because of the red tape surrounding the cultivation license and sales permit process with Health Canada. According to an analysis from Marijuana Business Daily back in May, Health Canada had received well over 500 cultivation license applications that it had to review and either approve or deny. These take months or even years to review. Then, assuming a grower receives the green light to plant cannabis, they may have to wait a while for the sales permit. On average, it was taking 341 days for sales permits to be approved back in May, with the fastest on record still taking about four months from permit filing to approval. Following the official legalization date of Oct. 17, it took just hours in some provinces for product to run out. At the moment, more than half of all provinces and territories in Canada are contending with some degree of cannabis shortage, and it looks unlikely to abate anytime soon. That means sale and profit estimates for pot stocks are probably too high, which’ll lead to disappointment next year. You may not want to talk about it, but the black market is going to make its presence known in 2019. If cannabis shortages do persist, as is the expectation at this point, it wouldn’t be a surprise to see consumers turning to the black market to fill the void, so to speak. Not only does Health Canada’s red tape create an opening for a black market that was otherwise on its heels leading up to legalization in October, but it further emphasizes the cost advantages that illicit pot growers can bring to the table. Namely, black-market operators don’t have to pay the 10% excise tax, they won’t owe any federal income tax to the Canadian government, and they don’t have to wait for approval from Health Canada to grow or sell their cannabis. The black market can consistently undercut legal sales channels on price, which means it’s not going anywhere. And if illicit growers are here to stay, it means, once again, that sale and profit estimates for marijuana stocks are probably too high. Fourth, even though we’ve witnessed a handful of brand-name equity investments and deals in 2018, don’t count on there being a rush to partner with cannabis companies in 2019. The deal you’re probably most familiar with is Corona and Modelo beer maker Constellation taking a 37% equity stake in Canopy Growth for $4 billion. More than just angling to develop infused beverages, Constellation’s massive equity stake in Canopy signals its expectation that legal weed will be a long-term, high-growth industry. But not all brand-name beverage, tobacco, and pharmaceutical companies are sold on the weed industry. In September, multiple news outlets reported that Coca-Cola (NYSE:KO) was in discussion with Aurora Cannabis (NYSE:ACB) to either make an equity investment in the company or create a partnership that would seek to develop new products, presumably including cannabis-infused beverages. There were plenty of reasons a tie-up between Coca-Cola and Aurora Cannabis would have made sense, such as Aurora’s market-leading peak production potential and Coca-Cola’s deep pockets and marketing expertise. Ultimately, however, Coca-Cola chose not to invest or partner with Aurora, or with anyone for that matter. Instead, its management team is simply watching from the sidelines. This is a view that many brand-name companies could take as the pot industry attempts to find its footing in the early going. Last but certainly not least is our old nemesis: share-based dilution. As a refresher, access to nondilutive forms of financing has been very limited for pot stocks, even in the postlegalization environment. Banks have simply not wanted to take on the risks of facing financial and/or criminal penalties by offering loans or lines of credit to marijuana companies. This has resulted in pot stocks turning to bought-deal offerings for capital. A bought-deal offering involves the sale of common stock, convertible debentures, stock options, and/or warrants in order to raise capital. The sale of common stock, or using common stock to finance an acquisition, leads to an immediate uptick in a company’s outstanding share count. Meanwhile, convertible notes, options, and warrants can lead to a steady increase over many years. This has the effect of diluting the value of existing shareholders as well as weighing on earnings per share, since there are more shares to divide net income into. Aurora Cannabis, arguably the biggest diluter of all, could see its share count eclipse 1 billion when it next reports its quarterly results. For context, it had just 16 million shares outstanding less than five years ago. In sum, things aren’t as green as you might expect for the marijuana industry heading into the new year."
Medium.com,Life,The U.S. Federal Government: The Biggest Opioid Cartel In the World,Cannabis,https://medium.com/@jackson.lowry.films/the-u-s-federal-government-the-biggest-opioid-cartel-in-the-world-33c07d9feedc?source=topic_page---------276------------------1," According to the National Institute on Drug Abuse every day 115 people in the United States will overdose on opioids. While this does include illegal substances such as heroin, of that 115 people three quarters of them died from the use of legal prescription opioid pain relievers. In 2015 2 million Americans suffered from substance use disorders related to prescription opioid, many of which simply because they were given the medication for their post surgery or other conditions. According to Dr. Elliot Krane, a professor of anesthesiology and a pain management specialist at Stanford University, “More than two-thirds of emergency department visits and hospital admissions linked to opioid use were caused by therapeutic use of the prescriptions, rather than abuse.” These are not people with criminal records or history of drug use, just people given an addictive and often deadly substance for their pain. Meanwhile all the pharmaceutical companies that manufacture these drugs continue to make billions and their “medication”, as the federal government defines it, continues to flow into every corner of the country with the express consent of the government. As it turns out the difference between what is a “medicine” and what is an “illicit drug” mostly comes down to government interpretation, not actual science. If you crush up Oxycontin, a legal substance regularly prescribed to people across the age spectrum, and inhale it, it has almost the exact same effect as powder cocaine yet children, adults and the elderly have it regularly prescribed in massive doses for things as simple as tooth aches. To make sure your substance is listed as a “medicine” and that you can sell your drug of choice on the federal cartel’s turf you have to make sure that the cartel bosses are getting their cut. According to the New York Times over the course of the last ten years pharmaceutical companies have spent $2.3 billion, yes billion with a B, on lobbying congress. Last year alone they spent $240 million lobbying senators and congress members. According to The Guardian as of October 19th, 2017 “ Nine out of 10 members of the House of Representatives and all but three of the US’s 100 senators have taken campaign contributions from pharmaceutical companies seeking to affect legislation on everything from the cost of drugs to how new medicines are approved.” The federal government’s endless bloated agencies and bureaucracy have claimed to have tested these substances and they are 100% safe for public use, heck, in most states your dentist can give your children a weeks worth of full strength Vicodin and send them home where hopefully those legal substances will be used properly and no one other then the patient will use them. In the federal governments book this is totally okay. Contrast that with how the federal government has treated substances like THC, the active element in Marijuana. Marijuana is classified as a Schedule 1 drug by the DEA, defined as having no accepted medical use and a high potential for abuse. Marijuana shares this spot with other substances such as LSD and heroin. As Dr. Thomas Strouse, medical director of the Stewart and Lynda Resnich Neuropsychiatric Hospital at the University of California explains “Although marijuana can cause heath problems if used in excess, there are no known cases of somebody dying from marijuana overdoes. The same cannot be said for opioids.” Addressing the DEA’s claim that marijuana has no medical uses and is highly addictive compared to opioid drugs like Vicodin, DR. Peter Grinspoon MD, a contributing editor for the Harvard Medical school wrote; “It (Marijuana) is quite effective for the chronic pain that plagues millions of Americans, especially as they age. Part of its allure is that it is clearly safer than opiates (it is impossible to overdose on and far less addictive) and it can take the place of NSAIDs such as Advil or Aleve, if people can’t take them due to problems with their kidneys or ulcers or GERD. In particular, marijuana appears to ease the pain of multiple sclerosis, and nerve pain in general. This is an area where few other options exist, and those that do, such as Neurontin, Lyrica, or opiates are highly sedating. Patients claim that marijuana allows them to resume their previous activities without feeling completely out of it and disengaged.” So what is one step down from Marijuana? Schedule 2 drugs, which include crystal methamphetamine and cocaine (Both opioid base drugs), which have, according to the DEA, been accepted as medical treatments in the United States. If you legally buy some weed in a state like Colorado to help deal with chronic pain and cross state lines you could be looking at thousands of dollars in fines and even several years in federal prison. On the other hand you can make and distribute a pill that contains the same base ingredients is cocaine and crystal meth and that’s totally acceptable, not just acceptable but encouraged. This is not to say that there are not legitimate uses for opioids in small doses as a medical tool or that there are no health risks associated with marijuana, to do so would be equally as short sighted position as those held by the politicians legislating on the topic. Opioids are not the devil and marijuana is no magic cure all. This articles goal is to highlight the absolute hypocrisy of the federal cartel who will fast track and legalize any drug pushed by it’s wealth donors but will stifle the legal cultivation of safer alternatives at the behest of those same donors. It doesn't matter what the substance is it should be used with caution in the healthiest possible way but pretending like the federal governments polices are based on real science and data is just simply untrue."

Medium.com,Life,A Plea for Cannabis in Hospitals,Cannabis,https://healthcareinamerica.us/a-plea-for-cannabis-in-hospitals-4497c1048a5a?source=topic_page---------281------------------1," Recreational cannabis is officially legal in the state of California. This milestone makes California the world’s largest legal cannabis market, allowing anyone over the age of twenty-one years to purchase cannabis in select retail shops. Valued at $7 billion, the California cannabis market is buzzing with new brands and products that are normalizing use and inspiring more people to try cannabis for the first time. As a longtime cannabis user and advocate, I am thrilled that we have finally made progress diminishing the plant’s social stigma and promoting the healing benefits of the plant. However, we are now faced with a dangerous disconnect between recreational and medicinal cannabis that threatens the future of both cannabis and human health. Our fight for cannabis as medicine has only just begun. Just because anyone in California can legally buy cannabis does not mean it is available to the people that need it most. Two weeks ago, I spent the night in the Intensive Care Unit at Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center in New York City watching my partner’s father die of colon cancer. After two years of failed chemotherapy and radiation, this prominent New York City lawyer weighed 130 pounds and could no longer talk nor move. He was admitted to the hospital for the twentieth time, confined to his hospital bed for days until doctors released him. Though this patient had a medical recommendation for cannabis use in New York and vaporized THC and CBD daily to manage his pain, he could not use his medicine while he was stuck in the hospital. Instead, he was administered Fentanyl. What if medical cannabis patients want to use cannabis instead of opioids? Impossible. The rotating nurses on call in the Intensive Care Unit told me that cannabis use is forbidden at Sloan Kettering, the top ranked cancer hospital in the nation. Even in states with established medical cannabis programs, medical cannabis patients are prohibited from using cannabis in the hospital setting. I believe this policy is outdated, flawed and unjust. By not allowing a cancer patient, or any patient, to use cannabis in the hospital, we are denying the patient’s right to self-medicate and truly heal. This is especially unfair for the multitude of patients who have already experienced relief through regular cannabis use. Medical cannabis recommendations are granted for people with cancer because cannabis eases the side effects of chemo and radiation, with some studies suggesting cannabinoids can make standard treatments more effective. Many of the patients admitted to the hospital are preparing for surgery, recovering from surgery, or experiencing a wide range of complications from treatment. Other patients, like the man I was visiting, are pumped of morphine to ease excruciating pain after standard treatment fails and only hospice remains. Imagine you have cancer and cannabis is the only thing that eliminates the grueling nausea, vomiting, fatigue and pain caused by chemotherapy and radiation, but when you are admitted to the hospital for a common chemo-related complication like an infection or blockage, you are unable to use cannabis for days or sometimes weeks. This is the reality for thousands of cancer patients right now. Prohibiting cannabis use in the hospital undermines the medical cannabis program in total. It encourages the continued use of dangerous and addictive pharmaceuticals instead of plant medicine. On an emotional level, this policy disempowers patients, robbing them of the opportunity to manage their illness on their own terms. The first step to unlocking the power of cannabis as medicine is legitimizing cannabis use in hospitals so patients can safely use non-smoking products as needed. Thankfully, this is not a new idea. At Mayo Clinic’s hospitals in Rochester, Minnesota, medical cannabis use is permitted among patients registered with the state’s program who come in with a non-smoking product. To date, over 3,700 patients are enrolled in the program. The Minnesota Hospital Association has created a set of policy templates for other hospitals to use as they work to adopt similar cannabis use programs. We have a long way to go. Through my research, I found one report of a dying cancer patient kicked out of USCF Hospital after she attempted to use cannabis inside. I also found a plea from the past: a 2002 op-ed in the New York Times by a New York State Judge with Stage 3 pancreatic cancer begging for medical cannabis in the hospital. He writes: “This is not a law-and-order issue; it is a medical and a human rights issue. Being treated at Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, I am receiving the absolute gold standard of medical care. But doctors cannot be expected to do what the law prohibits, even when they know it is in the best interests of their patients. When palliative care is understood as a fundamental human and medical right, marijuana for medical use should be beyond controversy.” As more states work to legalize medical and recreational cannabis, we must prioritize access for sick patients before serving the recreational users looking for a “high.” California, I challenge you to use your market leadership to set a new standard for health. Let’s work together to develop a hospital use program that supports the future of cannabis as medicine for all."

Even during the psychedelic ’70s in Madison, Wisconsin, my poison of choice was bourbon. Or beer on Badger game days. While many of my friends were stoners, I stayed firmly in the Tequila Sunrise/Singapore Sling camp, sorority girl that I was. It took me a full 38 years to bloom into the cannabis evangelist I am today. It started with a freelance assignment. My editor suggested I check out a hot new San Francisco start-up called Meadow. Fresh out of legendary incubator Y Combinator, Meadow offered a more convenient way to get a medical-marijuana card. Click, click and a qualified physician would come to you, conduct an exam and voilà — you’d be the mellow recipient of the city’s primo legal weed. Ho-hum. In my skeptical perspective, possessing a cannabis card was similar to having a fake “therapy dog” license for your canine — a bit scammy, but no real downside to it. I viewed the gig as merely another quirky writing project, like the interviews I’d had with a Christmas-tree farmer, a hot-shot floral diva and Macy’s window dressers earlier that year. Meeting a weed doctor ranked below tepid on my journalist curiosity scale. Then I met Dr. Dan Price. After 14 years at Oakland’s Highland Trauma Center the board-certified emergency physician was quickly morphing into San Francisco’s guru of grass thanks to his knowledge, expertise and people skills. By teaming up with Meadow and highly respected cofounder David Hua, the good doctor helps patients find alternative wellness solutions to Big Pharma. He zipped up — on a skateboard — to the co-working space where we’d decided to meet. Once we were inside, the cannabis exam itself was fairly straightforward and completely noninvasive. And it didn’t take long for my assumptions to crumble: as Dr. Price detailed the new ways cannabis could help my medical conditions (insomnia in particular), it started to click that today’s herb was not the Maui Wowie of my youth. Cannabis 2.0 was a radically different version of the one-size-fits-all weed that was our only option back in the day. The ancient plant was finally on the path to fulfilling its true place in our medical universe. And as herb historians know, cannabis has been a medicine way longer than it hasn’t been. I left the exam with a medical-marijuana recommendation letter plus an entirely new vocabulary. Indica? Sativa? Hybrid? Cannabinoids? I was in a brand-new world. Behind Door Number 3? If you live in the Bay Area, you’re deep in the domain of dispensaries. Wander around the city, and you can’t help but wonder what’s behind those mysterious doors. Many look pretty sketchy from the outside, like a dive bar that’s safe to visit only on game-day mornings, and then only if the Niners win. But once inside? Forget the grody head-shop stuff. An increasing number of dispensaries look more like an Apple store. They’re open, airy and sparklingly clean, a cross between a spa and a doctor’s office. Despite these trendy innovations, though, I was nervous on my first dispensary visit. Armed with my rec letter and Dr. Dan’s suggestions, I meandered into a place called Igzactly 420. I chose this spot because, wuss that I am, I figured I’d be less apt to encounter trouble in the Financial District. And if the cops showed up, I knew three coffee shops where I could hide and also snatch a great latte. This is where my head was then: stuck in Reefer Madness stereotypes. Was my initiation the “strange trip” my friends had predicted it would be? Of course it was, in the best possible way. In fact, this first visit kicked off a series of revelations that eventually overturned many of my misconceptions. Gawking at the glass jars and the glossy gear, it was like Christmas morning for new cannabis lovers. Even better, the staff didn’t treat me like I’d walked in with Cannabis for Dummies under my armpit. I’d gotten so used to the tech industry’s ageism — the assumption that if you’re over 40, you’ve got to be clueless — that it was a pleasure to discover its absence in this new industry. Ditto for the lady thing. This is an industry that values women. This Silicon Valley–defying fact has held true as I’ve explored the new world of weed. As Ben Larsen, cofounder of Oakland’s Gateway Incubator, told me, “We have this unique opportunity to create the industry as we see it — as we want to see it. We want diversity, we go get more diversity. Want more women founders in the space, we go create more women founders. There’s a lot of passion — that’s what makes it so intoxicating.” I marched away from Igzactly 420 with what is now my favorite “medible” — the award-winning Kiva Mint Irish Cream Chocolate Bar, made in good old California. I’ve been to many dispensaries since that first visit, but next on my list is the new “haute” Harvest SF, which recently opened on Geary. As their site indicates, “This is not your typical dispensary,” and they aren’t kidding. Pricey and posh, the new location resembles a hipster wine bar. Now if only my closet held a little Stella McCartney number to speed me past the velvet rope and up to the reigning budtender. 365 Nights and Counting My insomnia, the unhappy result of my late husband’s ten years of battling cancer and heart disease, has vanished. I had always been a champion sleeper, but when Bob was hospitalized (often), a four-hour night’s sleep was considered a good one. I was also running a thriving business, raising an awesome daughter and tending to an ailing parent. My doctor took one look at me and prescribed Ambien. I loved it at first. I slept and slept and slept. But then came the side effects. If I didn’t get a full seven hours of sleep, I’d walk around in a drugged daze. And even if I did, I was cranky. Very cranky. Fast-forward to today. It’s been one full year since I was ushered into this surprisingly complex, frenetically evolving world of weed. Since then, my cranky has disappeared, my energy has mightily rebounded, and I look forward every evening to my chocolate Kiva nightcap. In a sense, natural cannabis has helped reset my body back to its natural rhythms. My brain approves. Beyond these very real personal health benefits, though, there’s another thing that has completed my transformation to cannabis evangelist. One Saturday, I stood in line at Oakland’s Harborside Health Center, surrounded by the proverbial melting pot of patients — black, white, brown, young, old. Grandmas. Millennials. Baby boomers. Vets. Mill Valley moms in their Kate Spades. They were the living, vaping, smoking, nibbling embodiment of Harborside Health Center’s mission: a “dedication to changing the perception of cannabis to one of wellness and healing.” Once you hear the stories — many tragic, many uplifting — of the decades of struggle and devotion by cannabis pioneers, your slumbering sense of social justice wakes the hell up. We’ve endured 70 years of misinformation, propaganda, injustice and drug-war rhetoric over what? A plant whose very name in Latin means useful? Enough of this nonsense. I’m a cannabis evangelist. Who’s with me?"

What works best for the citizens of New York, my home state, or Washington may not work for residents of Kansas or Indiana. When it comes to legalization of marijuana for medicinal use, I have long believed that each state should be allowed to implement a system that works best for its residents. After much thought and very careful consideration, I have come to believe that the same is true of legalizing marijuana for recreational use. Much like my own personal views on this issue have evolved, it is clear that the American people no longer view marijuana with as much skepticism as they once did. When I first came to Congress in 1981, only 1 in 4 Americans believed marijuana should be made legal. Today, that number has climbed to nearly two thirds, a record high. Since 2012, nine states and the District of Columbia have legalized marijuana for recreational use by adults. Recreational use of marijuana is decriminalized in another 13 states while 29 states and the District of Columbia have legalized it for medical use. When looking at the support for legalization that clearly exists across wide swaths of the American population, it is difficult to make sense of our existing laws. Under current federal law, marijuana is treated as though it’s as dangerous as heroin and more dangerous than cocaine. A staggering number of American citizens, a disproportionate number of whom are African-American and Latino, continue to be arrested every day for something that most Americans agree should not be a crime. Meanwhile, those who are entering into the marijuana market in states that have legalized are set to make a fortune. This is not only misguided, but it undermines the basic principles of fairness and equal opportunity that are foundational to the American way of life. That is why I am not only announcing my support for decriminalizing marijuana at the federal level. I am also announcing that in the coming weeks, I will be introducing legislation aimed at achieving this goal. This legislation will allow each state to ultimately decide how they will treat marijuana. In addition to freeing up the residents of each state to make the decisions on what’s best for them, the bill will make targeted investments which are necessary to protect public health and safety and ensure that members of all communities are able to participate in the new and thriving marijuana economy. A bipartisan group of Senators are already working to tackle sentencing and criminal justice reform so our drug laws catch up to the realities of the world we live in today. I hope my decriminalization plan will do the same. Over the next few months I hope that I will have your support as I work to bring Democrats and Republicans together to better serve their constituents and support the rights of Americans to freely and safely use marijuana as they please."
