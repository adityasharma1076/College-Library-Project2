Power Transmissiom,2 Boca Ceramic Bearings Offer Flexibility,Bearings, http://www.powertransmission.com/news/3297/Boca-Ceramic-Bearings-Offer-Flexibility/,"  This new line of full ceramic bearings, ceramic hybrid bearings and lubricants is catered towards the automation and advanced manufacturing industries. Boca Bearing Company is introducing a new line of full ceramic bearings, ceramic hybrid bearings and lubricants catered towards the automation and advanced manufacturing industries. Boca Bearing's ceramic bearings can be used in varieties of manufacturing environments ranging from extreme temperatures, high speeds to heavy loads. Ceramic hybrid ball bearings use steel races and ceramic balls. Ceramic balls weigh up to 40 percent less than steel balls. This reduces centrifugal loading and skidding, so hybrid ceramic bearings can operate up to 50 percent faster than conventional bearings. This means that the outer race groove exerts less force inward against the ball as the bearing spins. This reduction in force reduces the friction and rolling resistance. The lighter ball allows the bearing to spin faster, and uses less energy to maintain its speed. Ceramic hybrid ball bearings have ceramic balls in place of steel balls. They are constructed with steel inner and outer rings, ceramic balls and are known as hybrids. Full Ceramic Bearings are made entirely of ceramic material and are superior to common steel bearings in many ways. Full ceramic bearings can continue to work under extremely high temperatures and are capable to operate up to 1,800 degrees F. Ceramic is much lighter than steel and many bearings are 1/3 the weight of a comparable steel bearing. Full ceramic bearings are highly corrosion resistant and will stand up to most common acids. They will not corrode in exposure to water or salt water. And finally full ceramic bearings are non-conductive. This wide array of features allows for application flexibility. Engineers can upgrade and downgrade machines, seamlessly integrating them into different production lines without long waiting times, maintenance and without production down times. Deep groove bearings, thrust bearings, angular contact bearings and self-aligning bearings are just some of the styles available in Full Ceramic and Ceramic Hybrid versions. "

Power Transmissiom,12 Bearings Six Times More Wear Resistant,Bearings, http://www.powertransmission.com/news/2726/Bearings-Six-Times-More-Wear-Resistant/,"  Maintenance-free plastic plain bearings made from iglide T500, one of 12 standard materials from bearings specialist igus, are high-tech problem solvers for temperature-, pressure- and chemical-critical applications. The company is now launching an advanced bearing material using nano particles. The material iglide X6 is up to six times more wear resistant at long term temperatures of 482 degrees Fahrenheit, according to the company's press release. Polymer plain bearings made from iglide T500 have been around since the mid-1980s. They run dry at a long-term application temperature of -148 degrees Fahrenheit to +482 degrees Fahrenheit (up to +599 degrees Fahrenheit for short periods). Even at a permanent temperature of 482 degrees Fahrenheit, the bearings can still withstand a surface pressure of about 21,750 psi (pounds per square inch). In addition, this material absorbs very little moisture and is resistant to almost all chemicals. This high-temperature material, which has proved its worth in thousands of applications over many years, is available from stock in more than 250 dimensions. In 25 years of polymer research, the possible applications for lubrication-free polymer plain bearings have been continually expanded. This new material is up to six times more wear-resistant than iglide T500 under the influence of temperature and demonstrates significantly reduced relaxation behavior. For the user, this means the press fit of the bearings is improved by up to 50 percent. In addition, the material has an even greater resistance to chemicals. Nanotechnology was used to optimize the new X6 material. In this area, surface properties play an increasingly important role compared with the material volume properties. In nanotechnology, the size of the object determines properties. These are ‘size-induced functionalities'. The use of nanoparticles has a decisive influence on the performance of iglide X6 plain bearings, especially under the influence of temperature. The new plastic plain bearings made from iglide X6 are available in 24 dimensions. "
Power Transmissiom,14 Revolvo Offers Split Roller Bearings for Harsh Environments,Bearings, http://www.powertransmission.com/news/3940/Revolvo-Offers-Split-Roller-Bearings-for-Harsh-Environments/,"  In harsh environments the choice of cage material for the bearings is critical to ensure reliability. The advantages provided by split roller bearings in delivering greatly reduced downtime compared to solid bearings are well documented: savings of 80% or more are achieved with SRB types on installation/disassembly due to their split-to-the-shaft configuration. However, savings in downtime can be forfeited if split roller bearings fail to provide the levels of reliability demanded in many tough user industries such as quarries, mines, cement plants, sewage plants, marine, steel and aluminium plants and paper making facilities. In these industries the choice of cage material for the bearings is critical to ensure reliability: that is why Adrian Menzies of Revolvo, is arguing that Brass is always best. ""We designed our ranges of SRBs from blank sheets of paper and, after considering the alternatives, we decided that brass was overwhelmingly the best cage material for use in our bearings. Several recent studies have shown that machined high tensile brass cages have several advantages over pressed steel, aluminium and non-metallic bearing cages. Brass cages offer high rigidity, high strength and can be used at high temperatures. They also offer the key features of absorbing lubricant and performing well in aggressive environments where lubrication is marginal. In contrast to some non-metallic cage materials, such as polyamide, they are unaffected by, and can be used with, most common bearing lubricants, including synthetic oils and greases. ""Brass is also first choice in industries such as petrochemical where unexpected failures can be catastrophic. Brass lends itself to preventative maintenance programmes, where vibration monitors are used to get early warning of potential failures. This is possible because brass fails very gradually, giving indication of failure along the way. In contrast, polyamide cages do not lend themselves to vibration monitoring programs and pressed steel cages can fail catastrophically without warning. This is the major reason why operators of petrochemical plants have replaced pressed steel and polyamide cage bearings with brass caged split roller bearings. ""The machined brass cages in our ranges of split roller bearings also deliver improved bearing reliability by ensuring accurate guidance of the bearing rollers. The Revolvo cage design has CNC bored pockets that are optimised to give very accurate roller guidance that prevents skewing: a condition that can lead to edge loading on the bearing and reduced bearing life. In addition to providing excellent roller guidance, the Brass cage also allows operation at higher temperatures up to 140 degrees C without problems, and operating speeds up to 25% higher, as long as thrust loads are within design limits. ""To the above advantages should also be added the non-flammable characteristics of brass, which enable the material to be used for the cages of bearings employed underground in bearing mining applications. In contrast bearing cages manufactured from aluminium, light metal alloys or non-metallic materials cannot be used: aluminium, and non-metallics because they are flammable. ""Designing a standard range of bearings with brass cages has resulted in Revolvo winning many prestigious contracts, among them a large order for the Hatfield Colliery near Doncaster. One of the major investments when the mine was reopened was a huge belt conveyor for coal extraction. The conveyor is equipped with Revolvo's split roller bearings: heavy duty 240mm series units and various medium series units. All of these bearings are manufactured in cast iron with brass cages as standard; this means that they can be used underground without modification. ""The standard material specification of the SRB bearings was a major factor in their specification; equally important was the bearings ease of maintenance - particularly important in the cramped conditions underground - and their superior sealing systems. SRB also offer the benefit of inspection in situ, as part of a planned maintenance schedule; and have longer life, because they cannot be cross- located."" "
Power Transmissiom,16 Bearings Limited Puts Independent Distributors First with IDC-USA,Bearings, http://www.powertransmission.com/news/8856/Bearings-Limited-Puts-Independent-Distributors-First-with-IDC-USA/,"  Bearings Limited has provided, through distribution, a full line of bearings and power transmission products for over 70 years.

Power Transmissiom,18 Renishaw Offers Encoders for Wind Turbine Bearings,Bearings, http://www.powertransmission.com/news/4237/Renishaw-Offers-Encoders-for-Wind-Turbine-Bearings/,"  Blade pitch adjustment is one of the most critical functions of wind turbine operation, and the giant bearings in the adjustment mechanism can now be manufactured with accuracy typically reserved for small parts, using a new vertical turn/grind machine from Swedish builder KMT Lidköping. The machine combines advanced motion systems with Renishaw optical and magnetic linear and angle encoders on critical axes to achieve form deviation of less than 1 µm on parts 4,000 mm in diameter. “This is hard turning and grinding, and is very demanding,” said Eive Johansson, KMT Lidköping’s chief designer. “Positioning accuracy is very important, with a direct effect on the quality of the finished bearings.” Prior to the VTG4000, the company’s largest machine could accommodate parts up to 600 mm (24 in) diameter, but the VTG4000 handles diameters in excess of 4,000 mm (157 in), the size of the largest wind turbine bearings, while providing much greater accuracy. Linear motors on the linear axes make the VTG4000 fast, and firm hydrostatic guideways increase accuracy. “A standard size machine, using ballscrews on the axes, maintains about a 3-µm form deviation,” said Johannson. “This machine maintains form deviation of less than 1 µm with feed resolution in 0.1 µm steps.” Linear slides are at the heart of Lidköping machines, and the combination of hydrostatic guideways, air seals and linear motors creates a stiff, accurate, maintenance-free system. “To achieve dynamic stiffness we need high gain, which is linked to the quality of the encoder scales,” explained Johansson. “It also makes a big difference that the angle encoders have the scale integrated directly onto the ring.” High Quality Improves Control of Turbine BladesPitch bearings allow wind turbine blades to optimize their angle according to wind speed, or create a stall condition in high winds, so the reliability of these bearings is critical to efficient, safe operation. The multi-tasking VTG4000 is designed to machine these large bearings in a single set up, performing both turning and grinding with two separate heads. The two heads are configured as required, usually grinding/turning or grinding/grinding. The machine’s 4.5 m X-axis carries the two heads on opposite sides of the part, and allows both grinding and turning tools to access the outside of the part. With some components weighing more than 35 tonnes, the VTG4000 is very resistant to distortion and thermal variation, which is aided by closely controlled hydrostatic oil and coolant temperatures. “We’ve used hydrostatic guideways since the 1970’s, and combining them with linear motors gives us a faster, more accurate machine capable of far greater acceleration and deceleration,” said plant manager Henrik Jonsson. “When you see that you can move the 25,000 kg rotary axis with your finger, you realize how good the hydrostatic system is.”Johansson first saw the encoders that would end up on the VTG4000 at the EMO show in 2007, and Lidköping put the sensors through rigorous testing. “We compared different scales assembled on our reference slide and selected the one with the best performance,” said Johansson. “It was important that the linear encoders have a continuous length of at least 4.5 m, as well as high dirt resistance, and SiGNUM  fit these requirements the best. We have fitted them to all four linear slides, and have had no problems. Our rotary table has the same design principle, with hydrostatic radial and axial bearings, air seals and torque motors. We did the same analysis and chose the SiGNUM angle encoders.”Renishaw’s LM10 magnetic angle encoders are fitted to the B-axes of the grinding heads. These encoders are exposed to the harsh conditions of the machine environment, but their non-contact, non-optical design, and sealing to IP68, protects them from the effects of coolant and swarf. The digital or analog output LM10 allows up to 100 m travel and high-speed operation of up to 25 m/s (4 m/s at 1 µm resolution).All Renishaw encoders feature an integral patented set-up LED that speeds installation and removes the need for complex set-up equipment or oscilloscopes. “One of the best features of the Renishaw encoders is how easy they are to set up,” added Johnasson. “With the scale attached and the readhead approximately located, the indicator lights make it very easy to see how well the two elements are aligned.” To accurately set the part in the machine’s work-coordinate system, the VTG4000 uses a Renishaw RMP60 radio signal transmission touch probe. After a raw part is placed on the bed, the RMP60 is loaded into the tool changer and used to locate the exact position of key features in a matter of seconds. This data is used to update the coordinate system in-cycle for quick, accurate machining.      "

Power Transmissiom,26 SKF Black Oxide Bearings Promote Reliability,Bearings, http://www.powertransmission.com/news/5559/SKF-Black-Oxide-Bearings-Promote-Reliability/,"  June 11, 2014—SKF black oxide bearings add a surface layer of protection to promote higher reliability and performance for wind turbines.  The coating can be specified for all types of critical bearings in wind turbine systems to help promote higher reliability against widely varying temperatures, speeds, and loads and to resist contaminants, moisture, and chemicals that otherwise could limit bearing lifecycles and increase costs of turbine operation and maintenance.  The coated bearings can be introduced into new installations or serve as replacement upgrades. Black oxide bearings ultimately can increase turbine uptime by enhancing resistance to corrosion and smearing; improving performance in low-lubrication conditions; limiting risk of fretting, micropitting, and cracking; reducing potential damage from aggressive oil additives; and reducing the effects of friction and wear. The black oxidation surface treatment is applied to a bearingâÂ™s rings and/or rollers.  The process âÂ“ involving a chemical reaction at the surface layer of the bearing steel âÂ“ is performed in an alkaline aqueous salt solution at defined temperatures.  Up to 15 different immersion steps create a thin, dark black surface layer delivering a significant performance upgrade for the broad range of bearing types and sizes in wind turbines (up to 2.2 m in diameter and up to 1,000 kg per individual bearing component). Suitable bearing types for the coating include tapered roller bearings, cylindrical roller bearings, spherical roller bearings, and CARB toroidal roller bearings, among others playing vital roles in wind turbine systems.

Power Transmissiom,42 Roller Bearings Key to Energy Efficiency,Bearings, http://www.powertransmission.com/news/3368/Roller-Bearings-Key-to-Energy-Efficiency/,"  Schaeffler rolling bearings contribute to saving energy, conserving resources and increasing performance. Schaeffler Group Industrial’s efficient rolling bearings with optimized  friction from the INA and FAG brands are a key component for the entire  industry. Rolling bearings make an important contribution to saving  energy and conserving resources and, at the same time, increase the  performance and competitiveness of machines and plants. The Schaeffler  Group’s range of energy-efficient solutions not only covers the design  and production of rolling bearings with optimized friction, but also  includes the development and use of simulation and calculation tools and  the analysis and an understanding of the entire system with its bearing  supports. The new machined needle roller bearing with the TWin Cage made of  plastic provides higher efficiency as a result of lower friction. In  this bearing, two short needle rollers can be inserted next to each  other in one cage pocket instead of the otherwise usual single long  needle roller. This completely new combination of cage and rolling  elements achieves a significantly lower frictional torque in comparison  with conventional needle roller bearings.  All geometric parameters of inner ring, outer ring and rolling  elements have been revised for the new FAG Generation C deep groove ball  bearings. The optimized osculation of the rolling elements on the rings  has made it possible to reduce the friction by up to 35 percent  compared with the previous generation. The operating life and  performance increase significantly with considerably reduced energy  consumption.  The optimization of the rib contact in the tapered roller bearing is  particularly significant: The frictional torque of conventional tapered  roller bearings increases dramatically with increasing axial loads in  particular. The Schaeffler Group has therefore revised the geometry,  surfaces, materials and dimensional and running accuracy of its new  X-life tapered roller bearings. By using these measures in combination  with the optimized contact geometry of the inner ring rib and roller end  face, the frictional torque is reduced by up to 75 percent compared  with conventional products.  In addition to high radial loads, cylindrical roller bearings can  also support axial loads if they are used as semi-locating or locating  bearings. Axial loads are transmitted via the rolling element end faces  and ribs. Using new calculation methods and changed manufacturing  processes, the Schaeffler Group’s engineers optimized the contour of the  roller end faces and the contact conditions between the end face and  rib, and thus significantly increased the axial load carrying capacity.  The more rapid formation of a lubricating film and the lower contact  pressure reduce the frictional torque under axial loads by up to 50  percent. This increases efficiency considerably.   "

Electric motors, household appliances, pumps and fans, electric power tools, and two-wheel vehicles are the fields of application in which FAG Generation C deep groove ball bearings are most commonly used.  More durable, less noise, low friction and cost-effective Ever since FAG Generation C deep groove ball bearings were successfully established on the market in 2008, their product characteristics have been subject to continuous improvement.  “We looked at the product, production, and logistics, and developed solutions in all areas that fulfill the highest requirements in the market,” explains Thomas Kreis, project manager for the deep groove ball bearing high-volume business at Schaeffler. Schaeffler products continue to set benchmarks when it comes to relevant technical characteristics, such as minimizing friction or noise. Two new sealing concepts have also been developed. Less grease loss and better protection against contamination extend the grease operating life and, thus, the bearing's operating life.  The new Z-type dust shield with its innovative labyrinth seal helps to reduce the egress of grease by 20%, and prevents contamination by 30% in comparison with the previous design. The patented ELS lip seal, which is optionally available, provides maximum sealing action at low friction and is particularly suitable for alternating axial loads, such as in wheel bearings in motorcycles. The improved sealing action, without any additional friction loss, is due to the innovative lip shape that is perfectly matched to the ring recess. What is more, the recesses that have been shifted to the interior of the bearing significantly improve the bearing’s robustness during handling, for example during mounting. Moreover, non-contact BRS lip seals and HRS lip seals, which start at the inner ring, are available with increased sealing action in the standard range. The high-quality of the balls and the noise-optimized cage mean that FAG Generation C deep groove ball bearings run significantly more quietly than conventional deep groove ball bearings. In addition, optimized osculation reduces friction. These characteristics can be attributed to the numerous optimizations to raceway parameters with regard to roundness, waviness, roughness, and tighter manufacturing tolerances. Reduced friction also means lower energy costs during operation. Production geared towards 100 percent quality at maximum output volume Schaeffler’s new production concept at the Yinchuan plant is entirely focused on the specific requirements of the high-volume business. The highly-automated production lines are optimally designed for these types of bearings and any variations, so that setup operations and downtimes can be reduced to a minimum. Schaeffler puts a special focus on cleanliness in the production process. For this reason, several automated washing stations that prevent even the slightest contamination of the products have been integrated into the production lines. At the same time, highly-skilled employees and several automated 100% inspection facilities ensure that the highest quality standards are met. Just like the plants in Caldas (Portugal) and Savli (India), where deep groove ball bearing products have been produced for several years, the plant in Yinchuan has been certified according to the highest ISO quality standards for the industrial and automotive sectors.  An optimized supply chain ensures prompt delivery A stockholding and logistics concept that is coordinated worldwide ensures prompt and reliable delivery to our customers from the plants in China, Portugal, and India. For Europe, setting up the new European Distribution Center (EDC) is of central importance. Operations at the locations in Northern Europe (Sweden) and Southern Europe (Italy) have already started. The “Central” logistics center in Germany is currently under construction and will start supplying customers in Central, Western, and Eastern Europe as of next year. "

Power Transmissiom,92 SKF Showcases Explorer Spherical Roller Bearings and Other Products at PTC Asia 2015,Bearings, http://www.powertransmission.com/news/6809/SKF-Showcases-Explorer-Spherical-Roller-Bearings-and-Other-Products-at-PTC-Asia-2015/,"  SKF recently showed off several of their most recent products at PTC Asia 2015. SKF recently presented a selection of its products and solutions at PTC Asia 2015 in Shanghai, China, from Oct. 27-30. This year, SKF demonstrated the new SKF EnCompass Field Performance Program and a range of solutions for industrial electric motors, elevators, centrifugal compressors in chillers, gearboxes, remote diagnostics and other products. New small sealed SKF Explorer spherical roller bearings with improved performance were one of SKF’s exhibits at this year’s PTC. The bearings prolong service intervals and needs for re-lubrication for gearless traction motors and reduce environmental impact. The range of bearings uses a new seal design, given the designation ‘RS’, which reduces overall friction in the bearing by up to 20 percent. In representative running conditions, this translates into calculated annual energy savings of up to 145 kWh. For a typical gearless traction motor in a heavy-duty elevator, replacing two sealed SKF Explorer bearings with the newly optimized design could cut CO2 emissions by up to 100 kg annually. Over the motor’s lifecycle, it can add up to a two-ton reduction in CO2 emissions. The new small sealed SKF Explorer spherical roller bearing is part of the SKF EnCompass Field Performance Program. This program provides users with a more detailed analysis of the factors that influence bearing service life and enables users to optimize bearing selection and design for improved performance in real-world conditions. Also on display were the new oil-free pure refrigerant lubricated bearings for centrifugal compressors in chillers. The new bearings are an oil-free solution for direct drive centrifugal compressors in chillers that uses low-viscosity refrigerant as the bearing lubricant. SKF also showed off a new magnetic system, an oil-and contact-free drive for centrifugal compressors in chillers. Combining a high-speed permanent magnet motor and active magnetic bearings with integrated controls, the magnetic system can operate with variable speed drives from various manufacturers to deliver energy savings of at least 10 percent versus conventional centrifugal compressor designs. This technology also reduces maintenance costs for the users and provides them with reliable and cost-effective air conditioning. SKF’s HRS seals were also shown at the exhibition. The new generation HRS seals can extend the service life of heavy-duty equipment operating in difficult conditions, and are manufactured in a full range of standard sizes to suit heavy-duty applications in a range of industries, including wind energy, cement manufacture, mining and tunnel boring equipment.

Power Transmissiom,98 NSK Bearings in Electric Motors,Bearings, http://www.powertransmission.com/news/6266/NSK-Bearings-in-Electric-Motors/,"  NSK Europe's Tony Synnott explains how bearing design is affecting electric motor performance and reliability. As the development of more efficient electric motors continues to keep pace with upcoming regulations, it is important to ensure that all the components are engineered to the latest specifications, including the bearings. Tony Synnott, UK Engineering Manager for NSK Europe, explains how bearing design is affecting electric motor performance and reliability. Bearings in electric motors are designed to support the rotor and maintain a consistent air gap between the rotor and the stator as well as transferring the loads from the shaft to the motor frame. Selecting the correct bearing design ensures the design efficiency of the motor is maintained with minimal friction and power losses. For a small electric motor, a bearing failure and any subsequent damage can put it beyond economical repair, so it is desirable to install high quality bearings that are designed to withstand the stresses of the environment. In larger applications, a bearing failure can cause considerable down-time, so matching the design to the application is crucial. For example, if a motor designed for an in-line drive application is reassigned to a radial, belt-drive application, the bearings are likely to be compromised and not perform as might be expected. In the original, specified application, the motor would be fitted with deep-groove ball bearings but these could be overloaded by the increased radial load from the drive belt. In terms of bearing design itself, there has been considerable innovation in terms of bearing materials technology as well as precision engineering and manufacturing processes. By improving the surface finish of the rolling elements and raceways within a bearing, the friction levels are reduced, which reduces energy consumption and noise. When these improvements are combined with the advances in lubrication, the result is a much improved operating life. One such example is the latest AC traction motors that are being used in the current generation of high speed trains, which are now expected to go faster and travel much further between maintenance periods. The bearings employed in these motors are expected to deliver exceptional performance under severe operating conditions, including high radial loads, high impact loads and high speeds. A major obstacle to achieving extended maintenance free intervals is electrical erosion. This occurs when ‘stray’ electric current flows through the motor bearings to earth. The result is damage to the bearing, the extent of which depends upon the magnitude of the current and the duration of the conditions. The damage, known as electrical arcing, is usually in the form of tiny craters and micro welds on the bearing raceway and rolling element surfaces, which results in premature bearing failure. One solution to the electrical arcing failures is the use of ceramic coatings or ceramic rolling elements in the bearing design, which provide electrical insulation from the shaft. Ceramic coatings are often applied using a plasma spray. The ceramic coating is treated with an acrylic resin to seal the surface and prevent the ingress of moisture. This coating also provides additional protection against strong alkalis and high temperatures used for washing the rolling stock. The life time of a bearing, assuming it has been correctly specified for the application, is often determined by the lubrication regime and how the bearing design ensures sufficient flow to all the rolling elements. Finite element analysis and computational fluid dynamics can be used to improve bearing strength and the flow of lubrication, both of which need to be carefully specified for each application. The maintenance programme also plays a role in bearing life expectancy and should take into account the working environment and the practicalities of access to the equipment. By improving the sealing arrangements and optimising the lubrication technique, the maintenance period can be extended to coincide with other components such as the wheelset bearings. This offers the client considerable savings in maintenance costs and lost productivity. The key to optimising bearing design is in understanding the application and the environment, whilst having the ability to employ industry leading materials and quality control. NSK has developed the unique, long life Z Steel which has significantly extended the service life of its bearings when compared to conventional bearing steel. This has been combined with improved cage designs lubrication and seal designs, as well as ceramic and resin coatings. The end result is high quality bearings that are produced for the electric motor in all environments and applications. "
Power Transmissiom,100 NSK Low Torque Bearings Improve Energy Efficiency in MRO Sector,Bearings, http://www.powertransmission.com/news/6340/NSK-Low-Torque-Bearings-Improve-Energy-Efficiency-in-MRO-Sector/,"  NSK is known across the world for its class leading reliability and long bearing life, as well as its economic and environmental credentials. Within the global automotive sector, NSK has worked with the industry to produce low torque bearings which help to reduce power consumption and emissions. Now these advances in engineering design are being applied to general purpose, deep groove ball bearings, which are used in a wide range of industrial applications. There is a worldwide focus on energy efficiency and, increasingly, production engineers are looking beyond initial procurement prices when assessing capital investment in new equipment. Instead, attention is drawn to the total cost of ownership (TCO) as well as CO2 emissions for the expected life of the machine. Most notably, this has led to considerable changes in electric motor design and the regulations which govern it. To help designers and customers alike, NSK has developed a series of improvements for bearing design and manufacture. These have resulted in standard deep groove ball bearings demonstrating up to a 47 percent torque saving for high speed domestic appliances compared to conventional bearings of the same size. This helps to improve efficiency and therefore reduce energy consumption; two features which will appeal to every industrial sector. NSK has made several developments in tribology and material technology as well as advancements in steel cleanliness to produce a significantly improved steel fatigue life. In addition, further advancements have been made in the heat treatment process which ensures excellent hardness and wear resistance characteristics, all of which enable the latest bearings to deliver improved performance and reliability. In terms of actual bearing manufacture, NSK has improved the ball bearing raceway surface finish and geometry. These improvements reduce internal friction which in turn reduces power consumption, operating noise levels, heat generation and wear. This is complimented by further improvements to the lubrication and sealing properties of the NSK bearings. Continuous research into the grease used to lubricate the bearings has allowed NSK to develop products that achieve the fine balance between minimising friction while still providing long term reliability. These developments are matched by the innovation of the NSK V seal which has improved the effectiveness of the seal without increasing the torque or operating temperature of the bearing. The use of cutting edge design technology, and state-of-the-art manufacturing processes, allows NSK to continue to deliver market leading bearings for a wide range of applications. The latest designs provide customers with the opportunity to reduce energy consumption which in turn helps to minimise operating costs and CO2 emissions. "
Power Transmissiom,104 Cooper Roller Bearings Becomes SKF Cooper Split Bearings,Bearings, http://www.powertransmission.com/news/8672/Cooper-Roller-Bearings-Becomes-SKF-Cooper-Split-Bearings/,"  SKF Cooper split roller bearings can be fitted, removed and inspected without having to dismantle surrounding equipment, providing savings in terms of reduced maintenance and downtime.  SKF acquired Cooper Roller Bearings Co Ltd. in 2013 as part of the US-based Kaydon Corporation, Cooper's parent company at the time. Following a period of consolidation within the SKF, it has now been decided that all Cooper Split Bearings ranges will be marketed under the name of SKF Cooper going forward. SKF Cooper products will continue to complement the growing SKF portfolio of complete solutions for the marine, mining, quarrying, construction and energy sectors.  In addition to the brand name change, the channels to market for SKF Cooper products, including responses to customer inquiries, product supply and after-sales support, will be handled on a global basis through local SKF sales outlets going forward. SKF Cooper split roller bearings can be fitted, removed and inspected without having to dismantle surrounding equipment, providing savings in terms of reduced maintenance and downtime. The products include both split cylindrical roller bearings and split double row tapered roller bearings, the latter with the ability to take axial loads in either direction. Both are housed and sealed in special swivel cartridges, which are suitable for mounting in pedestal or flanged outer housings. The cartridges have a spherical outer surface that fits into a conforming surface in the mounting unit rather like a ball and socket joint; any shaft misalignment tends to move the cartridge, seal and bearing together, maintaining the seal on an axis parallel to the shaft. This configuration allows extremely close tolerances to be maintained between the housing and the shaft, delivering a sealing performance that is recognised as one of the best in the anti-friction bearing industry. As well as their complementary product ranges and reputations for engineering excellence, Cooper and SKF have one other thing in common: both mark 1907 as a particularly momentous year in their respective histories. 1907 was the year that Cooper's founder, Thomas Cooper patented the world’s first split rolling element bearing, and in that same year Sven Wingquist invented the first self-aligning bearings and founded the Svenska Kullagerfabriken company – nowadays more commonly known as SKF.

Power Transmissiom,108 NKE Prepares to Meet Future Challenges in Bearings Market,Bearings, http://www.powertransmission.com/news/8739/NKE-Prepares-to-Meet-Future-Challenges-in-Bearings-Market/,"  Thomas Witzler is general manager of NKE. Based in the Austrian city of Steyr, bearing manufacturer NKE Austria GmbH has been part of the Fersa Group since January 2016. The group was established through the merger of Spanish company Fersa Bearings and NKE Austria. Both companies are internationally active in the development, production and sales of bearings for the global automotive and industrial markets, with Fersa covering the automotive and NKE the industrial sector.  Thomas Witzler, general manager of NKE, recently talked about the strategic outlook and plans of the Austrian company in the coming years.  “In 2018, Fersa will exercise its purchasing option to acquire the remaining 51 percent of NKE, making the latter a full member of the Fersa Group. As a group we will be ideally positioned to extend our production capacities and jointly set up additional factories, as well as to utilize common resources in all business sectors,” Witzler said. “NKE will also increase its focus on its four strategic industries: mechanical drives, electrical drives, agri-tech and fluid technology. The group has the clear goal of achieving the turnover-milestone of 100 million euros by the year 2020.” According to Witzler, the bearings market is facing a radical change in the next five to ten years. In particular, the automotive market will come under pressure from the growing trend towards electric mobility and the reduced demand for conventional bearings. “We expect the capacities that will be freed up through this development to shift from the automotive to the industrial sector, which will result in additional cost pressure,” Witzler added. “A further trend is that conventional automotive suppliers are increasingly transforming into system suppliers, as conventional mechanical components are increasingly being replaced by intelligent specialized systems.”  NKE is investing heavily in the technologies of tomorrow. Because conventional bearing technology is mostly at its limits, profitable growth will, in the long term, be possible only in niche markets. NKE is therefore focusing on the development of intelligent products, like its sensor bearing. “We are aiming for a profitability of at least ten percent. In addition to customer service, we will also further enhance our flexibility and speed, and aim to generate turnover of 200 million euros in the Fersa Group. In the medium term, this will be achieved both through organic and inorganic growth,” Witzler said.  "
Power Transmissiom,110 SKF Develops Online Heater Selection Tool for Bearings ,Bearings, http://www.powertransmission.com/news/7322/SKF-Develops-Online-Heater-Selection-Tool-for-Bearings-/,"  SKF has created a highly accessible online tool for heater technologies.  The new SKF online heater selection tool introduces an easy, convenient and highly accessible resource to make the right pick among heater technologies for mounting or dismounting bearings and similar workpieces in an application.  Based on a bearing’s designation or input of key parameters, the tool chooses the appropriate heater for a job from SKF’s comprehensive product range, including electric hot plate, induction heaters and fixed induction heaters. Suitable heaters are grouped into “mounting” and “dismounting” families for quick reference.  The practice of hot mounting and hot dismounting of bearings and workpieces historically has served to reduce the risk of damage to a bearing, shaft or workpiece and help increase bearing service life and machine reliability. Ultimately, proper heater selection is critical for application success.  For standard bearings the online heater selection tool requires only an SKF bearing designation to determine the appropriate heater.  In the case of other bearings or annular components, the online tool can select a suitable heater after users simply enter parameters defining the application and specifying the dimensions and weight of the bearing or work piece.  Either way, the heater selection tool serves as a practical resource for use by customers or distributors anywhere and anytime. The SKF online heater selection tool can be accessed at the link below.        "
Power Transmissiom,112 Revolvo's Water Wheel Bearings Improve Efficiency and Reliability,Bearings, http://www.powertransmission.com/news/6256/Revolvos-Water-Wheel-Bearings-Improve-Efficiency-and-Reliability/,"  Pictured is Revolvo's split roller bearing. For any power generation project, efficiency and reliability are two very important characteristics. So, when a 2-star Michelin restaurant in Belgium decided to refurbish its water wheel generator, it needed to source new bearings. With such close proximity to water, the new bearings would also require excellent sealing properties, which led to the installation of a Revolvo split roller bearing (SRB). The restaurant, located in the south of Belgium, planned to replace the existing steel water wheel with a new, more efficient, glass-reinforced nylon design. The aim of the project was for the new water wheel to produce sufficient electricity to power the restaurant, with any surplus being fed back into the local grid and generating an additional income stream. The simplicity of fitting a split roller bearing, compared to a solid bearing, is a major factor in its longevity. Because they can be removed and replaced by  supporting the shaft, there is no need to lift the shaft, or obtain access to the shaft ends. This eliminates the need for expensive and awkward to handle lifting equipment. This feature is valuable for all applications, especially regarding large machines, where sheer size and weight is a barrier to fast and cost effective servicing. This particular application required exceptional sealing properties from the bearing, which was fitted with a Walker Seal arrangement with a single garter lock spring and retaining plate to provide protection against water ingress. The seal design has subsequently been tested following adverse weather with increased the river level and partially submerged the bearing. “Revolvo has a very successful history of installing bearings in applications where they will be submerged in water, or much worse,"" said Adrian Menzies, Revolvo’s sales and marketing director. ""Thanks to a very effective sealing system our bearings are capable of surviving far longer than traditional bearings with no more than basic maintenance required. Another advantage of the SRB is that when they do reach the end of their life they are very easy to replace.”   "

Power Transmissiom,118 Hartford Introduces Drawn Cup Needle Bearings,Bearings, http://www.powertransmission.com/news/2960/Hartford-Introduces-Drawn-Cup-Needle-Bearings/,"  Hartford Technologies, a global manufacturer of engineered bearing products for OEM and other high-volume applications, has introduced a broad line of Drawn Cup Needle Bearings. Drawn Cup Needle Roller Bearings consist of a stamped outer shell, cage and needle rollers. They are similar to standard roller bearings, except for a smaller diameter-to-length ratio, which gives them a substantial advantage in fitting tight envelopes. By controlling the clearance between the rollers, rollers are kept parallel to the axis of the shaft. The major advantage that needle bearings offer over bushings is that they operate with rolling motion, rather than sliding motion. As a result, friction is less, the torque required to rotate the shaft is lowered, less heat is generated and lubrication is simplified. The overall benefit to the user is that bearing wear is substantially reduced.  Hartford Drawn Cup Needle Bearings have a low cross section design which provides suitable load carrying capacity, increases power density and maximizes product life. They are manufactured in chrome steel, and low carbon steel in sizes as small as 3 mm ID by 6.5 mm OD. Applications are highly diverse, and range from two-stroke engines to towel dispensers. Other applications include automotive steering columns, outboard motors, power tools, appliances, office equipment and air compressors. Hartford Drawn Cup Needle Bearings are typically open at both ends. Sealed Drawn Cup Needle Bearings are sealed at one end and are often used for shaft end mounting. The seal keeps the lubricant or non-pressurized oil from migrating, and prevents contamination of the raceway areas. Material options for Hartford bearings include chrome steel and low carbon steel; bearings can be supplied in lots as small as 500 pieces. "

Power Transmissiom,5 Ruland's Couplings Accomodate High Misalignment,Couplings, http://www.powertransmission.com/news/1113/Rulands-Couplings-Accomodate-High-Misalignment/,"    Applications for oldham couplings include encoders, positioning systems using servo and stepper motors, as well as other light duty drives. Possible other applications include anything where easy component removal for cleaning is desired. In higher rpm applications, the couplings feature a balanced design for reduced vibration.    Oldham couplings are a three-piece design comprised of two hubs and a floating center disc. According to Ruland's press release, the center disc is available in acetal for high torsional stiffness or nylon for shock absorption and vibration dampening, and is the torque transmitting element.    Torque transmission is accomplished by mating slots in the center disc with the drive tenons on the hubs. The slots fit with a slight press fit, are on opposite sides of the disc and oriented 90 degrees apart. The press fit allows the coupling with acetal disc to operate with zero backlash. In operation, the center disc slides on the tenon of the hub to accommodate misalignment.   Couplings can accommodate large amounts of parallel misalignment with light bearing loads.  This is especially important for protecting delicate bearings or seals and in applications where it is not practical to closely control parallel misalignment during the assembly process.    In addition to the parallel offset capabilities,oldham couplings accommodate small amounts of angular misalignment and axial motion.           "
Power Transmissiom,7 Rulands Couplings Contain Keyways in Each Bore,Couplings, http://www.powertransmission.com/news/1299/Rulands-Couplings-Contain-Keyways-in-Each-Bore/,"  Ruland Manufacturing's stepped bore rigid couplings with standard keyways in each bore. The couplings are a two-piece style allowing for easy assembly and disassembly without moving other components. Hardware is opposing for balance, allowing for higher speeds with reduced vibration. Rigid couplings are often used to connect motors to shafts where misalignment is neither present nor desired.  These couplings have zero backlash so are suitable for motion control and shaft-to-shaft applications.  Keyways increase the torque capacity of the coupling by creating a positive drive while ensuring the precise rotational positioning of the shafts. The added torque capacity provided by the keyway may be needed in applications with shock load due to sudden starts and stops or reversals, when the bore is small relative to the coupling OD, when the shaft may be undersized or when temperature changes may alter the size of the shaft or bore in application. Precise rotational positioning may be needed in applications where shaft phasing is important for timing. The couplings are offered in one- or two-piece styles in aluminum, black oxide carbon steel and stainless steel with bore sizes from 1/8"" to 2"".  "
Power Transmissiom,"9 Ruland Disc Couplings Built for High Accuracy, High Speed Systems",Couplings, http://www.powertransmission.com/news/6765/Ruland-Disc-Couplings-Built-for-High-Accuracy-High-Speed-Systems/,"  Ruland's disc couplings' primary feature is that they can stand up to the pressure even in the face of shaft misalignment. Ruland recently started advertising their line of disc couplings. Disc couplings from Ruland are torsionally stiff, operate with zero-backlash and have a balanced design, making them a good choice for highly accurate systems with speeds of up to 10,000 RPM such as wafer handlers, bonders and screen printers. Disc couplings are comprised of two anodized aluminum hubs for low inertia and multiple flat stainless steel disc springs that allow for a substantial amount of shaft misalignment while remaining rigid under torsional loads. Ruland fastens the discs to the hubs to ensure a secure fit that does not allow for any backlash or play. The disc springs are very thin, allowing them to bend easily under all types of misalignment with relatively low bearing loads. Ruland disc couplings have a balanced design for reduced vibration, benefiting solar and semiconductor equipment which often position items that are highly sensitive to minor vibrations. The balanced design also allows for higher speed capabilities of up to 10,000 RPM. Single disc styles are suited to applications where compact installation is required. Double disc styles have a center spacer to increase misalignment capabilities. The center spacer is available in anodized aluminum for general purpose use, or insulating acetal for electrical isolation. Parallel misalignment is accommodated by the double disc style or by essentially using two single disc couplings in tandem. Ruland manufactures disc couplings with or without keyways in inch, metric and inch to metric bore combinations ranging from 1/8"" to 1 1/4"" (3 mm to 32 mm). All hardware is metric and tests beyond industry standards for maximum torque capabilities. Stainless steel hubs and spacers and custom designs are available by special request. "
Power Transmissiom,11 Ringfeder TSCHAN TNR Couplings Designed for Wide Range of Rigidity ,Couplings, http://www.powertransmission.com/news/6851/Ringfeder-TSCHAN-TNR-Couplings-Designed-for-Wide-Range-of-Rigidity-/,"  Ringfeder TSCHAN TNR couplings can be operated under extreme ambient conditions.  Unlike commonly used, torsionally elastic shaft couplings, the TSCHAN TNR is adjustable and therefore allows for a smoother start-up of power transmissions. This new, non-shiftable coupling made by Ringfeder Power Transmission is not only ideal for compressors, pumps, generators and crushers, but it is also suited for all fields of power generation using combustion engines, such as emergency power aggregates and mobile generators. Describing the challenge, Norbert Telaar, strategic product manager, said, “When selecting couplings for power transmissions, we often had to make compromises if a very involved design preceded it.“ Given this observation, his team came up with the idea of developing a coupling that would allow for the rigidity to be adjusted within a wide range.  When internal combustion engines, such as frequently used diesel engines, are employed, the power train is subject to dynamic stimuli. The actual dynamic behaviour can be plotted mathematically by joining mass moments of inertia, damping and rigidity. When the excitation frequency and the natural frequency coincide, resonance is inevitable. By changing the mass moments of inertia and specifically adjusting the rigidity of the coupling, these resonances can be moved from service speed into the non-critical range.  What makes the TSCHAN TNR special is that the parameters of the coupling can be adjusted within a wide rage, while its outer dimensions remain the same. The coupling becomes “adjustable” because the elastic buffers are separated one from another and, as a result, are ordered in series. This simply requires a smart combination of available elastomers on an inner and an outer buffer plane, respectively. You no longer have to compromise over setting the torsional-vibration behaviour. By employing TSCHAN TNR, the properties of couplings can be adjusted dynamically with little effort.    "

Power Transmissiom,49 Ruland Jaw Couplings Utilized for Precision Conveyors,Couplings, http://www.powertransmission.com/news/8309/Ruland-Jaw-Couplings-Utilized-for-Precision-Conveyors/,"  Zero-backlash jaw couplings can be an excellent fit for high speed precision conveyors, allowing designers a great amount of system design flexibility. Ruland zero-backlash jaw couplings have a balanced design, accommodate all forms of misalignment and have high dampening capabilities, making them an ideal fit for precision conveyors with frequent starts and stops. These conveyor applications are often found on equipment used in semiconductor, solar, optical inspection, and medical automation. Jaw couplings offer system designers a wide range of sizes and performance characteristics to fit their application requirements. Zero-backlash jaw couplings from Ruland are made from two polished aluminum hubs and a spider type insert. The curved jaw profile of the hubs press fits to the spider, ensuring zero-backlash operation. Hubs are available in clamp or set screw style with inch, metric, keyed, and keyless bores. Spiders are available in three durometers: 98 shore A for high stiffness, 92 shore A for a balance of stiffness and compliance and 85 shore A for the highest amount of dampening. Conveyor designers can mix and match hubs and spiders to create a coupling that best fits the need of their application. Ruland jaw couplings have a standard balanced design for reduced vibration at higher speeds which is critical for conveyors in applications such as rapid optical inspection where errors can be caused by slight deviations in expected positioning. Jaw couplings are considered fail safe because if the spider fails, the jaws on the two hubs will interlock with no loss of power transmission. This prevents the system from coming to an abrupt stop and damaging sensitive high value items such as semiconductor or solar wafers. Ruland jaw couplings are made from bar stock sourced from select American mills and carefully manufactured in Ruland’s factory in Marlborough, Massachusetts. They are available in bore sizes ranging from 1/8 inch to 1 1/4 inches or 3 mm to 32 mm. Stainless steel hubs and spiders with a center hole are available by request. "
Power Transmissiom,51 Couplings: Stainless Steel Mesh Inserts Designed for High-Temp Environments,Couplings, http://www.powertransmission.com/news/9076/Couplings-Stainless-Steel-Mesh-Inserts-Designed-for-High-Temp-Environments/,"  This high-temperature, precision elastomer coupling's stainless steel mesh inserts allow for compact solutions. For designers who have had to compromise by using larger couplings than otherwise necessary - or coupling styles that are less desirable - these new elastic metal insert couplings could be a good fit.  Precision elastomer insert couplings offer technical advantages in a wide variety of power transmission applications. With the rigid jaw hubs machined from solid round bar stock, the torque density can be superior to that of almost any other type of backlash-free flexible coupling - depending on the stiffness of the elastomer insert used. Precision elastomer inserts are typically made from injection-molded polyurethane and are available in a variety of Shore hardness values, depending on the application requirements for vibration damping, flexibility and torsional stiffness. Softer materials, i.e. - those generally more suitable for damping and flexibility - also tend to be less thermally stable. This means that as temperatures increase, they soften, reducing the torque capacity of the coupling. This has historically left equipment designers to make compromises around high heat - either significantly upsizing the elastomer coupling, or changing to torsionally rigid metallic couplings that are suitable for a subset of dynamic drive applications, but lack the ability to absorb vibration and shock. To address this problem R+W  offers elastic coupling inserts from stainless steel mesh - mostly eliminating the temperature factors needed when sizing precision elastomer couplings and facilitating compact solutions - even in the presence of high heat. Formed out of AISI 316L hard-drawn wire, the new elastic inserts are corrosion-resistant, providing further advantages. They generally function in a temperature range from -30° to 500° C, with some special applications having reached 600° C. This makes them a great choice for oven conveyors and other heating systems, e.g. - small hot work rolls, down-hole oilfield equipment, etc. The company also uses them in their own hydraulic test benches to avoid the problem of hot oil making the traditional plastic materials brittle. Capacities range from 2 Nm to a maximum acceleration torque of 1,350 Nm, and a maximum bore diameter of 60mm.  Larger sizes are also an option for custom projects, as this insert type can scale up and change dimensions in a variety of ways, as a matter of the tooling. Stiffness values can also be adjusted by changing the density to which the wire is compacted in the forming tool, thus allowing the couplings to suit a variety of performance requirements. "

This allows a single coupling to combine clamp and set screw hubs with inch, metric, keyed and keyless bores. Ruland uses a proprietary hub machining process that leaves a smoother surface for interaction between the hub and disk, resulting in long life and reduced downtime. Oldham couplings from Ruland have a balanced design for reduced vibration at high speeds. Modular conveyor systems benefit from a standard coupling that can be installed on different motor, shaft and roller configurations including blind assemblies. Torque transmission is accomplished by mating the slots on the center disk to the drive tenons on the hubs. Oldham couplings accommodate all forms of misalignment, and are best suited for parallel misalignment. They operate with low bearing loads protecting system components such as bearings. The disk is available in acetal for high torsional stiffness, PEEK for high temperature and low outgassing, and nylon for shock absorption and noise reduction. In the event of wear or failure, the disk can be replaced, restoring the original performance characteristics. Oldham couplings are electrically isolating due to the non-conductive nature of the center disk. This helps prevent electrical currents from being passed to delicate instruments. They also act as a mechanical fuse in torque overload situations, with the disk cleanly breaking and stopping power transmission. Bore sizes range from 1/8” (3 mm) to 1-1/8” (30 mm) and stainless steel hubs are available upon request for use in high corrosion or clean room environments. Disks can be manufactured with a center hole to allow further shaft penetration or tapped holes to attach the disk to a hub so it stays in place during disassembly.  "

Power Transmissiom,119 Tschan 'TNT' Combines GWS Torque Delimiters and Claw Couplings,Couplings, http://www.powertransmission.com/news/6566/Tschan-TNT-Combines-GWS-Torque-Delimiters-and-Claw-Couplings/,"  Tschan TNT combines torque delimiters and claw couplings in one package. Tschan recently presented Tschan “TNT”, a marriage of two established products. It is a combination of Gerwah’s “GWS” torque delimiters and Tschan’s elastic claw couplings of the Nor-Mex and Tschan TNB series. This combination of the torque delimiter and the coupling under the Tschan label is designed to provide high-quality, simple overload protection in complex and expensive power trains. For example, the combination of the zero-clearance TNT torque delimiter and the Tschan Nor-Mex makes it possible to change the spacer ring without having to axially move the input and output ends. If combined with the Tschan TNB, it is possible to change the buffers without removing the part. Once the retaining screws have been removed and the holding ring has been pushed back, each of the mounted buffer pins can be radially removed. In addition, combinations with Gerwah multi-disc clutches as well as Tschan Posiflex denture clutches will be available in the future.  Tschan Posiflex couplings allow for a shifting of the angle on each gear level of up to 0.75 degrees, even if there is axial motion of several millimeters. The variety of combinations can be expanded and, if desired, also be used with other coupling systems that Ringfeder Power Transmission has in its product portfolio. Other than shear pin couplings or various other solutions, the Tschan TNT is non-destructive and can be switched on again after an overload. "

These drive systems are used to provide speed reduction/torque multiplication from the gas turbine output shaft and provide the necessary offset between these parallel shafts in the aircraft. Four different design configurations have been tested in the NASA Glenn Research Center, High-Speed Helical Geartrain Test Facility. The design configurations included the current aircraft design, current design with isotropic superfinished gear surfaces, double-helical design (inward and outward pumping), increased pitch (finer teeth), and an increased helix angle. All designs were tested at multiple input shaft speeds (up to 15,000 rpm) and applied power (up to 5,000 hp). Also two lubrication, system-related, variables were tested: oil inlet temperature (160âÂ“250° F) and lubricating jet pressure (60âÂ“80 psig). Experimental data recorded from these tests included power loss of the helical system under study, the temperature increase of the lubricant from inlet to outlet of the drive system and fling-off temperatures (radially and axially). Also, all gear systems were tested with and without shrouds around the gears."

In either case, when these fans are supported by hydrodynamic bearings, it is the oil film thickness developed from the bearing-shaft interaction that limits the minimum speed that can be maintained without causing premature wear and bearing failure. This paper will present a brief overview of lubrication theory and critical design parameters to achieve slow speed operation."

Power Transmissiom,9 Zero-Max ETP Shaft Locking Device Designed for Fast Setup,Design Engineering, http://www.powertransmission.com/news/7237/Zero-Max-ETP-Shaft-Locking-Device-Designed-for-Fast-Setup/,"  Zero-Max's ETP shaft locking device is designed for use in both dynamic and static applications. Zero-Max has recently released ETP, a setup and shaft locking device that is designed for both dynamic and static applications. The simple, yet versatile ETP is adept at handling both dynamic and static applications while saving time, trouble and money in the process. In today's ever-changing manufacturing industries where more is demanded of less, reducing setup time at the front-end of a production job is the best place to start. ETP provides that front-end improvement. The ETP is essentially a precision bushing that will accurately expand both the ID and OD at the same time when the single actuation screw is tightened. Since the expansion is caused by the self-contained hydraulic pressure, the resulting force is even along all surfaces. The bushing aligns precisely without axial movement as it is tightened. It positions accurately in seconds.  Another key ETP feature is that it can be actuated thousands of times with repeatable accuracy and without any axial movement. An Allen wrench is all that is required to mount and lock these bushings into place. They have sealed, clean lines that resist debris collection and clean easily without any special maintenance. ETP is available in several models to fit the application. The ETP Express and Techno models both feature a single actuation screw. The Express handles a torque range from 40 to 6400 ft. lbs. while the Techno handles a torque range from 28,000 to 32,000 ft. lbs. Sizes available handle 15mm through 100 mm shafts with both operating well in temperature ranges from -22° to +180°F.  13200 6th Avenue North  Plymouth, Minnesota 55441"

Renold Gears has designed a heavy-duty, custom gearbox solution for a manufacturer of a special type of coarse material washers known as log washers. Effectively these are huge rectangular boxes, or troughs, usually fabricated from steel plate, containing two steel shafts with paddles attached along their length. They are commonly used for washing and sizing cemented aggregates, gravel, various ores and limestone etc.  Known as log shafts, from which the log washers take their name, the steel shafts are aligned parallel to each other within the box, and as they turn the paddles intermesh. The turning and intermeshing paddles facilitate material-on-material cleaning, with water jets, and they also crush and convey the material along the box to the exit point at the far end.  The custom gearbox designed by Renold Gears has a single input shaft with counter rotating double output shafts to drive the two logs. The internal gearing was designed to ensure the logs are aligned perfectly and do not come into contact with each other during operation. As well as providing the torque to drive the machine the gearbox also acts as a bearing support to support the two logs. They will be supplied in two sizes to match the centres of the logs and the power of the machine.  Renold Gears has supplied gear units to this industry sector for over 20 years and the experience it has gained was a primary reason the company was chosen to provide this solution. The gearboxes were amongst the first to be produced on Renold's Burkhardt + Weber machining center at its factory in Rochdale. "

Power Transmissiom,43 Couplings: Stainless Steel Mesh Inserts Designed for High-Temp Environments,Design Engineering, http://www.powertransmission.com/news/9076/Couplings-Stainless-Steel-Mesh-Inserts-Designed-for-High-Temp-Environments/,"  This high-temperature, precision elastomer coupling's stainless steel mesh inserts allow for compact solutions. For designers who have had to compromise by using larger couplings than otherwise necessary - or coupling styles that are less desirable - these new elastic metal insert couplings could be a good fit.  Precision elastomer insert couplings offer technical advantages in a wide variety of power transmission applications. With the rigid jaw hubs machined from solid round bar stock, the torque density can be superior to that of almost any other type of backlash-free flexible coupling - depending on the stiffness of the elastomer insert used. Precision elastomer inserts are typically made from injection-molded polyurethane and are available in a variety of Shore hardness values, depending on the application requirements for vibration damping, flexibility and torsional stiffness. Softer materials, i.e. - those generally more suitable for damping and flexibility - also tend to be less thermally stable. This means that as temperatures increase, they soften, reducing the torque capacity of the coupling. This has historically left equipment designers to make compromises around high heat - either significantly upsizing the elastomer coupling, or changing to torsionally rigid metallic couplings that are suitable for a subset of dynamic drive applications, but lack the ability to absorb vibration and shock. To address this problem R+W  offers elastic coupling inserts from stainless steel mesh - mostly eliminating the temperature factors needed when sizing precision elastomer couplings and facilitating compact solutions - even in the presence of high heat. Formed out of AISI 316L hard-drawn wire, the new elastic inserts are corrosion-resistant, providing further advantages. They generally function in a temperature range from -30° to 500° C, with some special applications having reached 600° C. This makes them a great choice for oven conveyors and other heating systems, e.g. - small hot work rolls, down-hole oilfield equipment, etc. The company also uses them in their own hydraulic test benches to avoid the problem of hot oil making the traditional plastic materials brittle. Capacities range from 2 Nm to a maximum acceleration torque of 1,350 Nm, and a maximum bore diameter of 60mm.  Larger sizes are also an option for custom projects, as this insert type can scale up and change dimensions in a variety of ways, as a matter of the tooling. Stiffness values can also be adjusted by changing the density to which the wire is compacted in the forming tool, thus allowing the couplings to suit a variety of performance requirements. "

Power Transmissiom,51 Redesigned Air Motors Minimize Need for Compressors,Design Engineering, http://www.powertransmission.com/news/1850/Redesigned-Air-Motors-Minimize-Need-for-Compressors/,"    Via an integral rotary valve, air up to 100 psi is supplied to each of the three pistons in turn. The free-floating pistons transmit torque on start-up that can be adjusted via a pressure regulator, resulting in high torque at variable low speed and low noise.  Because the Dynatork air motor traps the compressed air within the piston/cylinder, allowing for maximum energy conversion, the unit is easier to seal than a vane motor cylinder. The air motor consumes up to 80 percent less air than a vane motor, providing a significant cost savings even at maximum torque. It can be used in harsh and hazardous environments thanks to redesigned internal air passages that replace the external tube structure, and it can operate in constant start-stop applications under loads displaying similar characteristics to a stepper motor.     ""The original purchasing criteria for the motors, given by the UK automaker, were greater reliability on 24/7 operation and freedom from lubrication to avoid the possibility of contamination,"" said David Lockett, joint managing director of Huco Dynatork. ""However, by changing to the air motor, this manufacturer has gained considerably more. The company has now installed 42 Dynatork motors which have provided a capital saving of two 600 scfm compressors and an overall power saving of 152 kVA per year.""   Available in aluminum, stainless steel for harsh environments and plastic for high-pressure washdown environments, the air motors can be supplied as fully submersible units for lubricated or non-lubricated operation.   The air motors are available with maximum torques up to 16 Nm or 550 Nm with gearbox. Huco has also introduced a new controller that holds the motor speed constant under variable load for paint and other liquid stirring applications where torque reduces as the paint or liquid levels fall.

Power Transmissiom,"53 Excel Gear Designs, Prototypes Navy Gun System Gearboxes",Design Engineering, http://www.powertransmission.com/news/2094/Excel-Gear-Designs-Prototypes-Navy-Gun-System-Gearboxes/,"  Roscoe, IL-based Excel Gear has transitioned from prototype to production of 38:1 ratio gearboxes designed for positioning the gun mount used in the Advanced Gun System (AGS) used by the U.S. Navy and Marine Corps. The AGS is used in the DDG 1000 destroyers that support Navy and Marine Corps expeditionary and joint operation in the littorals and deep inland. BAE Systems of Minneapolis develops the AGS as a complete weapons delivery system that uses rapid and virtual prototyping for the gun, magazine, ammunitions and support subsystems. The system produces gunfire for guided and unguided projectiles at targets over 70 nautical miles. Excel Gear designed and prototyped the gearbox used in the positioning execution of movements on the gun mount. The main gear diameter in the unit measures 17"", and overall the gearbox is 46"" long with 36"" in diameter and weighing 3,740 lbs.  A successful pair of prototypes was produced for evaluation and performance testing prior to the production order. ""This achievement marks a very important milestone in the history of our company, and we all worked very diligently as a team to attain this business and see its successful execution,"" says N.K. Chinnusamy, president of Excel Gear. Excel's gearboxes help the rotary and vertical positioning of the gun mount. Testing was performed at the Excel and BAE Systems' facilities. One challenge for Excel in this project was limiting backlash, as Chinnusamy explains. ""Backlash in this case is controlled by precision grinding gears to close tolerance and also grinding splines to fit master gages. The gearbox had to meet very precise backlash, lost motion and stiffness criteria. Our two prototype gearboxes met all the criteria without any exceptions."" "

Power Transmissiom,57 Ameridrives Design Overload Protection Solution for Metals Recycler ,Design Engineering, http://www.powertransmission.com/news/6269/Ameridrives-Design-Overload-Protection-Solution-for-Metals-Recycler/,"  Ameridrives recently repaired a metal shredder with an overload protection solution. An international metals recycler was suffering from recurring damage to the motors and universal joints caused by torque overload when the shredder rotors jammed caused by an un-shreddable obstruction. During a jam the torque generated was so excessive that damage was being caused to the components within the drive train, such as the universal joint bearings and even the motor itself. In this instance not only could the repair bill becostly, but the downtime could be considerable while the obstruction was cleared and the drive train repaired or replaced. In total, up to 48 hours of downtime was required each time the rotors jammed. In an effort to save on maintenance costs and reduce downtime, the site manager turned to Ameridrives, a division of Altra Couplings, to see if its engineers could design a solution. As a manufacturer of industrial couplings, Altra Couplings develops bespoke solutions for most industries which incorporate reliability with reduced operation costs. Having assessed the application, Altra’s engineers designed an overload protection solution into the universal joints which would protect the components within the drive train in the event of a jam. An Americarden U3440 universal joint was modified to incorporate a shear pin overload device. When a rotor jam occurs, and torque reaches in excess of 533,000 Nm, the pins shear, disengaging the driven end of the universal joint from the driving end and protecting the components from damage. The solution also meant that, after clearing the jam, a maintenance crew can replace the pins and have the shredder operational in less than four hours – reducing downtime by over 95%.   "

Power Transmissiom,73 Coreless Design Maximizes Motor Efficiency,Design Engineering, http://www.powertransmission.com/news/1948/Coreless-Design-Maximizes-Motor-Efficiency/,"  ""Athlonix motors are powered by a proprietary self supporting coil, whose design optimization flows from more than 70 years of Portescap research and design. The result is maximized magnetic flux and turn-density for a given diameter, within the Athlonix motor platform,"" says Udayan Senapati, brush DC product line manager for Portescap. ""In contrast, typical self-supporting coils have inherent turn-density limitations that affect the magnetic flux density in the magnetic circuit, which further limits output and endurance of the motor."" The coil design allows for a low motor regulation factor in which energy efficiency is near 90 percent, depending on motor load conditions. The result is a motor that performs better over its lifetime, and the package weight has been reduced to 15-53 grams, depending on the frame size.  ""The motor regulation factor, measure by R/k² where R is the coil resistance and k is the torque constant, is a critical measure of a motor's power density over its performance lifetime,"" Senapati says. ""The lower the motor regulation factor, the lower will be the heat loss at higher loads, thus enabling the motor to retain high power density with sustained endurance. The heat loss from a motor is detrimental not only in terms of reduced efficiency, but it also degrades motor performance over the life of the motor. Superior motor regulation, then, is the key to levels of performance and endurance that set Athlonix apart from conventional technologies."" Athlonix motors have motor regulation factors lower than most comparative motors by 5-20 percent, according to a Portescap press release. The result here is consistent power density over the motors' lifetime. They also are capable of higher throughput than other motors because of the quick acceleration they're capable of.  The Athlonix motors are well suited for applications such as medical analyzers and electronic assembly that require constant pick-and-place operations during machining, assembly and scanning. They are also suitable for medical pumps, secure door locks, watch winding mechanisms and robotics. "
Power Transmissiom,75 Parker Teams with CalMotors on Hybrid-Electric Truck Design,Design Engineering, http://www.powertransmission.com/news/2581/Parker-Teams-with-CalMotors-on-Hybrid-Electric-Truck-Design/,"  Parker's Electromechanical Automaton Division, a leading supplier of motion control technology, is proud to announce that its MPP series traction motor and inverter are integral components of a series-electric hybrid truck deployed by US 1 Industries to serve at the Port of Long Beach. The US 1truck uses a 215 kW Parker MPP traction motor as the single source of torque for their Class 8 truck - a large tractor-trailer truck with a gross vehicle weight of 80,000 lbs. Thanks to the large speed range of the MPP, the truck can travel at a continuous velocity of 70 mph. Using the MPP motor, the truck has better acceleration and passing capabilities compared to the stock diesel engine typically in the truck. An onboard generator will be used to recharge the batteries as energy is depleted giving it a range of 200 miles on a single charge - at full load. CalMotors is the company responsible for the complete integration of the powertrain. ""Their intimate knowledge of the Parker components is invaluable to the optimization and ultimate success of this vehicle,"" says Jay Schultz, product manager for Parker's MPP motors. The first truck will serve as a test vehicle at the Port and will collect data over a few months to confirm the theoretical performance calculations predicted by CalMotors. The Parker drive system is expected to have a timely payback for US 1; however, the emissions reduction will be realized immediately. ""Parker has been an excellent partner for CalMotors as we engineer complete powertrain solutions for all sizes of vehicles,"" says Mike Kasaba, president of CalMotors. ""The motor efficiency, performance and broad range of motor options along with Parker's agility and fast response time have allowed us to tailor an impressive powertrain system for a Class 8 truck."" Designed for the demanding applications found in today's high-performance electric and hybrid vehicles, Parker's MPP traction motors offer lower weight and higher power, all in a smaller package than other traction motors. High-performance neodymium magnets are employed for higher torque output. Parker's MPP motors feature innovative winding design and Parker's exclusive dual cooling implementation, which features a patent-pending internal cooling technology. This design yields up to 40 percent higher torque per unit size than conventionally constructed permanent magnet motors. The Port of Los Angeles and the Port of Long Beach have strict Clean Truck Programs, which mandate that all trucks that do not meet the 2007 Federal Clean Truck Emissions Standards be banned from the facility, which stretches along 43 miles of waterfront. By implementing Parker's MPP motors and inverters in their trucks, Cal Motors and US 1 are helping the busiest container port in the country meet its emission goals.   "

Power Transmissiom,"89 NSKs New Bearing Designs Deliver Longer Life, Higher Speeds in Papermaking Machines ",Design Engineering, http://www.powertransmission.com/news/926/NSKs-New-Bearing-Designs-Deliver-Longer-Life-Higher-Speeds-in-Papermaking-Machines/,"    The increasing demands worldwide for paper mean that failures in the continuous production cycle can be costly. Despite the many operating difficulties, bearing manufacturers are under pressure to provide increasing levels of reliability and operating life from their products.    One of the major problems addressed by NSK is the trend to higher operating temperatures in the dryer sections of papermaking machines. These temperatures, up to 200$B!(BC on newer machines, cause high thermal stresses, which can lead to fracture of the inner rings of the spherical roller bearings used in the dryer sections. The same problem can also occur as a result of rapid dryer warm-up. The excessive thermal stresses that result can lead to broken bearings and breaks in production.   The company analysed the mechanism of inner ring fracture, and established a strength evaluation method that enabled development of the TL (Tough and Long-Life) specification.    The TL specification is a special surface treatment of an original steel type. According to the companys press release, it attains both high raceway surface hardness and dimensional stability under high temperatures (up to 2000C) while, simultaneously having the same level of compressive residual stress at the raceway surface as conventional carburised steel.                                                                                 The latter feature increases the fracture resistance performance commonly associated with conventional spherical roller bearings. In fact, TL specification bearings have higher inner ring fracture resistance compared with bainite steel (austempered high-carbon chrome bearing steel) and bearing steel (hardened high-carbon chrome bearing steel) units.    The raceway surface hardness of the TL material also exceeds that of bainite bearing steel and carburised steel. This means that TL specification steel achieves a longer life, when foreign debris is present, than any of the other bearing steels.   In addition to their use in dryer sections, TL Series spherical roller bearings are suitable for use in drying cylinders, PV, canvas, paper and breaker stack bottom rolls, soft calendars, and Yankee dryers.   NSK also developed the HPSTM series of spherical roller bearings for use in other small diameter rolls in the papermaking process, including canvas rolls, paper rolls, felt rolls and rider. The HPS series is a new design of spherical roller bearing (SRB) that offers twice the running life of conventional SRB of the same size, together with a 20% increase in running speed.     To address the cage wear issue, the company developed a special nitriding surface treatment, which is applied to the high-precision pressed steel cage of the HPS series bearings. Compared to conventional nitriding, NSKs treatment forms a finer and harder surface with a more uniform hardness.     Finally, NSKs Molded Oil  bearings (standard deep groove ball and SRB) enable machine users to replace existing methods of lubricating machine parts, especially on raw material conveyors, carrier rope sheaves and suction rolls.   ""Molded Oil"" is a plastic containing lubricating oil and the lubricating oil accounts for more than 50% of the content. Therefore, the mechanism of oil discharge from the matrix is temperature-dependent--the higher the heat generation, the higher the oil discharge rate.   Bearings equipped with Molded Oil are particularly suited to environments exposed to moisture or paper dust. They do not suffer from oil leakage and there is no loss of lubricant due to the ingress of water. In addition, Molded Oil bearings can affect equipment performance in environments where lubrication is difficult to apply and in places where oil and grease absorbing dust is produced.  In both cases, long-term bearing performance is increased.   "

High atop the Cerro Armazones in the harsh but extremely dry environment of the Chilean Atacama Desert, more than 2000 custom hybrid actuators will adjust 798 quarter ton segments in the primary mirror of the Extremely Large Telescope (ELT). As a leader in precision motion control solutions, PI (Physik Instrumente) designed a new type of actuator that would meet the extreme requirements and win the European South Observatory (ESO) contract.  Hybrid Actuator Concept Solves the Nanometer Precision - High Load - Low Heat Conundrum  PI’s ultra-precision actuator was developed to meet requirements such as: tracing performance better than 2 nm RMS, force variation 0 to 900 N, 15 mm travel, minimized heat dissipation. Several concepts were simulated and tested before a winner was picked. The best results were achieved with a hybrid design based on the combination of piezo actuator, brushless motor, linear encoder and a hybrid controller to drive both the brushless motor and piezo actuator simultaneously based on the position feedback of an optical position sensor providing sub-nanometer resolution. Three actuators are required per segment.  Why is this Precision Required? In order to perform similar to one 39 m mirror (it is not feasible to make a single mirror of that size), all segments have to be aligned to each other to within nanometers all the time. The exact position of the mirror segments is influenced by several factors such as wind load, distortions, and vibration from the telescope structure, temperature fluctuations and varying gravity effects during tracking motions of the telescope. Smallest alignment errors between the mirror segments will degrade the optical performance of the telescope. How Large is Extremely Large?Touted as the largest telescope in the world, the 39 meter diameter ELT individual hexagonal mirrors measure 1.4 meters across and weigh about 500lbs each. The large aperture directly determines the light-collecting area, which in turn defines the exposure time. More area means that for a given amount of exposure time, the telescope can detect more distant (fainter) stars and look deeper into the universe. With its total surface area of close to 1000 square meters, the ELT is supposed to collect around 100 million times more light than the human eye and boasts about 250 times the light gathering area of the Hubble Space Telescope. The ELT is scheduled to see its first light in 2024.  "

Standard configurations can be delivered with a maximum one week lead-time.  110 Westtown Rd  West Chester, PA 19382 "
Power Transmissiom,125 Ringfeder TSCHAN TNR Couplings Designed for Wide Range of Rigidity ,Design Engineering, http://www.powertransmission.com/news/6851/Ringfeder-TSCHAN-TNR-Couplings-Designed-for-Wide-Range-of-Rigidity-/,"  Ringfeder TSCHAN TNR couplings can be operated under extreme ambient conditions.  Unlike commonly used, torsionally elastic shaft couplings, the TSCHAN TNR is adjustable and therefore allows for a smoother start-up of power transmissions. This new, non-shiftable coupling made by Ringfeder Power Transmission is not only ideal for compressors, pumps, generators and crushers, but it is also suited for all fields of power generation using combustion engines, such as emergency power aggregates and mobile generators. Describing the challenge, Norbert Telaar, strategic product manager, said, “When selecting couplings for power transmissions, we often had to make compromises if a very involved design preceded it.“ Given this observation, his team came up with the idea of developing a coupling that would allow for the rigidity to be adjusted within a wide range.  When internal combustion engines, such as frequently used diesel engines, are employed, the power train is subject to dynamic stimuli. The actual dynamic behaviour can be plotted mathematically by joining mass moments of inertia, damping and rigidity. When the excitation frequency and the natural frequency coincide, resonance is inevitable. By changing the mass moments of inertia and specifically adjusting the rigidity of the coupling, these resonances can be moved from service speed into the non-critical range.  What makes the TSCHAN TNR special is that the parameters of the coupling can be adjusted within a wide rage, while its outer dimensions remain the same. The coupling becomes “adjustable” because the elastic buffers are separated one from another and, as a result, are ordered in series. This simply requires a smart combination of available elastomers on an inner and an outer buffer plane, respectively. You no longer have to compromise over setting the torsional-vibration behaviour. By employing TSCHAN TNR, the properties of couplings can be adjusted dynamically with little effort.    "

Power Transmissiom,Effect of Assembly Errors in Back-to-Back Gear Efficiency Testing,Gear Drives, http://www.powertransmission.com/articles/1215/Effect_of_Assembly_Errors_in_Back-to-Back_Gear_Efficiency_Testing,"SummaryAs gear efficiency is improved in small steps, it is important to be able to distinguish actual improvements from scatter that can occur while testing. An FZG back-to-back gear test rig was used to investigate how the assembly and re-assembly of the same test setup affects the measurements. A spread in torque loss between one assembly and another of the same test setup were observed. Rig conditions also affected the spread in input torque. With knowledge of how the spread in torque loss varies due to assembly, test results could be distinguished between changes due to assembly and actual differences between tests."
Power Transmissiom,Determination of Load Distributions on Double Helical-Geared Planetary Gearboxes,Gear Drives, http://www.powertransmission.com/articles/0617/Determination_of_Load_Distributions_on_Double_Helical-Geared_Planetary_Gearboxes,"SummaryStandardized calculation methods such as ISO 6336 and DIN 3990 already exist to determine the load distributions on gears inside a planetary gearbox, but by their very universal nature, these methods offer varying results depending on the gearbox design. Double helical gears, in particular, can benefit from more specific, complex algorithms to reach a maximum level of efficiency. Double helical gears interact with the rest of the gearbox differently than helical or spur gears, and thus benefit from different analytical models outside the standardized methods. The present research project describes the algorithm to determine the load distribution of planetary gearboxes with double helical gears."

This system corresponds to a first step towards the design of a hybrid vehicle gearbox that can operate up to 40,000 rpm on its primary shaft. The numerical model is based on the thermal network method and takes into account power losses due to teeth friction, rolling-elements bearings and oil churning. Some calculations underline that oil churning causes a high amount of power loss. A simple method to reduce this source of power losses is presented, and its influence on the gear unit efficiency and its thermal capacity is computed."

These drive systems are used to provide speed reduction/torque multiplication from the gas turbine output shaft and provide the necessary offset between these parallel shafts in the aircraft. Four different design configurations have been tested in the NASA Glenn Research Center, High-Speed Helical Geartrain Test Facility. The design configurations included the current aircraft design, current design with isotropic superfinished gear surfaces, double-helical design (inward and outward pumping), increased pitch (finer teeth), and an increased helix angle. All designs were tested at multiple input shaft speeds (up to 15,000 rpm) and applied power (up to 5,000 hp). Also two lubrication, system-related, variables were tested: oil inlet temperature (160âÂ“250° F) and lubricating jet pressure (60âÂ“80 psig). Experimental data recorded from these tests included power loss of the helical system under study, the temperature increase of the lubricant from inlet to outlet of the drive system and fling-off temperatures (radially and axially). Also, all gear systems were tested with and without shrouds around the gears."
Power Transmissiom,"Lightweight, Highly Efficient Drive System",Gear Drives," http://www.powertransmission.com/articles/0217/Lightweight,_Highly_Efficient_Drive_System","SummaryThis paper presents a joint project conducted by Ashwoods Electric Motors and Oerlikon Fairfield that uses planetary drives with an integrated electric motor. Current solutions used in production of off-highway vehicles rely upon large, heavy and inefficient brushed DC or induction motors, coupled to a planetary gearbox. This presents a number of challenges to the vehicle designers such as: limited vehicle range, limited space around the motor/drivetrain, and motor durability. The proposed integrated system utilizes an Oerlikon Fairfield Torque Hub, widely used in off-highway vehicles, and the Ashwoods first-to-market, interior permanent magnet motor. How these products are integrated, i.e. incorporating a brake solution, represents a market-changing product. Using interior permanent magnet (IPM) technology in the motor design means the motor can be up to 70% lighter, 70% smaller and 20% more efficient than traditional motors used in off-highway traction applications."

Power Transmissiom,5 Zero-Max Right Angle Gear Drives Ensure Lifetime Lubrication,Gear Drives, http://www.powertransmission.com/news/8158/Zero-Max-Right-Angle-Gear-Drives-Ensure-Lifetime-Lubrication/,"  Lifetime lubrication ensures long term, maintenance free operation for Zero-Max Right Angle Gear Drives (left). Lifetime lubrication in Zero-Max “Crown” gear drives assures motion system designers of a smooth operating, quiet right angle gear drive that needs no maintenance. These drives are designed for economical transfer of speed or power. Lubricated for life with Beacon 325 premium grade grease, Zero-Max Crown drives feature heat treated AGMA Class 10 spiral bevel gears. This combination of bearing design and lubrication formulation ensures long-term, maintenance free operation for demanding industrial applications. The drives feature precision hardened and ground ball bearings with non-magnetic steel shafts for handling speeds up to 2,000 rpm in most operating environments. The internal gears are permanently mounted to the shafts with locking pins. This provides a very resilient and durable connection for use in heavy load applications while requiring no maintenance. Sealed-for-life systems using motors, generators and similar equipment in industrial applications require an equally robust gear drive. Crown drives provide that and more. Lubrication with Beacon 325 grease ensures optimum performance in temperature ranges from -50° C to +120° C without evaporation. Zero-Max ensures their drives are predictably smooth operating, and similar model sizes have identical performance characteristics when designed into multiple drive setups. To accomplish this, Zero-Max drives are precision assembled for perfect bearing and gear alignment. The drives are pre-lubricated during assembly, then completely enclosed in a heavy-duty anodized aluminum housing. The housing is designed for maximum strength and heat dissipation. This design ensures that internal gears stay permanently aligned, lubricated and free of contamination from outside debris. Zero-Max Crown drives are used throughout dozens of industries in hundreds of applications. Among these are food processing, packaging and material handling systems. Available in many sizes and models, Crown Drives are ideal for a wide range of horsepower, torque and shaft speed requirements. Standard two and three way models are available with 1:1 and 2:1 speed ratios in shaft diameter combinations of 3/8, 1/2, 5/8 and 3/4 inch. "

Power Transmissiom,11 Bonfiglioli and Schaeffler Collaborate on Wind Turbine Gear Drives ,Gear Drives, http://www.powertransmission.com/news/9759/Bonfiglioli-and-Schaeffler-Collaborate-on-Wind-Turbine-Gear-Drives-/,"  A compact Industry 4.0 solution package for wind turbine azimuth drives is the result of a long-term development partnership between Bonfiglioli and Schaeffler. A compact Industry 4.0 solution package for wind turbine azimuth drives is the result of a long-term development partnership between Bonfiglioli and Schaeffler. Schaeffler Torque Sense and SmartCheck sensors record torque, speed, vibration and temperature information. These data are transmitted through a gateway, combined and processed using algorithms, developed by Bonfiglioli and based on the more than 60 years know-how in gear motors and dedicated specifically for the application. Subsequently, the data will be made available for the users on the Bonfiglioli Cloud platform. The Bonfiglioli Dashboard provides a clear overview of the collected information for the operator. Maintenance measures can be carried out in a load-oriented manner and the unplanned downtimes of the system can be minimized, and operating costs can even be more than halved.  On the Bonfiglioli dashboard, the operator can carry out a continuous control of the state of the geared motor based on the data situation; even an estimation of the remaining service life of the drive takes place. Abnormal behavior of the azimuth drive is reported as naturally as critical conditions. On this basis, the maintenance intervals can be optimized to the actual needs and necessary repairs can be made at favorable times. At the same time, the control of the drives can be optimized, whereby overloading can be avoided. Valuable result is the drastic reduction of unplanned downtime or vice versa, the significant increase in the profitability of a plant.  Concrete figures based on the example of a 2.3 megawatt wind turbine make this clear, as Gaetano Ciaravella, Bonfiglioli's Mechatronics & IoT Manager reported at a conference: Currently, the availability of a wind turbine is falling from 95% in the first year to 82% in the 20th year of life with a median of 88.5%. At the same time, the yields of a wind turbine are falling by about 7% per year due to lower kWh prices. The operating costs account for approximately 75% of the total initial investment in the 20 years of life. About 50% of the operating and maintenance costs are attributable to unplanned interventions. Specifically, this means that for a 2.3 megawatt wind generator in 20 years operating costs of approximately 1.6 million euros are estimated, of which up to 1.1 million euros are due to unscheduled repair and maintenance. With the help of the relatively small investment in the system from the cooperation between Bonfiglioli and Schaeffler, operating costs can be reduced by up to 60%.  In reality, there are certainly other advantages that are difficult to quantify due to the available data. They result from the possibility of adapting the electronic drives to environmental and operating conditions (e.g. temperatures, wind hours / year, etc.), which has a direct and positive effect on the productivity of the wind generator.

Power Transmissiom,Load Capacity and Efficiency of Grease-Lubricated Worm Gears,Gears, http://www.powertransmission.com/articles/0914/Load_Capacity_and_Efficiency_of_Grease-Lubricated_Worm_Gears,"SummaryVarying installation requirements for worm gears, as, for example, when used in modular gear systems, can necessitate grease lubrication - especially when adequate sealing for oil lubrication would be too complex. Such worm gears are being increasingly used in outside applications such as solar power plants and slew drives. While knowledge about the operating conditions is often appropriate, the basic understanding for load capacity and efficiency under grease lubrication is quite poor. Investigations done at FZG and sponsored by FVA/AiF are shown here to give an impression of the basic factors of load capacity and efficiency. The results of the investigation indicate a satisfying quality of calculations on heat, load capacity and efficiency based on characteristic parameters of the base oil with only slight modifications to the methodology known from DIN 3996 or ISO TR 14521."

These drive systems are used to provide speed reduction/torque multiplication from the gas turbine output shaft and provide the necessary offset between these parallel shafts in the aircraft. Four different design configurations have been tested in the NASA Glenn Research Center, High-Speed Helical Geartrain Test Facility. The design configurations included the current aircraft design, current design with isotropic superfinished gear surfaces, double-helical design (inward and outward pumping), increased pitch (finer teeth), and an increased helix angle. All designs were tested at multiple input shaft speeds (up to 15,000 rpm) and applied power (up to 5,000 hp). Also two lubrication, system-related, variables were tested: oil inlet temperature (160âÂ“250° F) and lubricating jet pressure (60âÂ“80 psig). Experimental data recorded from these tests included power loss of the helical system under study, the temperature increase of the lubricant from inlet to outlet of the drive system and fling-off temperatures (radially and axially).

The initial design could not be adapted to the requested number of revolutions during that phase. Consequently the actuator needed to be modified so that the function of the mechanism would not be endangered or, by extension, the overall function of the NIRSpec instrument. The modification included a change of the overall actuator designâÂ”internal dimensions, tolerances, materials, lubrication and assembly processâÂ”while keeping the interface to the mechanism, mass and function."

The load is shared among multiple teeth around the coupling circumference, resulting in higher load capacity than a conventional single key. However, the total load is not equally shared among all spline teeth, mainly because of pitch deviations resulting from the manufacturing process. The load distribution along the spline engagement length is also nonuniform because of tooth misalignments and shaft torsional effects.

Power Transmissiom,23 New Redex Gears Offer Increased Versatility ,Gears, http://www.powertransmission.com/news/6149/New-Redex-Gears-Offer-Increased-Versatility/,"  Redex gears offers two complementary integrated drives. The high-speed DRP, KRP and KRPX solutions dramatically extend the Redex range of drives, particularly for high-speed milling tables. Versatility is the key issue for manufacturers of multi-axis milling machines and vertical turning lathes. The same machine must be able to perform various milling and lathing operations so that machining operations can be carried out with the highest accuracy (without part disassembly) and the highest productivity.  Until now, these heavy constraints meant that manufacturers had to use drives that were generally complex and did not necessarily meet every technical requirement. Redex offers two complementary integrated drives for tables used on milling machines and vertical lathes. They allow designers to choose the right drive for each application and based on their priorities of speed, power, accuracy and rigidity. Redex's high-speed versions of its DRP, KRP and KRPX ranges complement the features of its MSR range of drives. They simplify the design of the mechanical transmission systems of both large rotary tables used on vertical lathes (over 2000 m) and smaller tables used on milling machines. They also improve machine accuracy and allow for smaller machine footprints. When meshed with a drive gear, the two reducers on Redex TwinDrive and DualDrive solutions cancel 100% of backlash. These high-speed reducers have been hardened to allow continuous operating cycles and meet the specific requirements of rotary tables. As a result, Redex high-speed TwinDrive and DualDrive units can achieve rotational speeds of up to 28 rpm-1. Although the Redex MSR range offers higher rotational speeds, the high-speed versions of its DRP, KRP and KRPX drives offer far greater accuracy, rigidity and momentum. They are the standard drives with the highest positioning accuracy (a few arc-minutes). The complementarity of both solutions allows manufacturers to design the right rotary-table drives for specific applications and thus their priorities of speed, power, accuracy and rigidity. Redex solutions make it possible to execute additional functions on the C-axis without any additional mechanical devices or the use of position locking. This maximum accuracy is maintained during milling and/or positioning operations particularly by the electrical or mechanical preload system, which continuously manages the counter-torque between the pinions. Solutions that use two reducers, and thus two motors, are more cost effective and easier to manage in most cases. Compared to heavy-duty rotary tables used in conventional configurations that require a 160-kW motor, the TwinDrive solution uses two 80-kW motors, which are more standard and often less expensive (even accounting for the cost of both units). Maintenance and spare-parts management is also simplified by the use of the smaller, standard motors. This simplifies rotary-table design because it eliminates the need for machine-tool manufacturers to design and build their own gearboxes with all the necessary components.   "
Power Transmissiom,25 Renold Gears Designs Heavy-Duty Gearbox Solution for Log Washer Manufacturer,Gears, http://www.powertransmission.com/news/8344/Renold-Gears-Designs-Heavy-Duty-Gearbox-Solution-for-Log-Washer-Manufacturer/,"  The custom gearbox designed by Renold Gears has a single input shaft with counter rotating double output shafts to drive the two logs. Renold Gears has designed a heavy-duty, custom gearbox solution for a manufacturer of a special type of coarse material washers known as log washers. Effectively these are huge rectangular boxes, or troughs, usually fabricated from steel plate, containing two steel shafts with paddles attached along their length. They are commonly used for washing and sizing cemented aggregates, gravel, various ores and limestone etc.  Known as log shafts, from which the log washers take their name, the steel shafts are aligned parallel to each other within the box, and as they turn the paddles intermesh. The turning and intermeshing paddles facilitate material-on-material cleaning, with water jets, and they also crush and convey the material along the box to the exit point at the far end.  The custom gearbox designed by Renold Gears has a single input shaft with counter rotating double output shafts to drive the two logs. The internal gearing was designed to ensure the logs are aligned perfectly and do not come into contact with each other during operation. As well as providing the torque to drive the machine the gearbox also acts as a bearing support to support the two logs. They will be supplied in two sizes to match the centres of the logs and the power of the machine.  Renold Gears has supplied gear units to this industry sector for over 20 years and the experience it has gained was a primary reason the company was chosen to provide this solution. The gearboxes were amongst the first to be produced on Renold's Burkhardt + Weber machining center at its factory in Rochdale. "

Power Transmissiom,1 IHS Reports Motion Control Growth Tied to Global Machinery Production,Motion Control, http://www.powertransmission.com/news/7314/IHS-Reports-Motion-Control-Growth-Tied-to-Global-Machinery-Production/,"  Following a sound 8.4 percent revenue growth in 2014, the global market for motion control hardware suffered strong headwinds and declined by 10.6 percent in 2015, with estimated $10.4 billion revenues, according to the latest research from the IHS Motion Controls Intelligence Service. The motion controls market includes the following products: general motion control (GMC) and computer numerical control (CNC) servo motors, servo drives, and position control hardware. European and Japanese suppliers dominated the global motion control market, holding nine out of the top 11 market shares. They were profoundly affected by currency depreciation against the U.S. dollar in 2015. Though weak currency favored exports, by improving pricing competitiveness to some extent, euro and Japanese yen devalued significantly against the U.S. dollar. This devaluation led to considerable revenue loss in the motion-control markets in Europe and Japan, which respectively fell 13.7 percent and 10.8 percent in 2015.   The market for, and investment in, motion controls in 2016 is expected to be continuously constrained by various economic, geopolitical and political concerns, including the unfavorable economic climate in emerging economies. Other concerns include China’s ongoing economic slowdown, stagnant commodity prices, the migration crisis in Europe and the U.S. presidential election.  The European market is forecast to lead market growth in 2016, as the region’s economic climate improves; however, Asian and American markets are expected to overtake the growth momentum from the European market by 2020. Overall, Europe, Middle East and Africa (EMEA) is projected to remain the largest regional market for motion controls, with nearly $4.8 billion in revenue, including software and services in 2020.   The growth of the motion control market is largely dependent on global machinery production. Machine tools remained the largest industry sector for motion controls, reaching $4.2 billion in 2015, which accounts for nearly half (42 percent) of total revenue. However, this sector suffered a severe decline in 2015, particularly in China and the United States, which are leading national markets for machine tools.  As the sector represented 80 percent of computer numerical control (CNC) hardware revenues, the sluggish machine tools sector struck the CNC market with a 14.8 percent contraction. This sector continues to experience short-term growth pressure, due to weak demand in China and the United States; therefore, revenue for motion controls in machine tools is forecast to grow at a low CAGR of 1.9 percent from 2015 to 2020.   Motion controls, which are core components in the robotics industry, are expected to benefit greatly from the global robotics boom. In fact, motion-control revenue from the robotics sector will grow the fastest at 12.6 percent CAGR, from 2015 to 2020; as a result, this sector is predicted to account for 9.6 percent of all motion control revenues in 2020.

The smaller AC Motors segment grew the fastest at 24.3 percent to $34.3m.” Individually, the fourth quarter of 2016 also increased on a year over year basis by 15.3 percent to $841.7 million. Growth rates were positive in each product category MCMA tracks. MCMA summarizes market results from suppliers and distributors in quarterly tracking reports and trend analysis reports. These reports examine orders and shipments by major product category quarterly and annually with helpful tables and graphics. Growth rates and book to bill ratios are provided for each product category.

Power Transmissiom,23 Rockwell Automation Enables CIP Networking in Motion Control Applications,Motion Control, http://www.powertransmission.com/news/933/Rockwell-Automation-Enables-CIP-Networking-in-Motion-Control-Applications/,"  March 2, 2007—Rockwell Automation can now demonstrate how manufacturers can use standard Ethernet and the Common Industrial Protocol (CIP) networking standards for motion control and other demanding applications. The CIP protocol, the upper-layer protocol for DeviceNet, ControlNet and EtherNet/IP networks,can solve advanced communication and integration challenges for many applications.   ""Many manufacturers choose CIP networks to create a seamless flow of information, from the smallest device up through the enterprise business system,"" explains Paul Brooks, European product marketing manager, Rockwell Automation.  ""With CIP Motion, the advantages of CIP and Ethernet now extend to multi-axis coordinated motion control applications, further improving machine synchronisation and information flow, reducing installation costs and increasing productivity.""   CIP Motion is a strategic initiative from the Open DeviceNet Vendor Association (ODVA) that is creating a distributed motion control solution using only EtherNet/IP, and includes controller-to-controller and controller-to-drive connectivity. This approach will provide high performance axis-to-axis synchronisation with clock synchronisation jitter of +/-100 nanoseconds, a flat network architecture using standard unmodified Ethernet and a common configuration and programming environment.    Concept demonstrations for CIP Motion have settled the question of whether the open, standard design of EtherNet/IP can be used for all application types, including the most demanding motion and drive applications. Rockwell Automation has demonstrated servo drive control with +/-100 nanoseconds jitter, sharing the network bandwidth with both traditional automation and commercial 'office' style devices using standard, off-the-shelf Ethernet switches.   ""The beauty of CIP is its simplicity,"" Brooks concludes. ""With CIP, manufacturers save time with no special configurations to the networks. Information on a network is not abridged or upended in the configuration; it goes to the right place right away. Because it is cost effective and requires less programming and wiring time than other networks, CIP offers an attractive solution today as well as into the future.""   "

Power Transmissiom,31 Zoller to Demonstrate Siemens Motion Control at IMTS,Motion Control, http://www.powertransmission.com/news/2596/Zoller-to-Demonstrate-Siemens-Motion-Control-at-IMTS/,"  During IMTS, Zoller Inc., a provider of tool presetters and tool management software based in Pforzheim, Germany and Ann Arbor, MI, will have a Sinumerik 840Di CNC in its booth, pre-loaded with the Siemens Motion Control Information System (MCIS). One module of MCIS is its Tool Data Information (TDI) suite. Siemens makes useful and immediately-accessible information about tool status available to machine tool and presetter programmers, operators and production managers alike, through MCIS. Having such data can be extremely helpful in organizing tool strategies in production departments and small job shops and, owing to the predictable patterns of wear on various types of tooling, Siemens has incorporated a library of such information into the TDI suite. Offered to customers as a standard solution, Zoller has written an interface to connect TDI to the company's presetter, enabling data to be brought directly into the Siemens numerical control. Zoller boasts accuracy on its presetters to two thousandths of a millimeter (0.002 mm) or less than eight millionths of an inch (0.00008 in). By utilizing TDI and a Zoller presetter, a machine tool end-user benefits in many ways, including faster access to tool data with no manual entry of values required.  All tool data are transferred to the CNC by an automatic link in the presetter, resulting in significant cost-, time- and operator action savings. In addition, the user develops an increased understanding of tool life and tool wear patterns on various operations in the shop.  The Zoller presetter writes data directly onto an RFID chip, making transfer to TDI onboard the Siemens CNC is simple and easy.  Lastly, an end-user can maintain a central server that indicates the location of any tool in the shop or factory, as well as track the status of the next tool needed to perform an upcoming operation. To see the demonstration, please visit the Zoller booth at IMTS, booth W-2022.   "

Current solutions used in production of off-highway vehicles rely upon large, heavy and inefficient brushed DC or induction motors, coupled to a planetary gearbox. This presents a number of challenges to the vehicle designers such as: limited vehicle range, limited space around the motor/drivetrain, and motor durability. The proposed integrated system utilizes an Oerlikon Fairfield Torque Hub, widely used in off-highway vehicles, and the Ashwoods first-to-market, interior permanent magnet motor. How these products are integrated, i.e. incorporating a brake solution, represents a market-changing product. Using interior permanent magnet (IPM) technology in the motor design means the motor can be up to 70% lighter, 70% smaller and 20% more efficient than traditional motors used in off-highway traction applications."

Power Transmissiom,21 NSK Bearings in Electric Motors,Motors, http://www.powertransmission.com/news/6266/NSK-Bearings-in-Electric-Motors/,"  NSK Europe's Tony Synnott explains how bearing design is affecting electric motor performance and reliability. As the development of more efficient electric motors continues to keep pace with upcoming regulations, it is important to ensure that all the components are engineered to the latest specifications, including the bearings. Tony Synnott, UK Engineering Manager for NSK Europe, explains how bearing design is affecting electric motor performance and reliability. Bearings in electric motors are designed to support the rotor and maintain a consistent air gap between the rotor and the stator as well as transferring the loads from the shaft to the motor frame. Selecting the correct bearing design ensures the design efficiency of the motor is maintained with minimal friction and power losses. For a small electric motor, a bearing failure and any subsequent damage can put it beyond economical repair, so it is desirable to install high quality bearings that are designed to withstand the stresses of the environment. In larger applications, a bearing failure can cause considerable down-time, so matching the design to the application is crucial. For example, if a motor designed for an in-line drive application is reassigned to a radial, belt-drive application, the bearings are likely to be compromised and not perform as might be expected. In the original, specified application, the motor would be fitted with deep-groove ball bearings but these could be overloaded by the increased radial load from the drive belt. In terms of bearing design itself, there has been considerable innovation in terms of bearing materials technology as well as precision engineering and manufacturing processes. By improving the surface finish of the rolling elements and raceways within a bearing, the friction levels are reduced, which reduces energy consumption and noise. When these improvements are combined with the advances in lubrication, the result is a much improved operating life. One such example is the latest AC traction motors that are being used in the current generation of high speed trains, which are now expected to go faster and travel much further between maintenance periods. The bearings employed in these motors are expected to deliver exceptional performance under severe operating conditions, including high radial loads, high impact loads and high speeds. A major obstacle to achieving extended maintenance free intervals is electrical erosion. This occurs when ‘stray’ electric current flows through the motor bearings to earth. The result is damage to the bearing, the extent of which depends upon the magnitude of the current and the duration of the conditions. The damage, known as electrical arcing, is usually in the form of tiny craters and micro welds on the bearing raceway and rolling element surfaces, which results in premature bearing failure. One solution to the electrical arcing failures is the use of ceramic coatings or ceramic rolling elements in the bearing design, which provide electrical insulation from the shaft. Ceramic coatings are often applied using a plasma spray. The ceramic coating is treated with an acrylic resin to seal the surface and prevent the ingress of moisture. This coating also provides additional protection against strong alkalis and high temperatures used for washing the rolling stock. The life time of a bearing, assuming it has been correctly specified for the application, is often determined by the lubrication regime and how the bearing design ensures sufficient flow to all the rolling elements. Finite element analysis and computational fluid dynamics can be used to improve bearing strength and the flow of lubrication, both of which need to be carefully specified for each application. The maintenance programme also plays a role in bearing life expectancy and should take into account the working environment and the practicalities of access to the equipment. By improving the sealing arrangements and optimising the lubrication technique, the maintenance period can be extended to coincide with other components such as the wheelset bearings. This offers the client considerable savings in maintenance costs and lost productivity. The key to optimising bearing design is in understanding the application and the environment, whilst having the ability to employ industry leading materials and quality control. NSK has developed the unique, long life Z Steel which has significantly extended the service life of its bearings when compared to conventional bearing steel. This has been combined with improved cage designs lubrication and seal designs, as well as ceramic and resin coatings. The end result is high quality bearings that are produced for the electric motor in all environments and applications. "

Power Transmissiom,27 Dunkermotor Releases Linear Motors and Actuators Catalog,Motors, http://www.powertransmission.com/news/4056/Dunkermotor-Releases-Linear-Motors-and-Actuators-Catalog/,"  ServoTubes can be utilized in packaging, automation and specialty machinery applications.  Dunkermotor, now part of Ametek Precision Motion Control, has released its first ServoTube linear motors and actuators catalog with technical specifications and drawings that cover 1,346 standard product configurations of tubular linear motors, actuators, modules, components and gantries. With their high speed, acceleration and precision, coupled with very low noise, easy installation and no maintenance design, ServoTubes can be utilized in packaging, automation and specialty machinery applications. The stainless steel washdown models are designed for use in food processing, pharmaceutical and medical applications. Comprised of just two parts, a rod and a forcer, the ServoTube linear motor is inherently simple and elegant. The stainless steel rod is filled with rare-earth magnets and the forcer incorporates a series of coils energized as three-phase windings. The forcer coil magnetic field interacts with the rod magnetic field, generating linear force. In the unique ServoTube design, the magnetic forces are balanced, and motion is smooth and cogging-free as opposed to flat-bed linear motors. The ServoTube forcer coils optimize use of the magnetic field and feature a built-in heat sink that offers improved thermal efficiency over conventional U-channel linear motors. The Dunkermotor linear product line is based on three shaft diameters: 11, 25 and 38 mm (0.433, 0.984 and 1.496 in.) The compact ServoTube motors offer peak force up to 1860 N (418 lbs.), with continuous force to 293 N (65.8 lbs.) A water-cooled option on the stainless steel hygienic washdown version increases continuous force to 498 N (111.9 lbs.) Maximum speed is 9.3 m/s (366 in./sec.) with acceleration up to 586 m/s2 (59.75 g). Stroke lengths range from 14 to 1751 mm (0.55 to 68.93 in.) The speed and dynamic response of the ServoTube offers significantly increased throughput over ballscrew drives and the food-safe internal dry bearings built into the tubular actuators have a rated lifetime ten times that of a ballscrew. The non-contact construction of the ServoTube is maintenance-free and disperses no lubricants. Its direct drive simplicity eliminates couplings, belts, pulleys and gearboxes; thereby minimizing machine footprint, eliminating downtime and reducing cost of ownership. ""Traditional linear motors require a costly linear encoder, necessitating careful alignment during installation. With the ServoTube linear motor's sinusoidal magnetic field design, Hall sensors in the forcer can provide position information with repeatability of 12 microns, thereby eliminating the need for a linear encoder,"" notes Will Vinson, Dunkermotoren USA president. ""Compared to other tubular linear motors, the ServoTube is unique in that it develops a very constant force, which provides a number of benefits in terms of the quality of motion as well as an ease in tuning, all while not requiring proprietary drive electronics.""

Power Transmissiom,129 Otto Motors Releases Otto Industrial API,Motors, http://www.powertransmission.com/news/8786/Otto-Motors-Releases-Otto-Industrial-API/,"   The Industrial API addresses the challenge of machine-to-machine communication and full industrial automation by simplifying the process of connecting equipment and programmable logic controllers (PLCs) to Otto. Otto Motors is proud to officially release the Otto Industrial API, solving one of the major hurdles in manufacturing today: achieving a fully connected and optimized smart factory. The Industrial API addresses the challenge of machine-to-machine communication and full industrial automation by simplifying the process of connecting equipment and programmable logic controllers (PLCs) to Otto.  “Otto Motors is really setting the bar high for system accessibility and ease of integration in their market. This new API allows Ignition to seamlessly access the data as OPC tags and integrate them with our built-in components and scripting,” said Don Pearson, chief strategy officer, inductive automation. “We are excited to see how this API can remove connectivity barriers that have prevented some people from utilizing self-driving vehicles in the past.” As a collaborating company with Inductive Automation, Otto Motors integrated Ignition software as part of the Industrial API architecture. Ignition is a software platform with a feature set that include the translation of different protocols to the ones needed to speak to PLCs within manufacturing environments; therefore, contributing to a closed loop automation system. “The industry has long struggled with the challenge of connecting industrial machines built by different companies,” explains Simon Drexler, director of product, Otto Motors. “Pieces of equipment from the same company generally communicate easily with each other but creating a connection that enables data to be exchanged across products from different vendors can be complicated, costly, and time consuming - and sometimes impossible. This problem is, at best, a barrier to attaining the benefits of a smart factory that many companies aspire to. At worst, it’s a severe limitation on productivity.” Available now, the Otto Industrial API connects self-driving vehicles to existing automation systems and processes, providing faster integration of Otto with robust and standardized integrations with industry-standard software and protocols.

Power Transmissiom,131 IS23x-MA Intelligent Step Motors Suited for Multi-Axis Applications,Motors, http://www.powertransmission.com/news/1824/IS23x-MA-Intelligent-Step-Motors-Suited-for-Multi-Axis-Applications/,"  Technosoft announces the IS23x-MA Intelligent Step Motors, based on the MotionChip DSP Control Technology and specially adapted to distributed motion control applications with integrated intelligence.    These ready-to-run motors have a cost optimized design embedding stepper motor, power electronics, controller and interface into a single compact unit (61 ÷ 96 x 57 x 57 mm), together with basic local digital and analog I/O signals and PLC functionalities. This structure significantly reduces the motor cabling through the machine and eliminates the usage of external setup analog components.    IS23x-MA have been developed in two motor lengths, offering 1 to 1.8 Nm permanent output torque and operated from a 12 to 48 V single power supply. High-resolution settings to the equivalent of up to 256 microsteps/step can be used.    The motion programming can be done from a CAN/CANopen master via PC/PLC, either by using the appropriate motion library, or directly at motor level, using the built-in motion controller and the EasyMotion Studio platform. This greatly simplifies the master’s task: motion functions pre-stored in the motor memory can be called or executed via I/O signals.   IS23x are fully programmable to execute position or speed control. They include high-level trajectory generators for: profiles (S-curve, trapezoidal or PVT), contouring, electronic gearing and camming. Communication is done over CAN (CANopen/TMLCAN) or RS-232 networks.   For an off-the-shelf usage, the IS23x-DS motors (already configured to cover the usual operation modes and parameters) are available. Compactness, embedded intelligence and cost-effective design make the IS23x a valuable motion control solution for all industrial applications where space is critical and the machines need to look neat and uncluttered. Thanks to the IS23x’s local intelligence, users can simplify complex applications by distributing the intelligence between master and motors. Thus, instead of trying to command each step of an axis motion from the master, they can program the motors using TML to execute complex tasks and inform the master when these tasks have been completed.

Power Transmissiom,133 Drake Motorsports Development Introduces High Performance Polymer Parts,Motors, http://www.powertransmission.com/news/8808/Drake-Motorsports-Development-Introduces-High-Performance-Polymer-Parts/,"  Torlon Offset Upper Control Arm Bushings by Drake Motorsports Development.  Drake Motorsports Development, LLC was recently formed to accelerate the availability of track proven race parts and to continually develop new racing products from a racing industry insider perspective. The first part developed is an offset control arm bushing machined from Torlon 4435. The bushing delivers an increased static negative camber range of adjustment for the front wheels, which is used as a suspension tuning method to optimize tire contact under high lateral loads. Tyler Quance, owner of Drake Motorsports Development, and the engineering manager for Drake Plastics, has been racing a Spec Miata with a set of these bushings since mid-2017. During this time, the bushings have shown no measured wear. The bushing material is self-lubricated and requires no grease, making a totally maintenance-free, non-consumable part which is intended to last as long as the racecar.  The bushing was designed in collaboration with Chris Haldeman and X-Factor Racing of Princeton, Texas. This collaboration resulted in a decision to supply the bushings already installed in control arms with a steel anti-rotation dowel pin to ensure each bushing stays in place under demanding race conditions, and to finish ream the offset hole after installation for a precision fit with the steel inner sleeve. This process saves the customer a great deal of time and hassle during installation and ensures the bushing set is aligned to deliver maximum available front wheel camber in a ready-to-bolt-on assembly. The extreme wear resistance and excellent lubricity of Torlon 4435 provides the combination of improved performance and improved part life. This grade and suspension bushing application supplied previously by Drake Plastics, has a pedigree with the Risi Competizione Ferrari race team.  Now that Drake Motorsports Development is assembled to expand the accessibility of Torlon 4435 bushings as performance aftermarket parts, Torlon is poised to obsolete traditional bushing materials in higher-end performance and racing applications. According to Quance, “once drivers and race prep shops try Drake Motorsports Development’s Torlon 4435 suspension bushings, I expect they will want to use them exclusively.” The second part launched by Drake Motorsports is a high-performance polymer transmission shift bushing machined from Torlon 7130. Prototypes were run in 3 different cars for the NASA Spec Miata Eastern States Championships at Sebring in September 2017 with excellent results. According to Bret Synder, lead crew member for Drake Racing and driver himself, “the shift bushing is almost a forgotten part until it becomes a problem from excessive wear or breakage.” The thermoplastic bushing maintains the impact-absorbing characteristics of the OEM Mazda bushing other aftermarket metal replacements cannot. This means internal gearbox components remain isolated from severe hard-shifting impact as designed by Mazda. Torlon 7130 is one of the strongest and most durable polymers making what is generally accepted to be a consumable part one which now lasts indefinitely. "

Power Transmissiom,143 BEI Kimco's Brushless Motors Meet Centrifuge Requirements ,Motors, http://www.powertransmission.com/news/7626/BEI-Kimcos-Brushless-Motors-Meet-Centrifuge-Requirements-/,"  BEI Kimco was challenged to develop motors that would deliver the high speeds needed for two centrifuge manufacturers, while at the same time provide quiet operation and maintenance-free performance.  BEI Kimco has met the high performance motor requirements for laboratory centrifuge machines. Centrifuges are used in biology, chemistry and hospital labs to rapidly spin and separate liquid samples into layers for analysis. These machines have varying requirements in motor functionality and size, as well as speeds that can range from just a few thousand rpm to higher than 50,000 rpm. BEI Kimco was challenged to develop motors that would deliver the high speeds needed for two centrifuge manufacturers, while at the same time provide quiet operation and maintenance-free performance.   BEI Kimco developed Brushless DC (BLDC) motors DIT11-15 and DIH40-49 to meet the necessary specifications of the individual centrifuges including operating speeds approaching 25,000 rpm. While the DIT11-15 motor delivers relatively moderate torque levels of 3.0 oz-in given its small size (1.1"" in diameter x 1.28"" in axial length), it does incorporate integral drive electronics for a more simplified external control scheme. In contrast, the robust DIH40-49 design is capable of power levels approaching 500 watts in a size of 4.0"" in diameter x 4.9"" in axial length.  These two brushless motors provide impressive low noise characteristics that are achieved through precision rotor system design methodologies and bearing selection.     ""While the maximum speed and power levels of these motors are notable, their ability to sustain the rated performance over the life of the centrifuge was equally important in meeting customer requirements,"" says Walter Smith, applications engineer. ""Similar BEI Kimco motor technology has been used for several leading manufacturers of medical, laboratory and industrial equipment.""  "

Power Transmissiom,147 Infolytica Corporation Releases MotorSolve v5,Motors, http://www.powertransmission.com/news/6346/Infolytica-Corporation-Releases-MotorSolve-v5/,"  Engineers and designers of electric machines have a revamped and more intuitive modeling environment to use when performing motor simulations and analysis as of today with the release of MotorSolve version 5. Major additions to the software also enhance the charts and field data available to users. Here are just some of the highlights available. MotorSolve is among the most easy to use design software of its kind. Version 5 raises the bar of user friendliness by introducing a number of changes – both requested by users and created by Infolytica – to the interface and modeling engine to make it easier and faster. Using MotorSolve is simple and foolproof: after a thorough review of each motor template, design parameters have been renamed (to follow the latest standard terminology) and simplified in terms of geometrical options. The variational geometry engine, which gives MotorSolve the flexibility and power to handle virtually any motor design within these templates, has also been improved by being more responsive and providing more feedback to the designer by doing a best fit of dimensions for invalid geometries. The user interface in MotorSolve 5 is much more responsive: setting values for the parameters, display updates, and in general all user interface operations are much faster. MotorSolve v5 also includes a new motor efficiency map which automatically plots the efficiency at different operating points. It can be based on a quick linear approximation or accurate nonlinear computation. Surface force density plot has also been added to the result information available. Other analysis tools such as arrow plots to show data superimposed on the motor template – such as the flow and magnitude of the current in the coils, has been added. The same scripting capability that is used in our MagNet software which makes customization, batching and optimization possible, is now implemented in MotorSolve. Using scripting, all MotorSolve commands can be accessed through APIs, callable from any programming language, e.g. Visual Basic, or any application, e.g. Microsoft Excel, that is ActiveX compliant. It is possible to run MotorSolve as an engine, by invoking the module from the outside, in a script. "

If four-quadrant digital speed control is desired, the control can be commanded to run in either direction, stop and hold with torque or stop without torque (coast) through digital inputs. Other inputs can switch between programmed speeds or allow for a variable analog speed reference.  Accel/decel ramps for the motor also can be programmed. The control offers the capability for a motor to function as a stand-alone or programmed servo, which interfaces to the rest of the machine via digital and analog IO. The BGE Series electronic controllers offer different modes of operation to choose from, such as analog or digital torque control, analog or digital speed control and digitally selectable position control (relative, absolute, and modulo). The controls incorporate protection against over-voltage, low voltage and excessive temperature. Designed for volume OEM applications, BGE Series electronic controllers offer a design alternative for restricted space applications where the additional length of an integral control motor may not be feasible. They also can be encapsulated to provide additional protection in extreme environmental conditions. If only speed control is required for an application, the BGE 3004A, a cost-optimized one-quadrant controller, is available.  BGE controllers are available from stock at the Pittman Express E-Commerce store.  343 Godshall Dr, Harleysville, PA 19438"

Power Transmissiom,161 Pittman Motors PBL4850E Programmable Three-Phase Brushless Motor Drive Added to IDEA Drive Line,Motors, http://www.powertransmission.com/news/6817/Pittman-Motors-PBL4850E-Programmable-Three-Phase-Brushless-Motor-Drive-Added-to-IDEA-Drive-Line/,"  Pittman\'s PBL4850E is the newest addition to their IDEA drive line of motor controllers. Pittman Motors has announced the latest addition to its IDEA drive line of motor controllers: the PBL4850E programmable three-phase brushless motor drive. With the PBL 4850E, Pittman motor users can create distributed stand-alone complex motion profiles intuitively and quickly, eliminating the need for additional motion control components such as programmable logic controllers or field communication buses. Among the graphical user interface’s features is automatic population of motion profile parameters based on the entry of a few motor characteristics. Complex motor parameter calculations or in-depth knowledge of the motor specifications are not required for proper operation. Furthermore, Pittman IDEA software allows the user to program motors through the use of on-screen buttons instead of command sets or programming languages. The PBL4850E is a four-quadrant brushless controller that utilizes sinusoidal commutation to produce smooth motion. The torque produced by sinusoidal commutation minimizes torque ripple. The drive further refines motion by incorporating two motion profiles: trapezoidal and s-curve. The latter may be used to eliminate jerk due to rapid changes in velocity rates during motion. The drive offers programmable current control of up to 5.6A peak with an optional current boost during ramping of up to 6.5A peak. With an input voltage of 12-48VDC, the drive can accommodate a wide range of brushless motors. Hall cell signals are used for phase initialization and an encoder provides positional feedback.  Other features include eight opto-isolated general purpose inputs and outputs.  Each input is rated for 5 to 24 VDC, 8 mA maximum per input. The outputs are open collector, 5 to 24 VDC, 200 mA maximum per output.  The PBL4850E IDEA drive communicates via a USB to mini USB.  The IDEA software is configurable with numerous programming units to provide versatility in creating programs with the PBL4850E drive. Selecting units of revolutions creates a platform for users to generate complex velocity motion profiles geared towards rotary-based applications. Selecting units of inches or millimeters simplifies programming within a linear-based setup by allowing users to program with native units within the system to generate motion profiles.  Real-time and programmable methods of operation make the drives ideal for prototyping and integration into systems. Users can instantly witness motion when sending commands directly to the drive via the USB interface. This allows users to easily send motion profiles with varying parameters to determine torque and speed limitations under load during design. The drive also is well suited for integrating into systems because it can store a wide range of complex motion programs into memory and is capable of executing them independently without a connection to a computer or communication bus.  The IDEA software allows system designers to easily troubleshoot programs using line-by-line or multiple line program execution and an interactive debug feature. Inputs and outputs can be simulated using the software before connecting actual I/O hardware. Driving brushless motors has never been easier. The IDEA Drive is also designed to operate the broad range of new ECO series of brushless motors offered by Pittman. The motor line spans a wide variety of DC motor sizes and technologies, ranging from 10 mm-diameter brushless DC motors used in high-speed medical applications to large, NEMA frame DC servo motors used in sophisticated automation equipment.  343 Godshall Dr  Harleysville, PA 19438"

Power Transmissiom,167 Lenze AC Motors Reduce Energy Consumption,Motors, http://www.powertransmission.com/news/3356/Lenze-AC-Motors-Reduce-Energy-Consumption/,"  The new Lenze IE2 L-force three-phase asynchronous (AC) motors meet or exceed global regulations aimed at reducing energy consumption.  Lenze Americas, a global manufacturer of electrical and mechanical drives, motion control and automation technology, has introduced to the market the MH Series of high efficiency motors rated at 80 to 92 percent efficiency. The new Lenze IE2 L-force three-phase asynchronous (AC) motors meet or exceed global regulations aimed at reducing energy consumption, while improving overall drive system performance. ""Energy consumption in drive systems is a major cost factor, especially in material handling applications with long running times, acceleration and lifting operations,"" states Wayne Lazzerini, mechanical product manager at Lenze Americas. ""The MH series of motors, especially when combined with the right transmission, allow users to improve efficiency and significantly reduce energy usage-gaining efficiencies and increasing savings for Lenze customers."" The IEC 60034-30 standard, Rotating electrical machines - Part 30: Efficiency classes of single-speed, three-phase cage induction motors, specifies the international efficiency (IE) codes for induction motors.  In an effort to harmonize global efficiency levels, changes have been made to IE values to ensure consistency with international values.  Beginning June 2011, the EuP (European Parliament) has mandated that electric motors in continuous operation with a power of 0.75 to 375 kW must be in efficiency Class IE2 or higher.  For example, in round figures, the minimum efficiency for a 7.5 kW motor is 85 percent at IE1 and 88 percent at IE2. ""Lenze high efficiency MH asynchronous motors operate within energy efficiency Classes IE1 and now IE2 for future compliance. Supplied in power ranges up to 45 kW, customers can count on right sizing, not oversizing, by selecting precisely the functional range desired for the application from this new range of well-designed L-force three-phase motors,"" adds Lazzerini.

Power Transmissiom,169 Maxon Motors Launch into Outer Space,Motors, http://www.powertransmission.com/news/3927/Maxon-Motors-Launch-into-Outer-Space/,"  For the power supply, the solar arrays of the Dragon capsule are oriented towards the sun by Maxon motors. The flawless launch of the SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket on May 22, 2012 is another successful step for Maxon Motor AG in the use of high precision motors in the astronautics industry. The crucial tasks of the Maxon motors in the SpaceX mission included orienting the solar arrays of the Dragon spacecraft towards the sun to provide the power supply. The first private cargo capsule in the history of space travel was launched into space on May 22, 2012 from the Cape Canaveral Air Force Station in Florida. The voyage of the unmanned ""Dragon"" spacecraft, developed by the Californian company SpaceX, was a historical event for all involved. Never before has a private company developed a combined spacecraft and launch system that is capable of undertaking an orbital rendezvous and then returning to earth. Maxon brushless motors were used on the voyage to the ISS to rotate the solar arrays to keep them aligned with the sun as Dragon orbited the earth, open the instrument bay door which contains navigation equipment, and lock in place the fixture that allows Dragon to be grappled by the space station's robotic arm. On May 25, 2012, astronaut Donald Pettit successfully used the 17.6 meter robotic arm of the ISS to grapple the Dragon and guide it to the docking point on the space station. The 4.4 meter tall Dragon spacecraft supplied 520 kg (1146 pounds) of scientific equipment and food to the ISS. On May 31, the six ton capsule detached from the ISS and splashed down under parachutes in the Pacific Ocean off the coast of California on the same day. The capsule was returning 660 kg (1455 pounds) of material from the ISS. Now that NASA has phased out its space shuttle program, the Dragon is the only means of transporting such large quantities of material back to earth. The Maxon team has been working on the SpaceX motor project for the last year. This is a milestone in the history of Maxon, and the story isn't over yet, as NASA has contracted with SpaceX for another twelve flights to the ISS. In a few years, the spacecraft will carry seven astronauts to the international space station.    "

Mesys AG will present its new version of shaft and bearing analysis software in Hall 25, Stand A21 at Hannover Messe. The bearing analysis software allows the calculation of bearing load distribution and bearing life according ISO/TS 16281 and is integrated in a shaft system calculation with additional possibilities like strength calculation for shafts, modal analysis and interfaces to gear calculation programs. Mesys AG can now do a variation of clearance within bearing tolerances, consider misalignment of one bearing up to 0.1mm and use a tolerance for loading. For all cases a normal distribution is used with three times standard deviation fitting into the tolerance field. The number of calculations can be specified by the user. A first insight is already possible with a smaller number of calculations, but for nice-looking curves several thousand calculations are needed. The probability for the results of basic reference life were calculated with 20,000 load cases, which took about 12 minutes on a standard desktop computer. For the initial calculation the maxima of the curves are close to each other, but the variance for the roller bearing B2 is much larger. The reason is the misalignment of the shaft, which has a larger influence on the roller bearing. The report will also show minimum, maximum, mean value and standard deviation for each selected result. The default version of parameter variation is helpful to visualize the influence of one parameter on one or multiple results. The statistical version can be used if the influence of multiple uncertainties should be evaluated. Instead of manually checking multiple parameters an automatic calculation of the whole ranges can be done. In order to understand the reasons behind the results it will still be necessary to carry out additional evaluations, but the software shows the ranges of results that have to be expected. In addition to the shaft and rolling bearing calculation software a new calculation of load distribution for ball screws is available now. Life is calculated from load distribution analogously to ISO/TS 16281. This allows the consideration of radial and moment loads in addition to axial loads. As in the other programs, an automatic parameter variation is available as well.  Technoparkstrasse 1 CH-8005 Zürich"

Power Transmissiom,9 Lenze Announces Reusable Robotics Software Modules for its FAST Application Toolbox,Software, http://www.powertransmission.com/news/6389/Lenze-Announces-Reusable-Robotics-Software-Modules-for-its-FAST-Application-Toolbox/,"  Lenze's standardized and reusable robotics software module to its FAST application toolbox. Lenze recently announced standardized and reusable robotics software modules as a supplement to its FAST application toolbox for automation and control designs. Using the complete robotic modules from Lenze FAST, mechanical engineers can quickly integrate kinematics into machines tailored to specific material handling tasks. “Robotics requires kinematics and path planning. By blending expertise in robotics and motion control, Lenze FAST robotics modules eliminate requirements for proprietary systems and complex interface programming for path planning,” said Craig Dahlquist, automation team leader, Lenze. The new robotics software modules make it easy to integrate robots into an overall automation system and control them accordingly during operation of equipment. The geometric calculation of the robot, the kinematic model, is integrated with a universal method of coordinate transformation developed by Lenze in partnership with universities. Featuring a robotics core offering six degrees of movement, the integrated software ensures maximum freedom. The Lenze modules utilize PLCopen Part 4 specifications for path planning, which enables implementation of functionalities such as Buffer Mode, Blending, Look-Ahead, and motion smoothing commands. The robotics core supports other standard motion commands: linear, circular, spline and point-to-point. Parameterization enables the efficient execution of pick-and-place and other customized movements, without requiring previous knowledge of robotics. The robot is not instructed how to move until the kinematic model has been assigned to the motion producing modules. So, the path can be planned independently of the kinematics. Reprogramming is unnecessary if kinematics change; only relevant parameters need to be entered. Lenze offers integrated kinematic modules for Delta2, Delta3, buckling arm and SCARA robots, in addition to modules for different types of gantry robots. In addition to six main axes, auxiliary axes can be programmed, which makes for easier implementation of speed-dependent processes, such as glue application, welding-head guidance, tool operation, and synchronization of a robot to a conveyor belt (i.e., for the purpose of grasping moving objects). A visualization system for testing purposes is provided in the Lenze PLC Designer for every FAST technology module. “Customers need work-arounds to reduce complexity and expedite time to market for machines. Thanks to FAST robotic modules, a pick-and-place or any complex movement is as easy to position as a single-axis movement task,” adds Dahlquist. "

Power Transmissiom,21 GWJ Technology Releases Latest Version of GearEngineer Software,Software, http://www.powertransmission.com/news/9130/GWJ-Technology-Releases-Latest-Version-of-GearEngineer-Software/,"  The calculation of the 3D gear tooth form of true herringbone gears is the highlight of the new GearEngineer version. GearEngineer is a software program designed for calculating the real 3D tooth form in addition to the dimensioning and load capacity of cylindrical and bevel gears. GearEngineer calculates the gear tooth form based on a mathematical simulation of the manufacturing process analogous to traditional manufacturing on gear cutting machines. This geometry provides the basis to manufacture cylindrical and bevel gears in conjunction with multi-axis machining centers. The new version was introduced for the first time at AMB 2018 to a wide audience and comes with a number of new functions. All calculation modules now include two unit systems: the metric system and the U.S. customary unit system. The user can quickly switch between the units. Gear qualities according to ISO 1328 and ANSI/AGMA 2015 for cylindrical gears are now integrated. In addition to the load capacity calculation in accordance with DIN 3990 and ISO 6336 Method B, the ANSI/AGMA 2101 standard was also added. The user can work with a tip radius instead of the addendum chamfer for cylindrical gears. The definition of basic rack profiles for external cylindrical gear pairs was supplemented by the semi topping flank and topping. Using the definition of the semi topping flank, the corresponding hobs can then be specified, and they generate an addendum chamfer or tip relief during the gear hobbing process. The calculation of the 3D gear tooth form of true herringbone gears is the highlight of the new GearEngineer version. True herringbone gears are two connected helical gears but they do not have a gap separating the two helical faces. There is a rounded connection between the two halves. The tooth geometry including the rounding process of herringbone gears is very complex but can be calculated and generated by using GearEngineer. The complete flank and root geometry can now be created automatically for the manufacturing of herringbone gears and used for further CAM programming. This opens completely new perspectives for the manufacturing of herringbone gears on multi-axis machine centers instead of using obsolete Sykes machines. Whereas, previously soft machining was usual, today it is possible to use the hard machining process for manufacturing herringbone gears. "

Power Transmissiom,35 KISSsoft and Geartech Jointly Develop New Software Program,Software, http://www.powertransmission.com/news/757/KISSsoft-and-Geartech-Jointly-Develop-New-Software-Program/,"  January 19, 2006— KISSsoft AG and GEARTECH Software are pleased to announce the introduction of a new and updated version of GEARCALC, a gear design program originally released in 1986. GEARTECH Software has been providing rating programs for spur and helical gears since the 1984 release of AGMA218, the first commercial product to comply with the AGMA standard of the same name. Using techniques introduced by GEARTECH founder Robert Errichello, this program was later updated to include analyses of wear and scuffing probabilities (SCORING+ in 1985) and preliminary sizing routines (GEARCALC in 1986) into one seamless package. GEARCALC requires a minimal input data and prompts the user to input the application, load, material, and heat treatment data for a gearset.   GEARCALC designs maximum-capacity gearsets that have minimum volume and weight.  Profile shift coefficients can be selected to maximize pitting and wear resistance, scuffing resistance or bending strength. AGMA 2001, which replaces AGMA218, rates gears exactly as intended by the American Gear Manufacturers Association Standards:  ""ANSI/AGMA 2001-D04 and ANSI/AGMA 2101-D04, “AMERICAN NATIONAL STANDARD, Fundamental Rating Factors and Calculation Methods for Involute Spur and Helical Gear Teeth.” AGMA 2001 performs the following analyses:  Life Rating – Given the transmitted power and speed, the pitting life and bending fatigue lives are calculated for a single load and speed, or for an entire spectrum of loads and speeds with the resultant lives determined from Miner’s Rule. Power Rating – Given the pinion speed and required design life, the allowable transmitted power based on gear tooth pitting and bending fatigue is calculated for both the pinion and gear.  The allowable power rating of the gearset is the minimum of the four power capacities. AGMA 925, which replaces SCORING+, rates gears exactly as intended by the American Gear Manufacturers Association Information Sheet: AGMA 925-A03, “AGMA Information Sheet, Effect of Lubrication on Gear Surface Distress.” AGMA 925 performs a complete analysis of the tribology of spur and helical gears.  It calculates the EHL film thickness using the Dowson and Toyoda equation and the flash temperature using Blok’s critical temperature theory. AGMA 925 features include: Calculates EHL specific film thickness and probability of wearCalculates total contact temperature and probability of scuffingCalculates rolling, sliding, and entraining velocities, and specific sliding (slide/roll) ratiosCalculates Hertzian contact stressProvides screen and hard-copy plots of specific sliding, Hertzian stress, film thickness, specific film thickness, and contact temperature  Programs GEARCALC, AGMA 2001, and AGMA 925 work together in a seamless integrated system that has been optimized using state-of-the-art technology to simplify gear design and analysis.   The software is available as a stand-alone package, or integrated into the CAD programs Inventor, Solid Edge, SolidWorks and Pro/E.   "

""Right from the start, we focused on developing intelligent components, with products that can properly handle one-off lots while at the same time offering ease of use for operators lacking interdisciplinary skills and easy integration into operational processes. With regard to a self-explanatory, intuitive operator interface for a complex technology, we more or less took our cue from smartphones,"" according to Uwe Weiß, managing partner of the company.The company developed its own application software, Weiss Application Software (WAS), to provide a solution to the requirements for the human-machine interface-an intelligent, Windows-based user interface for generating and configuring motion control programs for all Weiss user-programmable products. In a manner of speaking, the engineering effort normally necessary for integration has already been provided by the software. WAS is beneficial for small and medium-size manufacturers of special-purpose machinery, who up to now have been compelled to outsource the development of control programs due to the absence of in-house expertise in this complex subject. WAS makes it easy for them to set up Weiss' automation components themselves, either by entering paths, angles and ramps directly or by using the handy teach-in mode. WAS also supports large-scale users of Weiss components by helping them to reduce programming effort and thereby reduce the life cycle cost (LCC) of the system.  "

The bearings significantly extend maintenance intervals on compressors used to recover gas vapor. Proven to withstand regular exposure to sour gas and other harsh process gas compressor conditions, the SKF bearings can deliver up to ten times the service life of conventional bearings.“SKF sour gas compressor bearings meet the urgent need to improve efficiency in this kind of compressor. The sour gas compressor bearings will dramatically cut maintenance costs for operators and make a great contribution to the environment by increasing compressor availability and preventing the escape of gas vapour,” says Lars Kahlman, senior application specialist, SKF Global Segment Fluid. Every year, the oil and gas industry “flares”, or ­vents, an estimated 150 billion cubic meters of waste gases.  This emits approximately 400 million tons of CO2, or about 1.2 percent of all annual global CO2 emissions.  Much of this flared gas can now be captured by vapour recovery units or re-injected but because existing compressor bearings wear out and fail in as little as six months, too much gas is going unrecovered while maintenance is carried out. As an example, a compressor equipped with ten SKF bearings of this kind can save up to 670 tonnes of CO2e per year or up to 8000 tonnes during the lifetime of the compressor.The maintenance intervals are minimised by SKF sour gas compressor bearings, which feature several high performance materials, including a new generation of hard, ultraclean, high-nitrogen steel. These bearings offer a high degree of impact toughness, high fatigue resistance and superior corrosion resistance to sour gas (H2S), condensing water and acid gases (CO2) and other agents that cause conventional bearing raceways and rolling elements to flake.

Power Transmissiom,6 Bearings and Balls for Turbine Flow Meters,Bearings,http://www.powertransmission.com/news/2812/Bearings-and-Balls-for-Turbine-Flow-Meters,"The Boca Bearing Company recently announced a new line of ceramic balls, stainless steel bearings, ceramic hybrid bearings and full ceramic bearings for turbine flow meters. Flow meters provide replicable and exact measure of linear, nonlinear or volumetric flow rate of a liquid or a gas. Turbine flow meters, or axial turbines, translate the rotating turbine action around an axis into a readable rate of flow. These types of meters are typically used for oil and gas measurement in pipelines where the density of the fluid depends greatly upon pressure, temperature and the gas composition. To ensure a long life for flow meters it is crucial that the meter has been installed with the proper bearing material depending on the fluid lubricity and operating temperature. Many turbine meter installers prefer ceramic bearings for their superior design and durability. Ceramic bearings are a substantial upgrade over traditional steel bearings for many turbine flow meter environments. Ceramic is a non-porous, glass like surface so it is virtually frictionless and therefore needs very little or no lubrication to operate. Ceramic is also suitable for extremely high or low temperature applications with ranges of -100 degrees C to +900 degrees C. Boca Bearings has a full range of bearings and balls in a variety of materials such as stainless steel, alumina oxide ceramic, silicon nitride ceramic and heavy duty plastics. Many different styles of bearings are also available including radial deep groove bearings, thrust bearings and angular contact bearings. Additionally, bearing configurations can often be tailored to fit each application comprising variations of materials for races, retainers and balls as well as specialty lubrications and coatings.

Typical steel industry applications for these bearings include casters, large electric motors, gearboxes, fans, and others where non-locating bearings must be specified.A Carb bearing (for radial loads only) in the non-locating, or “float” position in combination with a spherical roller bearing (for combined axial and radial loads) in the locating, or “held,” position ultimately can deliver a highly efficient bearing arrangement to eliminate the influence of shaft contraction or expansion due to temperature fluctuations often associated with steel mill applications.Carb bearings integrate design features from several conventional bearing types to realize optimized capabilities and performance.  They can accommodate misalignment (similar to a spherical roller bearing), adjust for axial expansion of a shaft (similar to a cylindrical roller bearing), and maximize load capacity due to long self-guiding rollers (similar to needle roller bearings).All Carb bearings have further been upgraded to the SKF Explorer performance class characterized by high-quality steel and an improved heat treatment process to impart superior hardness and toughness for operation in the most difficult conditions.Carb bearings are offered in a wide range of sizes and can be supplied with specialized seals and cages. Custom designs can be engineered.  SKF "

Power Transmissiom,31 Renold Couplings Ensure Trucks Keep Mining,Couplings,http://www.powertransmission.com/news/3030/Renold-Couplings-Ensure-Trucks-Keep-Mining,"When a large construction and mining company were plagued by the constant failure of the couplings on their underground mine trucks, they turned to Renold Hi-Tec Couplings, of Halifax, England, to provide a long term solution. For many years the company were fitting V type rubber-in-shear couplings between the engine and the gearbox. However, when the coupling failed, the truck was coming to a complete stop, often blocking an important access point. Renold recommended the HTB 4500, rubber-in-compression coupling. Its intrinsically fail safe, maintenance free and has severe shock load protection properties, coupled with a high temperature capability of up to 200 degrees Celsius. A rubber-in-compression coupling was also favored by the company as they can drive metal to metal to move the truck out of the way and continue mining if the rubber blocks disintegrate. This was illustrated when a problem with the oil circulation in the gearbox resulted in the gearbox overheating and destroying the rubber blocks in the coupling, however the truck could still be moved. Further orders will be fulfilled in 2011.  Renold PLC  "

Power Transmissiom,35 Mayr Offers Easy-to-Assemble Shaft Couplings ,Couplings,http://www.powertransmission.com/news/5090/Mayr-Offers-Easy-to-Assemble-Shaft-Couplings,"High screw tightening torques can become a real challenge during installation of large shaft couplings – especially where space is restricted. Mayr power transmission has therefore equipped the ROBA-DS disk pack coupling for high torques with an easy-to-assemble, positive-locking conical connection which operates at extremely low tightening torques. The five construction sizes in this series cover a nominal torque range from 22,000 to 110,000 Nm.The handling of large couplings is hard labour, and should therefore be made as easy as possible for the technicians. Furthermore, ease of assembly for large couplings also represents an economic aspect. Many hours and unnecessary costs can be saved thanks to simple and fast assembly. In the case of the ROBA-DS with a conical connection, the flexible disk pack is connected, positive-locking and backlash-free, with attachment components such as hubs, flanges and sleeves. Externally-conical bolts are pulled into the conically-shaped bores of the attachments using tensioning screws, and the collar bushings of the disk packs are tightened. Due to this conical shape, forces are generated which radially, flexibly expand the collar bushings and attachments, and in this way guarantee the backlash-free connection of the disk pack.Screw tightening torques drastically reducedThe new conical connection reduces the screw tightening torques to a fraction compared to conventional, frictionally locking designs, and this significantly simplifies installation and disassembly. Furthermore, the aggregates do not have to be moved for installation and deinstallation.ROBA-DS disk pack couplings are extremely robust, resistant to high and low temperatures, and are torsionally extremely rigid and maintenance-free. They transmit the torque backlash-free and without wear, and compensate for axial, angular and radial shaft misalignments. On double-jointed designs, this component permits extremely flexible variations in length between the two disk packs for adjustment to the shaft clearance. Disk pack couplings are well-suited to applications with high torques.  Mayr "
Power Transmissiom,39 Ringfeder Offers Permanently Magnetic Couplings,Couplings,http://www.powertransmission.com/news/4574/Ringfeder-Offers-Permanently-Magnetic-Couplings,"Permanently magnetic couplings are becoming increasingly popular among manufacturers as sealing elements in their pumps, filter systems and agitators. Especially when critical media such as acids and alkaline solutions are involved it is indispensable that the driving and the driven sides are strictly separated. The non-contact and thus leakage-proof magnetic transfer of power consequently offers a wide range of advantages in comparison to standard shaft seals.Only recently one of its customers from the filtration industry asked the Ringfeder team to develop a magnetic system to optimize the flow concentration. In the past he had used a magnetic system with an expensive adapter flange to connect the different pitch circles of pump and containment shell. Ringfeder Power Transmission came up with a solution which does away with the adapter because thanks to the improved flow concentration the diameter could be reduced by approximately 25 percent. This fact allows for a direct connection, too.In comparison to standard synchronous couplings, the maximum torque could be increased for more than 50 percent with the new magnetic system without changing the frame size. At the same time the amount of magnetic material was reduced by 30 percent which diminishes the mass moment of inertia. Furthermore, customers can choose to have the interior and the exterior rotor made of aluminium or plastic instead of stainless steel to reduce costs. The innovative system has stood the test as a custom-made special solution.  Ringfeder Power Transmission GmbH "

Power Transmissiom,113 Voith Turbo Supplies Fluid Couplings for AFC Drives,Couplings,http://www.powertransmission.com/news/4386/Voith-Turbo-Supplies-Fluid-Couplings-for-AFC-Drives,"The Jin Cheng Coal Group, one of the biggest coal groups in China, found a way to avoid unexpected downtimes of the AFCs (Armored Face Conveyor) and to raise the productivity of the Chang Ping Coal Mine. In the past, the underground mine was facing a lot of problems because of their AFC drives equipped with two two-speed motors. The Head of the Jin Cheng Coal Group decided to replace the two-speed motors with Voith Fluid Couplings (type 562 DTPKWL2) in order to prevent chain breaks as well as gearbox and motor break downs in the future. The couplings provide a lot of benefits for AFC drives.“Based on the hydrodynamic principle, the fluid couplings protect the whole drive train from overload situations, which often happen at Chang Ping Coal Mine”, says Mao Weihong, head of the mechanical and electrical department of Chang Ping Coal Mine. The 562 DTPKWL2-1000 couplings are so powerful that they can easily handle blockages of the AFC without downtime or damage of the equipment. Mao is very satisfied with the exchange of the equipment. Furthermore, he compliments the reliability of the couplings and especially their soft start function. “For upcoming mining projects, we will also rely on Voith Fluid Couplings to raise our productivity,"" adds Weihong.Since the installation of the couplings in 2009, the AFC experienced no chain breaks. This also means significantly reduced maintenance efforts. Nowadays, the coal panels produce a yearly output of 3 million tons in the Chang Ping Coal Mine. The situation of the coal mine has improved.   Voith Turbo "
Power Transmissiom,117 Voith Couplings Utilized on Belt Conveyor Drive,Couplings,http://www.powertransmission.com/news/5049/Voith-Couplings-Utilized-on-Belt-Conveyor-Drive,"When high reliability and power are needed, the mining company Xishan Jinxing Energy Co. Ltd relies on the fill-controlled 866 TPKL fluid coupling from Voith. A total of three fluid couplings are used underground in the powerful 4.8 MW drive of the main belt conveyor in the Xiegou No. 12 coal mine in Shanxi Province, China.Three 1600 kW (1,900 HP) drives power the 1,900 metre (6,200 feet) long main inclined belt conveyor. This conveyor transports 3 800 metric tons of coal every hour. Powerful and reliable couplings are required. For the mine operator, the 866 TPKL fluid coupling from Voith is the best solution on the market.Through controlled application of torque, the fluid coupling pretensions the belt slowly and permits smooth conveyor start-up. This controlled soft start protects the belt and driveline components and extends their lifetime. As a result, the Voith fluid coupling reduces unplanned downtime – the operator benefits from lower maintenance costs and continuous production. Regard-less of the load state of the belt, start-up times of up to three minutes are possible. Thanks to stand by cooling of the operating oil, the 866 TPKL fluid coupling also permits multiple conveyor start-ups in succession, even when the belt is loaded.The mine operator is very satisfied with the performance of the 866 TPKL. In contrast to other solutions, the compact fluid coupling is also very capa-ble of withstanding extreme environmental conditions such as dust, dirt, moisture, heat or cold. As in every hydrodynamic coupling, power transmission in the 866 TPKL is virtually wear-free. For the operator, this translates into lower maintenance and repair costs for the coupling. In addition, motors start up independent of the machine load, and through sequenced starting of the motors, the fluid coupling reduces the load on the power supply circuit.An additional benefit of the 866 TPKL is its ability to operate with reduced filling to drive an empty conveyor at a reduced speed. During the creep speed operation, less power is transmitted and the belt runs more slowly. This function is useful for the visual inspection of the belt and splices. In the Xiegou No. 12 coal mine, the fluid couplings were operated in the par-tially filled mode during commissioning to be sure that the belt was tracking properly. With the fluid couplings operating in the partially filled mode, the belt speed could be reduced to 1.2 – 1.7 m/s instead of operating at the rated speed of 4.5 m/s.Until now, the coal mine has been operating at the initially planned produc-tion capacity of 15 million metric tons of coal per year. The operator plans to increase production capacity in the next one to two years. This will re-quire the main belt conveyor to be upgraded with a fourth drive. For this, the operator plans on installing an additional 866 TPKL fluid coupling from Voith.  Voith Turbo GmbH "
Power Transmissiom,121 Altra Couplings Solves Vibration Issues for Large Pumps,Couplings,http://www.powertransmission.com/news/6042/Altra-Couplings-Solves-Vibration-Issues-for-Large-Pumps,"A large raw water pumping station in Malaysia was suffering from severe vibration problems with the drivetrains on a number of large pumps which resulted in regular failures and downtime. When an update to the original parts was unsuccessful in solving the issue, the plant's managers turned to Altra Couplings to offer a solution. Fortunately the power transmission specialist was able to design a bespoke solution using TB Wood’s Form-Flex shafts which substantially reduced vibration.The pumps, which are used to pump raw water, had originally been specified with 4-section shafts forming the vertical drivetrain. However, the drivetrains had always suffered from vibration issues which caused damage to the pumps’ motors and necessitated regular maintenance, causing downtime. When some of the pumps were due for an upgrade they were fitted with 4-section U-Joint shafts in an attempt to reduce the vibration. Unfortunately the vibration on the new shafts was even worse than before, so the plant’s managers decided to look elsewhere for a solution.A spokesman comments: “After the new U-Joint shafts were installed the vibrations were even more extreme than they had been before. No more than four or five of the pumps could be run at a time and some of the pumps with U-Joints could never be run. The reduced pumping capacity began to create local drinking water shortages so it was crucial that we found a way to reduce the vibrations. It was clear that we needed to source our solution elsewhere so we approached Altra Couplings for help.”After a site visit and careful analysis of the pumps and existing drivetrains, Altra Couplings was able to recommend a custom designed, 3-section, Form-Flex Composite driveshaft from TB Wood’s. The upper and lower sections of the shafts used 7” diameter tubing while the centre section used 14” tubing to span past the centre floor bearing location where the vibrations had been most severe. The three driveshaft couplings formed a four story drivetrain which connected the pump to the motor.David Proud, global development director for process pumps and compressors for Altra Couplings, adds: “The Form-Flex composite tubes weigh up to 80% less than steel while still providing the necessary strength to transfer the torque to the pumps. The reduced weight and design, which incorporated a wider diameter at the point where the vibration was at its worst, meant that we were able to significantly reduce the problem.”An initial, single TB Wood’s solution was installed in one of the worst affected pumps; it was quickly accepted by the site’s management, who acknowledged that the bespoke solution contributed significantly to the station’s improved pumping capacity. To date, half of the original installed vertical shaft systems have been replaced with the Altra Couplings solutions.  Altra Couplings "
Power Transmissiom,123 Zero-Max Offers ServoClass Couplings ,Couplings,http://www.powertransmission.com/news/5139/Zero-Max-Offers-ServoClass-Couplings,"ServoClass Couplings are often described as very smooth and quiet during operation. That smooth operating characteristic is a result of several factors, including how consistent the various parts of the coupling are assembled and held together. Maintaining precise and repeatable assemblies is more than having a good torque wrench.  For example, it is possible to have several bolts that are all torqued to the same value and still have inconsistent clamping forces.  This situation would be caused by an inconsistent coefficient of friction in the threaded surfaces.To ensure that each and every ServoClass coupling is assembled correctly and will grip the shaft precisely, Zero-Max uses a special solid film lubricant treatment on the threads of all the socket head cap screws used in the ServoClass line of couplings.  It is this attention to even the smallest details that makes the ServoClass couplings run smooth and perform at the highest level in applications of any speed. Additional design features of this product line include all high quality materials including precise 304 stainless steel disc members. These are aligned and locked precisely into position onto the high strength aluminum alloy hubs with ISO 4762 XL 12.9 corrosion resistant socket head cap screws. The coupling assembly process itself is also controlled with a computerized system for the most precise fit of all components. Zero-Max ServoClass couplings are suitable for precise positioning requirements and high speed reversing loads common of many AC and DC servo motor systems. These applications include automation of all types, packaging, semi-conductor assembly, laboratory automation and medical equipment, to name just a few. They are designed to provide superior shaft engagement and reliable use with system speeds up to 10,000 rpm.  Further, the coupling’s increased clamping strength eliminates the need for keyways while providing a clean, balanced design.Available in 12 sizes with both single and double disc models, ServoClass couplings handle torque ratings ranging from 0.5 to 250 Nm.

Power Transmissiom,61 Bauer Motor Design Fulfills Efficiency Standards  ,Design Engineering,http://www.powertransmission.com/news/5023/Bauer-Motor-Design-Fulfills-Efficiency-Standards,"The need to convert customers from super price sensitive buyers to intelligent, specification and purchasing entities remains an on-going challenge for any quality brand manufacturer of power transmission products. Both OEM manufacturers and MRO distribution channels will demand the lowest purchase price possible, often because the results of using a poorer quality product will only happen after the standard warranty period has run-out on a particular machine or replacement; therefore shifting the cost burden to the end user every time. When cheap electric motors burn out, poor quality gears wear and cheap bearings seize, it is most often the buyer that says ‘at least they were cheap’ not the engineer, or the production manager and the maintenance department who are secretly delighted there is something for them to do, justifying their existence. Accountants also can’t argue with something that is broken and needs repairing, the money has to be spent. The good news for quality manufacturers of gears and geared motors is the rising cost of manufacturing. With today's energy costs, and at the speeds and volumes of production, the high cost of downtime means stoppages cannot be tolerated and the need to reduce energy costs and show corporate efficiency targets are being driven by political and environmental reasons. It is hard to make a cheap motor and gearbox that is very efficient, to reach 95% efficiency in a mechanical gearbox and an IE4 super premium efficiency rating for an electric motor takes good design, top quality materials and highly advanced manufacturing techniques.In some applications, where a geared motor is used rarely and is in a non-critical application in an unchallenging environment, then a cheap, inefficient geared motor might suffice. But for every other application, efficiency and reliability are absolutely vital, and this is true for the majority of industrial applications.Bauer Gear Motors PMSM (permanent magnet synchronous motors) already fulfil the requirements of the future IE4 (Super Premium Efficiency) classification. The PMSM series employs a highly efficient design of rotor that integrates embedded permanent magnets made from rare-earth material rather than the squirrel-cage rotor found in more conventional induction motors.This design offers a number of key benefits. It reduces heat losses from the rotor by 100%, total losses by approximately 25%, and increases total efficiency by 10% or more compared to the most efficient conventional motors. For the PMSM user, this improved performance translates into lower total cost of ownership, a reduction in CO2 emissions, and on-going savings that buffer against future increases in energy costs.

Power Transmissiom,157 Stober Utilizes Heidenhain Encoders for Servo Motors,Motors,http://www.powertransmission.com/news/4227/Stober-Utilizes-Heidenhain-Encoders-for-Servo-Motors,"Manufacturers of robots and CNC machine tools require precise and compact drives with high power efficiency. To meet these and future demands, Stober Antriebstechnik GmbH & Co. KG decided to develop a completely new family of servo motors with three different motor sizes, each available in four different lengths for torque values of 2.8 to 31 Nm in various versions. The synchronous servo motors of the EZ series provide a very high power density in an extremely compact form. The positioning and speed of the servo motors are controlled with the battery-backed Multiturn Rotary Encoder EBI 1135 likewise newly developed by Dr. Johannes Heidenhain GmbH.  Smaller, lighter, more dynamic and more precise are the common demands made by customers to Heinz Bäzner, head of cost center, motors, at Stober. These market demands led to the completely new development of the EZ series of servo motors which have now been on the market since the beginning of 2011 in flange sizes of 98 mm to 145 mm. The synchronous servo motors for speeds of up to 6,000 rpm are extremely short with a high power density. This has been made possible by the innovative method of manufacturing the stator winding.""Previously, with the Stober servo motors, we used a complete laminated stator core housing into which the windings were introduced individually,"" said Bäzner. ""In the case of the EZ motors, however, tooth winding was used, in which the winding was produced as a multi-layer winding (orthocyclic winding). This ensures a very high copper fill factor.""Furthermore, the stator plates are no longer welded or riveted, but are bonded together directly when punched. This means that the plates are placed so closely together that a significantly higher layer factor than with punching or riveting is achieved. This manufacturing method ensures higher stability and thus less vibration, less detent torque and a smoother surface without rivets or welding seams, which in turn prevents eddy currents. The higher layer factor also means less loss in the laminated stator core and a higher power density. ""Another highlight"" for Bäzner is ""the encapsulating of the winding in plastic."" This ensures even better heat removal. The higher copper fill factor, the new patented procedure for stator plate production and subsequent encapsulating of the winding as well as other measures such as the use of high-energy neodymium iron boron magnets permit the volume to be reduced by about 50 percent with the same torque compared with previously manufactured servo motors. ""These motors' high efficiency rate of 91 to 95 percent is therefore better than required by the IE4,"" emphasized Bäzner. The weight of the motors is also reduced by half thanks to the lower volume. The newly calculated rotor design and optimized rotor gaps also played their part in reducing the moment of inertia and thus improving the dynamics of the motors accordingly.""The extremely compact design of the motors forced us to solve a number of design problems,"" said Bäzner. ""For instance, the rotor bearings are deep inside the end winding."" For this reason a very small encoder was needed for mounting on the cam. The multiturn rotary encoders with mechanical transmission used previously in the Stober servo motors were no longer suitable due to their size.Bäzner continued, ""We therefore asked Heidenhain, with whom we have enjoyed successful cooperation for many years, whether they had a rotary encoder that can fit into this space and can fulfill our high requirements. Finally, after intensive tests, it became clear that the newly developed inductive rotary encoder EBI 1135 was the optimum solution for our EZ series of servo motors.""""The EBI1135 encoders are the first generation of inductive multiturn rotary encoders from Heidenhain with battery buffering,"" explained Dr.-Ing. André Schramm from marketing and product management at Heidenhain. ""Thus, compared with our other multiturn rotary encoders, all with mechanical transmission, we can achieve comparably high degrees of control and precision with the battery-buffered devices despite their small size, which means that a high level of control performance can also be achieved.""""It is just a pity,"" added Bäzner, ""that we did not come across the encoder before we had finished the design phase. Otherwise we could have made the motor another 10 mm shorter."" The number of revolutions is generated inductively with this new generation of encoders and buffered with the battery. This means that even if there is a power failure, the current position of the servo motor can always be read out. Here, the battery is mounted externally, as with all encoders with battery buffering, because the temperatures are too high where the encoder is incorporated in the motor. At Stober, the battery is mounted in the likewise newly developed Absolute Encoder Support (AES). The AES is installed between the servo controller and the rotary encoder cable. The advantages of this solution are that the battery is easy to access and the absolute position of the servo motor is safely buffered even when the servo controller is replaced.The EBI 1135 absolute multiturn encoder attains a total resolution of 34 bits (singleturn: 18 bits, multiturn: 16 bits). Thanks to its modular design without ball bearings and transmission, it is one of the world's smallest absolute rotary encoders with a length of 12.3 mm and outside housing diameter of only 36.83 mm. It is therefore predestined for use in highly dynamic servo motors of small size for automation technology and industrial robots.The new rotary encoder with battery-buffered revolution counter distinguishes itself in particular with optimized inductive scanning evenly around the circumference together with a sturdy design. This produces a high degree of precision of ± 120"", good controller quality and a large permissible axial mounting tolerance of ± 0.3 mm. The large permissible axial mounting tolerance of ± 0.3 mm, the wide voltage range of 3.6 to 14 V and, compared with multiturn scanning with a mechanical transmission, the greatly expanded multiturn value range of 65,536 distinguishable revolutions increases the reserves in the application available to the customer. The electronic multiturn scanning without additional mechanical components also improves the shock and vibration compatibility and ensures low-noise operation.According to Schramm, ""The EBI 1135 is the first inductive encoder that is equipped with the EnDat 2.2 interface."" This purely serial interface permits fast and secure data transmission at clock-pulse rates of up to 8 MHz for high drive dynamics even in environments with potentially high electromagnetic interference (e.g. welding robots). In addition, the greater voltage range of 3.6 V to 14 V means that there are no longer any problems with voltage drop in the cable.The multiturn function of the EBI 1135 is realized through a revolution counter. To prevent loss of the absolute position information during power failure, the multiturn must be driven with an external buffer battery. Compared with the absolute value encoders with battery-buffered revolution counter currently in widespread use in Asia, two features of the EBI 1135 are to be highlighted in particular. One the one hand, the power consumption in battery-buffering mode was lowered to 12 µA (the usual value here is about 25 µA) and a longer battery life of approximately 10 years could be achieved using a buffer battery with 1500 mAh and 3.6 V. On the other hand, the full speed of 12,000 rpm is permissible also in battery-buffering mode (in many cases, devices from the competition greatly reduce the permissible speed in battery-buffering mode).

Power Transmissiom,51 Siemens Enhances PLM Software ,Software,http://www.powertransmission.com/news/4854/Siemens-Enhances-PLM-Software,"Siemens recently introduced a new series of industry-specific offerings at its annual PLM Software Analyst Conference in Boston. The Industry Catalyst Series offerings consist of a pre-packaged combination of industry best practice guides, templates and software aimed at accelerating PLM deployment and tailoring the system to the needs of specific industries. The series is designed to increase a company’s overall return on its PLM investment, as well as the speed at which ROI is realized. The new offerings will also make it faster and easier to adopt, and gain value from, the latest PLM technology. The Industry Catalyst Series will work with one or more Siemens PLM Software offerings and – in accordance with the company’s open business model – in combination with third party PLM solutions. Individual Industry Catalyst Series offerings will be announced over the next several months.“Two years ago we began our transition from a product-focused organization to one focused on the unique requirements of industries,” said Chuck Grindstaff, president and CEO, Siemens PLM Software. “This announcement represents a pivotal step forward in that transition. Each offering in the Industry Catalyst Series will be built around a specific industry’s best practices, based on in-depth knowledge we have collected over more than 30 years of working with customers. By imbedding that knowledge and experience in each offering, our customers will not only experience accelerated PLM implementations, but those implementations will be tailored to each company’s business in a way that facilitates the adoption of new technology. The result is more business value, faster ROI, and the ability to benefit from the latest technology as soon as it becomes available.” Over the past several years, most organizations have come to appreciate how PLM technology and processes can help them increase productivity and efficiency. At the same time, however, many of these organizations have been slow to implement a full scope PLM solution, or to adopt the latest technology for their existing PLM system. This often stems from concern about costs and business disruptions associated with the need to customize standard PLM technology to their specific processes, data structures and workflow.The Industry Catalyst Series minimizes that disruption by delivering an industry-tailored deployment more quickly. As the name implies, each individual Industry Catalyst Series offering will work like an industry-specific “agent” to accelerate a PLM implementation. This is accomplished through the three main components of each offering:• Industry Best Practices – a set of digital guides and templates which function as a reference for the best processes and practices across the product lifecycle in a particular industry.• Deployment Accelerators – a set of industry-specific recommendations for product selections, systems design decisions, configuration procedures and best practices for deployment.• Open and Configurable Industry Solution Components – software components that enable the implementation team to easily control the appearance and behavior of a Siemens PLM implementation, without the need for custom programming.“Building interfaces and custom coding can add significantly to the cost of a PLM system,” said Georg Vogl, executive program manager PLM at BSH, a Siemens PLM Software customer. “Over the past several years, Siemens has evolved its PLM software solutions to minimize these efforts by allowing us to configure the system to our needs rather than developing custom software. This has already helped us reduce our total cost of PLM ownership by 25 to 35 percent. Now with the introduction of the Industry Catalyst Series, we see the potential to implement new PLM technology even faster and reduce costs even further.”“The natural time lag between the introduction of the latest PLM technology and its adoption by customers may be extended due to tailoring to meet industry and company-specific needs,” said Peter Bilello, president of CIMdata, a leading PLM consulting firm. “The longer this time lag lasts, the greater the amount of ‘missed value’ the customer will experience and the greater the risk to their competitive position. Siemens’ new Industry Catalyst Series is aimed at reducing this time lag for companies seeking to deploy a new industry-tailored PLM system, or those seeking to adopt the latest technology into their existing PLM system. In either case, the Industry Catalyst Series is designed to enable these companies to accelerate their time to value and enhance their competitive position.” Over the next several months, individual Industry Catalyst Series offerings will be announced for a variety of industries including automotive, electronics, consumer products, marine, energy, machinery, medical device and aerospace. In addition to supporting multi-vendor PLM implementations, the Industry Catalyst Series offerings will work with all of Siemens’ enterprise-level PLM software products including NX software for digital product development, the Teamcenter portfolio for digital lifecycle management, the Tecnomatix portfolio for digital manufacturing, and LMS software for test and mechatronic simulation.
