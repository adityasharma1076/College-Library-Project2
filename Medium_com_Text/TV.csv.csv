Medium.com,Arts & Entertainment,Watchmen review: “She Was Killed by Space Junk”,TV,https://medium.com/@charlesevans/watchmen-review-she-was-killed-by-space-junk-39ee4bcd4a78?source=topic_page---------0------------------1," As a writer and critic, I have to admit a bias: Watchmen is one of my favorite stories of all time. Though I’m not especially immersed in the world of superheroes or the comic book medium in general, something about Dave Gibbons and Alan Moore’s graphic novel completely enthralled me, and to this day it remains a significant creative touchstone in my life. Therefore, it’s difficult to poke holes in something so personal. Similar to the notion of altering the past, why challenge an experience if the end result is fundamentally positive? A work of art can feel perfect despite its imperfections, and there’s nothing about Watchmen that feels urgently in need of change to me. However, if I’m going to be honest, one area where I do feel the comic comes up short is in its treatment of women, in particular the portrayal of Laurie. She’s not given the same depth or nuance applied to nearly all of the other (male) main characters. There are a few circumstantial narrative reasons for this which make sense, and others much less so. But I’m happy to say that the new Watchmen is well aware of the issue, and not only seeks to redress it, but has wildly exceeded any and all expectations. Laurie Jupiter So who was Laurie, and who is she now? In the 40s, Laurie’s mother Sally Juspeczyk took on the costumed persona Silk Spectre, styling herself after the burlesque bombshells of the day. Though a decent crimefighter and one of the more visible members of the Minutemen, Sally’s long-term goal was to use her masked hero character as a way to promote her other alter ego, pinup model Sally Jupiter. From there, she and her manager Larry hoped to spin those careers into acting on the silver screen. Life didn’t quite work out that way. Sally instead got pregnant and retired Silk Spectre, marrying Larry largely for financial stability. The intended acting career never materialized, Sally’s only notable credit the softcore B-movie Silk Swingers of Suburbia. By 1985, she’s aging in a gaudy Hollywood retirement community, pining for when she was younger, life still ahead of her. Sally forced Laurie to follow in her footsteps — a bit of vicarious living if there ever was one — Laurie adopting the character Silk Spectre II, part of the new (and terribly named) masked vigilante group The Crimebusters. Throughout the 60s and 70s, Laurie continued her mother’s legacy, albeit with a heavy grudge stretching well into adulthood. Essentially an overbearing stage mom, Sally took away Laurie’s chances for a normal life almost from the beginning. Laurie would go on to form a relationship with fellow Crimebuster Dr. Manhattan, an utterly creepy arrangement given that she was still in her teens and Jon had recently dumped his girlfriend Janey after he grew to find her boring. (Volumes could be written about Dr. Manhattan’s passive aggressive shittiness, disguised as a byproduct of his godlike existence). Following the Keene Act of 1977 and the subsequent banning of masked vigilantes, Dr. Manhattan began working exclusively for the US government, Laurie allowed by the Nixon administration to remain his companion. When the comic begins, Laurie and Jon live in an underground apartment on a heavily guarded New York military base. Laurie is tired of isolation from the outside world, and from being shut out by her evermore distant Ubermensch partner. She reconnects with old friend Dan Dreiberg, a retired costumed hero once known as Nite Owl II. (Similar to Laurie, Dan was a second generation superhero who inherited the mantle of an already established masked character). Each somewhat lost in their own way, Dan and Laurie revive a long-simmering romance after Dr. Manhattan takes a respite to Mars. Later, Jon teleports Laurie to the red planet, where they discuss the end of their relationship, his comments maddeningly nonlinear since he exists outside of conventional space-time. Jon: This is where we hold our conversation. It commences when you surprise me with the information that you and Dreiberg have been sleeping together. Lori: You know about me and Dan? Jon: No, not yet. But in a few moments you’re going to tell me. A few moments later: Eventually, Jon apologizes for his cosmic aloofness, and they make peace with each other. After returning to Earth and rendezvousing with Dan, the three of them become the only people in the world (apart from Adrian) aware of the truth behind the squid attack. Dr. Manhattan opts to venture elsewhere in the multiverse, while Laurie and Dan decide it’s better to keep Veidt’s actions a secret in order to preserve peace. At the end of the book, the two of them go on the lam, disguising themselves under new identities and toying with the notion of resuming vigilantism. Before disappearing, they pay a visit to Sally, Laurie coming to terms with her ambivalent feelings towards her mother. But how they arrive at that moment is one of the graphic novel’s most controversial aspects. While the Minutemen were at the height of their popularity, Sally was assaulted and almost raped by Eddie Blake, the costumed adventurer who called himself the Comedian. The attack is vicious, Eddie mercilessly beating his supposed friend and clearly aroused by her pain and fear. Later in the comic, while Laurie and Jon have their discussion on Mars, he uses his telepathy to help Laurie uncover an unpleasant truth: years after the attempted rape, Sally and Blake had a consensual encounter, and Laurie realizes the Comedian — a man she utterly hates for brutalizing her mom — is in fact her biological father. Alan Moore often comes under a fair amount of fire for relying on sexual assault as a motivator for female character development, Watchmen included. While the appropriateness of using such a storytelling device has, will, and should be debated, in this instance Laurie’s revelation is meant to be transformative. Whether or not it works depends on the reader. That Sally could forgive such a horrific act, her feelings for Blake resulting in Laurie, convinces Dr. Manhattan that love is greater than the cold mechanics of the universe. The fact that by all odds such a force shouldn’t exist is, to him, a miracle. For Laurie, she begins to understand her mother genuinely cared for Eddie despite his actions, causing Laurie to see Sally in an entirely different light which cuts through the years of built-up resentment. Would this plot twist be regarded as problematic today? Absolutely, yes. As our society grapples with the power structures which have allowed men to abuse women for much of modern civilization, the idea of a story where a rapist finds partial redemption by later hooking up with his victim is . . . well, troublesome. As is any possible suggestion that Sally somehow owed the Comedian forgiveness. She was never at fault in the first place. Though in Blake’s amoral, animalistic mind Sally had her assault coming — because these costumed characters are, at heart, playing with imagery evocative of primal urges towards sex, death, and power — his warped POV is in no way shared by her. It doesn’t matter how fetishistically she’s dressed or that there was mutual attraction; he beat and tried to rape a woman. End of story. The comic also features an interview excerpt where an older Sally is asked about the assault, and she at first demurs before stumbling over her thoughts and then questioning whether she may have secretly wanted Eddie to violently take control. This would yet again not go over well in the current clime . . . it can too easily be interpreted as a form of victim-shaming by indulging a standpoint which shifts blame away from the man. But where this plot still works is in its genuine belief in love. The Comedian’s opinion of humanity is that we’re all sacks of meat fucking and killing each other in a world where rules and morals are artificial attempts to hide from our true nature. Indeed, a question hanging over the entire story is whether or not humanity is worth saving, or if we’re simply doomed to annihilate ourselves. Laurie’s birth negates Blake’s cynical worldview in that it fills even a god with wonder. It should also be noted that Sally does not lack agency. She never mentions any obligation in terms of forgiving Eddie. She does so because she chooses. It’s a very real dilemma faced by victims of abuse, as they often continue to struggle with feelings for those who hurt them, who in many cases are people they love or loved. And while Sally’s uncomfortable interview could be chalked up to tone-deaf writing on Moore’s part, it’s not necessarily the story suggesting Sally might have in some way welcomed Blake’s aggressive advances, but her openly warring with her own thoughts regarding the matter. It’s well documented that many who’ve experienced such an assault typically find themselves plagued by questions of doubt and self-blame for years afterwards. In the photos accompanying the article, Sally looks visibly distressed, a sign that this trauma continues to haunt her, no matter how complicated her feelings for Eddie. (She also spends her life keeping the Comedian away from their daughter, not fully trusting him). Still, it’s not flawless, and for some it can be off-putting. The same goes for the depiction of Laurie. To be fair, Laurie and Dan are designated as the “normal” superheroes, at least compared to their contemporaries. Neither character is driven by disturbing impulses, deep-seated psychological problems, or grandiose notions of superiority, unlike most of the other costumed vigilantes. For many readers, Dan and Laurie simply won’t be as interesting or colorful as a Rorschach or a Veidt or a Dr. Manhattan. These two are meant to give a glimpse into the lives of grounded, mostly stable people who occasionally get to experience the high of heroism, and how they navigate being surrounded by unstable narcissists. What can Dan and Laurie do with the knowledge that Adrian Veidt murdered millions of innocent people in one sick prank? Nothing, really, other than try to enjoy the time they have. Laurie also didn’t want to be a masked vigilante in the first place, so she has less backstory as far as how she got from A to B, a regular person thrown into an arena she never asked to join. All of that considered, she still is not as richly drawn as the other characters. Dan Dreiberg is granted an entire issue devoted to exploring his past and his motivations for taking on the Nite Owl persona. Even Sally, who has comparatively little screentime next to her daughter, is given more complexity and pathos, a woman of a different era now cast aside in her twilight years. Sally projected her own desires onto her daughter, Laurie missing out on the opportunity to understand who she really is. There’s plenty of dramatic territory to mine there, yet the comic mostly scratches the surface. Which is not to say Laurie lacks importance or has no bearing on the story. Of all the people in Watchmen, she’s the one rolling her eyes at the antics of the Crimebusters, possessing an innate understanding of the self-serious absurdity of superheroes. The novel also does address misogyny, with Rorschach calling Sally a “bloated, aging whore” in his journal and openly disliking Laurie for being what he considers a distraction to Dr. Manhattan and Dan. Laurie is weighed down by the expectation that it’s her responsibility to keep Jon happy, and a big thrust of her arc is breaking free of that oppressive sexism. But it’s clear that Moore and Gibbons didn’t quite know what to do with Laurie compared to the rest of the comic’s cast. Laurie Blake When Damon Lindelof assembled the writers’ room for the new Watchmen, he made sure that women were part of the roundtable to bring a perspective to the material other than straight white cis males. And the feedback he received — from various writers, directors, and producers involved with the show — indicated that the book’s depiction of female characters is sorely lacking. So, the series has attempted a corrective measure in the form of Jean Smart’s version of Laurie. Imbued with a hardness and a caustic wit only sporadically glimpsed in the comic, this new Laurie has jettisoned all former personas (Laurie Juspeczyk/Jupiter, Silk Spectre II, her various renegade disguises post-novel) and now settled as FBI agent Laurie Blake. The adoption of her father’s last name demonstrates not only an acceptance of her connection with him, but also that his bitter, ironic sense of humor about the world lives on inside her. Jean Smart’s performance rivals anything we’ve seen thus far in the show, right up there with Regina King and Jeremy Irons, playing Laurie with so many dimensions that her energy nearly flies off the screen the moment she steps into frame. We first meet Laurie Blake during a staged bank robbery meant to catch a ridiculous vigilante named Mr. Shadow (the scene filmed as a tongue in cheek homage to The Dark Knight). Laurie has left behind her life on the run and now works for the Bureau’s Anti-Vigilante Task Force, knowing all too well that people who hide behind masks and take the law into their own hands are often not coming from a place of pure-hearted do-gooderness. On the request of Senator Keene, she’s assigned to investigate Judd Crawford’s murder, something in which she has no interest. But right away it becomes obvious there’s no better agent to be working this case; Laurie can get into the mindset of a masked character like few others, having been one herself for decades. Taking one look at the Tulsa PD, Laurie already knows what’s wrong and how it will continue to get worse. Though she jokingly dismisses the suspect who tells her his rights are being violated, she of course does care that the cops are abusing their power. At nearly every juncture she turns the tables on the police, diffusing the situation with sarcasm and then pushing back on their tactics while also keeping her true perspective guarded enough to be difficult to read. Though she may have an aversion to the behavior of people in costumes, Laurie lacks reserve when it comes to using violence, demonstrated by her shooting of Mr. Shadow (the bullets only stopped by his rubber costume) and later the 7K terrorist who interrupts Judd’s funeral. This is in step with the comic, which found Laurie unafraid to employ especially ferocious measures when threatened. (She and Dan take out a gang of muggers by nearly tearing them to pieces). But it would be a disservice to simply reduce Laurie to a badass who takes no prisoners. One common mistake made by screenwriters (especially men) is to fall into the “she’s not like other women” trap, essentially just another form of sexism. This trope gleans the superficial basics of fictional icons like Ellen Ripley and Sarah Connor — very broken people whose invulnerability hinders as much as helps, a trait accepted for male protagonists without question — and hijacks those elements into an excuse to bro-job women, implying they’re only worth a major role in the story if reflecting the attributes normally assigned to the macho trappings of the genre. Watchmen avoids this prepackaged Strong Female Character cliche by doing more with Laurie than having her strut around waving a gun. Instead, Laurie’s hardness masks (because yes, in some ways she’s still wearing one) a disappointment and weariness that the world is still finding new ways to repeat the same mistakes. Not that Laurie herself always avoids missteps. She’s very good at what she does, but then makes impulsive decisions like sleeping with the inexperienced agent tasked with helping her, a major ethical breach to be sure. And though she doesn’t want to, and despite the anger she still holds for some of his behavior, she misses Dr. Manhattan. (Similar to how her mother longed for the Comedian, just as Laurie’s disillusionment mirrors that of her father). Her call to Jon in the interplanetary phone booth, and the elaborate joke she tells him, says much of what we need to know about Laurie . . . melancholy, pissed off, sardonic, insightful, and ultimately, lonely and filled with yearning. The joke she tells is based on Dan/Nite Owl, Adrian Veidt/Ozymandias, and Jon/Dr. Manhattan, with God sending all three of them to Hell no matter their heroic deeds. (A grim acknowledgement of the typically unhappy endings which tend to befall superheroes). But the real point of it is Laurie’s rage at having been overshadowed by the damaged men who were allowed to define her life. Yet beyond that, she can’t fully let go of the mark Jon left on her, and her message is as much “I miss you” as it is “bite me you big blue overhyped manchild.” And for the first time since abandoning Earth, Dr. Manhattan appears to respond, Angela’s UFO-abducted car dropping from the heavens just like the brick in Laurie’s joke, the aura of Mars winking in the sky. One upped, Laurie breaks out in uncontrollable cackling, nearly falling over. Whether Jon actually had anything to do with it, or the car’s arrival merely a coincidence, Laurie of all people can appreciate the comedic timing. Same as her father, she knows that only a fool expects to have the last laugh. Further under the hood:"

Medium.com,Arts & Entertainment,When the Body Becomes a Crime Scene,TV,https://medium.com/fearless-she-wrote/when-the-body-becomes-a-crime-scene-541b06456173?source=topic_page---------2------------------1," How Unbelievable indicts our criminal justice system It’s the initial recounting that’s the hardest. It’s the phone calls you make after leaving his house, or the party, or the place that you ended up that you don’t remember ending up in. It’s the way you pretend that it wasn’t a big deal that your friend didn’t pick up that phone. It’s the way you laugh off the hysterical text message you sent. It’s the half-completed story you told in your diary before you had to stop writing, before you went to go take yet another shower. The serial rapist in Netflix’s Unbelievable makes his victims take a shower in order to wash the evidence away. Because he knows that this is the kind of rape that gets the cops called. This is the kind of rape where they’ll care about the evidence. After Amber Stevenson is raped in Netflix’s Unbelievable, Detective Karen Duvall tells her, “Every rape has three crime scenes: the location of the assault, the body of the attacker, and the body of the victim.” So each of the victims is subjected to the evidence collection procedures of a rape kit. “How long does it take to process a rape kit?” Detective Duvall asks. “Uh, about a day or so if we request a rush,” Officer Morris answers. But the fact of the matter is that this is the exception, not the rule. Rape kits can sometimes go untested for years after DNA is collected, a process that can sometimes be as traumatizing as the rape itself. You recount your story again. And again. Evidence is scraped off your body, from inside your body, put in bags that are often left untested. According to this Atlantic article, which investigates the 11,000 untested rape kits found in Detroit in 2009, “Each year, roughly 125,000 rapes are reported across the United States…But in 49 out of every 50 rape cases, the alleged assailant goes free — often, we now know, to assault again.” And perhaps this is why we know that about three out of every four rapes go unreported. Because no one wants to face scrutiny when they’re at their most vulnerable. No one wants to be told that they can’t be believed. No one wants to re-subject their body to trauma. And a lot of victims do not even know that they can claim that title. In a society that teaches women that it is up to us to protect ourselves, it can be easy to blame ourselves for being in that situation or getting drunk with that guy. It took years of therapy for me to admit that my rape was rape. It never occurred to me to get law enforcement involved. It never occurred to me that my body was capable of offering evidence. And that’s probably because I knew my rapist, as most victims do. Most incidents of sexual violence do not look like the stories told in Unbelievable. Most sexual violence occurs at the hands of dates, of family friends, at college parties. And a victim, already fearing social retaliation, the ostracizing that occurs from outing a predator, asking people to question their own complicity, often chooses to stay silent. After all, we don’t even know if that rape kit will be tested. We don’t even know if it’ll help tilt the rhetoric of he said/she said in our favor. And many of us know that we won’t be believed anyway. As Marie Adler’s story shows us, it is often more convenient for law enforcement to write our stories off as inconsistent, unreliable. Never mind that a key component of trauma is the inability to state a coherent narrative. Never mind that perpetrators often use drugs and alcohol to render their victims unable to remember, unable to gather details with clarity. In his book The Evil Hours: A Biography of Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder, David Morris describes the way time works after trauma: “In normal time, you move from one moment to the next, sunrise to sunset, birth to death. After trauma, you may move in circles, find yourself being sucked backwards into an eddy, or bouncing about like a rubber ball from now to then and back again.” Time slows down, speeds up, flashbacks distort the narrative. And this is the story that we depend on in order to prosecute sex crimes. This is not to say that we can’t trust victims. But it is to say that we cannot write off inconsistencies as fakeries. A post-traumatic interrogation cannot be the primary mode of testing validity. When the body is the scene of the crime, law enforcement treats it as it would a room that holds secrets, if only they could peer inside. What law enforcement sometimes forgets is that those bodies are attached to people who are often recovering from one of the most traumatic moments of their lives. I don’t have an answer on how to improve the state of things within our current justice system. I don’t know how to do it better. What I do know is that Unbelievable is an indictment of the way that rape cases are often handled by law enforcement. Though the two detectives are ultimately successful, we see all the pitfalls of the system along the way. The cases in Unbelievable are solved due to the persistence of two determined detectives, not because of reliance on a faulty system. And we shouldn’t forget that many police officers are often invested in a culture that distrusts women. As Detective Rasmussen reminds us, “Everyone knows, huge correlation between violence at home and violence against strangers and even so, a third of wife-beating cops in Florida are still walking around with a badge and a gun.” From the time the police arrive to the time she pleads guilty of false reporting, Marie Adler is as much a victim of the criminal justice system as she was of her rapist. But Detectives Rasmussen and Duvall show that there can be a better way: a way that is centered in empathy, that puts the victim first. So what does justice look like for survivors? I’m not sure. I imagine it would be different for every person. For me, I imagine it would be an apology. I would like for him to listen to the ways his one night has stayed with me for years. I would like to tell him about the sleepless nights, about the fear I developed around sex and intimacy. More than that, though, I would want him to understand that what he did was wrong, because I’m not even sure he knows. I sometimes wonder if, in a culture that teaches men that drunk girls are easy targets, he has ever put the name “rape” to what happened that night. I wonder how many more women have been the victims of his “game.” I would like to see a justice system that focuses less on treating the body as a site of evidence collection and instead focuses on providing restorative justice to let survivors heal. Options such as victim impact panels, where survivors of sexual violence speak with those convicted of sex crimes about how their lives have been negatively impacted, can help survivors feel a sense of agency. Some survivors even find empowerment in meeting with their rapist directly, in a supervised and mediated setting. Some, like the women in Unbelievable, will ask to speak at sentencing. Because while many women find a sense of security knowing that their rapist can no longer hurt them, many also crave an admission of guilt, an ownership of the trauma they’ve caused. They want their pain to be recognized. And I believe that is why so many women I’ve talked to love Unbelievable. Rasmussen and Duvall recognize the pain of the women they are fighting for. They believe them. They don’t second guess them. And that’s something that many survivors crave. One out of every six women will be the victim of rape or attempted rape in her lifetime. One out of every thirty-three men. Unlike other crime scenes, we cannot simply be cleaned up and be as good as new. We must work to heal. And I would argue that it is the responsibility of our justice system to help us get there. And this might mean law enforcement might need to work with survivors and our advocates to come up with new and creative ways to investigate and sentence perpetrators of sexual crimes. Their victims are counting on it."
Medium.com,Arts & Entertainment,Safety Last! ‘Rick and Morty’ Season Four Is Finally Here!,TV,https://paleymatters.org/safety-last-rick-and-morty-season-four-is-finally-here-6869401ee37b?source=topic_page---------4------------------1," Our infinite dimensional nightmare is over. Adult Swim’s Rick and Morty finally returned last night with its first new episode in over two years. The greatest, most wildly creative show today is back! So let’s dive in to this season opener. The episode title “Edge of Tomorty: Rick Die Rickpeat” is obviously referencing the 2014 Tom Cruise movie Edge of Tomorrow (which I hear is based on an anime), where Cruise is caught in a deadly time loop while fighting an alien army. Rick and Morty loves to reference other sci-fi and adventure movies and play around in the tropes of older stories. This is no exception. But while they don’t invoke the specific plot points of the episode’s namesake; they do explore its themes of mortality and rebirth. More on that later… The episode opens with a typical family meal scene that Rick typically disrupts by wanting to go on an adventure. He then drags Morty (after being forced to ask for his consent) on a pretty standard R&M quest to collect a hard-to-get object. This object is a crystal that shows its holder how they’ll die. Morty becomes obsessed with his own mortality and following a path that will bring him to a safe, satisfying, unimaginative end, in his crush’s arms (“I do as the crystal guides”). Oh Morty! Rick on the other hand is mostly compelled by boredom and has no regard for his own mortality or the sanctity of life or the safety and well being of his family. So a central theme of the show is writ large in this dichotomy. And a carpe diem lesson is learned by the time we get to the ends credits, or maybe not. What are Rick’s motivations? Playing it safe is no way to live, so have a some fun?!? Is he addicted to thrills and danger? A masochist? Is his covert master plan yet to be revealed? We’re still guessing and can’t wait to learn more. The vast, mind-blowing, multiverse world of Rick and Morty that has grown over the first three seasons of this show has garnered great expectations for this season. I was expecting this season premiere would touch on some of the show’s major story arcs. So many questions remain: What’s going on with the Citadel of Ricks (You know, that interstellar city populated by solely by versions of Rick and Morty from throughout the countless dimensions of existence)? What’s up with Evil Morty as the new Citadel president? Who is Evil Morty? Is Beth a clone? Is anyone who we think they are? Surprisingly, no new ground was broken on these major story arcs. What we got was a slight reset. In other words, the show is basically back to the character dynamics of season one: a semi-functional suburban family who lives with megalomaniacal genius who drags his grandson on insanely dangerous sci-fi adventures with no regard for his safety or well being. The only new wrinkle is that Rick has to ask for Morty’s consent to go on their adventures. This was a minor moment in the opening scene, but a significant moment in central relationship of the show. Yes, they made a small attempt to tame Rick. What’s this about? Do they think the show had gotten too dark (see season three’s “The Ricklantis Mixup”)? Had Rick become too much of a monster? This show has become niche programming block Adult Swim’s most successful offering by far. In fact, season three was the most watched TV comedy by 18–24, according to Neilsen. So maybe some tone-lightening was needed? Perhaps they thought they should dial back the cynicism at the outset of a new era. This way Rick has more room to to grow more sociopathic, more of an egomaniac… or maybe he’ll become the cuddly grandpa we never saw coming. One of the funnest signature parts of the show in the first three seasons is their multiverse, and how each individual dimension is hilariously and perversely different than our own. This episode had a great time playing with the multiverse with clones of Rick being generated in imaginatively bizarre scenarios… not all Ricks are from primate-based, ya know. In some worlds Rick might be a fascist, or an anthropomorphic shrimp, or both! This dimension hopping was a fresh take on the multiverse and as awesome as channel-flipping through interdimensional cable. They also brought back a fan favorite character, Mr. Meeseeks in this ep. So it seems like sticking to the hits was the plan for the season opener. They might have expected tons of brand new viewers and wanted to give them a “classic” R&M story, but one that would satisfy longtime fans as well. At the end of the episode, even after Rick and his clones had died several times, and Morty had killed several bullies and cops, everything was back to normal. The reset was in effect. One character even makes the meta-comment “As far as continuity goes the reset button has been hit.” The slates were wiped clean. It’s back to business as usual. At the end of the ep, Rick and Morty even revel that they’d go for a hundred years, which I swear they said somewhere in season one. So the stage is reset, and that was probably the best move they could make at this point. If you’ve followed the show from the beginning you know how complicated the Rick and Morty world had become, with all the aliens worlds, alternate dimensions, clones, implanted memories, the Schwiftiness of it all. A reset with a slight fine-tuning on the core relationship of the show was a fantastic way to start the new season. I’ll conclude with a few choice quotes from this episode: “You’re gonna be a lot happier if you just focus on the moment instead of how you’re gonna die” -Rick “Cover me in gasoline and spiders?! I’m in.” -Morty “There’s a lesson here and I’m not the one who’s gonna figure this one out” -Rick Paley Matters is a publication of The Paley Center for Media."

She said, very simply, “Firsts.” Angie explained that the first time you do something is always the best time because it’s the way you’ll never experience it again. Every other time you do that thing, you’ll do it with the knowledge of what it’s like to do it, but the first time, it’s pure experience. It was such a good answer that I’ve remembered it all this time. But here’s something I don’t remember: the first time I watched Sex and the City. As I played the first episode, there was no visceral memory of the first time I had watched it. In a way, I like this because it’s like I never watched Sex and the City for a first time, but rather it’s a show in my DNA. But I also don’t like this, because I love this show and you’re supposed to remember falling in love. That’s why questions like, “How did you two meet?” and “When did you know they were the one?” exist. But I don’t know how I met Sex and the City nor how I knew it was the one. I remember the experience of watching several of my favorite shows for the first time. I sat in the green armchair in the living room of my childhood home and watched the season two finale of Grey’s Anatomy, my mother saying she couldn’t believe they actually aired McDreamy sliding off Meredith’s underwear (the scandal!) while I felt like I was understanding desire for the very first time. When Meredith said, “I can’t breathe with you looking at me like that, so just stop,” and Derek, somehow invoking a cowboy-like energy, went, “Do you think I want to look at you?” it became the lens through which I’d forever measure desire. And if I think about that scene, I can still feel the lines of fabric of the armchair. I know where that armchair was positioned in the living room, so I know where I was positioned in the world, the very first time I experienced it. If you asked me how I met Gossip Girl, I’d tell you that I watched the series premiere on the floor of a dorm room belonging to a girl who once yelled at her father for buying the wrong brand of water bottles. I knew Gossip Girl was the one when I watched the season two premiere, which I know aired on Labor Day 2008 because I returned home early from my aunt’s BBQ to watch Blair ask Chuck to say those three words, eight letters. Breaking Bad, The Good Wife, The Leftovers, I have specific memories of experiencing moments from these shows for the first time. But Sex and the City, the show that I’ve probably watched most in my life, the show that’s probably molded me more than any other, is the one I cannot remember watching for the first time. While watching the first episode of Sex and the City doesn’t bring back a memory of the first time I saw it, I can tell you, undoubtedly, that I used to hate this episode because I used to hate the entire first season, so much so that I’d begin my DVD rewatches with season two. But now, I love the first season. Carrie says things like, “Welcome to the age of uninnocence.” The entire series opens with a tale about two characters we literally never see again. It is chaotic good. When I first watched Sex and the City, I was a 17-year-old mean girl. Exactly how my mind worked back then, I don’t know. I was awful. But I think I didn’t like season one because it’s fairly experimental. In an effort to adapt a newspaper column, in which Candace Bushnell did heavy reporting, into a television show, they employed Carrie breaking the fourth wall and talking heads of those being interviewed for the column. I don’t know if this would have worked long-term, as the show shifted away from it mid-second season, but I appreciate it now. I think what I initially liked about the show was the formula: every episode has four plots following each main character, two of which were more comedic and two more dramatic. I initially liked the fairy tale quality and the happy ending of the sixth season. I liked the surface level appeal of the show. And I’m grateful for these elements, as they made it a show that 17-year-old me could enjoy. If I didn’t begin loving Sex and the City with such fierce intensity at 17, I’m not quite sure who I’d be at 30, and it was those elements that seduced the younger version of myself. It’s funny that Sex and the City helped inform who I am at 30 and this 30-year-old version of myself dislikes many of the elements that drew the 17-year-old me to the show. Now, I think the neat formula can sometimes feel repetitive. I prefer the experimental episodes of Broad City, Girls, You’re the Worst, and Atlanta to how fixed and orderly every episode of Sex and the City is. I also connect much less to the romanticism and happy ending. Of course, this isn’t to say I love the show less than before. I just love other things: I love that Carrie is an anti-hero. I love that Charlotte is low-key the most sex-obsessed character. I love some of the genius editing that makes eating a salad a deliciously filthy joke through the lens of the previous scene. I love the clothes, the anxiety, and the self-obsession. The internet is full of articles about how being married to one person is like falling in love with many different people throughout a lifetime. It’s a true sentiment. I’ve been in a relationship with Eric for seven years, three of which we’ve been married, and even in just this time, he’s been many different people. I mean, he’s still him, but I’ve loved variations of him, just as he’s loved variations of me. Loving several variations of someone is true to any long-term relationship, be it partners, friends, or family. What’s interesting about having a long-term relationship with a television show is that the show doesn’t fundamentally change, but you do, and because you do, so does the way you view the show. Sex and the City is an anchor around which I’ve changed, and in my changing, Sex and the City has become a different show, even though it hasn’t changed at all. And yes, I’m aware that I’m comparing my relationship with a television show to my marriage, but, I assure you, I’m not deeply unhinged. I just really love the stories I love. Maybe the mark of both a truly great relationship, and a truly great television show, is that several versions of yourself can love the object of your affection. I don’t know who I’ll be in another 13 years, willing I’m still alive, but will I love still love Sex and the City? Abso-fucking-lutely—I’ll just probably love it, yet again, for a different set of reasons."

Medium.com,Arts & Entertainment,"LGBTQ Characters Hit Record High on Network TV, Study Says",TV,https://medium.com/@CTStaff/lgbtq-characters-hit-record-high-on-network-tv-study-says-83f9b643928a?source=topic_page---------10------------------1," The percentage of regular LGBTQ characters on primetime broadcast TV peaked with an all-time high this season: 10.2%, or 90 out of a total of 879 characters, onscreen. According to a study by the Gay and Lesbian Alliance Against Defamation (GLAAD) that was released Thursday, this surpassed last year’s record of 8.8% and achieved the 10% goal that the LGBTQ organization had set for the networks by 2020. This year’s findings are measured against GLAAD’s 24-year records of tracking lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender and queer characters on TV, which they began releasing in 2005 as an expanded survey entitled “Where We Are on TV.” “At a time when the cultural climate is growing increasingly divisive, increased representation of LGBTQ stories and characters on television is especially critical to advance LGBTQ acceptance,” said Sarah Kate Ellis, GLAAD president and CEO. FX’s “Pose”, with the biggest LGBTQ cast ever for a scripted show, and the new “Batwoman”, featuring the first gay superhero lead in a TV series, are just two shows contributing to this spike in LGBTQ representation. Although they already reached their goal of 10% one year early, GLAAD is allegedly challenging networks to go even further: for 20% representation of LGBTQ regular characters on primetime scripted broadcast series, by 2025. Additionally, they’re suggesting that half of these LGBTQ characters will be people of color within the next two years. Undoubtedly, it’s important for these historically underrepresented groups to be included onscreen-but does it accurately represent the general population? An estimated 4.5% of the adult population in the United States identify as LGBTQ, which equates with 11.3 million people. This is according to a new analysis by the Williams Institute at UCLA School of Law. As of last year, people of color make up about 39 percent of the population. Other findings contained in the new report from GLAAD: - African-Americans remained steady at 22% of regular TV characters despite being only 13% of the U.S. population, while Latinos reached a record high 9% of regular characters on broadcast network TV series-which is only half their estimated 17.8% representation in the U.S. population. Asian Pacific Islanders remained steady at 8% of regular TV characters, compared to being about 5% of the U.S. population. - Women increased to a record 46% of regular characters on broadcast TV-up 3 percentage points from last year-but short of the 51% they represent in the U.S. population. - Disabled characters represented on TV also reached a record high of 3.1%, or 27, but is still well below their actual number of 20% of the population, according to a U.S. Census estimate. - Netflix counts the highest number of LGBTQ characters on all streaming services, and Showtime counts the highest number on cable networks. The CW boasts the highest percentage of LGBTQ series regular characters of the five broadcast networks."
Medium.com,Arts & Entertainment,The Netflix Effect,TV,https://medium.com/thinksheet/the-netflix-effect-2d94683ef9f1?source=topic_page---------11------------------1," When I was a young boy I had a dream: I dreamed of an infinite entertainment catalogue, the library of everything-ever-made, one that would cater for my every whim or chance discovery. I would be the master of ceremonies, the wizard before the machine, pulling levers and turning cogs, eliciting inspiration from the database. It was a slot machine I would always win at. I was at an age, perhaps twelve or thirteen, when I really started to enjoy films and TV. I’d been given my first television set by my parents and I was eagerly (and surreptitiously) exploring new movies and late night scheduling with a genuine sense of discovery. It was also the moment when I came to understand that some things on TV are better than others. So I began to get excited about what else there was out there: What else had this actor appeared in? What else had this director made? The Internet was not yet ready. The world of entertainment was dominated by trips to the video store and most especially the TV schedule. I’m old enough to remember a time when TV schedules were sacrosanct; by which I mean, not only did they rule over my family’s habits and routines, but also inspired in me a belief in something greater. A bigger plan, a sense of mightier forces which could affect the habits of large swathes of the population. TV schedules even shaped the way I experienced a day and a week. I’m not exaggerating when I say that TV schedules helped to teach me about the shape of time. This idea has taken a fresh turn for me recently since my young nephew, who has just turned five years old, has begun to ask the sort of probing questions about the nature of time that adults tend to take for granted. For instance, he doesn’t yet understand what a “week” is, but he wonders when Friday is coming, a day which he has learnt has pleasurable significance as the end of his school time. He has also pondered on the meaning of “yesterday”, though for him it might mean any time in the past. Similarly “tomorrow” is any time in the future, unless tomorrow is Friday in which case he knows it is the beginning of something special. What he will probably miss out on, though, is the vital instruction provided by the rules of the TV schedule. The Netflix effect has replaced the TV schedule with a marvelous alternative — and yet at a curious cost. If you tune into YouTube or Netflix or Amazon, then the old rules no longer apply. The beauty of the TV schedule — if I may take a moment to reminisce — lay in the perusing and the planning. Some people do it with a pen and paper; for me I did it by memory, letting the TV schedule form my mental landscape of what the next week would bring. One had to be patient. Waiting a week between episodes of you favourite programme was normal. You couldn’t skip around — there was no such thing as ‘pause’ or ‘resume’. You had to be there, on the sofa, at the allotted time. Otherwise you missed it. (Unless you set the video-record timer — which, alas, was notoriously easy to mess-up, cutting off the beginning or end of show, or recording the wrong channel altogether.) Moreover, the routines of predictable programming, by which I could get my bearings, was abetted by specific scheduling highlights. I was aware that Monday TV was different to Friday TV, and that Saturday and Sunday swept away all the regularities of the week. Saturday was generally far more colorful and entertaining, whereas Sunday usually tended towards the well-behaved, sedate and sometimes very boring. Even daily news bulletins, scheduled at 1pm, 6pm and 10pm, were reliable stakes in the landscape of time that, whilst as a child I had no interest in, nonetheless offered dependable way-markers. When schedules changed, say for a charity gala night or an all-over-coverage sporting event, the sense of disarray bothered me. It was a sort of betrayal, like being told I wasn’t allowed to see my friends or that the toy shop had unexpectedly closed. Where was my programme? I never consented to this! At Christmas the TV schedule took on a new gloss. It was like the TV stations were offering gifts: the latest films and TV specials were allowed to take exclusive place beneath the tree, as it were. At Christmas I never minded the schedule disruption. The Netflix effect does away with all this. Time is only relevant in the question of whether you have enough of it to watch another episode or film sequel. Otherwise — and this is the point — you dictate the schedule according to your own preferences. It is, in many respects, the vision I had as a child, only far better designed. What I never counted on was the distraction of choice, nor did I realized there were so many things I didn’t want to watch. These two shortcomings are really the opposite sides of the same coin, since how one chooses what to watch inevitably comes down to choosing what rule out. As such, entertainment has turned into a new kind of personal project: the eye peruses the grid, the finger triggers the remote. Channel-hopping is now an old-fashioned vice; its replacement is box-set browsing whereby a thumbnail image and a star rating can determine how you spend your next 50 hours of recreation time. Get it wrong and there’s no one to blame but you. Then there are the “Because you watched…” algorithms that are successful only to the extent of knowing why you chose to watch a particular title in the first place. Films or TV series tagged with the same keywords (or however the algorithm works: actually it’s more complicated than that, so complicated in fact that in 2006 Netflix famously offered a prize of $1 million to anyone who could improve on the algorithm) are lined up in front of you, and help normalize the process of one-thing-leading-to-another. By reducing the number of steps between titles, the experience is of being served, as if being waited on at a restaurant. We are never deprived of anything — if you can’t find something to watch, that’s because you haven’t read the menu properly. The principles of user-experience tell us that ease-of-use is always a benefit. But it falls down in one crucial respect: it deters us from the chance discovery in the very best sense. I realize now that what I hoped for as a child was the impossible concoction: the infinite catalogue that also kept the best things hidden from me. The rule of supply and demand stays true: abundance and value remain inversely proportional. The TV schedule offered up its best material only in meager morsels, which is why I enjoyed them all the more. I miss that. Oh well, you know what they say about cake and eating it.

Medium.com,Arts & Entertainment,The suburban dead: Black Summer (Netflix) reviewed,TV,https://medium.com/@barnaby.page/the-suburban-dead-black-summer-netflix-reviewed-111c485e73fc?source=topic_page---------12------------------1," Black Summer, a brief and lean zombie-apocalypse series that surfaced on Netflix earlier this year, might have passed almost unnoticed into the great morass of streaming back-catalogue if it hadn’t been for the plaudits delivered on Twitter by Stephen King. “Existential hell in the suburbs, stripped to the bone,” he called it, and justifiably: Black Summer is about as far from the overwrought affectations of The Walking Dead (with its characters perpetually wallowing in that strange mixture of self-pity and self-congratulation) as you can imagine. “No long, fraught discussions. No endless flashbacks, because there’s no back story,” as King observed. It is rather far from King’s own style, too. The characters are not just ordinary but almost bland, seemingly only sketched by the scriptwriters, with the actors left to fill in their humanity; and although space and distance are fundamental to the show’s power, there is little sense of place as such. If the people are everyman, the location is anywhere. Set in the early weeks after the appearance of zombies, Black Summer eschews the picturesque, weed-infested collapsed-civilisation aesthetic of many such shows. It was mostly shot in Calgary, a large but nondescript city in western Canada (I am allowed to call Calgary nondescript because I grew up in Edmonton, its arch-rival to the north), and its very first images give us a taste of the atmosphere to come: as a government warning siren sounds in the background, we see uncomplicated, unfussy shots of an ordinary residential street on a bright day, deserted and so still that they might as well be photos. This is the real horror in Black Summer: the fact that the streets which should be full of dog walkers and suburbanites’ cars and kids on bikes, which should be accompanied by TVs heard from windows and shouts heard from back yards, are so empty and silent. The fast-moving zombies are well thought-out and unnerving, but they are not Black Summer’s focus. What is truly disturbing to its characters, and therefore to us, is the utter up-ending of normalcy, the way that everything which provided security is so suddenly gone, just like that. It is not far, perhaps, from the bleak horror toward the end of Frank Darabont’s King adaptation The Mist, when Thomas Jane’s protagonist accepts that the monsters have won, and the survivors are doomed. It is certainly a good deal more genuinely chilling than any number of leering, hammed-up sadistic supervillains. From those empty streets, Black Summer (which comes from many of the same people as Z Nation but has nothing else in common with that show) takes us through eight episodes — each divided into several, individually titled acts — that track a small number of survivors, notably a mother separated from her daughter and a criminal posing as a soldier. These recurring characters, and their quest for a stadium where (supposedly) the authorities have established a safe haven, give shape to the series. But it is not afraid to leave them for a while, or to dawdle along the way, sometimes reflectively, sometimes in action sequences of great tension. Two of the most effective passages in the series, for example, are sidelines like this. In one of these, a character is trapped briefly on top of a school bus by a pursuing zombie; this is gripping, with a real feeling of peril (something that’s much enhanced in Black Summer by the way that none of the ensemble cast is an obviously unkillable star). In another, the same character encounters a dog, and tries to persuade it to stay with him. The guy is lonely (yes, that happens during zombie apocalypses too), and it’s desperately poignant. These quieter moments — and there are many of them — along with the sparse, naturalistic dialogue make the action sequences all the more impactful when they do erupt, often filmed in handheld style with unremitting motion and urgency. But they are never large-scale, in terms of people or geography: Black Summer conveys much better than most works in the post-apoc genre just how small and vulnerable the survivor groups are, and how moving even short distances can be fraught with danger. And in many of its best set-pieces, notably one in a school (episode 3, with Lord of the Flies overtones) and another in a diner (episode 5, perhaps the highlight of the series), it makes outstanding use of confined locations, too. The sense of being trapped by a few walls, as much as the daunting empty world beyond, conveys the impotence of the survivors. Underlining all this is a fine score from the prolific but little-known Alan Puro. Often there is silence, often Puro provides no more than a hint of sound, but it escalates to a noisy, formless intensity at crucial points, as uneasy and uncomfortable as the characters’ new environment. Smart and subtle touches — for example slight hints of vocalisation, or the way that the music almost blends with the zombies’ moans for a moment — add to the eeriness. Just as the score is expressive without being explicit, and the action-led sequences are full-on without being melodramatic, Black Summer is not, as King noted, big on grand speeches. Dialogue is limited and mostly functional; indeed, one main character can barely speak English, while another is deaf. Most of the time, they’re too scared to wax eloquent, yet this — coupled with consistently fine performances — makes them all the more believable. Even if we can never deeply identify with them as individuals, we can imagine ourselves in their plight, and it’s not pleasant. But it is compelling, haunting, and human.

Medium.com,Arts & Entertainment,"For Those Who Are About to Die, We Reboot You: “Arrow” Approaching the Crisis",TV,https://medium.com/@markdonohue/for-those-who-are-about-to-die-we-reboot-you-arrow-approaching-the-crisis-1c966c50ab5f?source=topic_page---------13------------------1," There has never been a time when I would describe it as my favorite show, or felt deeply moved by any of its various cast changes and allegiance shifts, but Arrow has been a reliable companion the past several years. Even in its more narratively slack periods, it’s always been good at delivering professionally staged, nicely shot practical action sequences and square-jawed hero monologues. At its core, Stephen Amell, Emily Bett Rickards, and David Ramsay are extremely good in their roles. They’ve had many excellent, even overqualified actors step in as villains throughout the years, and many more one-off guest performances so terrible that they arguably contributed even more (positively) to the tone of the show. As the series’ universe has expanded, it’s embraced the fan spirit of its once-distant comic book origins and taken to the surprise cameos and back-from-the-dead twists that reward people who watch these things closely and repeatedly. It’s been outdone on occasion by individual seasons of its spinoff children (The Flash was briefly great, Legends of Tomorrow has quietly been one of the best shows on television for a while now after starting poorly), but it’s never been terrible. I never finished a single season of any of Netflix’s Marvel shows, and I finally tapped out on Legion two episodes into its last year. Agents of SHIELD bounced off me completely. The Rook put me asleep three times during its second episode. You couldn’t pay me to watch another Westworld. But I’ve never thought about quitting Arrow, even at times in the sixth and seventh seasons where it seemed out of juice. It’s just good enough even when it’s bad, and it keeps me up to date for the annual crossovers. For a show that has always been repetitive by design, Arrow has thrown out the playbook for its last season. It might be true that an eighth and final year only exists because it’s needed to erect the scaffolding for the gigantic five-show Crisis on Infinite Earths event, beginning next month, that the CW has been promoting for two solid years, but Arrow’s writing team has embraced the opportunity. It’s dredging freely through the show’s long history in a fashion that’s not a nostalgia play, but increasingly a sincere critique. Arrow has always had a weakness when it comes to deviating from its formula. It’s so clearly a show that works best when following a certain template that its efforts over the years to try and force shifts have always fallen flat. Take Oliver’s abdication and flirtation with the League of Assassins in S3, or Oliver and Felicity’s estrangement in S4, or S6’s break-up of Team Arrow, or Oliver’s prison sentence at the beginning of S7. In all these cases, the changes in the status quo felt so obviously temporary that it was difficult to get invested in the storytelling. Before too long, Oliver, Dig, and Felicity would be back together fighting one nemesis or another, with or without the assistance of a fungible crew of sidekicks. Season Seven was especially disappointing on this end. Its major innovation, flash-forwards to a future storyline where Oliver’s kids and a couple of aged-up supporting characters fought a criminal conspiracy in their own era, turned out to be a dud. Either they were backdoor-piloting a spinoff that nobody wants to see, or the writers were just addicted to the convenience of getting to eat up three or four scenes every episode with uncomplicated stories that didn’t have to tie in to the present-day action or involve any of the established regulars. But hold that thought. Season Eight seemed like an improvement from the beginning. It was sad but necessary that the story finally dispensed with Felicity, who had carried Arrow’s exposition, comic relief, and emotional weight adroitly since the first season. I don’t think I realized until she was absent how often Felicity behaved as Oliver’s backstop, explaining to him repeatedly why he was coming across as a jerk long after he should have been able to sense that for himself. Oliver in Felicity’s absence has had to figure out more of his problems on his own, and even in just a few shows we’ve seen a great deal of long-delayed character growth. Amell is pretty good at playing Oliver Queen as a man who feels strongly that he has to project emotional detachment at all times, as opposed to a man with no emotions at all. In a handful of new episodes, we’ve seen him break composure much more often than usual, feeling the weight of his separation from his wife and children and the burden of his final mission. In a series of scenes with Diggle, Laurel, and Thea, we’ve seen more and more of his compassionate side. A more self-aware Oliver has been the secret sauce to a final season structured as a world tour through the Green Arrow’s past adventures. Incorporating time travel, alternate dimensions, ancient prophecies, and alien deities with a wild abandon the show was originally too stuffy to embrace, each of the new Arrow episodes this year has been a deliberate callback to an earlier season. The premiere, “Starling City,” sent Oliver to an Earth where he was still thought lost on Lian Yu and reunited him with his mother and Tommy Merlyn in scenes pulled directly from the pilot. “Welcome to Hong Kong” returned Oliver to the site of Season Three’s flashbacks, then “Leap of Faith” moved him to over to the mythical Nanda Parbat, where the present-timeline climax of the third season took place. In “Present Tense,” a gang of terrorists dressed like Oliver’s greatest nemesis, Deathstroke from Season Two, and led by his son attacked the city. (One sociopath dressed in a mask inspiring an entire army of them has an unintentional echo in the very buzzy new HBO Watchmen series. But Arrow has done so in continuity, not with a reboot. Give it some credit already.) Even though the show is now moving at a rapid pace, it’s still finding time for beats where Oliver considers how he and his situation have changed since the last time he set foot in all of these various locales. Encountering his sister in Nanda Parbat, he’s able for the first time to see her as a peer instead of a dependent. He’s more empathetic to how he has used old allies like Tatsu and Talia for his own ends, and he has a new sympathy for villains like China White now that he’s deeply involved in questionable behavior on behalf of a larger cause he doesn’t entirely understand. Snarky asides from returning regulars like Curtis and Thea indicate that the show’s writers aren’t blind to its missteps, and can be affectionately critical of its ridiculousness. The increased stakes and accelerated pace help devices that Arrow has been leaning on since forever feel fresh. Nearly every season has had at least one Diggle feature episode that’s more espionage and techno-thriller-oriented than Arrow is typically. “Leap of Faith” has exactly that in a subplot where Diggle and Lyla chase arms dealers from Hong Kong to Kasnia in fancy dress. It’s fun like it always is (Ramsay and Audrey Marie Anderson have great, grown-up chemistry) but what’s new is the way it cuts directly to masked ninjas playing pyrotechnic hopscotch over in Oliver and Thea’s storyline. Arrow hasn’t historically juggled tones this loosely, but it’s a pleasant late development that it can now stack a Tom Clancy riff against an Indiana Jones lift and have both benefit from the contrast. Over these first three episodes, the continuing flash-forwards featuring Mia, William, Rene’s daughter Zoe, and Diggle’s sons Connor and JJ were the weak link. Charlie Barnett from Russian Doll was another great choice of villain, but other than that, the blue-tinged adventures of Future Team Arrow didn’t seem to have any obvious link to the dimension-hopping craziness taking place back in 2019. But then Arrow embraced chaos in the way Legends of Tomorrow has learned how to do, taking the license its expanded universe justifies to do absolutely anything and pushing it to the limit. There’s a flash at the conclusion of “Leap” and the Arrow Jr. team are suddenly in the same room as the present-day heroes. Why? Who cares? It’s narrative gold! Oliver has to deal with his long-lost son and the daughter he abandoned as an infant. Diggle has to contend with his biological son becoming a supervillain and the existence of a foster child he didn’t know existed yet. “Present Tense” gets right into it with this stuff, which has to chafe the writers on The Flash who whiffed entirely on a similar arc. Oliver and William finally have a satisfying father-son talk after years of the younger William being merely an inconvenience. Rene has something interesting to do for the first time in years. Katherine McNamara’s Mia is not a particularly cuddly character, but her combination of violence, ill temper, and silly magazine-cover hair remind me so much of peak Buffy Summers that I’m board for her prickliness. Additionally, after misusing Katie Cassidy for close to a decade, they’ve finally arrived at a version of Laurel Lance — snappy, blonde, chaotic good — that’s fun to watch. In the last season! There’s speculation that Cassidy might get to go on to a Birds of Prey spinoff, or better yet, Legends. If she wants to do it, she deserves it after all the terrible writing she’s been subjected to over the years. Arrow in Season Eight is finding ways to turn weaknesses into strengths. It’s not something the show has often done willingly. It’s a show that has stubbornly stuck with characters that didn’t work — like Roy, or Ricardo Diaz, or original-flavor Laurel — for years with no clear reason. If its siblings The Flash and Supergirl are sometimes too willing to jettison the plan for a season and call an audible if a storyline or an actor isn’t working out, Arrow tends to go down with the ship. And that’s something it seems to be reconsidering as it approaches its end. It’s not too common a thing for a genre TV show to spend its last season turning the mirror on itself, although rhetorically it seems like an obvious move. These characters ought to be asking themselves why it is that despite their best efforts to foster peace, they end up facing off against a maniacal criminal mastermind every spring. Arrow in Seasons Six and Seven seemed more than a little bit like it was despairing in the face of its own cyclical nature. The flash-forwards did a very bad job of supporting the notion that any of Oliver’s heroics were making a long-term impact, even while the seventh-season finale optimistically gave itself the title “You Have Saved This City.” In this most recent episode in particular, the writers seem through their characters to directly be addressing the idea that they need to do things differently to bring about permanent change. Shown direct evidence of a bad future for themselves and their children, Oliver, Rene, Dinah, Diggle, and company exercise some self-reflection and start to ask whether their old behaviors need to change. Season Eight pitched itself like it was going to be a means to an end, Oliver following The Monitor’s instructions to an inevitable noble demise. But maybe it isn’t that. At the very least it has its heroes acting more alive than they have in ages. Perhaps it took the destruction of an entire other Earth (and a whole battalion of tertiary Flash characters, not that anyone cares) to wake them up. Maybe things won’t pay off as thoughtfully and elegantly as it seems they may now. But still I want to give the producers of an eight-year-old cult show on a sexy-teen network credit for approaching their ending thoughtfully, rather than playing out the string on cruise control. There’s rarely a great reward for it! Lost tried to do something comparable at the end and enraged its entire audience. Buffy the Vampire Slayer had the broad strokes of a question-the-system, break-the-cycle final season worked out, but it badly bungled the execution. Arrow’s legacy is secure. There are going to be shows where great-looking guys and girls in tight costumes and masks punch Nazis for years to come. But it would be a very nice message to send in the wake of Crisis on Infinite Earths that beyond all of this TV-14 violence is the potential for lasting growth and change."

Are you a “Geller football rivalry” person? a “Rachel’s beef trifle” person? a “special guest star Brad Pitt” person who hasn’t rewatched that episode in a few years and forgot that the episode’s culminating punchline is that Rachel was once known as “the hermaphrodite cheerleader from Long Island”? I am here to tell you that one HAS NOT AGED WELL. Consider switching camps and joining me as a “special guest star Christina Applegate” person. It’s so much better over here. (Also, watch Dead to Me.) But as Pumpkin Spice Season gradually gives way to Red Cup Season at Central Perk — fancy overpriced espresso beverages being the only thing we basic bitches love more than thinking way too much about 90’s sitcoms — I strongly encourage you not to neglect the other slice of the Friends holiday episode canon: Christmas, New Year’s, and Hanukkah (that’s right, despite Monica’s opulently-decorated trees, every once in awhile the show actually remembers the Gellers are Jewish). Ten thousand words of plot analysis ranking eleven episodes of a television show which has been off the air for fifteen years is certainly not everyone’s cup of tea, but as someone whose entire online brand is Inappropriately Strong Opinions About Friends, I’m just going to trust those folks to self-select out, and proceed accordingly. For everyone else: could I be any more excited to start this list? Let’s go!"
Medium.com,Arts & Entertainment,Limetown is back with new layers,TV,https://medium.com/pop-off/limetown-is-back-with-new-layers-689d8d56ab59?source=topic_page---------16------------------1," Limetown is a new TV show on Facebook Watch that brings a lot of surprises on face value. Jessica Biel is still rad after a quiet period in her career, Facebook may be able to compete with the streaming gods, fictional podcasts can crossover to a bigger stage, etc. And for those reasons alone, it is intriguing. The show is built upon the base of a podcast that had a moment in the spotlight several years ago, around the same time Serial went viral. It followed the same format of a reporter digging into an old mystery, interviewing voices that had laid dormant for years, with each interview revealing another lead that kept the audience locked in. There have been quite a few shows that have mimicked Serial to find success, but Limetown was different in one fundamental way: it was entirely a work of fiction. I listened to this podcast in 2015 without knowing that vital difference and became one of the thousands of idiots who googled the phrase “Is Limetown real?” to find that my gullibility was very real. If anything, the realization set the hook deeper. The show ended on an insane cliff hanger back in 2015 and never came back for a second season. The writers knew they had something special and were determined to bring Limetown to a new medium and a larger audience. I’ll be honest, for four years I forgot the show and my disappointment with the lack of closure. As I waited for a bus a few weeks ago, I turned to my right to find Jessica Beal, bathed in an eerie blue light, staring up at the word “LIMETOWN”. In my disbelief, I almost googled “Is Limetown real?” to see if this cult podcast was indeed back with an A-list actress attached to it. I immediately watched the first four episodes released on Facebook Watch. The show was not only just as good as I remembered but so much more profound. TV allowed for the character of Lia Haddock to have off-air relationships that we had never known, and interactions with her employer at American Public Radio that made the investigation feel even more critical. It is an absolute joy to see this side-hustle project become something more real with a production budget to boot. So here’s my official endorsement to watch the show. If you haven’t seen it yet, stop here, because the spoilers are everything, and I’m about to unload several of them. What has stuck with me, especially after the release of Episodes 7 & 8, is a feeling of true haunting. The podcast left you with a mix of wonderful mystery and disdain for secret organizations, which the new medium maintains easily. The show adds another layer, however, with the ability to build characters outside of their voices. Television can show flashbacks instead of telling them, feel raw reactions from the reporters instead of their calm and direct radio voices. In episode 3, Lia Haddock interviews a man she believes this linked to Limetown, following a clue about a man who killed ‘them’ in the town of Rake, Wyoming. The man is hated in Rake because he is believed to be the man who murdered three little girls a decade before in a barn fire. Through Lia’s interview with this man, he tells his story, in excruciating detail, about the day he came upon the barn already fully ablaze during a hike. “Anyway I heard screams and so I ran over. And the fire was spreading fast but it wasn’t… they were pushing on the door but there was something blocking them from getting it open wide enough and… the screams were scared but not… I could’ve forced that door open. I didn’t. Instead, I just rested my hands against them, and I watched. They got quiet when they saw me, I remember, cause that’s when I learned how loud fire can be. At first, they screamed for me to help. I didn’t. And they pushed as hard as they could, but they’re just little girls. I heard the fire get louder, and that’s when their screams became something else. Something more… like an animal from that part of your brain that you only get to know right before the end when you’ve experienced physical suffering beyond comprehension. The sound of the demon calling you home.” He finishes this story with a moral, as any good children’s story does. “I learned something about myself that I wouldn’t have learned in any other way. It was an answer [to the biggest question] there is. Am I capable? Spend a lot of your life wondering that… how far you would go… where your line is… I don’t wonder that anymore.” I’ll pause for one second to allow that to sink in. This man killed three girls by allowing their predicament to continue when he had the means to pull them to safety. There was no premeditation. Someone else did that part, and we never find out who or why. The fire itself ends up meaning absolutely nothing to the investigation. It doesn’t matter, because the writers set up this scenario for a reason. They want you to focus on the particular brand of evil the man from Rake, Wyoming, is selling. Later in the show, our fearless reporter Lia has taken a darker edge as she chases shadows that are following her and killing everyone in her wake. After her colleague Mark demands the investigation stop, he hits his head in an altercation of wills and morals, and Lia watches him bleed out on the floor with the phone in her hand, ready to dial 911. But she doesn’t. She watches it happen, realizes the freedom Mark’s death would give her in finding answers, and is suspended in time as her friend dies right in front of her. As the story climaxes upon another high-action interview gone south, one that Mark disapproved of, she comes to the same realization as the man from Rake, Wyoming. “Mark Green is a good man. He was a good man and he didn’t deserve what happened to him but… and I know this now… Because I learned something about myself that I would never have learned in any other way. I would do it again.” The parallels are shocking. This woman is supposed to be our protagonist. A deeply disturbed protagonist, yes, but she is the one we are all here for. We knew she had some issues before this point, but we are learning along with Lia just how far those issues will push her. What I find most interesting is the circumstances of these two events. There’s a clear theme here of people pushing the boundaries and learning just how far they can go, how much blood they can stand on their conscience, yet they’re always surprised. The twisted element is that all of these situations result from passive actions on the part of the offender. The man walked up on the barn. Lia did not mean for Mark to fall in a way that would result in his death. But when presented with that situation, they acted outside of their means. The message here is an interesting one. Humans like to say ‘I would never,’ but what are the writers saying in contradiction? ‘I would never’ implies a lack of opportunity? We are all so worried about our self-interest that we have forgotten all concepts of learned ethics? Or, to flip the script back on the academics of Limetown, do we push too far in the name of progress and then cover it up when the side effects are unexpected? The stakes have been dangled at an all-time high to close out episode 8, and there will be more harrowing revelations to come."

Medium.com,Arts & Entertainment,A Road Trip with Jonathan Van Ness,TV,https://medium.com/@aaronhicklin/a-road-trip-with-jonathan-van-ness-46c5d013651d?source=topic_page---------19------------------1," The charismatic star of hit TV show Queer Eye had a troubled and chaotic early life. Here he talks about his journey to fame, and deciding to come out as HIV positive. The words “smoky lavender” appear twice in Over the Top, a memoir by Jonathan Van Ness, the most fabulous of the so-called Fab Five on Queer Eye, the hyperventilating makeover show in which he stars. The first time it is used to describe the skin color of a gun-toting meth addict he encounters during a stint as a sex worker in Tucson. The second to describe the color of the thigh-high boots worn by the hair stylist at a salon he lands at in Los Angeles in 2008. He is 19. Later, Jane Fonda, a customer, tells Van Ness his hair makes him look like Jesus. Between these two smoky lavenders is a gulf that separates two versions of Van Ness: the garrulous, sassy, resident groomer of Queer Eye — and the emotionally bruised, risk-taking addict. As he warns readers midway through the book, “Buckle up, buttercup, because I can go from comedy to tragedy in three seconds flat.” Van Ness and I are in a Cadillac sedan, driving past the tangled, rusting architecture of Philadelphia’s suburbs. Travelling like this is normal for him — on Queer Eye, he gets to roam the country waving his wand and transforming lives. The show, which was brought out of cold storage last year after an 11-year hiatus, has been a surprising success. America, it seems, is hungry for its uplifting brand of magic. A lot of that comes down to Van Ness, the show’s foremost cheerleader for Queer Eye’s stated mission of turning red (Republican) states pink, “one makeover at a time”. It’s Van Ness who brings the energy to the party, Yass queening his way through each episode, scattering memes and neologisms wherever he goes, and generally helping people connect to their feelings, often by tapping into his own. Tears are never far below the surface. Resistance is futile. Everyone loves him. Van Ness has a hectic, energetic style and a voice that soars high and then higher. In the car he talks quickly, words tumbling out of his mouth in a way that can leave you trailing far behind. When I ask if any of his encounters on Queer Eye have changed him, he answers: “The act of showing up for your family and being able to live in the world I think is heroic. There’s like 15 bajillion eggs in the ovaries and who even knows how many, like, little spermies are in there, so the fact we got to be born and be living this long is kind of like a mathematical who-knew.” This is, I think, a roundabout way of saying we all deserve to be acknowledged. But things are way more fun when Van Ness says them. For our meeting, I’d taken the train from New York to Philadelphia, where Van Ness was filming an episode of the show, with vague plans to walk to the Liberty Bell. But he’d just received a 24-hour reprieve from work and, shortly before arriving, his publicist suggested I drive back to New York with him. Sitting in the back of a car with someone you’ve never met can be awkward, and I was conflicted. But Van Ness disarms with charm. A pop culture magpie, he slides from subject to subject and dares you to keep up. How he finds time to watch so much, know so much, work so much, is a conundrum. Lately, he has learned to meditate as a way to manage his stress. “On Sundays I sometimes don’t work,” he says. We are on route 95 somewhere outside of Philadelphia, and as we navigate the traffic we admire his latest manicure, each nail painted to represent a different cast member of the 1996 comedy, The First Wives Club, a touchstone for Van Ness. “This is Goldie Hawn getting her lips done,” he says, as he lifts a finger for inspection. We talk about cats — he has four, including Liza Meownelli, who clearly wins the prize for best name; and we watch an old video that surfaced late last year on The Jimmy Kimmel Show. In it the 11-year old Van Ness performs an interpretative dance to Jewel’s “Pieces of You” — his entry in the school talent show. For the number, he wore a Kabuki mask positioned on the back of his head and a baggy black t-shirt emblazoned with a question mark. The piece culminates in a triple-axel-style pirouette that is so wholehearted, so gutsy, and so precious that it’s heartbreaking. At the time, his mother gently suggested that he might want to reconsider. The other kids, she said, would not let him live it down. But when had they ever? “I have been able to identify with the female experience because I come from a home where my family was broken.” Part of the reason Van Ness identifies with movies like The First Wives Club is, of course, its peerless cast (Bette Midler, Goldie Hawn, and Diane Keaton at their peak), but it springs, too, from a deep well of empathy for the characters. He was four when his parents divorced after his father was caught out having an affair. “I have been able to identify with the female experience because I come from a home where my family was broken, and my mom was hurt by my dad, and a lot of women in my family experienced that,” he says. “The feeling of betrayal that those women face, I felt from my city. What he also knew, early on, was that the world of women was more interesting to him than the world of men. He recalls at the age of four telling a friend of his father’s that he wanted to be a cabana girl or a cosmetologist when he grew up. As an adult, he would gravitate to “gender queer” to express his place in the world, but that wasn’t an option in childhood. A particularly dismaying story conjures his father’s war on his son’s gender exploration. “I remember very clearly my dad finding me in an evening gown with my two cousins,” he says. “He tore me out of the dress, holding me in the air so that I was perpendicular to the ground. I was terrified.” But there were pockets of joy, too. Joining the junior varsity cheerleading squad at high school at 14 was an epiphany — he felt at home immediately. When I make the faux pas of forgetting who starred in Bring It On, the cult 1999 cheerleading movie, Van Ness gasps. “I could almost throw you out of the back of this car for asking such a preposterous question,” he says. “So, you’re telling me you came to this interview not having seen Bring It On? What were you doing?” I daren’t tell Van Ness that I have also not watched Game of Thrones, the show that gave rise to his hugely popular recap series, Gay of Thrones — a springboard for his showbiz career. In season four of Queer Eye, viewers saw Van Ness return to his high school in Quincy to makeover his arts teacher, Cathy Dooley, a beloved figure who stood out for not making him feel different or unusual. The cameras show Van Ness performing with the cheerleading squad as students clap and whoop. It’s a moving spectacle that implies a circle has been closed. Everyone loves queer people now, even in Quincy. But what we see on screen is not the whole truth. A few weeks before the Fab Five arrived, the school had asked parents to sign permission slips for their children to be on camera, prompting protests from a local pastor. “He sent a letter to the newspaper that blasted the normalization of LGBTQ culture, and said we should not be rolling out the welcome mats at a public school,” Van Ness says. “It was just a really nasty letter.” Nor was it just any old pastor. “This was someone who was like a family friend, someone I’d known for a very long time.” He looks glum. “I don’t think we’ve come as far as I wished and hoped that we had.” “I cussed my dad out 300 of the days of 2016… Our relationship literally was on thin ice over that election.” Leaving small town America in order to be fully himself, only to find being fully himself is what brings him back to small town America, is an irony not lost on Van Ness. “It’s a little bit Gift of the Magi,” he says. But he also knows Quincy is his secret weapon because “even the most Republican-ass Trump supporter is someone I have grown up next door to”. Or even grown up with. Three years ago, he had to work hard to convince his father not to vote for Trump. “I cussed my dad out 300 of the days of 2016,” he says. “Our relationship literally was on thin ice over that election.” In the end, Van Ness Senior voted for Gary Johnson, the nominee for the Libertarian party. “I was really proud of him for it,” he says. When the original Queer Eye premiered on the Bravo channel in 2003, it was a more straightforward makeover show inspired by advice columns in Esquire magazine. Where it was radical was in the casting of five confident, unapologetic gay men to dish advice to hapless straight men. But people rarely cried and there was little talk of self-care. “I was just trying to get guys out of pleated khakis and to get them to cut off their mullets,” says Carson Kressley, who starred in the original. “I don’t think any of us thought the show had any sort of idea about making a political statement.” The 2018 reboot, on Netflix, repackaged the Fab Five as social missionaries spreading the gospel of love around America. A masterstroke was to take the guys out of New York, where the original show had been located, and into the heartland states that voted for Donald Trump in 2016. In a fractured society, the show would open minds by showing that our similarities were greater than our differences. Or, as another of the Fab Five, Karamo Brown, said in the opening episode of season one: “We’ve all got to come together in a way we can understand each other.” There have been four seasons of Queer Eye since its debut in February 2018 and a new one will drop early next year. The show’s hosts have not wasted time, assiduously attending to their brand while they still enjoy the spotlight. Three have published books this year and this month it’s the turn of Van Ness. His memoir, Over the Top, could have been a ghostwriter’s gift, packed with his witticisms and mantras for self-care. Instead it’s a lightning bolt — devastating and stirring, powered by years of anguish and humiliation. Does he worry how fans will react to his own revelations? “I’m scared,” he admits. “But I’m ready to pull the Band Aid off.” For Van Ness, Over the Top is about charting his own path through adolescence towards the triumph that is Queer Eye, but it’s also about owning — and thereby defusing — two of the most traumatic chapters in his life. The first occurred when he was four, when an older boy molested him in a closet. Van Ness tells his parents but it’s written off as “experimentation” and swiftly passed over. That single act of abuse casts a long, pernicious shadow over the book as we witness the ways in which Van Ness acts out his confusion and pain, from taking crystal meth, to sustained binges in sex clubs that satisfy his need to be wanted. He joins a 12-step program for sex addiction, but relapses. In the midst of all that, his stepfather, Steve, is diagnosed with bladder cancer, and told he has 11 months to live. His death, when it comes, knocks Van Ness back into the unhealthy behavior he’s been working to quit. “Everything that happened to me that summer will always be painful to think about,” he says. “It was like saying goodbye to so much of what I wanted.” Shortly after the funeral, his former boyfriend tracked him down at a bathhouse in St Louis and Van Ness’s fall to rock bottom seems complete. Almost. When he gets sick, collapsing at the hair salon he is working at one afternoon, he already knows what a doctor will tell him a day later: he is HIV positive. Van Ness writes about these bombshells with a quiet tenacity that skirts melodrama. He wonders if his reckless behavior was a self-fulfilling prophecy, the consequence of all the fear ingrained in him at such a young age. He wants other people not to have to go through the same thing. “It occurred to me: what if everything I’ve ever been through was preparing me for this moment — to be strong enough to share this, and to share it on my own terms,” he says. “Part of that for me is to process what’s happened, but the bigger part is that I wanted to do something to move the conversation forward in a meaningful way around HIV/Aids, and what it is to live with HIV, and to humanise and normalise a lot of the things I talk about.” He blinks, then adds, “I’m talking slow because I’m trying not to cry.” We are nearing New York, and the canyons of Manhattan fill the hazy skyline. Growing up, Van Ness used to fantasise he would help other people like himself. “I always felt that was part of my purpose,” he says. “But I thought it would be a really chic juice studio with great baked goods, maybe a dance and yoga studio.” He didn’t think the way he’d help people was simply by being himself on a global TV show — or by penning a generous and frank memoir. At a certain point, Van Ness picked himself up and decided he didn’t want to throw away his life. “It really took some time to figure out how to put my life together,” he says. But medical advances mean the virus is now undetectable in his blood. He remembers the day he was given his HIV diagnosis, asking the doctor if he could still live to be 75. “She was, like, ‘I will keep you alive long enough to die of a heart attack or cancer like everyone else,’ and then she laughed uncontrollably.” Is he making time for relationships? Van Ness shakes his head. “In the past, I’ve had relationships with people who I was almost using to validate myself and my existence, and that’s not been a great plan for me,” he says. “So, this is a season of me falling in love with myself all the way.” In some ways, he thinks that testing positive for HIV has been his liberation. In the past year, he has taken up ice-skating and thrown himself into gymnastics. And, of course, there is an election to fight. “I absolutely do not think I’d have been as socially aware or conscious or want to make as much of a difference,” he says. “It gave me a reason to really fight.” This piece originally ran in The Observer/Guardian UK (a few lines cut for space have been reinstated)"

(Spoilers obviously follow.) After spending the rest of the season in the mid-1980s, we abruptly jump forward to 2019. Vincent (James Franco), one of the series’ central characters, is sitting in a Manhattan hotel room. We see that the show’s subject matter — pornography but also bartending in New York — has become thoroughly mundane and regulated, just part of the room service. Disgusted, Vincent leaves to walk around Times Square — the modern Times Square, full of tourists and wealth, not the sleazy district in which he once thrived. A cover of “Sidewalks of New York”, a turn-of-the-20th-century ballad covered by members of Blondie (who also contribute the season’s opening theme, “Dreaming”) plays. As he walks, Vincent sees glimpses of people he once knew, people that are long dead and gone but appear to him just as they once did. They are all buried beneath the square’s hyper-modernity, but remain a part of its foundation, haunting the sterile surface. In a way, this scene embodies everything that David Simon, George Pelecanos and the other creators of The Deuce hoped to do with the show. The series reveals the psychogeography of both New York and the modern sex industry, the accumulation of stories remembered and forgotten that makes up a place. Even in Times Square, designed to banish any sense of history or tragedy (one prominently-featured window is a nonsensical sequence of letters), history still reappears. Simon and his collaborators’ approach, ranging from the epic The Wire to smaller pieces like Show Me A Hero, has always been to translate a kind of sociological history to television. The shows star individuals, but they are individuals who are generally not in control of their own fate, instead being buffeted from place to place by prevailing social forces. This unfolds in the finale of The Deuce too, in almost didactic fashion: characters talk about the political wrangle of the AIDS crisis, real estate interests, and technological changes which all bring about the end of quasi-legal sex work in Manhattan. And so, despite all the memorable characters, perhaps it’s best that the city itself has the last word. Perhaps the most important character for this sociological approach is Maggie Gyllenhall’s Eileen, also known as Candy. Eileen represents the best-case scenario for women who became involved with pornography in the 1970s and 80s. She’s able to move behind the camera, becoming a director. She describes her work as “femme erotica”, trying to fight the patriarchal nature of the genre. Out of everyone producing film, she’s the only one who seems likely to make anything worthwhile. In the second season, we saw Eileen create a feminist-minded, cinematic porno movie, and it seemed to suggest the possibilities of the new medium. But by the mid-80s, everything has moved to VHS, and no one feels the need to dress up the sex with storylines and themes. Depressed by this shift, Eileen starts making a film about how women are exploited and objectified by a patriarchal society — not just sex workers, but waitresses, secretaries, and just about everyone else. It’s a completely unpalatable message for porn, and the attempt to do the movie X-rated never quite comes together. We learn in the epilogue that Eileen did eventually finish the film, as a straight-up arthouse project. This choice reflects, I think, Simon’s distrust of genre elements, especially post-The Wire. Having watched an audience turn his sociological study of Baltimore into a font for quotes and memes seems to have pushed Simon even further from conventional plot satisfaction. (A similar thing happened to David Chase in the later seasons of The Sopranos, and to a lesser extent Vince Gilligan.) Audiences have responded accordingly. I would suggest, then, that Eileen’s movie A Pawn in Their Game is a stand-in for The Deuce as text: an uncompromising, uncommercially bleak breakdown of social problems. Its fate, releasing in obscurity but being belatedly recognized as a masterpiece, is the closest thing to a happy ending Simon can imagine. A film, or a TV show, can’t change the world, but it can exist with integrity as its own little bubble of truth. And yet, the third season of The Deuce continually calls into question Eileen’s integrity. In one scene, she attempts to screen Red Hot for a group of anti-pornography feminists, and none other than Andrea Dworkin admonishes her for putting a friendly face on the exploitation of women. Afterwards, Abby says that Dworkin is an asshole, but Eileen remarks that it’s something she needed to hear, and this seems to be the show’s position on the anti-pornography movement: unpleasant assholes, but not entirely off the mark in their assessment of the industry. Perhaps the clearest case of Eileen’s failure is how she treats Lori, the star of Red Hot and would-be attraction of A Pawn in Their Game. Lori is at the inevitable end of her pornographic career, finding herself cast in rougher scenes and scrounging for extra money at local strip clubs. She’s looking for any kind of meaning outside of her life as a sex object, but Eileen is so determined to see that life as a positive that she tramples over Lori’s feelings. And so Lori kills herself, in one of the most bracing television scenes in a long while. No matter how noble her intentions, Eileen is still implicated in a system of exploitation. This, too, can be read as The Deuce speaking about itself: Simon has been open about the set’s early difficulties shooting nudity and sex scenes respectfully, and of course there’s the miasma of allegations of exploitation surrounding star James Franco. And, no matter what its critique of capitalism, The Deuce is still ultimately part of the most bourgeois brand of telecom giant Time-Warner. Even these compromises, the series suggests, are becoming increasingly untenable. The Deuce feels like the last remnant of the “golden age” sociological shows that dominated critics’ lists (if not ratings) in the 2000s and early 2010s. Like the titular New York neighbourhood, that era of television was a compromised institution, but one that allowed for the lives of working people and for occasional moments of true expression. But television has been gentrified just as New York has, with gritty dramas replaced by expensive genre programming. (While the modern-day Vince is flipping channels, one can hear the theme song from Game of Thrones.) HBO has thus far shown loyalty and patience with Simon and company’s unsexy programming, but despite positive reviews The Deuce (like Treme and The Wire before it) hasn’t received much in terms of awards or ratings. Like most of the shows I’ve loved on HBO this past decade, it ended on Monday nights in obscurity. Most likely there’s some bean-counter at Time-Warner thinking that if Simon can’t make a hit about sex and crime with movie stars,he’s not going to make a hit about anything. So when Vincent descends into the New York subway (another great, compromised system), perhaps this is a coda not just to the series but to realist, sociological television as a going concern. As the song winds down, the viewer is subsumed by not a social system but a mass of individuals. We get a glimpse of someone who might be Abby, and seems to now be a high-powered attorney. There will always be TV shows about people like her, and the trendy young people we see around her. But for a brief period, there were shows about the rest of us."
Medium.com,Arts & Entertainment,What Amazon Prime Video’s “Modern Love” Got Right About Mental Illness,TV,https://medium.com/@olutunuoyelola/what-amazon-prime-videos-modern-love-got-right-about-mental-illness-712f068f9763?source=topic_page---------24------------------1," The third episode of Modern Love, aptly titled Take Me As I Am, Whoever I Am, starts off with Anne Hathaway’s character Lexi waking up EXCITED to take on the day. She’s dressed to the nines for so early in the morning — with a full face beat and a shimmering sequin top no less. She has boundless energy and she is the dictionary definition of “bright eyed and bushy tailed”. I immediately recognize this as a manic episode but my TV show buddy, Moroun, does not. Lexi is bipolar and I’m not (just the casual cocktail of depression and anxiety over here, though I’ve previously been asked to consider a bipolar diagnosis) but I can recognize that high anywhere: the burst of energy and invincibility that follows an intense low. Lexi wakes up with a craving for fresh peaches, she heads off to the supermarket in search for the perfect ones and there she meets Jeff. She is vibrant and charming and captivating, he is spellbound — they hit it off immediately. He asks her out and tries to set a date in the near future but she’s more like how about now? My guy is like umm, it’s a weekday morning — don’t we have work? But after a moment of thought, he’s like YOLO and they head off on their date. Lexi’s reason for asking to have a date right there and then is simple: she doesn’t know how she’ll feel literally tomorrow. When the date ends and they make plans to see each other again, I’m already like well, that was fun while it lasted because I honestly don’t expect her to make it to another date. Lexi’s main trigger is presented to be the fact that she’s bipolar and how that essentially disappoints people in her life — especially in love and at work. She has a job as an entertainment lawyer, which we’re told in her brilliant monologue that narrates the episode, that she’s very good at. She heads into work late after her date, if I remember correctly, and we’re met with her seemingly nice superior/colleague who informs her that she’s been written up for reoccurring absences and that she’s unable to cover for Lexi anymore. This great date, the potential of a second one, plus looming unemployment send her on a spiral to a low. Wild, I know. Lexi gets into bed where she says seem to be “the only place the monsters can’t get” her and then the camera pans over to the fresh peaches she got at the grocery store, as we watch them rot away untouched. By the time her second date with Jeff rolls around, Lexi still hasn’t gotten out of bed and at this point Moroun is like is it really that deep? I laughed because that’s actually how it is— no rhyme or reason — which is the most frustrating part of it all. Jeff calls to let her know he’s at her door and Lexi tells him she’ll be right down. He barely recognizes her when he sees her, she is un-showered and deflated — a far cry from her enchanting and vivacious self that he met earlier that week. She seems disinterested, like she’s obligated to be there. He calls her out on it and Lexi lies about having a flu (by the way: why is it that every time you vaguely say “I’m not feeling well” or “I’m sick”, people always think it’s a flu?) but she points out that she does feel a sense of obligation to be there and do this date, even though she physically cannot. The date ends and you just know Jeff is ready to run for the hills and tell his friends about this “crazy girl” he met. The next time Lexi wakes up, before she even opens her eyes, you can tell that the low has broken and the fog has lifted — shout out to the brilliant cinematographer, well done whoever you are. She sits up in bed with caution, as if waiting to be dragged back in and then upon realizing that she’s free, she jumps out of bed and immediately starts opening curtains and cleaning. Side note: I’ve never related to anything more in my life. Then she remembers Jeff and calls him up to schedule a do-over date. Again, he tries to put it on some other day and Lexi is like no, it’s today or today sir and he eventually agrees. While she’s getting dinner ready and getting dressed, we’re served with a montage of how Lexi discovered she was bipolar (she was 14 or so and just couldn’t get out of bed one day), how she managed to make it through school (she used her manic highs to work like crazy to make up for the depressed lows), become a lawyer and land a job — and then another and another but we’ll get back to that. At this point in the episode it seems like you can queue the band and start playing your “happily ever after” tunes but I laughed in Yoruba because I know better. Her NYC studio apartment is looking immaculate, the table is beautifully set for two, the food is looking like it will seal the deal, and Lexi is almost done her makeup. She standing in front of her bathroom mirror applying some mascara when she catches a glimpse of herself and remembers a quote from Rita Hayworth about how men meet her expecting her famous movie character the sexy, fabulous Gilda but when they take her home, they wake up to plain old Rita. Lexi seems to have a who do I even think I am expecting this to go well? moment and it all comes crashing down. At this point Moroun is like it is NEVER that deep! But it is. Lexi literally caves and tries to catch herself with the sink before collapsing onto the floor. It’s like her spine has been ripped out of her back. She literally begs out loud for her mind and body not to do this right now as her doorbell starts to ring. It’s beyond heartbreaking watching her trying so hard to get up and pull herself towards the door but she only manages to get as far as the toilet seat. The doorbells stops ringing and her phone starts ringing but she has lost the battle here and stumbles through the flat to her bed, turning off all the lights as she goes — letting the darkness fully consume her. Jeff is left standing on the streets of NYC — he hangs up the phone, starts walking, stops for a moment and looks up to Lexi’s flat, then eventually walks away. The next day or so, still drenched in aftermath of the previous low, Lexi goes into work to find out that she has been fired. This moment was so real for me. A lot of shows never show the balancing act of trying to hold down a job while living with a mental illness — they either have the person at the point where they’ve devolved and are now unemployed and in full blown psychosis, or they have the person as some sort of magical protege who’s mental illness doesn’t affect their work. TV shows like Crazy Ex-Girlfriend (which I love for it’s hilariously real portrayal of Borderline Personality Disorder) did not really touch on Rachel Bloom’s character Rebecca’s absences from work — her character was also a lawyer, maybe I should be a lawyer? Lexi is not surprised by the development but she is crushed nevertheless. Her superior/colleague asks to go out to coffee with her and Lexi is like yeah, sure, whatever, we’ll see how I feel whenever that is but the lady actually means now and you can see the glimmer of hope wash over Lexi. Soon, they are sitting in a diner booth and Lexi eventually tells her that she is bipolar — which we are told is the first time she is telling anyone this, the first time she has ever said it out loud. The lady’s automatic response is: Why didn’t you say anything? Why didn’t you tell me? which is valid… but also ignorant. The episode ends where it began, with Lexi writing her bio for a dating profile, two years after the events of the episode. We’re told that she took her new found confidence in disclosure and ran with it, telling any and everybody about her situation. She ends talking about all the medications she’s on and how that cocktail of chemicals is helping her better manage her symptoms and by extension, her life. If I’m being truly honest, the show as a whole is not that great but this episode was so powerful for me to watch. I felt SO seen. It was such a random but timely find for me as I’d never read the Modern Love New York Times column or listened to the podcast before finding out about the television show. It came at a time when I was grappling with this new brand of lonely that hits in your late 20s when friend groups are not tightly knit as they used to be, now that everybody has a job and a business and a husband and a baby — now that everyone is no longer living the same life and you’re each on your individual journeys alone. A quick fix for loneliness is to shack up and get married and have a baby, etc. and I fully see why people do it, but that solution doesn’t really seem to exist for me. Relationships and marriages and children are apparently already quite difficult, so when you look at them through the lens of what it’d be like in mine or Lexi’s shoes, it doesn’t look so great. Or even possible. My synopsis could never do Anne Hathaway’s portrayal of Lexi (based on Terri Cheney who is a real person and the author of Manic: A Memoir) or her flash mob musical dance numbers any justice, so you really still have to watch the episode but here’s why this episode is so important and has stayed with me: When you’re living with a mood disorder, the future is scary in a new and fun (read: not really) kind of way. First, there is the denial and bargaining of I can’t possibly feel this way forever and Dear God, I really hope I don’t have to deal with this forever. The highs and lows are exhausting in ways that you cannot articulate or describe and soon you’re stressed and anxious about future events because you simply don’t know how you’ll feel that day. Every invitation or deadline is like a test: will I make it or will I be a colossal disappointment? When my friend Feyi asked me to be her maid of honour, I was surprised. 1) Because she already had one (I don’t think two MOHs were a thing just yet then) and 2) Because she had previously expressed concerns about me having a low on her hypothetical wedding day (I don’t even think she was engaged yet) and how that would ultimately affect her and the day. I tried my best to assure her that I could rally and whatnot but the truth was (and always will be, it seems) that I actually can’t make any promises. I was touched that she asked and I accepted not knowing I was headed for one of the lowest periods of my life. I made it through the wedding, and I was a stellar MOH if I may say so myself, but it was never guaranteed. I’ve missed weeks of work, job interviews and important meetings and appointments that can’t be rescheduled and birthdays and weddings and baby dedications and drinks and beach days and the list goes on — all because I just couldn’t get out of bed. An attendance record like mine makes it hard to be seen as a reliable or committed employee, friend, spouse… or mother? There is this belief that disclosure is the key, the path and the light but I don’t think that is necessarily true. When people initially find out, there is always the “Why didn’t you tell me?” asked as if they would have done something magical or it would have changed the situation. Sure, at first they would be less quick to brand you as flaky when you cancel on them or something but eventually the long rope ends and people just want people who show up, damn it. Disclosure doesn’t automatically equal understanding and understanding doesn’t mean speculations won’t still form and resentment won’t still build. How many times a month can you even get out of bed? Why is it only when I ask you to do something that you can’t get out of bed? But this thing is so important, why can’t you just get out of bed? I’ve been out of the closet on this mental illness thing for pretty much as long as I’ve known. I’m very much like hey, so this is the deal, I’m trying my best, thanks but that doesn’t do much in my experience. People still take it personal somehow, and you can never escape the glare of judgement or disappointment. You either have people treating you like a ticking burden bomb strapped to a baby, or acting like they’re completely unaware of the circumstances. Or both. My ex-boyfriend was a combination of both. A month before we broke up, our only mutual friend was getting married. For context, when we met at a wedding the previous year it was like the serendipity gods were fully at work. We ran full steam ahead with the whole our paths would never have crossed at any other moment than such a time as this narrative (even though he went to the same university as quite a few people I know) until we found that we had one singular mutual friend — she was the only child of his late mother’s close friend and I had gone to bible summer camp with her as a child — just imagine the sentimentality of it all. We were very excited to attend the wedding together as you can imagine but then on the day, I just couldn’t get out of bed. My clothes were hanging of the wardrobe doors right across from my bed, everything was laid out and ready to go but I just couldn’t hack it. My ex was very confused, he kept calling with different variations of things that were supposed to be motivating: But you were so excited to go! You went all the way to the Mainland to pick up our invitations! My dad was looking forward to seeing you! What do I now tell Nini? I was on the other end of the line like I know, I hear you but today is here and it’s not happening. He ultimately went without me, and even came by after to check on me. A month later, he would break up our near perfect relationship because (among other things) he didn’t picture his wife and the mother of his children as someone who could suddenly just be in bed for days apparently. And that’s valid. No matter who or what you are outside of those low moments, people eventually stop seeing the vibrant, confident, fun version of you — they just see the illness and someone who is never there. Then even when it’s not about the illness, it’s becomes about the illness: it’s like being asked if any feelings or reactions you have are because you’re “on your period” even when you’re not on your period. With the best of intentions, it’s still doubly invalidating and infuriating. It’s a lose-lose battle. Telling an employer, that you basically plan to not show up to work randomly without any prior warning is really not the best way to get a job. Being the friend who only shows up a third of the time is not really the best way to keep friends. After a while they’ll just stop inviting you to things because you don’t show up anyway and the employer is likely to give the job to someone who shows up, even if you’re better. As I’ve gotten older, I’ve realized that I don’t bother with big dreams anymore. I’ve had to reevaluate even the small ones like having a full time job. All I want it to be the Chief Marketing Officer of something somewhere and strut around my 52nd floor corner office with a view of the city in a white pantsuit with my sharp bob and red lipstick AND be a #1 NY Times Bestseller on a worldwide book tour AND win an Oscar for Best Original Screenplay — but if I can’t even shower three days in row, where do I get off having big dreams? I don’t even really endorse having children as a thing we should be doing anymore but if my life randomly hits pause, where do I get off being someone’s mother? When I decided to get a master’s degree, I was terrified for so many reasons but what riddled me with anxiety the most was if I would be able to physically do it: get out of bed, show up to class, turn in assignments on time, do my readings, just actually do the thing. I have full confidence in my knowledge and expertise to pull off the course but all my brilliance means nothing if I can’t or don’t show up. This is the same anxiety I feel about relationships. When my last relationship ended, in the midst of all the pain and hurt and anger, there was a sense of relief. I no longer had to put up with someone else’s expectations in such an up close, intimate way. Nobody wants a girlfriend who cancels your perfectly planned dates or is in a random low when you need her to be upbeat, and the obligation to rally and perform this role is sometimes really heavy. I know what you’re thinking, but a girlfriend that is not mentally ill can cancel dates and be moody and what not but that’s where illnesses become illnesses — it’s all down to frequency and severity and how it affects your quality of life. Everyone is grappling with something sure enough, and that’s precisely what makes it that much harder to have extensive amounts of empathy for people. Relationships are sacrifices of time and emotions that stretch your mental capacity to its limits. Romantic relationships double down on this and any feelings of imbalance bursts the whole thing wide open: people like to feel like they are getting as much as they give. Once the label of mental illness is slapped on, there is immediately a heightened sense of imbalance: someone starts to feel like they are carrying the whole relationship on their own and nothing good can ever come of that. The good news is: the first term of my master’s programme is over in 28 days and despite the theatrics life has thrown at me since I started, I have only missed 3 classes so far — and that to me is a whole miracle. So, maybe there is hope after all, maybe I can have some dreams. Maybe. But the next time someone doesn’t show up to work, or cancels on you, or misses your baby’s two-thirds birthday, consider that they might just actually be unable to make it — and it’s not a reflection of who they are as a person or a pre-planned personal disregard of you. We’re all really just trying our very best: no pity necessary, just the benefit of the doubt."
Medium.com,Arts & Entertainment,How Colonialism Is Brought Full Circle By Capitalism In Television,TV,https://medium.com/@sjmyles79/how-colonialism-is-brought-full-circle-by-capitalism-in-television-e4ea24787872?source=topic_page---------25------------------1," F
or several years now, the American reality television landscape has been filled with shows that follow a similar narrative: White Americans head out into the wilderness , and have to survive while building a home, or making food, or mining for gold… or any number of manufactured scenarios. It is almost always white American men, although very occasionally, a white American woman may join a team. Thanks to the tax credit that followed the creation of series Deadliest Catch, Alaska is a favourite location for these types of shows — though, sometimes, the Canadian wilderness such as Yukon is used too. Rarely, locations in areas such as Georgia appear. These wilderness-based reality shows have always been colonialist in nature. They are driven by the idea of exploration and occupation — of striking out into a new area and claiming space. It harks back to the notion of frontiersmen, and taps into the apparently common pioneering dreams of white American men. Television networks promote these shows as being about people who choose to opt out of modern, urban and suburban society and live ‘off the grid.’ They use specific editing techniques and rousing musical scores to depict these people as heroes — taking on a huge challenge and sticking with it through adversity. But, upon closer inspection, these types of reality television demonstrate that capitalism has turned colonialism into a cycle — and these shows bring that cycle full circle. There’s Building Alaska — the ninth and current season of which sees “three men risk it all to build a remote hunting cabin, an off the grid bear lodge, and an island retreat.” This long-running reality series documents build projects at separate locations across Alaska, with men trying to overcome weather, landscape, isolation, and wildlife to create a homestead. There’s also Gold Rush. Now in its tenth season, its original premise was that, “facing an economic meltdown, the team risks everything and sets out on a mission.” That mission was to head north to the wilderness and find gold. Alaskan Bush People is also in its tenth season, though it is widely thought to be more heavily scripted and staged than other reality shows. That is not reflected in its premise, however, which characterises the series as “a journey into Alaska’s bush, where naturalist and adventurer Billy Brown, along with his wife, Ami, and their seven children, chooses to live life on his own terms, connected to wild nature and bonded to each other.” Alaska: The Last Frontier is in its ninth season of following the Kilcher family, who have lived on their homestead for four generations. They are the descendents of Swiss immigrants and Alaskan pioneers, and spend each episode in manufactured wilderness-based peril, even though they apparently live a 20 minute drive from the nearest town, and are able to provide regular updates and stylised photo shoots for their website. The list goes on and on — Mountain Men, Alone, Man vs Wild — but they all centre on the same thing: men “risking it all” for “survival”; as if their survival were ever in doubt, with sizeable camera crews documenting their every move. Do people get hurt making these shows? Of course they do, but people get hurt every day, everywhere, and if you choose to set your building project in the middle of bear territory, then the possibility of getting mauled by a bear should really be part of your all your decision-making processes. This is the first of two grim ironies that stem from these “reality” shows. They centre on white Americans seeking to get “off the grid,” and “unplug from capitalist society,” by signing lucrative contracts with giant media corporations. The cognitive dissonance involved here is truly remarkable. The tagline for the first season of the show Live Free Or Die specifically — and seemingly without any self-awareness — markets the series as such: “There is a movement growing in America. These pioneers have made a choice to awaken the animal self by going back to the wild.” For the people on these shows - like “financial advisor-turned-frontiersman Colbert” in Live Free Or Die, or airport-operator-turned-gold-miner Todd Hoffman in Gold Rush - the lifestyle they adopt in these harsh environments is a choice they make, with the backing and guidance of wealthy television production companies — regardless of the fact that, for communities such as the Inupiat village of Inaliq, on Alaska’s Little Diomede Island, this harsh environment is a daily reality that comes with real peril, as opposed to the kind manufactured for entertainment. The choices made by these reality TV stars are steeped in white colonialist privilege. It is the difference between a lifestyle choice, and an actual way of life. This brings us to the second irony of these shows — and it is, by far, the cruellest. The lifestyle that these people choose essentially returns them to that of white settlers (from both Europe and Russia, in the case of Alaska), who sought to crush Indigenous communities during the process of colonisation. So, for example, white Europeans decimated the First Nations of Canada through colonialism, only for a group of white American men to show up in Yukon two centuries later to test out their ability to “survive” in the wilderness in exchange for money; or indeed, for a group of white American men to show up two centuries later to essentially re-enact the Klondike Gold Rush of 1897, which caused further damage to First Nations communities in that era. This is one of the ways in which capitalism brings colonialism full circle — right there in our living rooms during our television viewing. It was early capitalism that sent Europeans across seas and oceans to colonise unfamiliar lands; the desire to open up new trade avenues and new opportunities for business and commerce; the desire to stake claim to property that could then be occupied, possessed, and monetised. It was early capitalism that drove the murder, robbery, and marginalisation of Indigenous communities, and it is modern capitalism that drives white Americans to seek to broadcast themselves either trying to re-capture that settler lifestyle, or trying to appropriate survival techniques developed by the very people that lived in that harsh environment first. First Nations and Indigenous communities were vilified and persecuted for living in a way that was connected to their land, to the extent that those communities were either completely destroyed, or irreparably damaged — with many forced to give up their land and adapt to colonisation. They were labelled ‘savage,’ ‘primitive,’ and uneducated for holding beliefs and values fundamentally based in balance, co-existence, and connection with the natural world. That sustained colonial onslaught continues to echo through history, impacting First Nations and Indigenous communities today. Indeed, the remaining bigotry is right there in that Live Free Or Die tagline, saying that in “going back to the wild,” they “awaken the animal self.” The dehumanisation of entire cultures rumbles on, unchecked. But now that enough white Americans are bored with “the rat race” they created — now that the pendulum has swung back far enough the other way that “homesteading” and “survival lifestyles” are back in fashion — wealthy corporations have found a way to capitalise, commercialise, and cash in on this essence of colonialism. Is any of that cash being donated to help clean up the water supply of First Nations and Indigenous communities today? Or to help return their land? Is any of that money spent on any kind of reparations for colonialism at all? The chances are slim, since there is no significant evidence of those issues being resolved. Despite the taglines of these shows, nobody is “risking it all” in the production of these reality TV series. They are neither “off the grid,” nor “unplugged from capitalism,” by virtue of the fact that they are literally beamed into the grid by grid-based organisations for profit. Instead, what we are seeing is an insult to victims of colonialism, for the benefit of the very system that drove colonialism in the first place."

If you’ve already been caught, you’re too late. I have nothing to tell you that will save you from your impending death. Never, ever let your child watch Netflix’s Little Baby Bum.
I’m serious. It seems innocent enough, colorful buses with large eyes and smiles, walking, singing, smiling animals and cartoon kids, living their musical lives. Your children might find themselves learning the names of new shapes, laughing at the constantly soundtracked moving pictures and singing cute songs. But just wait. What happens when you finish a netflix series? Netflix autoplays something recommended, right? But what if that new series is just another version of Little Baby Bum? If you’re like me, when you’re looking for something to watch the little buses will stick out amongst the boxes of show cover photos. You won’t be able to hide it from your children. You won’t be able to tell them it’s over, because they’ll know better. Little Baby Bum is never over. Ever! You might want to watch with them, but the familiar songs begin to subliminally tell you you’re wrong. These songs last longer than they ever did when you were a kid. There are 5 extra verses and 13 refrains. When you try to tell your children the folktales and sing them the nursery rhymes that helped you manage bedtime, it won’t work anymore. You’ll have to sing it just like Little Baby Bum or just put the damn show on again. Don’t worry about not remembering the words. You’ll realize you have to be that mom or that dad leaving them watching the TV alone. That’s when you’ll find yourself in the kitchen or bedroom cleaning and humming original songs from Little Baby Bum. You’ll try to think of another song, something you actually like and then it will dawn on you — though you listen to music all.day.long, it’s been months since you’ve listened to music you like. The only songs you can remember are from Little Baby Bum! Though you know lots of nursery rhymes, you can no longer remember the non-baby bums version. You might think you can solve this problem by hiding the remote control, not turning the TV on for a day or 10. You can even get rid of your TV and devices. Your life is officially over when you’ve done all you can to get those songs out of your head but your toddler or preschooler (or both if you’re that unfortunate) resign themselves to the acapella version of LBB songs. When you hear these songs 24/7, it’s over. You’ll never hear anything else for the rest of your life. And the creators of Little Baby Bums will just create yet another version for you and your little one to get back on the wagon, because you’re theirs for life now. This is your warning!"

Medium.com,Arts & Entertainment,"His Dark Materials is by the books, for better or worse",TV,https://medium.com/@mirafox/his-dark-materials-is-by-the-books-for-better-or-worse-6ff2ed5601f7?source=topic_page---------29------------------1," The first episode of HBO/BBC’s His Dark Materials is loyal to original, but what works in print doesn’t necessarily sing on screen If you aren’t already familiar with His Dark Materials, let me briefly contextualize HBO and the BBC’s new show: it’s based on Philip Pullman’s best-selling trilogy by the same name, which happen to be among my favorite books ever. This first season will be an 8-part miniseries covering the first book, The Golden Compass, and it’s already been renewed for season two, covering The Subtle Knife. It stars an obstinate young girl named Lyra (Dafne Keen), in a parallel universe to our own. Here, every person has an animal-shaped manifestation of their soul, called a dæmon, and life is run by an oppressive religious body known as the Magisterium. Though the books were ostensibly for children, they’re heavily philosophical, and come loaded with highbrow references — “his dark materials” is a line from John Milton’s epic poem, Paradise Lost, and the series takes its symbolic framework from the story of Adam and Eve. This has led to some controversy; when The Golden Compass, was adapted into a movie in 2007, it was boycotted by Christian groups and flopped in the box office — all despite the movie dialing down the religious themes in hopes of making it more palatable. But today, religious controversy is in vogue, with shows such as The Handmaid’s Tale and Good Omens garnering both critical and popular acclaim. The first episode of His Dark Materials makes clear that the series won’t be pulling any punches, despite producer Jane Tranter’s assertion that the Magisterium isn’t any particular religion; the Magisterium officials have Church titles — e.g. Father, Cardinal — and their robes are clearly cassocks. The first episode introduces us to Lyra, her daemon Pantalaimon — Pan for short — and their best friend Roger, who live in Jordan College in Oxford. Lyra is an orphan, raised under the protection of “scholastic sanctuary,” which keeps the university out of the Magisterium’s reach. Lyra is an energetic trickster, careening through corridors and generally wreaking havoc. But when Lyra’s uncle, Asriel (James McAvoy), arrives to Jordan to ask for funding for his new research — a very real-world academic struggle — she stumbles into a world of intrigue. Asriel has found a magical city visible through the aurora, opening the possibility of “a myriad of worlds, of which the Magisterium controls only one,” and seeding a heretical rebellion. Then a glamorous woman named Mrs. Coulter (Ruth Wilson) arrives, wanting to hire Lyra as her assistant. Mrs. Coulter seems perfect and Lyra is excited for the adventure, but the Master gives Lyra a cryptic warning before she leaves, along with an indecipherable truth-telling device called an alethiometer. Meanwhile, rumor begins to circulate of a sinister group, the Gobblers, which kidnaps children. A boy from the outcast gyptian group has disappeared — and, as the episode ends, Roger goes missing too. This first episode does a lot of work planting themes that will be important later. True to the original, truth and knowledge come up repeatedly. That the alethiometer, a truth-telling device, is forbidden by the Magisterium makes it clear that the Magisterium’s tactics depend on controlling access to knowledge — reminiscent of our own era of fake news and post-truth politics. Similarly, the repeated mentions of scholastic sanctuary emphasize that knowledge is under threat; academia is the symbol of free thought — regardless of its function in reality — and the Magisterium is threatening it with charges of heresy; knowledge threatens power. There are a lot of themes that I’m excited to see develop, and I’m still curious to see what will happen even though I basically have the books memorized. However, the almost line-by-line commitment to the books makes the first episode plodding at points. There’s admittedly a lot of essential world-building to be done — the function of dæmons, Dust, a shrouded prophecy about Lyra’s importance. But the conspicuously meaningful conversations used to lay this philosophical groundwork can take away from the type of actual character-building that makes an audience feel invested. I would have preferred this groundwork laid over the course of several episodes while keeping the plot moving forward at a brisker clip; Pullman’s compelling prose doesn’t necessarily transfer to a visual medium. That being said, the benefit of seeding the first episode with mysterious hints and big themes is that everything feel deliciously expectant. And there’s a lot of fodder for interesting social commentaries. The nomadic gyptian people aren’t a cohesive ethnic group like they are in the books, but instead a mix of outcasts, which makes me curious to see what kind of race and class commentaries we might see. And I’m especially interested to see if the idea of the subversive university continues, or if another, more radical form of free thinking displaces it; either way, there’s room for some nuanced criticism of institutions. Besides, even when it’s slow, His Dark Materials is so visually stunning that you don’t even mind. Dafne Keen’s Lyra is as spunky as the one I imagined as a child, jumping off roofs and into laundry bins, and they nailed the CGI for the daemons. There’s good reason to stick to the books after all — they were best-sellers, and Pullman’s prose has gained him a cult following. So the show is worth sticking with if they’re sticking with the books; we know there’s amazing things to come. ALSO OF NOTE:"
Medium.com,Arts & Entertainment,Review: Sorry For Your Loss on Facebook Watch (season 1),TV,https://medium.com/pop-off/review-sorry-for-your-loss-on-facebook-watch-season-1-cf8a312b7a68?source=topic_page---------30------------------1," I do have to question what Facebook thinks they’re doing with Facebook Watch. I suspect this little content creation experiment of theirs will fizzle out soon enough. However, Sorry For Your Loss could make an argument for them to stay in it. I like to refer to a show like Sorry For Your Loss as a “kitchen sink” show; meaning that there are A LOT of things going on in the show. Thankfully, this show makes it all work. Now it’s both reductive and dismissive to think of Sorry For Your Loss as just a “web series” or “show for the internet” because it’s on Facebook Watch— this is as much of a “web series” as Peaky Blinders or Fleabag. Regardless of platform, this is a very powerful and effective show. Created by playwright Kit Steinkellner and starring Elizabeth Olsen, Sorry For Your Loss tackles some pretty weighty issues. Chief among them, the loss and questionable death of a spouse. But wait, there’s even more loss — the show has addiction, divorce, adoption, recovery, infidelity, race, mental health, LQBTQ, etc. (ergo, my “kitchen sink” moniker.) Miraculously, the writing is so adroit that it all works and nothing overpowers the central theme of loss. Beginning with her first feature film, Martha May Marcy Marlene, Olsen has proven she’s got some serious acting chops. I think because of that she’s made interesting creative choices. Moving from indie films like Martha May Marcy Marlene to drama’s like Wind River to big-budget comic book movies in the Marvel Universe portraying Scarlet Witch. Each performance, whether starring or supporting, is evidence of just how good she is. Sorry For Your Loss is a nice addition to an already impressive and rapidly growing CV. In this show, Elizabeth Olsen plays Leigh Shaw, an advice columnist who wants to be a writer, who is married to Mamoudou Athie’s Matt Greer, a high school teacher who wants to be a comic book writer. Greer is the character who dies and as the ten episodes unfold, it becomes increasingly questionable as to whether his fall off a cliff while hiking was accidental or deliberate. You see, Greer battles depression and at the time of his death is experiencing a depressive episode. And on this front, the show portrays depression very well and keeps it rooted in the reality of the disease. One of the better lines comes around episode eight or nine. Leigh is sitting on the stoop with Matt’s brother Danny and she re-tells the story of someone from her grief group by saying, “He didn’t kill himself, the disease killed him.” And if you or you know someone with depression, that’s the truth. Depression is a disease. And like many diseases, it kills. The other thing this show does spectacularly well is its normalization of interracial marriage. What I mean by that is that there I have no recollection of race being mentioned in the first season — Olsen’s Leigh is white and Athi’s Matt is black. I’ve always felt the European shows handle interracial relationships much better than we do here in the states. This is the first time I can recall seeing it portrayed so benignly. The show treats interracial marriage as it should be — a non-issue. Sorry For Your Loss is following a trend of late, the toggling between past and present. Here it reminded me of the use of flashbacks in Unbelievable. This can be irritating at first, however, once you become acclimated, it can be a useful narrative device. Used effectively, it can integrate you into the story even more, as it does here. The one area that this time interplay falters is in the portrayal of Matt’s depressive episode which important in the structure of the show. On the one hand, I think the toggling here removed some of what was happening with the character that may have led to the episode. On the other hand, it could just as easily be argued that was the point. An event may not always be the instigator in a depressive episode. In either case, it’s not so disruptive here that you can’t put it together. But again, be it past or present, the central theme of Sorry For Your Loss is a loss of someone or something: Reading it like that may look like the show is a real bummer. The show isn’t a modern life portrayal via Albert Camus with a soundtrack by The Smiths. It’s not that at all. There are moments of levity — enough so that it doesn’t diminish the reality, and gravity, that accompanies significant loss. Sorry For Your Loss captures some real aspects of modern life…and loss is a part of life. The show also goes to great length to show how significant loss can cast its shadow over many. And how such loss can create a rudderless effect on those at the center and the periphery. While I have never seen This Is Us on NBC, I think there may be some content similarity between the shows. However, Sorry For Your Loss probably has a fraction of the budget. Which aligns it more with independent cinema and those things that make really good independent films— the writing, acting and directing. By all accounts, This Is Us has similar strengths. But again, much like independent films, to be competitive, Sorry For Your Loss has to deliver the same quality, if not better, with fewer resources. NBC is in the content creation business, it’s what they do. Facebook is not in the content creation business. Facebook is for television clips, not television shows. The stars were in alignment for Sorry For Your Loss. It’ll be interesting to see if Facebook can do it again with another show. The fact is that Sorry For Your Loss is on Facebook Watch and it’s hurting it. The show deserves more attention than it’s getting solely because it’s on a platform used for…whatever people use it for these days. The show seems to be overlooked. And it shouldn’t be. While I can applaud Facebook’s effort, in this case, I think it speaks more to the creative team and less to the platform. The cold hard fact is that Facebook will never be a competitive player in content creation. Period. If Sorry For Your Loss was on any other streamer, it would be getting loads of attention and awards recognition for the writing, the cast and the direction. It’s that good. However, on Facebook Watch, it’s lost among the other noise on that bukkake of a social platform. In the spirit of full disclosure, even I didn’t watch it on Facebook. I’d known about the show for months but I have neither the time nor inclination to go hunting on Facebook to find their shows. I discovered it on a long flight home and watched it there…and still haven’t popped on Facebook to look for it. There isn’t anything revolutionary about Sorry For Your Loss, it’s just a supremely well-crafted show. That said, I could give you a dozen different reasons to watch Sorry For Your Loss but the fact is you only need two — the writing and Elizabeth Olsen. RELATED:"
Medium.com,Arts & Entertainment,Lost inTranslation: Why Netflix’s “Neon Genesis Evangelion” is So Problematic,TV,https://medium.com/@jefflight_12860/lost-intranslation-why-netflixs-neon-genesis-evangelion-is-so-problematic-fbac79113a8c?source=topic_page---------31------------------1," To bring a new, polished version of the massively-popular series to streaming, Netflix went with Studio Khara, the splinter studio formed by Hideaki Anno, director of the original anime. This is not the first time that Khara has re-envisioned Evangelion, as they started making a 4-film retelling of the original series back in 2007. The fourth and final film of that series still has not been released, with many crediting the delay due to…you guessed it, Anno’s unhappiness with voice-over and translation issues. So what’s new in this story? Is this just another series with a huge fanbase that produces a lot of pressure on the creators to ‘get it exactly right’? Recently controversial properties like Star Wars, Joker, or Game of Thrones might have you thinking so. But actually the new complaints about Netflix’s revision of Evangelion are more insidious and hint at a political agenda. A series and a network that has always been fairly liberal with their ideas are now being accused of queer erasure, and worse: bad grammar. (I kid!.. But seriously, they are.)"
Medium.com,Arts & Entertainment,Euphoria Deals with Statutory Rape in a Troubling Manner,TV,https://medium.com/@siwemagadla/euphoria-deals-with-statutory-rape-in-a-troubling-manner-1b30b8be488d?source=topic_page---------32------------------1," My first introduction to Euphoria was that there would be 30 dicks and that Drake was one of the executive producers. This combination unsettled me because while Drake continued to be everyone’s favourite corny misogynist, I was still grappling with the information that in 2018 he’d been texting and giving relationship advice to 14 year old Millie Bobby Brown and had been rumoured to be in a relationship with at the time, 17 year old model, Bella Harris. I was distrustful of this collaboration because an adult man hanging around teenage girls in a way that resembled grooming culture would be working on a show that was being advertised as tackling sex, drugs, friendships and love for Generation Z high schoolers. A few weeks later it was clarified that the dicks were prosthetics and I was a bit relieved and included in this I later learned that like shows such as Sex Education the show had hired an intimacy coordinator to ensure a safe working environment. One of the most popular shows in 2019, Euphoria is a teen drama series created by Sam Levinson based on the Israeli series of the same name. It follows a group of high school teenagers as they navigate love, friendships, drugs and sex. The show is led by Zendaya who plays 17 year old Rue who upon returning from rehab with no plans to stay off drugs befriends Jules (Hunter Schafer), the new girl in town. In each episode we are guided by Rue’s narration and follow one of the seven main characters as they try to navigate certain aspects of their lives. The show has been lauded as being brutally honest about drug addiction, friendships and sex. Before the premiere of Euphoria, Zendaya posted a note on her Instagram saying that the show is for mature audiences and that people should only watch it if they were able to handle the content. In an interview with The Guardian she said that ""the show is about teenagers and not necessary for teenagers, which I think people can misinterpret"". Naturally, however, her audience from K.C. Undercover and the Spiderman franchise meant that her fans would gravitate towards her new project whether she advised them to or not. Zendaya, of course, shouldn’t bear the responsibility of monitoring whether teenagers are watching Euphoria because that responsibility isn’t hers to be bear but that of the teenager’s parents or guardians. In addition to this teenagers have the choice to watch whatever it is they want to watch and them ignoring show restrictions isn’t uncommon. Before Euphoria there was Skins which had similar themes to Euphoria’s and teens watched it despite the content being intended for mature audiences. What was so appealing about Skins and now Euphoria is that the actors playing these teenagers are closer to the ages of the characters they are playing. Most of Euphoria’s cast are in their early 20s which makes the characterisation more believable and is a break away and breather from watching actors clearly in their late 20s and early 30s playing 16 to 18 year olds. But, for all of that, after finishing the series I was concerned with the out of world implications of showing young adults portraying teens having sex on screen. At first I wrestled with wanting these actors to have the freedom to explore their characters in ways they deemed fit and didn’t want to jump on the morality wagon that emerges every time we have teen shows portraying teens doing things we as a culture acknowledge teens do but don’t want to think about. My worries landed on how the show’s depiction of teens having sex would contribute to the already existing sexualisation of them. I worried that like Skins we’d re-enter the territory of out of context gifs that romanticized characters mental illness and in Euphoria’s case that would allow predatory communities access to certain scenes that would be contributing to the hyper sexualisation of teens. Although I still have these fears, I’m also aware that the show doesn’t have a moral obligation to ensure that people don’t prey on actual teens but it should be aware of the consequences of casually showing these young actors having sex and considering that actual teens — a demographic that’s easily influenced and constantly preyed upon — are watching it and what’s happening on the show impacts them. Besides these out of world concerns I realized that the more pressing issue is the show’s troubling statutory rape problem. The characters attitudes towards sex are reflective of real life attitudes of it. In the show, boys distribute and watch revenge porn of their classmates, characters tell other characters to “catch a dick” aka “why have you waited so long to have sex. Just do it.” Characters make assumptions and hurt each other. In the first episode set in a party scene that brings all of our characters together, Kat (Barbie Ferreira) has sex for the first time, she later learns that the boy she was having sex with filmed her and uploaded the video on a porn website without her knowledge. Initially she’s afraid and shameful but she’s able to gain back her power upon realizing the popularity of the clip online. She capitalizes on this popularity and ends up becoming a financial dominatrix. At the same party, while McKay (Algee Smith) and Cassie (Sydney Sweeney) are having sex, McKay starts choking Cassie after making assumptions she likes it because he’d been forced to watch a sex tape of Cassie being choked by Nate (Jacob Elordi). Cassie tells him to stop which he does and asks McKay why he did that to which he responds that he thought she liked it. She’s confused and unaware that McKay has seen a sex tape of her and tells him he shouldn’t do that again unless he asks or if she asks. The scene is a decent lesson on consent and not making assumptions about your partner’s sexual preferences and while it demonstrated that the show is not completely ignorant about what consent is, the way in which it handled other specific “sex” scenes was alarming. In the first episode, Jules is talking and making plans to meet with “dominantdaddy” (Eric Dane) who we learn later is Nate’s father, Cal. Before meeting at a motel, Jules jokingly texts him ""promise ur not a serial killer? lol"", a text funny in that context but chilling when you’re aware of the epidemic murder of mostly black trans women and that Jules herself is a young trans girl entering a shady situation. Jules meets with him and when he asks how old she is, she lies and says she’s 22 despite how obvious it is that she is still a teenager. It is apparent as Cal has sex with Jules that she is in pain and the scene in itself is extremely uncomfortable to watch. And while I am describing it as a sex scene and Jules also interacts with it as just sex, it isn’t sex, its statutory rape. Cal is far older than Jules and as much as he is struggling with his sexuality and the way it has been stifled by notions of masculinity and the town he lives in, his sleeping with a teenager isn’t an excuse for what he is going through. Throughout the season Jules continues hooking up with men older than her and when Rue makes this observation, Jules rightfully points out that she and Rue won’t have the same experiences when it comes to dating and sex. Jules is right in that desirability play a huge role in who is seen as being attractive and dateable in a cisheteronormative society. As much as Jules is a conventionally beautiful cis passing white trans girl her experiences of dating and sex will differ from Rue’s who is cisgender. It’s an important conversation and an easy one to miss if you’re not paying that much attention because it’s occurs so briefly. What’s concerning about it is that while Jules is right about the way politics of desire work, Rue’s concerns aren’t wrong but the show doesn’t seem as interested in at least giving them much weight therefore Jules having these relationships is something that is left unchallenged. The dismissal of statutory rape occurs once again in Maddy’s (Alexa Demie) episode. Maddy is portrayed as being not that invested in sex itself but is interested in the power she can derive from it and she relishes in the performance of sex because she knows that she can get material things from it. In her narration of Maddy’s story, Rue informs us that Maddy had “sex” for the first time when she was 14 at a holiday resort with a 40 year old man. In the narration, we’re told that Maddy wanted it and was in control of the situation. While this could be true, there’s the fact that no 14 year old has power over an interaction with a 40 year old man and that that 40 year old man should have known better. Again, the persistence to represent this as merely a sexual encounter is disturbing because it isn’t, its rape. By continuously spreading this narrative that teenagers agency alone is enough is appalling and whether the show intentionally or unintentionally knows this, it’s contributing to rape culture. In another plotline involving Nate, we learn that the show isn’t ignorant about the way power works and the laws surrounding statutory rape. During the first episode party, in an attempt to make Nate jealous, Maddy publicly hooks up with Tyler, a college boy, in front of everyone and later seeing the opportunity for reconciliation with Nate lies and says she had blacked out during the hook up. Nate who is grossly obsessed with Maddy’s purity and generally has a messed up relationship with women and like his father is struggling with his own sexuality, stalks, breaks into Tyler’s apartment and beats him up. Nate goes on to threaten Tyler and informs him that Maddy is underage and tells Tyler that the hook up wasn’t a hook up but was a statutory rape. I’m still conflicted with the way that this was handled because on one hand I am aware that the sexual politics of having sex with someone legally off-age while the other party is underage but where there isn’t a huge age gap can get messy and those situations aren’t always clear cut but this plotline wasn’t about that specifically but about Nate’s obsession with power and how he’s able to wield it because of his privilege. The frustrating bit is that the show can do better. During Cassie’s episode it’s clear that the way male relatives behaved towards her in her prepubescent years is predatory and the show isn’t vague in showing this. Cassie further experiences difficulties such as her parent’s divorce and her father’s drug addiction that contribute to her entering really unhealthy sexual and romantic relationships where her boyfriends constantly coerce her and take nudes and sex videos of her which they leak online. The episode is thoughtful because of how in previous episodes we’ve seen how Cassie is treated by her male peers. We are shown that most of what has happened to her isn’t her fault but rather the fault of a culture intent on objectifying and shaming girls for having sex. Specific plotlines such as these reveal that the show isn’t completely oblivious about how power works because it recognizes how characters engage and even abuse it. And while the show isn’t an educational one and wants to tell a particular story (something I want to respect) the show would be more enjoyable if it didn’t choose a laissez-faire approach to handling statutory rape. The show has already been renewed for season 2 and I hope that if it doesn’t address its statutory rape problem, it at least abandons treating it in an offhand manner because continuing to do so the way it has this season is tactlessly contributing to rape culture."
Medium.com,Arts & Entertainment,Netflix Originals Are Just Bad Enough to Destroy It,TV,https://gen.medium.com/https-gen-medium-com-netflix-mediocre-originals-streaming-competition3822911d5e21-3822911d5e21?source=topic_page---------33------------------1," ast year, in August, I settled in with a smile to watch Disenchantment, Netflix’s satirical fantasy sitcom from Simpsons creator Matt Groening. I imagined it would skewer the popular fantasy genre as a hilarious satire of Game of Thrones and Lord of the Rings sword-and-sorcery tropes, with characters every bit as memorable as Marge Simpson and Krusty the Clown. And so I spent the morning on Netflix, watching the first few episodes, expecting greatness. I chuckled a few times during the pilot, mostly at an elf character named Shocko (the joke is that he’s always shocked). But as I made it through each episode, a half-hour each with no commercials to pad out their running time, I laughed less and less. I glanced at my watch and fidgeted with my iPhone. By the middle of the first season’s initial run of 10 episodes, I began to wonder if I was going to be able to finish the show at all. It just wasn’t funny. The characters weren’t that interesting; they come across as whiny and lacking in personality, despite the voice talents of Abbi Jacobson, Eric Andre, and John DiMaggio. Disenchantment improved a bit, but not enough to make it must-watch TV. The second half of the first season was released this year. It’s not much better. On paper, this show sounded fantastic. But actually watching 20 episodes of it is punishing; you want it to be so much better, and it never fully delivers. If you watch a lot of Netflix, this is probably a familiar story. For every Netflix series that wins awards and excites critics, say Russian Doll, there are at least three or four that fail to live up to their potential, or that register so little they quickly disappear. There are series that were added to Netflix only a year or two ago that now sound completely made up. Remember the 2017 Naomi Watts psychotherapy drama Gypsy? That forgotten 10 episodes of television had the unfortunate tagline, “Who are you when no one is watching?” We still don’t know. Netflix isn’t in a position to settle for so-so much longer. It needs to invest in shows that, however flawed they may be, won’t be damned with faint praise for being mediocre. As new streaming services from Disney and Apple come online, it’s hard to ignore just how many shows Netflix produces that are fine, perfectly acceptable to watch while you’re folding laundry or skimming Twitter, but not great enough to hold your full attention and win your devotion over multiple seasons. These are shows like the recent Paul Rudd comedy Living With Yourself, which has only eight episodes but feels like 12 with a bad sag in the middle. There’s the entirety of The Ranch, which ran for an astonishing 70 episodes on Netflix despite getting very little love from critics from the start. The company brought back Insatiable for a second season despite awful reviews and continued outcry about its content. In terms of quality, the material hasn’t transcended its bad press. Ryan Murphy’s big Netflix debut, The Politician, arrived in its first season messy and scattered — a major stumble for the guy who earned wide acclaim for American Horror Story and Glee. And that’s the problem, isn’t it? Even putting aside the issue of whether Netflix Originals movies have the same issue (boy, do they), many Netflix Originals feel rushed and incomplete, often in spite of the strong talent involved. After Netflix spent $120 million to make Baz Lurhmann’s show The Get Down, it got a positive reception, but not positive enough to keep it from getting canceled after only one season and lots of production turmoil. Even when Netflix somehow summons the right combination of actors, writers, directors, and other talent to make a show people love, it doesn’t often let those shows go more than a few seasons, creating bad will among fans. Netflix will probably never live down its cancellation of the adored sitcom One Day at a Time, and it surprised many by cutting short the life of Tuca & Bertie, a hyperactive cartoon that had the potential of being a perfect companion show for BoJack Horseman (also just canceled). Being on the outside of Netflix makes it hard to speculate how many of the decisions to scuttle shows that are working — or to rush forward on projects that aren’t fully baked — are made with regard to the company’s recommendation algorithm and its secret viewership data. In its goal to keep viewers glued to its service and willing to pay subscription fees every month, Netflix relies heavily on these data sources to craft programming that will pair well with what its watchers already binge, and when to purge shows that no longer contribute to that goal. Netflix is spending about $18 billion on programming this year, including movies it buys at film festivals and shows it licenses such as The Office and Better Call Saul. But spending lots of money no longer guarantees that Netflix will get the talent it wants or the titles it needs; Disney, Apple, Amazon, Hulu, and others are also throwing billions of dollars at the content-creation problem. It’s going to get harder, not easier, for Netflix to develop great shows with great talent. It was lucky to get a head start against latecomer streaming services, but that lead may vanish quickly. Netflix needs to look beyond its data to increase quality control over shows it makes. Show creators working with Netflix won’t want the streamer to override their creative control, but the company needs to make sure it’s moving ahead with shows that have a strong reason to exist, and that won’t hurt the company’s reputation by failing to live up to advance hype. Shows like The OA and Dear White People don’t appeal to everybody, but they benefit from a willingness to go way off-script for what most networks and streaming services do with television. Right now, Netflix isn’t in a position to settle for so-so much longer. It needs to invest in shows that, however flawed they may be, won’t be damned with faint praise for being mediocre. When you look at what streaming services people subscribe to, Netflix is typically the top choice along with a second or third option, according to analysts. But the launches of Apple TV+, Disney+, and next year, HBO Max, will change the dynamics of how much money people will spend to watch their shows. For the first time in a long while, subscribers may begin to feel that Netflix is optional, especially if they consistently find themselves underwhelmed by enough series that don’t stand out from the crowd. For Netflix, there’s one ray of sunshine that may buy the company some time: Apple apparently hasn’t figured out how to make great television yet."
