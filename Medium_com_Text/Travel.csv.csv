Medium.com,Life,When Your Life Falls Apart Long-Distance,Travel,https://psiloveyou.xyz/when-your-life-falls-apart-long-distance-5d5cbc5f029a?source=topic_page---------5------------------1," When I boarded that plane, I had no idea I’d never be able to go home again. I was no stranger to traveling for work, and neither was my boyfriend. Both of us traveled semi-regularly for jobs in and out of New York for sometimes weeks at a time. But this time was slightly different. I would be living in Atlanta for 9 months, the longest job either of us had ever taken away from our home base. I was hesitant about taking the job as much as he was hesitant about me going. He even offered to take on a bigger portion of the household expenses if that was the only reason I felt like I needed to go. But the prospects looked good, an opportunity to break into a new market for both of us as well as a job at a time when I really needed it. So I took the job, booked a ticket, and packed as much as I could into two bags. We were in a good place, both of us agreed, we would find a way to handle the distance and he would come down and join me as often as he could so he could explore the market for himself. This is part of the deal, we agreed. We would be fine. As I watched New York City shrink underneath me from my seat on the plane en route to Atlanta, I had a very distinct feeling that I recorded in my journal: 35,000 feet Life is this strange, gradient line. Where we are now is the sharpest, and as we look back things get fuzzier and fuzzier until we can’t remember anything at all past a certain point. But in front of us is: nothing. There’s never anything past the moment we’re in right now, it’s completely unknown. That’s where I am. Sitting on a plane and sitting in that moment, a blank slate of life on the other side that’s completely unknown to me. The deep irony of my last entry was my total restlessness. Well, that’s gone now. I’m plunging headfirst into a new city, new job, away from my partner, a whole new world ahead of me. When these wheels hit the tarmac, it’ll be just another tack sharp moment at the precipice of the unknown. Here goes nothing. Nine months later, as I was saying a tearful goodbye to my boyfriend and our dog in a half-furnished apartment in an Atlanta suburb, those words could not have rung more truthfully and more ominously."
Medium.com,Life,An Ex at the Airport,Travel,https://psiloveyou.xyz/an-ex-at-the-airport-47f33d39db76?source=topic_page---------6------------------1," I saw my ex at the airport. Well, I didn’t see my ex. She’s someone who was in my life for a long time, either too long a time or too short a time, depending on my mood and mindset and whoever else you might ask. (Ask her, I think she’d probably say too long.) But she was never mine. Or I didn’t let it feel that way. It’s not lost on me that this was part of the problem. She was a girlfriend, maybe the girlfriend — but now she’s an ex, maybe the ex. I don’t know. Too early to tell. I won’t know for sure until it’s too late — and I can tell you that definitively because I don’t know right now, this very minute, and right now is already way past too late. We hadn’t spoken since a couple days before Christmas. That had been the previous year. About eight months had passed. I was trying to get out of Denver and back to D.C. and the flight slated to take me across most of the country was indefinitely delayed. I’d gotten several notifications telling me as much but was still neurotic enough to continue forth with my pre-flight, post-security ritual where I make my way to my gate and lay eyes on it so I know for sure where I’ll need to be when I ultimately need to be there. Then I doubled back to find a bar where I could make fast work of my daily work per diem. On the way, I saw her. I did a double-take then a triple-take. Didn’t know for sure if it was actually her at first, because my mind and eyes had played tricks on me before. Anytime I saw a tall blonde I’d break into palpitations until I knew for sure it wasn’t the ex who fit that same physical profile. Part of me would always involuntarily hope it was her, while another part would hope we never saw each other again, which was the most likely scenario given our geographic distance, and the best thing (probably) and easiest thing (for me, anyway, though easy doesn’t mean best) given the way I had ended things. But it was her. And she was walking straight toward me. I got this sudden sinking feeling in my stomach and a vaguely frightening tingling around my neck that I only feel when I’m at my most uncomfortable. I turned around with a quickness and made a power-walk for it. I wanted to get away, find a place to get out of sight and not deal with a potentially difficult and trying situation — which is what I have always been, like, really pretty good at. Even though I had played out about a thousand scenarios in my head where I would run into her and it would be a pleasant affair, I knew the reality was likely that it wouldn’t be. I’ve come to find that the way I preemptively play things out in my head is rarely if ever the way they end up going, if they go at all. Like so many times before, and for better or worse, an airport bar was there for me when I thought or was trying to convince myself it was something I needed most. I watched her pass, hoping nothing would make her glance in my direction, that she wouldn’t walk into the same bar as me. It wasn’t lost on me that at one time in the not-so-distant past that someone like her noticing me was what I thought I wanted most. Strange the way timing works, I thought, how small the world is — and that both can work in your favor sometimes and fuck you over other times. (Well, It can at least provide a pretty solid assist while being only partially to blame — kind of an excuse or what enables you to make an excuse and feel justified about it.) My flight had gotten delayed. I was unintentionally lagging behind. I wasn’t supposed to be there. I was supposed to be long gone. She passed by without incident. Didn’t know I was anywhere near her, I don’t think. I stayed there drinking until my flight boarded, working on the apology letter I’d been writing and rewriting for months. Sent it when I got home and never heard back. But I’m still scared of what would happen if I did."
Medium.com,Life,Luck — An American Abroad,Travel,https://medium.com/@DeanPagani/luck-an-american-abroad-455936411cb?source=topic_page---------7------------------1," Being careful not to reveal any personal security details I carefully answered the Thai taxi driver’s questions as he practiced his English with me while driving across the center of Bangkok. “How long you in Bangkok?” “Until Sunday.” “And after Bangkok, then?” “Nepal.” “And after Nepal. Then back home to the United States for holidays?” “No, no holidays for me, I am going to India next.” “India? How long you travel?” This is where I decided to start being careful. “About two months.” “Oh. Well you say you have been in Bangkok a week. You will be in Nepal, India a month. And then?” He caught me. I will actually be gone longer than two months. So I revealed I had been in Vietnam and Cambodia first which got him to the two months he was looking for. Little did I know I was being driven by a math major. “And all alone. You travel by yourself. All over?” “Yes, it’s just me.” “Ohhhh. Americans. So cool! They travel all over world by themselves!!,” he sort of screamed it at the top of his lungs and banged the steering with his hand as if he were trying to get the attention of the people we were passing on the sidewalk, but they couldn’t hear him. I laughed as he pulled up to my destination and he let me out. He wished me luck with a big smile that suggested he wished he was coming with me. Later, as I was packing my bags for my flight to Nepal, I was shaking my head myself at the extent of this trip I am on and what I am doing. The night before an old friend asked me through Instagram whether I was hiring guides or fixers in the various countries I am visiting. No. Not really. I took a few tours in Vietnam because it was the easiest way to get where I wanted to go but for the most part I am just wandering the earth and actually trying to stay away from tourist destinations. I hate lines. I don’t like being herded. I want to see where real people live and how. I forget who it was, but someone I was talking to in Cambodia said to me you have no idea how easy it is for you because you have that American passport. You just wave that and go anywhere. At the Bangkok airport I was waved through one leg of the security course because our countries apparently have a reciprocal agreement on visa issues. Other than that I have felt no sense of official privilege. I did not feel my U.S. passport was a golden ticket to the chocolate factory. But a month into my journey I do feel privileged and lucky to be an American. I am just damn lucky…Goddamn lucky…that I was born in the country I was born in at the time I was born. Although I just learned recently that Italian-Americans were not originally considered white by U.S. immigration officials in the early 1900’s, I am damn lucky that by the time I was born that was not the case, or life might have been much different for me. And if you want, you can throw in the fact I was born a male. Unfortunately, even today, that carries with it certain economic advantages. So I hit the birth trifecta. The right country, the right time, the right race and gender (I know that’s four). Because of that stroke of luck (and I will throw in some hard work on my part) I have reached a point where I can just travel the world — by myself — and feel somewhat confident about it. It could all be snatched away from me in a moment of course if I wander into the wrong neighborhood or forget while crossing the street that they drive on the left in Thailand, but for the most part what do I have to complain about? I walk around anonymously. Not worth paying attention to as far as the locals are concerned and if I do get in trouble I suppose the American passport will help. I know ultimately it means Jared Kushner has my back. I have visited four countries so far and am landing in India as I finish this column. From what I have seen so far, on my worst day, I have fewer problems and a greater possibility of achieving my hopes and dreams than most people in what we call “the developing world.” In every country I have visited people who know nothing about baseball wear New York Yankees and Los Angeles Dodger hats. Asian women walk around in sweatshirts that say “Brooklyn.” When you take their pictures little kids make the gestures of American rap stars. On the way to Nepal there was a huge line of people placing their orders at Starbucks, McDonald’s and Subway at the airport. Does it take an around the world trip to know this intuitively? No, but it certainly drives the point home. There are parts of the United States, too many parts, that are stricken by poverty and poor living conditions, but it is not the norm. In southeast Asia difficult living conditions are the norm — except in the big cities — and even in those places where western culture is slowly replacing local culture you will see signs of struggle. In the United States it is a big deal that a large percentage of Americans do not have enough cash on hand to deal with an unexpected bill of $400. Where I have been most of the population is scrambling to make enough money just to get through the day. Today. The next 24 hours. And they will do it again tomorrow. Even though they realize the United States is going through a difficult time right now, most of the world looks up to us and wants to be us. Of all the people I have met since the end of September, only one — a Russian — laughed at me and dismissed me when I told him I was from the United States. Everyone else either said, they “love America” or asked me if I thought we have a chance to recover from whatever it is that is happening in our country. Mostly they wanted to learn. They asked questions about how our country works and they practiced their English while talking with me. I brought a Boston Red Sox hat with me on this trip and the few times I have worn it people have asked me why I don’t have a Boston accent. I told a Canadian couple from Montreal that I am really not a big baseball fan — and I am not from Boston — but when I was going through all my hats I decided to bring the one hat that said definitively, “I am an American.” They laughed and the woman, whose family is originally from Vietnam said, “If you’re going be tagged as an American you might as well own it, right?” That’s right. Might as well."

Medium.com,Life,Why You Should Pursue Sadness,Travel,https://medium.com/@decadentsavant/why-you-should-pursue-sadness-204c5895411e?source=topic_page---------9------------------1," After six weeks of continuous walking, having started in France and ended on the northwest coast of Spain, I found myself on a bus to Portugal seated next to an Austrian woman whose first words to me were, “I’m so sad to be leaving.” She hadn’t even made eye contact with me at the time, instead having only gazed longingly out the window, not at anything in particular since our view had been restricted to a concrete wall, but rather at the memories in her own head, born of her own adventure. She, too, had marched across the country and for the next hour we exchanged stories about our respective experiences. My pilgrimage through Spain was on a trail known as the Camino Frances, a somewhat grueling experience. The first two weeks were hell on my body with blisters, achy joints, shin splints, tendonitis, and weather of all sorts; the next couple of weeks tested my mind through boredom, frustration, loneliness, and exhaustion; and the final stretch eventually taxed my soul with existential musings of what the hell am I even doing here that alternated between poignantly questioning the pilgrimage and life in general. But found somewhere in between, like shimmering ponds in these deserts of agony, I began to revel wildly in small comforts like the first rays of warm sun on a cold morning or freshly laundered clothing. I enjoyed more substantial gifts like the intimate bonds formed with other human beings born in the suffering of the same journey. I won’t prolong the narrative with descriptions of stunning views of the Pyrenees mountains, numerous acts of kindness among strangers, cathartic weeping, or any of the other various miracles of anesthesia for physical pain that made the experience transformative. Rather, at this point, one only needs to know that at the end of it all, gazing out of a bus window at a concrete wall, I reveled in the romantic notion that I had escaped the mundaneness of my routine life, lived a crazy adventure unlike any other I’ll ever know, and also thought to myself over and over, I’m so sad to be leaving. So there we sat, two strangers, the Austrian and I, silently lamenting the end of our respective journeys we had grown to love, my subsequent actions reduced to that of a first time, heartbroken youth — I listened to a playlist of songs I’d curated along the way, scrolled through photographic memories on my phone trying to relive each one, and fired off texts to new friends I’d made along the way. It was all in the pursuit of a small dose of excitement that might dilute the mourning of an adventure ended. But it didn’t come. Instead, I looped through an endless Möbius strip of the aforementioned activities, feeling sorry for myself I had to leave it behind. But then a lesson the Camino taught me early in my days of suffering took over…feeling sorry for yourself isn’t a winning strategy if you want to reach the end. You have to learn to love every bit of discomfort that comes your way. Walked 30 miles in the rain and have some new blisters to show for it? Good. You knocked out two days of walking in one. Didn’t sleep last night because a grizzly bear was snoring in the bottom of your bunk bed? Good. You’ll sleep fantastic tonight. Sick of eating potatoes for the fifteenth dinner in a row? Good. You’re fueling up on carbs to get you through another day of walking. And then, on that bus, after my days of walking were already behind me, my new friend, Camino, yelled ahead to me, “Sad because you miss an experience in life? Good. You got to live it in the first place.” Listening, I leaned back, relaxed, and basked in the self-satisfaction that not only had I walked across the entire Kingdom of Spain, but I’d also managed to obtain a rare sadness that can only accompany the end of an epic journey in life. For the remainder of the bus ride to the airport, with one eye crying and the other smiling, I hovered in a magical place on the emotional scales between sadness and gratefulness. I was unable to discuss my newfound realization with the Austrian as she had gotten off the bus at a previous stop. But, I hope she eventually realized how lucky she was to have that feeling of loss, and I hope you do, too, when you manage to catch that glorious feeling of sadness."

Medium.com,Life,A Childhood in Northern Mexico: Looking Back In The Wake of the LeBaron Tragedy,Travel,https://medium.com/@mazzink/a-childhood-in-northern-mexico-looking-back-in-the-wake-of-the-lebaron-tragedy-3cd5e62f82e7?source=topic_page---------11------------------1," My family’s odyssey in Northern Mexico almost ended as soon as it started — parked on a dark highway, surrounded by men with machine guns. Last week, I watched as news broke about the cartel attack on relatives of the LeBarons, a fundamentalist Mormon family traveling through the Mexican state of Sonora, feeling like I’d been punched in the gut. Years ago, that could have been my family. For just over two years, I lived in a Mormon colony almost like theirs. I traveled on roads similar to the ones they traveled on. And while the cartels had nothing like the reach and firepower that they do today, there was still risk on those roads between the U.S. and the farming settlements that families like the LeBarons have cultivated for generations. In the late 1970s, my mother and stepfather picked up and moved us to Northern Mexico. Their reasons weren’t entirely clear, but my eight-year-old mind pieced it together as best it could. My stepdad, Peter, couldn’t find a job. America was in its first great recession, the Carter era of rampant inflation where prices rose faster than pay rates. My mother was a stay-at-home mom. They were living off of their savings and Peter was doing odd jobs, mostly landscaping, to bring in some kind of cash. When he got wind of a job teaching at a private school in a Mormon colony in the Mexican state of Chihuahua, my stepdad jumped at the chance. That’s what started our odyssey among the Mormons of Northern Mexico. One that almost ended as soon as it started — with our RV parked on the side of a two-lane highway in Chihuahua in the middle of the night, surrounded by men with machine guns. Let me backtrack a bit. Nowadays, I doubt that many U.S. citizens would think, “Hey, I should escape all the problems of modern civilization by moving to Mexico!” In the ’70s and early ’80s, though, the idea caught some people’s imaginations — including my stepfather’s. Escaping to a less developed part of the world was part of the American zeitgeist of the time. The final scene in the 1984 movie The Terminator, when Sarah Connor escapes into Mexico to hide in the mountains and wait for nuclear war and the rise of the machines, illustrates that thought pretty well. Everything seemed to be falling apart, and war with the USSR seemed almost certain. And there, just to the south of us, was Mexico, which Americans thought of — if they thought about it at all — as a poverty-stricken neighbor filled with stereotypical serape-wearing peasants tucked under big sombreros. The dollar was strong against the peso, so living there would be cheap, and the locals would be grateful for our cash. Peter had gotten a lead about the teaching job in Mexico while visiting some of his Mennonite cousins in the mountains north of Chihuahua City. The enthusiastic young Mormon who told him about it said the job was all but his — he just needed to be living in the area — and that he knew of a rental home available right away. To my stepdad, especially after touring the prosperous Mennonite farms of Cuauhtémoc and the Mormon ranches north of the mountains, Mexico seemed like the answer to all of his problems. Peter flew home and told us to start packing. This isn’t an expose of the LeBaron family or some of its extended members’ mysterious, sordid past dealings. Plenty of news outlets are trying to do a good job of that, though the family affected has nothing to do with its more notorious relatives. It’s a memory from an almost-nine-year-old me, frayed and a little faded, of our family’s odd adventure in the realest part of Mexico, historic land of the Apache and Tarahumara, arid and mountainous enough to hide bandits and desperadoes and revolutionaries and drug cartels, but most of all, a land of everyday people going on with their lives, all amid the heartbreakingly stark high desert landscape that featured in the background of the video coming out of Sonora last week. Northern Mexico has always had a pretty large element of lawlessness compared to most of the U.S. Most Americans don’t really understand how it all fits, who knows who, or what slights and vendettas drive the gunfights that erupt periodically across the region. Few know how different it is to travel there compared to the States. That willful ignorance is why my family found itself surrounded by men with guns in the middle of the night in early January 1979. We had crossed into Mexico a few hours before, five kids and a dog packed into the back of our hardy little Toyota Chinook. My stepdad drove, mom navigated from the passenger seat. As the sun set, we rolled slowly through Ciudad Juarez, the border city that in so many ways is an extension of and polar opposite of its sister city El Paso. Juarez was lively back then, before the cartels, a place for Americans to shop cheaply and spend the evening in its restaurants and bars. There was still enough violent crime that my mother ordered the curtains shut in the back of the RV so that no one could see in. My brothers and I took turns peering out between the curtains, watching the storefronts glide past in the darkness. Then we were out of Juarez and past the suburbs, and then we were beyond the streetlights, driving into pitch-black darkness. We drifted to sleep as the Toyota’s engine hummed along. We were jerked awake when the RV swerved suddenly. A big, all-steel Pontiac was swerving back and forth in front of our RV. I could see men in the back seat, looking back at us, their pupils glowing as they reflected our headlights. I could hear another car’s engine roaring next to our vehicle. “Geezus,” my oldest brother said, peering out of the curtain, “Those guys have guns!” “Get down! Stay where you are,” my mother said to us, sharply. “Don’t say a word.” Blocked in by cars, with a steep berm on either side of the road and no clue what lay beyond, Peter had no choice but to slow down and stop. Men burst out of the cars — two more were right behind us — brandishing revolvers, military-style rifles and short-barreled machine guns. My mother and stepdad were deathly silent in the front seats. Men surrounded our RV, guns leveled. Peter and Mom rolled down their windows and I watched as a gun barrel jutted inside, barely an inch from my mother’s head. For several very long seconds, it seemed like everyone outside was yelling, very loudly, very rapidly. Suddenly everything went quiet. I distinctly heard shoes crunching on the gravelly dirt that lined the side of the highway, and a man in tan slacks and a brown blazer leaned over to look in my mother’s side of the car. “Would you mind, very much, if you would raise your hands over your head? Very slowly, please?” the man said in clear English. These weren’t drug smugglers or highwaymen. They were federales, agents of Mexico’s federal government, dressed in plainclothes and driving unmarked cars. My stepdad had driven right past a mandatory checkpoint about an hour outside of the border city of Ciudad Juarez — one of several interdiction points set up to discourage smugglers of the drugs du jour, marijuana and cocaine. Tired and confused, and with a tenuous grasp of Spanish, Peter had missed the signs leading up to the checkpoint, steered the Chinook around a line of cars pulled off near a small, white-plastered, dimly lit building and continued down the dark highway, unaware that within a few minutes a fleet of unmarked cars was tearing after us. A few minutes of very polite conversation with the English-speaking plainclothes officer ensued, and then we shifted from being in the most dangerous place around to one of the safest spots in Chihuahua. We all got to hop out and stretch our legs in front of the headlights while the police searched our RV, and after a stern warning we were sent on our way with instructions to not stop for anyone else until we got to our destination. Unlike us, the LeBaron family were not at all ignorant of the risks they faced traveling back and forth to their ranch lands in Sonora, just across the state line from Chihuahua and due west of the two largest and oldest Mormon colonies in Mexico, Colonia Juarez and Colonia Dublán. They were traveling in a multivehicle convoy that should have guaranteed support and protection from the dangers of the highway. Each car likely had spare water, food and gasoline tucked in the cargo area so that they wouldn’t have to stop at unfamiliar gas stations along their route. They would have had predetermined rally points in case the convoy cars got separated, as happens sometimes. These were practices we learned to follow, too, during our time in Chihuahua. We arrived in Colonia Dublán on that same bitterly cold January morning, piling out of the Chinook onto the gravel driveway of the rental house that Peter’s new acquaintance had given him the address of. We were shivering in coats that were too thin for the climate — not because we were desperately poor but because we were Floridians, with no idea what cold weather really was. The sun was not yet up, and the pale light of a winter dawn was just barely enough to see by. Frost lay on everything: the brown grass of the yard, the neatly trimmed shrubbery that lined the driveway. To my eye, nothing had changed between leaving Florida’s 1970s suburbs and arriving here, other than the weather. We had simply traveled from one land of neatly laid out mid-century homes to another. I didn’t realize at the time that this world existed only within about a six-block by ten-block grid. I didn’t know that the next street over boasted hundred-year-old Victorian-era homes, or that the graded dirt roads were lined with maple trees drawing their water from the irrigation ditches that lined every street in the colony. We’d find out later that morning that my stepdad’s new “friend” hadn’t told anyone, really, that we were coming. Not the local Mormon church, not the owner of the rental house we were parked at, and not the school that was supposedly hiring. We had driven nearly 2,000 miles, had piled all of our furniture and possessions into a U-Haul — now sitting in a lot back in El Paso — had braved a solo drive at night down Highway 2, all on the verbal promise of a job that, in the end, didn’t exist. We stuck it out, though. We had to — Peter had rented out our house in Florida and staked the remainder of his savings on this move. I look back on our time in the Mormon colonies today with the fondness bred by decades of absence. As a child, Mexico was in some ways a wonderful place to grow up. Communities tended to be close-knit — not just the Mormon and Mennonite groups, who guarded their privacy, but the people of Nuevo Casas Grandes, the small city next to Dublán, whose history is closely intertwined with that of the original American colonists. When we weren’t attending classes at Mañuel Dublán — the private school Peter thought had a job for him — my mom and stepdad took us to see as much of the countryside as possible, relying on advice from neighbors on what areas were safe to visit and which to avoid. There were day trips to the ancient mud city of Paquimé, hikes on the nearby mountain El Pajarito, camping trips on Mormon-owned land high up in the Sierras. There were festivals in the town’s park, Saturday trips to the local cinema, American-style birthday parties at an American-style pizza place, Dinos. But we were also keenly aware that life outside this enclave wasn’t as idyllic. It wasn’t hard for me to overhear conversations between adults about people they knew being robbed or injured on the two-lane highway that stretched between towns, devoid of rest stops or shopping centers. A few days before our arrival a local family had rolled their station wagon off the highway berm at high speed, their unbelted kids scattering across the desert landscape, leaving one dead and others severely injured. Our first community event was the funeral. My mother keeps photos of our sojourn in Mexico tucked away in a few albums and shoe boxes at the bottom of her office closet. They’re grainy and faded, taken with my stepdad’s rangefinder or mom’s Instamatic. Most of them are from family trips to sights near Nuevo Casas Grandes or in the high desert south of Colonia Juarez. We’re smiling in most of them, posing with sun-bleached bones of long-dead cattle or giant stands of prickly pear cacti. Unlike our trips to national parks in the U.S., we all kept a watchful eye out for strangers approaching, for the unknown descending on us. The cartels barely existed back then, but Mexico had its dangers. It has always had them. Our family’s adventure in Mexico didn’t end because we felt we were in danger. My stepfather simply gave up trying to find a living there and found a job in El Paso, something that would bring in steady money until we could move all the way back to Florida. After two years of my parents odd-jobbing around the colonies, we had something like a stable life again. But I think often about our time in Mexico, and the people we left behind. There are plenty of good reasons that the LeBaron family chose to stay on their ranch land despite the dangers of the cartels. Rebecca Janzen’s summary of their history in Sonora and with the cartels is one of the most accurate you’ll find online right now. Further, it’s a beautiful country, not yet ruined by the corporate development that has turned U.S. cities into generic copies of each other. You won’t see McDonald’s and Buffalo Wild Wings restaurants stamped on the landscape every ten miles. It’s a place where neighbors still take care of each other, and where kids can stretch out and run outside. But it’s also a region where violence can lash out and end that idyll. Sometimes it’s predictable; sometimes it’s not. I’ve been gone from Mexico so long that I couldn’t begin to decipher what the cartel’s reasons were for attacking a vehicle filled with women and children. I only know that the possibility for violence has always been present in the region, existing side by side with the quiet communities of Mexicans, of Mormons, and of Mennonites that have tried to get along there for more than a century."
Medium.com,Life,A Reluctant Pilgrimage to Varanasi,Travel,https://medium.com/nomudnolotus-writer/a-reluctant-pilgrimage-to-varanasi-4b30a8de3ccc?source=topic_page---------12------------------1," Celebrating my birthday with a longtime friend in Varanasi was gift enough. The unexpected bonus was that our visit to this ancient city overlapped with a Kumbh Mela, a monumental religious event that takes place in India certain years, according to auspicious dates on the Hindu lunar-solar calendar. Pilgrims, including lay and clerical people, arrive in masses for the major Kumbh Mela (last one was 2013), which exceeds even the size of the Haj pilgrimage to Mecca. Just as Burning Man transforms a serene desert landscape into a swarming village for a weekend, Kumbh Mela, major or half-size, sprouts a buzzing tent city-like wallpaper that can be peeled off when the event ends. Kumbh Mela’s centerpiece is the ritual dip in Mother Ganga, whose waters, notwithstanding pollution, have long been regarded as soul-cleansing, sin-absolving, and regenerative. This year’s Kumbh Mela, a so-called “half” one, was centered at Prayagraj (formerly Allahabad), some seventy-five miles from Varanasi. Oga and I would watch the Naga Sadhu sect pour into Varanasi, setting up camp along the ghats, or riverbanks, in preparation for the collective dunk. Sadhus, according to the Times of India, comprise “one of the toughest streams of asceticism,” that rigorous practice of self-denial that seems to have been perfected in India over the ages. Sadhus renounce the material world. Many shave their hair except for a symbolic tuft, a shikha, at the back of the skull, a sort of divining rod that channels cosmic energy for the purpose of enlightenment. They perform pind-daan, a solemn celebration of their own physical death. They push the body to and beyond its limits, in their quest to eradicate sexual desire and silence the ego. When not attending Kumbh Mela, many meditate in the Himalayas, perform social work, or retreat to remote caves. This was my first, Oga’s fifth, visit to Varanasi—her proclaimed favorite city. I couldn’t have had a better guide as Oga’s been traveling the huge subcontinent frequently over the past sixteen years. She arranged our lodging at the Azure Guest House, a five-minute stroll to Assi Ghat, one of the eighty-seven riverbanks along the Ganges, including the three designated cremation ghats. The first morning, spurred by innocent curiosity in a new and exotic city, the bliss of discovery was mine. I ventured out alone at dawn and made my way to Assi Ghat. Amid the phantasmagorical carnivalesque atmosphere one expects in India was a preponderance of red and saffron robes. A Hindu priest near a long altar of ornamental liturgical items was just finishing puja in observance of the rising sun. I fell in line with the faithful to receive what I whimsically called “Holy Communion.” When it was my turn to bow to the young priest, I held out my palm, received and savored the anise-flavored pralines. He waved incense smoke over his head. I did so too. I bowed and said Namaste. I felt one with the communicants. As the morning broke full and bright, a yoga class and jazz musicians on tabla and clarinet ramped up the interactive offerings. I returned to my guest house and joined Oga for chai and porridge. Sona, our hostess, had spoiled us the night before with hand-crafted paratha and aloo gobi, a spicy stew of cauliflower, potatoes, and onions. Before we left, we’d each pack a small container of Sona’s secret chai blend. “It’s so clean and fragrant,” we cooed as we sipped the sweet milky Assam tea. As I related to Oga the myriad sensory invasions I’d just experienced, a woman’s voice interjected, “Don’t you just love it!” A declarative sentence requiring only an affirmative. She was a guest from Vancouver, on her way to Nepal with her husband and she meant to be sociable. But I bristled inwardly. The bliss of discovery drained with a sucking sound heard only in my head. Delusion slapped me in the face like a wet garment just plunged in Mother Ganga. Her innocent comment sparked the awakening to the fact of my being a tourist, not a pilgrim. Like the proverbial monk meditating with the urgency of his hair on fire, I would spend the next five days contemplating my inner dilemma, while also being immersed in the fantasia unique to India. Amid the cultural beauty and historical wonders, there are grit, poverty, indigence, and putrescence, elements to love when you can leave them. Is the detachment I aspire to really indifference? Hence, a knotty sense of separateness arose, the duality that is the root of suffering, the Buddha taught. Pilgrim or tourist, culture hound or voyeur was my constant mantra. Oga was my saving grace. Our friendship was born in one thunderclap twenty-seven years ago, when our eyes met at Beginners Mind Temple, the San Francisco Zen Center. Although she and her husband now live in Berlin, we rendezvous around the world, including a few times in southern India. I perceived that the same grace and joie-de-vivre that drew me to Oga, was working its magic on the many Sadhus we encountered on the banks of the Ganges. Despite their allegiance to abstemious ways, Oga could spontaneously generate sociable exchanges that transform monastic solemnity into gregarious connection. It took me a while to get inured to the casual nakedness of some Sadhus who had smeared their bodies head to toe with ashes and sometimes strung bells on their penises, a form of immolation. Admittedly, I was more voyeur than anything at first. Oga, being more savvy, would wait until after a period of sincerely engaging with them before asking, “May I take your photo?” As curious about us as we were about them, invariably they said yes, and often wanted to know was Oga Chinese? Japanese? When she answered, “Korean,” they gushed about loving South Korea. And I felt, by association, invited into their graces. Once Oga had me sit among a handsome group of Sadhus, who laughed unrestrained as she coaxed smiles to snap us. I too felt release and recouped some sense of oneness with the fellows. How could I not lose self-consciousness on our strolls along the ghats, the air on the spectrum from fragrant to putrid, but always alive, festive, electric with human enterprise? We brushed past swaying saris, vendor tables with garlands of fresh flowers, clutches of various religious groups in pure white or saffron who had come together for their spiritual “Woodstock.” They cooked on dung fires, smoked hashish, incanted soulfully in front of make-shift altars to any of India’s manifold deities. Women created a neon stream of sari silks and jangling jewelry as they perambulated around a sacred gnarled tree, chanting in Hindi. Like giant prayer flags, laundry washed in the Ganges festooned the sloping banks. Monkeys, goats, pigs, and cows hung with their own. I startled when a dead cow floated down river, but people heedlessly went on bathing, brushing teeth, washing clothes. At the burning ghat we watched a man unwrap and tenderly kiss his elderly father’s forehead. The corpse was being readied on sandalwood, to be burned and then consumed by the Ganges. The kiss, one of many steps in Hindu cremation, transported me back to my childhood watching old Sicilian relatives laid out ceremoniously in death. We children were not shielded from the stilled bodies of our kin, respectfully casketed, to be viewed, sat with, grieved over openly-kissing optional. The details of any funereal rites are fascinating, and I was glad to have Oga explain the whole process here in Varanasi. The son left for some minutes, then returned transporting a torch of sacred fire eternally burning at the Kashi Vishwanath Temple. He ignited the pyre and flames began incinerating the mortal remains of a human. Just two weeks later, another impermanence reminder-that we come from and will return to dust-would be repeated in less dramatic fashion when Catholic priests smudged foreheads with black ash for Ash Wednesday. We watched this Ganges ritual for nearly an hour before leaving the cremation, which would take about three hours to smolder down. Night fell as we headed home to Azure and a light rain started. A group of Sadhus exchanged pleasantries with us en route and invited us under their tarp for tea. We sat cross-legged on blankets, the glow of candlelight dancing on faces of four westerners and a half-dozen Sadhus. One Sadhu, turbaned with a groomed beard, spoke perfect English and might have been Oxford educated. He held forth on Mother Ganga, his rich voice commanding everyone’s attention. He was mesmerizing, interjecting an imperious Okay? after each phrase, along with piercing eye contact. He narrated a long tale of Indian mythology about a god who had sixty sons, Okay?, who were turned into asses by an angry competing god, Okay? My mind drifted and came back when the sons were redeemed and turned back to humans. In his professorial tone, he went on to say how the waters of Mother Ganga are pure, Okay? I audibly gasped and he qualified that he meant the headwaters that flow from the source near Rishikesh in the Himalayas. “Not here in Varanasi,” he lamented somewhat sarcastically, “where industry so generously contributes its sewage through twenty-six outlets.” He continued, “No bacteria grow in her waters from the source.” He knew an American who carried a bottle of headwaters back to the States and proved that no bacteria would grow in it, even after a few weeks. Okay! We felt a tumult of warmth with our Sadhu hosts and stayed more than an hour intuiting, where language failed, their dedication to their demanding practice. Soon they would be immersed in the confluence of three rivers-the Ganges, Yamuna, and the mythical Saraswati-on the designated bathing day. As we stood to leave, the “Professor” asked the initial of our first names and said, “Return tomorrow at 10 a.m. and I will give you names.” We rose before sunrise next morning, my birthday. Oga flagged down a man with a small wooden boat. Against its blue trim loomed a red horizon as we pushed offshore and drifted to the middle of the Ganges. We had purchased beforehand small terracotta-ensconced candles wreathed in marigolds and plumeria. We each lit a candle and ceremoniously set afloat our offering to Mother Ganga. Amarjid, our rower, let me row for a spell, my technique awkward under heavy bamboo oars. We loved the perspective from the serene waters (granted, teaming with life and death) of the cacophony and animation gathering onshore. We were a little late in returning to the Sadhus tent to get our names. I relished the idea of yet another to add to my two baptismal names, confirmation name, and the Buddhist name I received at lay ordination in 1996, Daiko Anshin, meaning Inner Flame, Peaceful Heart. (Even my surname has meaning-”handsewn.”) The new name would ameliorate my sense of separateness. We ducked in and settled on the thick blankets. One of the Sadhus had unraveled what I thought was a turban, but was his ropey dreadlocks, falling Rapunzel-like, a good seven feet. He stood posing for a photo with a pretty blond New Zealander. They related, the way people do who don’t share a common tongue-through facial expressions and body language. Our would-be name-giver was quite subdued and unable to get a word in amid the flirtatious banter that seemed, well, un-Sadhu-like. The spell was broken. Our wise man, though still charming, was very young by daylight. No longer imperious, he seemed to have forgotten about our names. He wiped our foreheads with powdered saffron and we slipped into the thick of tourists and/or pilgrims, alternately being one or the other. There remained one last important side trip. Having sat through hundreds of so-called “dharma” talks over the years of our Buddhist studies, we were eager to set foot on the sacred ground of the Buddha’s first post-enlightenment sermon at Deer Park, or Sarnath. We hired a rickshaw to take us the six miles there-it took an hour. The open, airy, groomed park, lush with green meadows and fenced-in deer, was a refreshing break from the crush of crowds at Varanasi. The ruins of ancient monasteries from different eras fanned across the green acres. A stupa, a brick dome-shaped tower, seemed the perfect humble shrine to the Buddha, who only reluctantly agreed to teach what he had learned sitting for thirty years under the Bo tree in nearby Bodhgaya. He told his followers that truth is empirical, or experiential. We must all seek our own middle way. As Prince Gautama Siddhartha, he had renounced his royal riches, and at first embraced the extreme asceticism the Naga Sadhus practice, only to declare it as not the way to liberation, or freedom from suffering. As we spiraled up one of the two stupas, I considered that I could go back to the young Sadhu and tell him that, to return to his mother’s home and to moderation. But I would be way out of line. I am just a reluctant pilgrim, one who sometimes looks a lot like a tourist…"

Medium.com,Life,Pirates Attack Cruise Ship,Travel,https://medium.com/@anastasiaandandrew/pirates-attack-cruise-ship-fb8a23db1277?source=topic_page---------16------------------1," On a cruise a few months ago a band of pirates in several speed boats hurtled at full speed towards the cruise ship as we sailed off the coast of Somalia. Their goal: to hijack the vessel, crew and passengers for a handsome ransom. It was mid-afternoon on a clear day, when between 8–13 speed boats could be seen clearly zig-zagging in front of the 102,000 ton, 273 m long vessel carrying 2,720 passengers in a bid to slow it down and attempt boarding. Another attempt was reported to have happened at around 11 pm the next night. As passengers we were aware that we were in dangerous waters and had been sent a letter advising us what to do to prepare. The letter instructed that in the event of pirates boarding the ship, we should follow the loud speaker instructions to go to a lock down area. I don’t want to name the cruise liner, but it is European and every announcement, from bingo to shipping info was made in four languages, so I can only imagine the confusion that could cause in a high stakes pirate situation. Meanwhile other precautions were taken. Blackout conditions were imposed on those with outside cabins, outside decks were readied with water cannons and out of bounds to all passengers. While the upstairs decks, usually the hub of night time frivolities, was quieter than a church on Tuesday. Initially the thought of pirates conjures images of Hook, Sparrow or even those fellows from Penzance, but just like the real pirates of old these modern pirates mean business and they play hard. These are desperate, angry young men with AK-47’s and attitudes to match. They get into their little speed boats head out onto the high seas and take on ships of more than 150, 000 tons. But to view them as just a small band of mercenary opportunists looking to hornswaggle piles of booty is simplistic. Modern piracy is a multi-million dollar, highly organised enterprise that relies on investors to pull off the high-risk operations. Somali piracy started in the early 1990's in response to the devastation left after the civil war. When the fighting stopped the Somalis realized that while had been distracted fighting each other, their fishing waters were being pilfered. Some Somalis took umbrage with these fishermen from other nations helping themselves and fought them off. Eventually they discovered they could get money out of these trespassers, even more if they towed the said trespassers back to the coast and hold them for ransom. Since then the operations have developed into sophisticated enterprises. There are an estimated 72 pirate groups, or “maritime companies” (according to Oliver Taylor of Listverse, Jan 2019). Investors pay in money, or equipment like guns, in the same way public companies do in the hope of a big dividend. If a hijacking is successful the bulk of the money goes to these investors, not the foot soldiers in the speed boats who stare down the barrel of a cargo ship. The foot soldiers stand to get a measly $30 -$75 thousand. An extra $10 thousand allowance is paid to those who bring their own ladder and gun. This kind of money goes a long way in a place like Somalia but is dwarfed next to the millions paid in ransoms. There are six possible outcomes when a ship is attacked: · failure to capture, · attack repelled, · release after ransom is paid, · release without ransom, · rescue, or · ‘unknown’ — a bit sketchy, but we’re talking pirates, international high finance and corporate reputation here. But let’s say a “maritime company” has secured investors and sent out it’s foot soldier pirates who have spotted a likely target. The pirates, often working in packs of speedboats take a two-pronged approach. Some of them will work to slow the target ship down by running zig-zag in front of the vessel, while the rest approach from the side to board. If the pirates capture the vessel they will take it back, close to the Somali coast where they will start ransom negotiations. These guys can play a long game and have been known to hold captives for up to six months. The hostages are fed by way of ‘donations’ from investors. Ultimately though, the pirates know the cargo is worth more than the crew, so they are quite happy to bump people off if necessary, or if they become ungrateful guests. Having said that though, they are just as likely to release their hostage crew and vessel. If a couple of these “maritime company” representatives turned up on Shark Tank looking for a new investor, apart from being strangely appropriate, their proposition would be seriously considered. Although the risk is high for the front-line personnel, from an investor POV, the outlay for a hijack attempt is only the cost of the fuel, and with the prospective payoff in the millions there is the promise of enough booty to keep investors in hot cars and fast women for some time, which apparently how most ill-gotten gains are spent. However, the chances of hitting the ransom jackpot are quite slim. The results of the 230 recorded attacks since 2005 are: · 42 attempts failed to capture the vessel, the pirates just gave up and left, · 16 attacks were repelled by crew and/ or passengers, · 84 were released after capture with no ransom paid, · 27 come under the ‘unknown’ heading, and · 40 have resulted in a pirate pay day, 17.4% success rate. This means there’s an 82.6% chance of no return on your investment on any given pirate raid, but when it pays it pays big. According to a Board of Innovation article $148 million was paid in ransoms to pirates in 2010. But the real winners are the insurance companies who get 10 times more than the pirates, with $1.85 billion paid in piracy cover in the same year. Interestingly, the International Marine Bureau reported that 1181 people were taken hostage in Somali waters in 2010, but according to this article only one ransom was paid to Somali pirates in that year. So, someone hit pay dirt. Cruise ships have a low risk of pirate hijack. Cargo ships are the primary target for pirates given their valuable load and minimal crew. Cruise ships pose a far more complex scenario; however, pirates have attacked a broad range of vessels with varying results. But where you sail also impacts the risk of hijack, or attempted hijack. All the statistics quoted in the article relate to incidents in Gulf of Aden, (AKA Pirate Alley) as it is the most treacherous stretch of water in terms of piracy. The map below highlights the danger zone of the area. Only six of the 230 recorded attacks were against cruise ships. None have resulted in capture. A well-known incident occurred in 2005 when the Seabourn Spirit was fired at in a hijack attempt. The attempt was unsuccessful but is famous largely because of the footage of the event. You can see it here, or read the CBS report about it here. It was by no means the most dramatic attempted hijacking. Other cruise ships, you can read about here, also experienced gun fire, one was even dealt a hand grenade, but pirates have never breached a cruise ship with passengers aboard. There was one case in 2009 when pirates captured a cruise ship, but quickly released it when they realized there were no passengers aboard. Private yachts are more vulnerable than cruise ships. Eight yachts have been attacked, some resulting in fatalities, but often they are rescued or released after a period of captivity, usually without a ransom. There was one amusing incident when the crew of a Taiwanese yacht fought back against an attack in 2011, throwing all marauding pirates overboard and making good their escape. Even military vessels have been subjects of attack. A few pirates have even gone so far as to board and attempt capture, but that didn’t end so well for them. In a 2006 case a US Military ship was breached, 12 pirates were captured, and one killed. Generally, once pirates realize they’ve boarded a military vessel they quickly make their excuses and slip out the back door. Another reason the chances of being attacked on your next cruise are slim is that piracy levels have dropped significantly in recent years. Between 2008 to 2011 there were 200 recorded pirate attacks in the Gulf of Aden. It peaked in 2009/10, the same time Captain Phillips upset his crew by sailing too close to the Somali coast. In that year 75 other vessels also had a brush with pirates. The waters of Pirate Alley are now policed by task forces staffed from international navies, which seems to have put the pirates off a bit, with only two reported incidents in 2017 and just one in 2018. The International Maritime Organization suggests that: “Planning and training must be on the basis that an attack will take place and not in the belief that, with some luck, it will not happen.” Cruise ships protect themselves using a range of tactics that broadly fit into defensive or offensive strategies. Defensive strategies generally entail minimizing the opportunities for the pirates to successfully capture the ship. These include camouflage through blackout conditions, deck closures, and low noise emissions. In the event of capture, passengers are corralled into lock down in the theatre and restaurants to keep them away from direct pirate contact. A sliding scale of offensive strategies that escalate depending on the severity of the situation are available. At the less severe end of the spectrum the captain will engage a zig-zag manoeuvre and/or speed up the ship to outrun the pirates. Next is the high-pressure hoses used to dislodge would-be attackers from their ladders. These are set up ready for action before entering the Gulf of Aden. If that doesn’t work a Long Range Acoustic Device (LRAD) is used. This device, utilized by naval troops, sends out sonic waves so powerful that it can cause permanent hearing damage from a distance of 300 meters. More dramatically cruise ships also carry two snipers on board. The night of our reported hijack attempt, a sniper was seen on the top deck in full black ninja gear carrying a large gun. He scurried out of sight when he realized passengers could see him. There are also a number of the everyday crew with specialized combat training, although you’ll never know who they are until they need to kick into Jackie Chan action. The first response to being approached by pirates is full speed ahead, as well as adopting a zig-zag manoeuvres. These tactics are usually enough to send the pirates packing, this was the case for the Seabourn Spirit. In the closest pirate vs. cruise ship shave in 2009, passengers on the MSC Melody emerged from a gala night concert to spot a skiff heading towards the ship. The crew were alerted and the passengers, dressed in their finest fripperies, flung tables and chairs at the attackers to prevent them boarding the ship. The pirates fired at passengers, but eventually gave up and left. No passengers were injured. This vigilantism is not recommended or expected of passengers. So, what happened in the case of my recent cruise? Needless to say the Aussie contingent of the ship, true to the ANZAC spirit, had already identified the bread rolls as the most lethal objects to hurl at any offending pirates and were ready to roll into action, but our services weren’t needed in the end. The captain sped up the boat, forcing the pirates to get out of the way and they buggered off. The attempt however was never formally admitted by the cruise liner, or crew, except one. When questioned directly about the incident most crew members replied that it was just gossip and asked if there was any photographic evidence. Well, we weren’t completely honest either.

Medium.com,Life,How to Look at Northern Lights.,Travel,https://medium.com/artists-travel/how-to-look-at-northern-lights-2c9bb8ec700f?source=topic_page---------18------------------1," Put Away Your Smartphone and See Them With Your Eyeballs. This article is not about the best northern lights tours in Reykjavik where you can go to some remote location on a boat or the top of a mountain whose name is spelled with 1000 vowels so that you see the sky without all the light pollution of the city. It is also not about which apps or websites to use to track the comings and goings of solar flares, or whatever science it is that makes northern lights happen — although there are many. No, this article is about how to look at northern lights and really see them. How to feel them in your bones. When I was younger my family was driving through the woods of northern Minnesota and I saw northern lights for the first time. It was a majestic display of pink and green lights that pulsed across the sky like a mystical sea creature. We didn’t have iPhones back then (in the iron age), so all I have is my memory of that night. Now when I think back I wonder, was it even real? Was it as good as I remembered? Yes, I want to say, but I don’t have any photos to prove it. As a result, my memories live on unencumbered. It took me close to 30 years to see the northern lights again. This time I was in Iceland for an artist residency in the Westfjords, the northernmost part of the island. I was going to be there for the entire month of March so there was no way I was not going to see them. I would hold witness to this magical display of mother earth and get actual photos this time. I couldn’t wait. One night early in the month, around 10 pm, my studio mate yelled that they were coming and we all threw on our coats and hats and hurried outside to get a look. I was immediately disappointed. There where she pointed was what looked like a large, gray, slightly phosphorescent cloud that grew and shifted in a decidedly non-cloud-like manner. It wasn’t green or yellow or pink. It wasn’t bright or magical. If it weren’t for the remnants of the sunset giving off an afterglow, this would have been a complete waste of time, I thought. What I didn’t realize is that, like ghosts and tropical fish, you often can’t really see northern lights until you put them under the right lens. The main reason is because of the inadequacy of the cones in our eyes, the part that sees colors. The lights are too far away so the photons show up as mostly black and white-ish. One way to distinguish if you are actually looking at northern lights, and not a murderous mist come to destroy you, is to hold up your smartphone camera and see if the weird cloud turns green. After you have determined that you are in fact looking at northern lights and that you would like to hold firm in your commitment to experience them, I offer you these three tips for making the most of it. After my anecdote, you might be surprised that my advice for the best way to take in the northern lights is, in fact, to put away your smartphone and resist the urge to take photos with it. But here’s why. While smartphone cameras are a good tool to spot northern lights in an ambiguous sky, you can guarantee that any smartphone picture you take of the night sky is going to be terrible — just like they were when you tried to photograph the lunar eclipse, or the super blood wolf moon, the solar eclipse and all those sunsets. (Yes, I’m calling you all for all those crappy sunset photos. Enough is enough!) And it will be tempting to try and take a million photos to get “the perfect shot.” I mean who amongst us hasn’t done it, myself included, (and continues to do it every day, almost out of habit when you see something, anything of note.) It is practically ingrained in our culture that we must lock down at least one travel photo that will drive friends and followers northern-lights-green with envy. But honestly, when it comes to northern lights you would do better to just get a photo off that guy setting up with his tripod and telephoto zoom lens because you are never going to get it with your phone’s camera. In case you are feeling defensive that your expensive smartphone is up to the task, the science behind nighttime photography requires that you have complete stillness and open your aperture for at least 10 seconds. Neither of which is possible if you are holding your phone above your head and trying to mash down on the photo button with your numb fingers. (However, if you do have a fancy camera, here are some tips on setting it up.) 2. Ok, no really. Put down your phone for real this time. I assume by this point you have tried, despite my best advice, to get some good photos of the northern lights on your phone. You paid good money to come all this way so why wouldn’t you want some memories. I mean YOLO, right? Right. I do it too, but after a few pictures I am going to tell you again: put that damn phone in your coat pocket, put your gloves back on (your hands must be freezing!) and see the northern lights (super bloody bat moon, solar plexus eclipse, etc) with your goddamn eyeballs. I’m sorry for swearing, but in part, it’s because you are completely ruining my vibe with all your loud fake aperture clicking sounds (you know you can turn that off) and the use of flash which will not help you get better focus of the natural laser light show happening 60 miles above you. It’s only making it harder for everyone’s eyes to adjust to the night sky. When you do put your phone down, resist the temptation to pick it back up and use it to take a picture every time something shifts in the sky — which is every 20 seconds. Instead, pay attention to the subtle shift in colors and think about how the light takes 8 minutes and 20 seconds to travel from the sun to the earth, lighting up the atmosphere and causing the beautiful display before you. Despite this fascinating tidbit, You may feel bored or worse, like you are coming down from a caffeine rush and there are no Starbucks in sight. All of a sudden seeing the northern lights is not as special if you can’t use this moment to brag to your friends. What is even the point?, you may think. Even worse you may be stuck on some boat tour in the middle of the Atlantic Ocean, in which case you have little escape from this existential mini-crisis. For the rest of you, you have the chance to move forward with your sightseeing from a place of consciousness- or not. Either be in the moment or go back inside and drink a hot toddy, you tried your best. 3. Close your eyes and feel the northern lights in your body For those of you that are still in it for the memories, you have made the commitment to “be in the moment” and are starting to sit with your boredom. On top of that feeling, you are probably starting to get cold, really cold. It’s a little known fact that northern lights can only happen on the coldest day of the year, to date. (It’s true, look it up in my factbook.) Plus the wind is starting to eat through the many layers of clothing you bought at the REI store in anticipation of your trip to the closest location near the arctic circle that you ever plan to go. It is at this moment that you need to dig in and appreciate where you are. Humble yourself to the natural world. Close your eyes and feel the northern lights, and arctic winds, wash over you. Feel them in your shivering body and let the dancing green and yellow lights warm you — or at least inspire you enough that you forget how cold it is. How often are you in the presence of large waves of colorful photons moving through the atmosphere. Rather than trying to contain it by thinking, be awed by it. We are all made of light and energy. You are the northern lights and they are you."
Medium.com,Life,8 Things I’ve Learned From 8 Months of Traveling,Travel,https://medium.com/@michaelbjornhuseby/8-things-ive-learned-from-8-months-of-traveling-8e8fe873e4b3?source=topic_page---------19------------------1," From Quito to Paris, it’s been quite a year. Eight months of living out of a backpack have taught me a thing or two. The countless, buses, boats, and blunders have contributed more to my knowledge than my formal education ever did. Here are a few tips from my travels. I’ve been on the road for eight months with just two backpacks (one large, one small). I’ve never thought I needed more. Not once. Here’s what’s inside my backpack. In fact, I’ve often thought I could do with a bit less. Having so few possessions is wonderfully freeing. If you need anything, you can always buy it on the road. Find a balance when deciding how far ahead to book transportation and accommodations. Planning ahead can save you money, especially on long international flights. You’ll also have a better selection of apartments, hostels, and hotels if you start looking early. However, sometimes plans change. I was going to spend two days in Uyuni, Bolivia until everyone I met told me I needed more time. By staying longer, I ended up wasting bus tickets I had already bought. Serendipity is the essence of travel, so you want to leave yourself some wiggle room. There’s no better way to learn about a culture than to meet the people who live there. My best moments weren’t spent in hotels or hostels. Nor were they on planned tours of the city. The most memorable experiences are out of the box and unplanned. Here are some examples of my favorites: Meeting the locals gives you a new perspective on life. Seize the opportunity to learn from your fellow humans! Always have snacks. There will be times when you arrive in the middle of the night and have no interest in going hunting for food. Having an emergency reserve is especially important if you have dietary restrictions. Wherever I go, I bring a bag of nuts, fruit, and instant oatmeal. My backpack hasn’t earned any Michelin stars, but it gets the job done. Traveling is much more enjoyable when you stop to smell the roses. Spend more time in fewer places. When you’re bouncing between destinations at the speed of light, you end up focusing more on the logistics of travel than the beauty of your surroundings. Taking your time lets you explore places off the beaten path, gives you more time to meet the locals, and can save you money on food, transportation, and accommodations. Learning a few basic phrases can help you navigate a foreign country, but that’s just the beginning. Language is one of the cornerstones of culture. When you take the time to learn the language, you demonstrate respect for the local people and their traditions. When you attempt the local tongue, the natives will usually be ecstatic. Even if your skills are lackluster, putting in a little effort can go a long way. Here are some tips for learning the language before you go. Taking photos and videos is a great way to remember your trip. Nothing takes you back to the evening river cruise or the Adean trek like seeing yourself in action. However, try to strike a balance. If you’re constantly archiving for the future, you’re never actually living in the present. Take a deep breath and soak in your surroundings. Perhaps the most important insight from my travels is that the only limits are those we set for ourselves. Maybe you think long-term travel sounds cool, but it’s too complicated or expensive. But guess what? It’s easier than you think. So much of growing up is learning to fit within predetermined systems. We follow the paths that are set for us. Traveling around the world and meeting people from different cultures has taught me there are many points of view. The options are endless. If you have a dream, follow it. There’s no better time than right now."
Medium.com,Life,"Chivalry, Rivalry and Revelry at the Cavalcata di Oswald Von Wolkenstein",Travel,https://medium.com/equestrian-explorers/chivalry-rivalry-and-revelry-at-the-cavalcata-di-oswald-von-wolkenstein-43a54471bc3a?source=topic_page---------20------------------1," 37 years ago, during a night of drunken revelry, a group of friends conjured up the idea of a competitive horseback tournament in honor of the medieval knight and minstrel Oswald Von Wolkenstein. What started as a joke with friends is now one of the most anticipated annual events of the South Tyrol. The Cavalcata di Oswald Von Wolkenstein today brings more than 20,000 spectators to the region. Offering a unique mix of adventure, history, horsemanship and cultural heritage, this event takes place in the first week of June, in the lovely mountains and valleys of the Dolomites. The five tournament locations are about as authentic a setting for a medieval tournament as any and include medieval fortresses, charming villages and picturesque alpine lakes. History of equestrian tournaments First mentioned in Roman cavalry texts thousands of years ago, equestrian tournaments have played an important part in military training over the centuries. More recently, they have been used to celebrate great battle accomplishments. During medieval times, tournaments were mock battles between two or more teams. These ‘play-fights’ often become extremely violent, engaging competing villages for several days. The church eventually intervened, and condemned the bloody tournaments. Friendlier games such as jousting were promoted instead. These events took part in town squares that had been set up in the form of a theatre so that everyone could take part. The modern day Cavalcata is a re-enactment of these jovial mounted games of days gone by. While time travel might be impossible (so far), the Cavalcata di Oswald Von Wolkenstein is pretty much the next best thing. Oswald von Wolkenstein was a medieval knight and arguably the most important early German poet and composer. Born in 1367 at the spectacular Trostburgs Castle, a 12th century stone fortress that towers above the village of Ponte Gardena. In remembrance of the influential knight and minstrel, the 36 teams meet at his ancestral home to start the tournament. Start times are staggered to prevent teams bottlenecking during the tournament. From the castle, they ride down the winding cobblestone path and through alpine meadows to the location of the first challenge. Castelrotto, the biggest town in the Alpe di Siusi, it is located at an altitude of 1060 m. Eduard Burgauner, the son of a baker in the 19th Century, dedicated his life to turn Castelrotto into a great work of art. And today most of the houses are painted intricately thanks to his skilled hand. There is a saying in the Dolomites between tourists ‘You don’t want to be the driver.’ The narrow hair pin bends between villages and valleys require nerves of steel. Luckily, an excellent public transport exists for the wimpy drivers (like me) and in the South Tyrol, environmentally friendly travel is a top priority. We caught the bus to Castelrotto early to enjoy the best view of the tournament. Once at the location, the horses enter one at a time. Each rider is required to gallop around the sandy circular track and launch a lance through a ring (and catch it on the other side) a total of three times. If the rider misses a ring, he must turn his horse and throw it from the other direction. If the rider drops the lance, he must do a penalty round at the gallop and pick up another lance and try again. At the end of a successful round, each rider must pass the lance to his team member (no easy feat at the gallop) who repeats the challenge until the team has finished their turn. The distance between the locations is circa 22km. It was a grueling day for many of the riders underneath the unforgiving mountain sunshine. Many dismounted and walked their horses between challenges. Water stops were plentiful and well appreciated by horses and riders. Italy has many medieval re-enactments, and often horses are utilized. The famous Palio of Siena attracts thousands of spectators from all over the world, but unfortunately the race is known for it’s has a dark underbelly. The victims of which are usually the horses. The Palio requires horses to run three clockwise laps around deadly tight turns, some of which are downhill. Horses are occasionally drugged. Many fall and more than 50 horses have died since 1970, despite animal rights activists staging repeated protests. Whilst there is no denying the thrilling atmosphere of the Palio — animal lovers find it leaves a bitter taste in the mouth. “There have been no serious injuries to horses during my time here.” — the veterinarian Kathrin Schrott tells me proudly. A vet and farrier are posted at every tournament site of the Cavalcata– providing extra care when required, and I note that after every run, a staff member dutifully rakes the track the horses will gallop on, to avoid any chance of injury to the horses competing. The bus drops us off at Siusi. A charming village at the foot of the Sciliar mountain range for The Labyrinth’. This challenge is located in a shady forest near the village center. Beer tents sell local lager [Forst] and sparkling mineral water in glass vessels. It is refreshing to see such care and attention for the fragile eco-system. There are no disposable plastic cups and bottles and the free bus service for spectators runs continuously between the four tournament locations to avoid overloading the roads and causing parking pandemonium. The team challenge at Siusi requires horses gallop through an L shaped track with each member holding one central lance in front. No easy feat with excited horses and roaring spectators. One by one, the horses exit a small starting gate, If they exist too quickly a smoke machine blows at the horse from behind, spooking him. They then must complete a complicated labyrinth of difficult to maneuver turns. This challenge requires a cool head and an agile horse. In Europe, horse breeding has always been a distinctly regional experience. The Haflinger horse was developed as a lightweight workhorse for the steep valleys and mountains of the Tyrol. They were used as pack-horses to supply the remote farms with goods from the valley and to work on the steep fields and forests. The breed was utilized by all members of the family, including children, hence the character had to be dependable and affectionate. Qualities that are still revered by fans of the breed today. The belief that animals have the gift of speech and prophecy still persists in some of the remote valleys of the Tyrol. Strange stories are told of things said by animals that were over-heard by humans and have later come true. The Haflinger, with his full, silky mane and golden coat is symbolic of the the mysterious Tyrol culture and traditions. This hardy yet magical looking little mountain horse has survived two world wars (both of which decimated the breed) and is now a popular sport horse all over Europe and beyond. The Haflinger is the Italian horse with the largest number of registered examples in the world, and watching the characteristic blonde horses working with dexterity and poise in their original environment is a wonderful sight for any horse lover. On to the third challenge. The horses ride through the largest alpine pastures in the whole of Europe, to arrive at a picturesque lake nestled in the Sciliar-Catinaccio/Schlern-Rosengarten nature reserve. This challenge requires riders to gallop down alongside the lake over a series of obstacles. The rider must bend down from the saddle to take a ball and shoot it inside a basket. The fastest team with the least errors wins. Our final location is the Prösels Castle. A breathtaking fortress that dates back to the 12th century (rebuilt in the 14th and 15th centuries). This castle has a sad and haunting history and sits below the Schlern mountain plateau. In the 16th century the castle was the site of famous witch trials, which resulted in the burning of nine women at the stake. It was claimed that the women (known as the Schlern witches or Schlernhexen) flew up the mountain to steal children and eat them and caused severe storms to hit the area. Despite its tragic past, the castle now serves as a place of celebration. Arriving at the final challenge is like walking into a Game of Thrones scene. Medieval flags and banners flutter, music plays, and crowds of locals drink mugs of ale and enjoy the local food. Horses are ridden up from below the castle and compete in front of the towers. It is a full immersion into medieval life. The challenge Passage through the doors is thrilling to watch. Not so much because of the riding ( fast-paced slalom between posts with bells), but because the horses and riders are now fighting to hold their hard-earned points. The air is electric with excitement. Pretzels, white sausages, grilled meat and tasty Krapfen are all available to hungry spectators and riders. When the riders have completed the final challenge, a prize giving ceremony takes place. The ceremony is a cheerful affair and is a replication of the medieval event Oswald Von Wolkenstein would have taken part in himself. The victory banner (and a tidy sum of money in a brown sack) is the coveted prize for the winners of the tournament. The winning team keep the banner for one year. If a team manages to attain three victories, the banner stays with that team forever.

Medium.com,Life,“The Young Who Died Delievered Us”,Travel,https://medium.com/swlh/the-young-who-died-delievered-us-8014d472b69a?source=topic_page---------21------------------1," The Mercedes taxi sped along the country highway. For the tenth time since we left Paris that June morning, I looked at the piece of paper in my hand. U.S. Military Cemetery. Marigny, France 9 miles west of St. Lo. Pfc. John Juba Jr. Inf. 4 Div. Killed Aug. 4, 1944. 20 years old. That was all I knew about the man whose grave my wife and I were on the way to visit. Kathy and I were on a delayed honeymoon in Europe, a month-long trip that had already taken us to Germany, Holland and Paris. Now, with a week left before we headed home, we were making good on a promise to a friend back home. Pat Callahan didn’t know much about John Juba either; his half-brother had been killed before he was born. Pat didn’t know how he died; only that he was buried in France in a grave no one in the family had ever seen. He asked if my wife and I would mind visiting the cemetery on our vacation, maybe take a picture of the gravestone for his mother. If it’s on your way, of course, Pat said when he handed me the directions, and that was how we left it. It wasn’t on our way, as it turned out, but all through our vacation the X marked beside Marigny on our map of France nagged at us. I’d never met Pats mother. Was she wondering if we’d found the cemetery? Did she wait to hear what the place where her son was buried looked like? In the end, we didn’t want to disappoint a woman who’d lost her first son in a war and never had the chance to pray at his grave. The day after we arrived in Paris we set out by train for Marigny, about 300 miles to the west. Four hours later, the taxi we hired at the St. Lo station raced through the rolling Normandy countryside, quickly eating up the nine miles left of our journey. For the first time that day I began to relax. We’d find the grave, take some pictures and make it back to Paris for a boat ride on the Seine without any problem. I didn’t know there were any Americans buried in Marigny anymore, the taxi driver said over his shoulder. I was still trying to explain, in my rusty French, about the directions in my hand and how there had to be an American cemetery there because that’s where this soldier was buried, when the cabbie turned off the highway toward Marigny and pointed to a sign planted in a grassy traffic island. German military cemetery, it said in French and German. Kathy and I were staring at each other now, beginning to panic. They just don’t pick up cemeteries and move them, I said. It’s got to be there. We came to a sleepy Main Street of stone shops, and the cabbie stopped to consult a woman on the sidewalk. American cemetery? she said, yes, there used to be one outside of town, but it’s not there anymore. There are only Germans there now. I wasn’t ready to give up yet. Maybe the Americans are buried with the Germans, I suggested to the driver. He shook his head, but drove on. A few miles out of town, on a narrow road that wound its way through apple orchards and pastures, he turned onto a dirt driveway and pulled up in front of a tall, stone fence. Behind it, we found a tree-shaded meadow lined with neat rows of yellow rosebushes, like Normandy’s hedgerows, stretching to the horizon. This was a curious cemetery. There weren’t many gravestones visible, just groups of brown crosses set in a row and staggered among the rosebushes. The graves 11,169 of them, we learned from a brochure in the chapel were marked by stone rectangles set into the earth. We only needed to read a few of the names inscribed on them Heinz, Friedrich, Gunther to realize that our search for John Juba's grave hadn’t ended. It had just begun. I think it was about 15 years ago they moved all the American graves, the cabbie told us on the way back to St. Lo. As far as I know, there’s only one American cemetery in Normandy now. It’s a big one up north at Colleville sur Mer, on the shore. You could take a train to Bayeux and get a taxi out there. Its only about 30 kilometers. We were hot, tired and hungry, but neither of us wanted to stop yet. We got on another train, and in less than an hour, a taxi deposited us in front of the visitors building at the Normandy American Cemetery and Memorial. In the office we found Pedro Rivera, a New Mexico native who was the cemetery’s superintendent, and asked for his help. Yes, he told us, there had been an American cemetery at Marigny nonce, but it was a temporary one. After the war, the graves were moved to permanent cemeteries like this one perched on a cliff overlooking Omaha Beach and the English Channel. He reached up to a wall shelf lined with half a dozen thick, black books, pulled one down and began flipping pages lined with columns of tiny print. If John Juba were buried overseas, Rivera said, his name would be in here. The books contained the names of American war dead buried overseas or commemorated as unknown or missing 35,000 names from World War I and more than 182,000 from World War II. American war dead like in cemeteries around the world, Rivera told us, but a Normandy casualty could be found in only two places. Here, on the site of the largest amphibious assault in the history of the world, or in another cemetery about 60 miles south, in the province of Brittany. Here he is, the superintendent said, his finger stopping at the bottom of a page. John Juba Jr. He was a Pfc. He paused and then looked up at us. Oh, I’m sorry, he said. He’s in Brittany. At least well be able to tell his mother where he is buried, I told Kathy outside the visitors building. She nodded, but we were both disappointed. We had a few hours to catch our train back to Paris, so we strolled in the cemetery, mixing with the crowds of schoolchildren, families of tourists and a contingent of French soldiers. The cemetery draws more than a million people a year, Rivera told us. We passed by a 22-foot bronze statute of a young man. The Spirit of American youth rising from the Waves. The dead at Normandy like under a carpet of grass kept green by lawn sprinklers waving back and forth over the white-marble headstones, 9,386 of them, set in single-file rows that reach t infinity. Beyond them, we came to the cliffs of Normandy and gazed down at the beach hundreds of yards below. From books and movies, I knew something about the history made on this spot, but it was hard to imagine it then. It was raining on D-Day. Today the sun was warm, the sky as blue as the water and dotted with puffy white clouds. Not an armada of ships, just a single sailboat; no dead, jut a lone family sunbathing on the beach. You know, if we stop now, Kathy said, all we can bring back is what they gave us in the first place an address. I was surprised she wanted to go on. By now, we knew that visiting John Juba's grave was going to mean spending another vacation day doing it. Wed have to return to Paris first and then set out again this time for Brittany. I wouldn’t blame you if you wanted to quit, I said. We tried. I know, she said, but we can’t stop now. She smiled. It’s become a pilgrimage, like going to Lourdes. The train to Paris was crowded, and we had to take seats apart. Kathy sat opposite two American college kids who, it turned out, had been at Normandy that day too. Omaha Beach attracted them for a reason different from ours though. We went, said the taller of the pair, otherwise identical in shorts and nylon backpacks, to lie on the beach, you know, catch some rays. John Juba was 18 years old about the same age as these two college kids when he was drafted out of trade school in 1942. Everyone called him Johnny. He loved to play football and baseball. He was engaged to a girl named Dorothy. We didn’t know any of this when we were searching for his grave. It wasn’t until we returned home that I learned more about him from his mother, Mrs. Ann Callahan, 76, who lives in the Hartford Park Housing Project in Providence. Johnny grew up in New Kensington, Pa., where the family lived at the time. He wasn’t happy to be drafted, his mother said. But she recalled a letter he once wrote from overseas. I’d rather be here, he wrote, than see a man that has a family. He stepped on a mine and it blew his legs off, his mother said. He was still alive in the hospital, but when he found he lost his legs, the shock killed him, It was raining two days later when we stepped out of a taxi at the gate to the Brittany American Cemetery and Memorial. There was no one in sight and the visitors building was locked. We were headed for the graves when I realized that I had forgotten to bring flowers. It had taken 37 years for someone to visit John Juba's grave and I wanted it to be a special occasion. Kathy was right. This was a pilgrimage, a journey to the grave of a soldier who could have been anyone’s son, brother, father, husband. In some unspoken way, I felt that we had become h is family, at least for this one day, and I knew that his family would have brought flowers. Wait here, I told Kathy and set off the rural highway in search of wildflowers. I was about to settle for a flowering carrot weed when I heard a radio through the open window of a stone farmhouse and saw beside it a garden bursting with white roses and snapdragons. The old man who answered the back door wore scuffed black clogs, gardening clothes and a cap. His apple cheeks were whiskery with white stubble. I had interrupted his lunch; behind him, in the spartan, stone kitchen, a bowl of bread, cheese and cherries sat on a table covered with an oilcloth. In my clumsy French, I told him about our search for the American soldiers grave and asked for permission to pick a few flowers from his garden. He turned away without a word. I was about to leave myself ready to believe that the French do hate all Americans when he reappeared with a pair of pruning shears. He waved away my suggestion of payment. Bring your wife back with you after you’ve seen the grave, he said. Well visit and drink some wine. The graves at Brittany lie beyond the Wall of the Missing 4,313 white crosses and Stars of David lined up on a manicured field like a marching band at half time. Five varieties of grass keep it green all year round. The cemetery was empty and so quiet we could hear the rain falling on the flower beds bordering the graves. Granite stones in the grass marked each section. I saw one labeled D on the right and ran over, excited and nervous at the same time. What if he wasn’t here either? Over here, I yelled to Kathy, a hundred yards behind me. I cringed as my shout broke the stillness, and a man appeared in the window of a house next door. Within moments he emerged, a middle-aged man in a tan raincoat who introduced himself as Donald Davis, the superintendent of the cemetery. D-10–8, he said. That’s right down here. He led us down nine rows of graves, turned down the tenth and began to count off crosses. At the eighth, we stopped and found John Juba's name cut into the white marble. I laid the flowers in front of the cross and knelt to take a picture for his mother. Wait. Davis bent down and turned the bouquet around so the flowers faced the camera. Otherwise, all you’ll get is a picture of the stems. Every trade had its secrets. Rest in peace, John, I said under my breath. The old Frenchman was outside trimming his rosebushes when we returned. He invited us into the kitchen, where the air was tangy with wood smoke, and poured port wine into three china cups. His name was Piere Letranchant. He was 72 years old and for most of his life had lived in this farm country outside St. James. His wife’s family, in fact, had once owned the 27 acres of land where John Juba was buried. It had been a dairy farm until the Americans bought it after the war. The cemetery was quiet most of the time, he said, except in November or on the last day of May when crowds come. Those are your holidays, no? But young people like you, he said, shaking his head, they never come to visit. The young have forgotten all this. He didn’t sound angry, just a little sad. What have they forgotten? we asked. That the young who died delivered us, he said. The young, they should come here. First published in The Providence Journal Sunday Magazine,1980"
Medium.com,Life,What Motivated Me During My Long Distance Relationship,Travel,https://psiloveyou.xyz/what-motivated-me-during-my-long-distance-relationship-392a60b5bcd4?source=topic_page---------22------------------1," People talk about—and writers write about—motivation like its a key that fell off its ring. You must “find” motivation. You must “unlock” the door to feeling motivated. But those cliches about motivation presuppose something: that you’ll use the motivation wisely. And also, that you’re motivated by the right things. In my experience, two bold assumptions. Consider: I once knew a guy—we’ll call him “the author”—who was in a long-distance relationship. For a year, he lived in Germany while his girlfriend finished her master’s degree in America. They barely made it, largely because the author was repressing an urge to quit school and start writing comedy. Several months into their arrangement, both parties were convinced the relationship would soon end. Things weren’t going well. At this rate, it would never last two years. This was when the author’s girlfriend had an idea. “Once my program’s over,” she said, “I could move there to live with you.” The author started thinking about what life in Germany would be like together. Where would she work? Could she get a visa? And will she need to learn German? The last question, in particular, troubled the author. He took German lessons before moving, and knew enough to be polite in public. But that was all. He learned what most American expats learn: that foreigners see Americans as free English lessons (among other things). Thus, he spoke English only and his German progress stalled. The idea of the author’s girlfriend moving to Germany was, of course, appealing. But he was concerned. Not about logistics or visas; that would all work out. His concern was that his girlfriend, who was by all accounts smart, would become more proficient at speaking German than he was. And because the author had an almost six months head start, he reckoned this might be a tough pill to swallow. But he told his girlfriend that he’d love it if she moved there anyway. With a plan in place to save his relationship, the author got to work. He sent messages to several German friends offering German lessons for beer. A day later, three get-togethers were on his calendar. A month later, the author was spending 30 minutes each day practicing German. He bought German flashcards and subscribed to ARD RadioNet. He was also drinking a lot of beer at his “lessons”, which were usually held at bars. At this rate, if his girlfriend ever did move to Germany, she might not be happy with the sack of goo he was quickly becoming. But the author’s German skills improved drastically in a short period of time. At the rate he was going, he would surely be fluent by the time his girlfriend moved to the Vaterland. Did the author’s fear come true? Did the couple become bilingual together, then live happily ever after? Did she dump him for being a dink? No, no, and no. A few weeks later, the author took a train to Berlin, tried standup comedy, and dropped out of his graduate program altogether. Then he moved to Boston to be with his girlfriend. It took several months before the author realized how ridiculous he’d been. For six months, he found any excuse possible to not practice German. Then the “threat” of his girlfriend — who never once expressed interest in learning the language herself — embarrassing him sparked his motivation. The point is, we are rarely motivated by what we want to be motivated by. You can’t will yourself to be motivated by something—in a relationship, at work, or any place else. We’re all a product of our circumstances. If there’s a competition, you’re more likely to do something. I’m not saying suggesting petty competitions—especially ones your opponent doesn’t know he or she’s in—is the way to approach everything. But as a tool for productivity, you can’t say it’s not effective. Perhaps the late comedian George Carlin said it best: “Motivation is bullshit. If you ask me, this country could use a little less motivation. The people who are motivated are the ones causing all the trouble! So be careful what you wish for when it comes to motivation. Your relationship, job, or whatever you care about are probably fine without it. The author — like you — probably didn’t need any more of what motivates him. Any more of that and he’d be dead."
Medium.com,Life,Savages and Cider,Travel,https://medium.com/writerontherun/savages-and-cider-de4cad775f71?source=topic_page---------23------------------1," For many tourists, a visit to France is all about Paris or the Mediterranean coast. I would like to suggest deviating from the norm a little and visiting the Basque country. Pays Basque sits to the south-west of France where the border with Spain runs through the rugged Pyrenean Mountains and then drops steeply to a rough Atlantic coastline. On the Spanish side of the border relations with the government are testy and have historically descended into violence. The French Basques have a more relaxed relationship with the government but are still fiercely independent and will quickly correct you if you try to suggest they are French. As you enter the region you will experience a noticeable change from other parts of France. In many ways, it feels as though you have traversed some invisible border and entered another country. As far as many Basques are concerned, you have. The architecture becomes more Spanish and the mountains more dominant. Even the graffiti changes and you will frequently see the word ‘Liberacion’ tagged across abandoned buildings. The local wine has an acquired, earthy taste, but it is not the only drink that is consumed here. The Basques have been making cider for so long that no one is really sure when they started. What we do know is that the arrival of the Romans saw a dramatic change in production techniques and capacity. As they introduced the first apple presses, cider was suddenly elevated from a local beverage to a valuable commodity. Cutting down an apple tree could see you being banished and destroying a cider barrel carried a death sentence. Though famed for their love of wine, the French still find the capacity to consume 15 million litres a year of cider and much of that emanates from the Basque country. Any Basque will tell you that this is the best cider in the world and I certainly was not about to argue. From January onwards the big buyers start visiting the cideries (cider houses) and tasting the previous year’s production. It is when the first cuckoo is heard in early spring that things get really interesting though. Producers will always hold back their last barrel for the Kukuaren Kupela which loosely translates to cuckoo barrel. Locals from miles away gather for a huge party as the barrel is pierced. The celebration goes on late into the night, accompanied by traditional music and a meal. Don’t expect the delicate haute cuisine you would normally find in other French regions. Instead, it is steak, fiercely braised over a fire and accompanied by a local chorizo like sausage, along with copious amounts of cider. At some stage the cider master will yell out the word Txotx (pronounced chocs) and the guests will line up in front of a large wooden barrel with their glasses at the ready. The host will then hammer out a plug and the cider will shoot out. Experienced cider connoisseurs can catch the stream from about eight feet away, and are even able to make their glasses ring musically as the golden liquid spurts into it. As the glass fills the first person in the queue steps away and the next person offers up their glass to the cider stream, supposedly without a drop being spilt in the process. This trick becomes a little more erratic as the evening progresses and more cider is consumed. Dominic Lagadec, the cider maker I was talking to, was as proudly Basque as any of his fellow countrymen. “Basques are savages,” he told me fiercely. “They live for walking in the mountains, playing pelote and drinking Segarno (strong cider).” Pelote is a game in which a hard ball is hurled across a court by players dressed in white with traditional red Basque scarves. The ball is caught and hurled with the aid of a basket like glove which projects it with the force of a cannonball. It is hugely popular in the region and the games are a tourist attraction in their own right. The coastal city of Bayonne is the largest city in the Pays Basque and Biarritz is another large coastal town well worth a visit. From there, access to the cideries or local pelote tournaments is easily arranged. The Kukuaren Kupela takes place well before the tourist season gets underway. This makes it a very authentic and local event and if you can plan a trip around that time you are unlikely to regret it."

Medium.com,Life,One day in East Berlin,Travel,https://medium.com/@Chris_Creegan/one-day-in-east-berlin-c4a7ef88a3a0?source=topic_page---------26------------------1," I never went to East Berlin. Not really. By the time I first set foot there on a freezing, grey morning in December 1989, it was too late. I was 28. The Berlin Wall, built six months after I was born, had fallen just weeks earlier. Those exultant scenes of hammers and chisels being taken to the concrete barrier — long imprinted in the memory of anyone over 40 today — were still held in the world’s gaze. Across the world, the Wall had been the most powerful symbol of the Iron Curtain. Not for nothing had Ronald Reagan urged Mikhail Gorbachev to tear it down. I was staying with a friend near Kleistpark in West Berlin’s Schöneberg district. She had been there that night. As she regaled me with her recollections, the story beyond the newsreel came to life. Arm in arm with a fellow reveller from the West, she’d strode down Unter den Linden, swigging from a bottle of something they scarcely needed. They were drunk with exhilaration. I marvelled that she had been there — part of history before it had even been written. My visit that December was fortuitous but there was no getting away from the fact I’d missed the main event. Everything had changed, not just in Berlin. The fall of the Wall was part of a chain reaction that had taken hold across Eastern Europe. And a lightning rod for events that followed far beyond Germany. The German Democratic Republic would stagger on for another 10 months, but its repressive potency had suffered a mortal blow on that triumphant night. My friend had written to me in London the previous year urging me to visit. But in the busyness of life, I’d failed to heed her call. A mistake that. Oh, to be a time traveller. That day in December was the nearest I got to a place which was disappearing. Leaving her apartment, we took the U Bahn to Yorkstrasse where we changed trains to travel on the S-Bahn through the Nord-Süd Tunnel, arriving underground at Friedrichstrasse. That brief trip took us by way of Potsdamer Platz and Unter den Linden, two of the city’s ghost stations, Geisterbahnhöfe, at which trains didn’t stop in divided Berlin. After the border checks at Friedrichstrasse — life behind the Wall had returned to a kind of faux normality — we headed first to Alexanderplatz with more Ostmarks than we could possibly need for a day. Just days before the Wall toppled, more than half a million East Germans had protested there. Wir Sind Das Volk — We Are The People. But however determined and hopeful they must have been, they couldn’t have imagined its demise would come so quickly. I didn’t own a camera or keep a journal. I have no photographs or diary entries to conjure up that day. Just a few fragmented memories. And yet it’s one I’ve returned to in my mind’s eye almost as much as any other in my life. I have often wished I could recall more. But I was too busy living it to record it. There’s a lot to be said for being in the moment unfettered by social media. I was just there. I had passed through East Berlin a few days earlier. Arriving bleary-eyed on an overnight train from Stuttgart, I mused that it was too late to defect. I watched East Berliners trudging to work through the snow. Two-stroke Trabants chugged along beside them belching out fumes into the brown coal sepia. Now I was there, the city took on a different complexion from the iconic images of the multi-coloured outer wall that had glued us to our television screens. A reminder that for East Germans, the inner wall, which we never got to see, was graffiti-free and beyond it lay a death strip. East Berlin seemed monochrome. It took me a moment to realise why and then it came to me. There was no advertising. Living in London I’d become so accustomed to the bright lights of capitalism, I had to blink to register their absence. In thin winter light, we took a tram up Prenzlauer Allee, accompanied by the Pet Shop Boys’ West End Girls on a transistor radio. Not ours but that of an East Berliner. It was as if he’d known we were coming. Later as dusk fell, we went in search of gay East Berlin. Tripping lightly down Stargarderstrasse under dim streetlights, we arrived at a place you’d hardly have known was there. Beyond its heavily curtained doorway, we took tea while a string quartet played. Its quaintness was a far cry from West Berlin’s vibrant and raunchy gay scene. Our final stopping point of the day was a local restaurant where we ate simple fare and drank beer among East Berliners. Berlin may have been caught in the world’s spotlight, but daily life went on. A trip on a tram, afternoon tea and an early evening meal. Hardly remarkable, yet utterly memorable. It would be seven years before I returned to East Berlin. Life got in the way again. By then, though remnants of the GDR were still plentiful, it was one half of a city long since unified. I’ve lost count of the number of times I’ve returned to Berlin in the intervening years — 40 visits, maybe more. Mostly a weekend, sometimes longer. Nearly always to Prenzlauer Berg. All because the footfall of that first trip was the beginning of a love affair which still endures. And yet to this day, that first attack of love feels almost fraudulent. I went to East Berlin, a card-carrying member of the Communist Party of Great Britain. I was part of a movement which, however critical of Stalinism it had become, was dedicated to something, the downfall of which the city now basked in. The most extraordinary thing about that day though — and my time in West Berlin — is that among all the images I can still recall, the Wall itself is not one of them. It’s almost as if it wasn’t there. And of course, in a way it wasn’t. The structure was still more or less intact, but its agency had been destroyed. I can’t remember it because — in its truest sense — it had gone. Just as East Berlin had. I still divide the city in two when I’m in Berlin. The Wall I don’t remember seeing has left its mark, even for me. And whenever I think of November 9th, 1989 — still the most significant political moment of my life — I think of that day. And my trip to a place that had already slipped into the past."
Medium.com,Life,An Indian’s Guide to the States…,Travel,https://medium.com/@salmatrish/an-indians-guide-to-the-states-b34264b11087?source=topic_page---------27------------------1," I wanted to write this within a month of moving to the States but I felt that I didn’t have enough experience to make an accurate observation. Now that I have entered month 9, I feel I am totally qualified to make expert commentary and generalization of the American experience for an Indian. I start with snow because that was my first experience here. I moved in the dead of winter. To Fargo, of all places! I was so not looking forward to it. I was sure that my winter experience would comprise of slipping and falling multiple times everyday. I balked at the suggestion that just a warm coat would be enough to keep me warm-surely the recipe for disastrous frost bites! However, the actual experience turned out to be far more pleasant. I marveled at how the snow glistened at night, at the snow covered rooftops with icicles hanging from the edge, at the frozen lakes that one could walk on…And I didn’t break any bones or freeze to death! 2. Fall will make up for the downsides of being away from home..almost I have already written about the wonder called Fall (for someone like me who has never experienced it before) in this post. I was fortunate enough to do a lot of traveling the past few months and I have seen some beautiful mountains, lakes, beaches, forests, etc., but still my first fall experience belongs in the top 5. 3. People are polite..too polite Keep in mind that I spent a lot of the time in the Mid-West in the past few months..which is notorious for its nice/polite people. Coming from a place where people rush to stand in front of the queue (sometimes shoving others to get there), give borderline rude stares to foreigners, don’t care about pedestrians, etc., the politeness is a bit jarring and unnerving. Crossing streets (as a pedestrian) is an awkward ‘first you; no, first you!’ game. And all the time spent holding doors for the next person that Hugh Laurie jokes about in the video above.. People always seem to be apologizing without doing anything wrong! In Indian families, politeness is equivalent to formality…if I start saying, ‘could you please pass the <insert food item>?’, ‘thank you for letting us stay with you’, etc., to my family, they will think I’ve lost my marbles. Here, that’s the norm. 4. Everyone’s pro at small talk Even Americans who identify themselves as introverts can hold long small-talk conversations. People in restaurants, subways, etc., can be frequently heard exchanging pleasantries like ‘How’s your day?’/‘How’s it going?’ or ‘Have a good day!’. Initially, I gave a curt and embarrassed, ‘Good’ or ‘Thank you’ and then fumbled with the phone to check imaginary messages to end the conversation. Now, I can (proudly) respond with ‘Good, how about you?’ and ‘Thanks! You too!’. I still have a long way to go to actually hold small-talk conversations. 5. You will miss the Indian Bidet (or more aptly, the butt hose)..and no, it doesn’t get easier with time Indian bidet is a convenience that I miss most fervently. I am sure all Indians do. It’s especially difficult for us women during that time of the month. Toilet papers just don’t seem enough. Every time I use the toilet, I have to fight the urge to take a shower immediately afterwards. Tip: flushable wet wipes help…nothing can make up for the comfort of our bidets, but wet wipes make the experience at least bearable. 6. The blessings called Dish washer..and washer/dryer There are two chores I hate more than anything else: Washing dishes and clothes. To have appliances/machines do those for me..that’s not just a convenience..it’s luxury at its finest. 7. Diversity This is not applicable to all U.S states obviously. Some places are quite whitewashed and there, people do give us ‘exotic creatures’ weird stares that can compete in their rudeness with the ones that foreigners get in India. However, more bustling cities, such as Boston, New York, Minneapolis, are made up of all kinds of people. That’s something you would never see in India. It’s an amazing experience to see people of all races, shapes, and colors while riding the subway or bus. 8. The simple understated magic of Everything Bagel and Cream cheese I was really wary about trying bagel and cream cheese for the first time. I reasoned, ‘what could be the big deal about some bread and cream cheese?’. Well, everything bagel is no ordinary bread and its combination with plain old cream cheese is a match made in heaven. You know how people have hot cocoa or soup when they are feeling under the weather? I eat bagel and cream cheese to cheer myself up! 9. Crossing roads is scarier Yes, you read that right. I’ve crossed some of the most dangerous streets in Mumbai on a regular basis but there’s a strange trust and coordination between the pedestrians and vehicles in India. Both parties are far more alert and can rely on each other to stop an accident from happening. Here, due to the over-reliance on rules, drivers seem to be on an auto-pilot mode and I am more wary of crossing streets where there are no traffic lights. 10. You’ll never stop missing the chaos of India When I was leaving India, my mom commented, ‘Don’t be one of those people who come back to India after a few months and can’t stop complaining about the pollution, traffic, and filth here’. Well, she needn’t have worried. When I went back to visit my parents a few months back, I found myself soaking up and embracing the cacophony of sounds-horns, namaz blaring from mosques, bells ringing in temples, loudspeakers blasting some political protest or music, etc. The chaos that I grew up complaining about, I didn’t know how beautiful it was until it was not there any more. Maybe it’s just the familiarity…maybe I associate the chaos with being home..But whatever the reason, I know that I’ll always miss the wonderful chaos that characterizes my country and it will always move me to tears when I experience it for the first time during my visits to India."
Medium.com,Life,Driving Into The Unknown,Travel,https://medium.com/@claireoelizabeth/driving-into-the-unknown-5a3c26ef856d?source=topic_page---------28------------------1," Sometimes there are just opportunities that you can’t pass up, and for me, that was spontaneously booking a flight to Anchorage, Alaska, to chase the Aurora Borealis — something I never imagined I would do before the age of 30. Just me, an acquaintance from Denver, and three other photographers that I’ve never met. To say that this trip pushed me out of my comfort zone is an understatement. But, I couldn’t say no to this once in a lifetime opportunity. So, I woke up for my 6:30am flight and tried not to look back. We arrived in Anchorage and picked up the three other photographers in our 31' Winnebago — where I would be calling home for the next 7 days. After some casual introductions and pleasantries, we realized that all of Alaska would be under cloud cover for the next 4 days. Panic set in. So, what you’re telling me is that I flew 3,000 miles to look at some faintly green clouds? Interesting. We started frantically searching for any pockets of clear skies in Denali, Kenai Fjords, the Arctic Circle… anywhere. Well, that anywhere turned into a 14-hour drive to the Yukon Territory to chase clear skies and a KP 5 rating of the lights. We were driving into the unknown. And, there was a chance that we would drive all that way, and the lights wouldn’t be visible. *Note* To see the Aurora Borealis, there are 3 key elements that play a factor in its visibility, strength, and color rating: solar wind, density, and BZ levels. As a freelance photographer, I’ve gotten used to the idea of not knowing a lot of things: my next paycheck, job opportunities, travel schedule, etc. I pride myself on being comfortable with the unknown. But, this… this was a different kind of unknown. This was driving a 31' Winnebago in the middle of the night with people I didn’t know to search for this mystical element that may or may not appear. To me, it felt like I was searching for the elusive seawolves, or the lochness monster. I may seem a little dramatic, but you have to be incredibly lucky to see a KP 5 or KP 6 rated light storm with perfectly clear skies. And, that’s what we were up against. But, that’s what it takes to get the shot, right? Going above and beyond what most people (in their right minds) would do tied in with a mixture of patience and no sleep. I knew that this would be the trip that would test my limits. The first night, no luck. We were 10 hours into our drive (2 hours past the US-Canadian border), and it was like there was a lampshade over the Aurora Borealis. It was partly-cloudy with an eerie green tint to them [the clouds]. We kept searching until 6:30am, and decided to give up for the night, or I guess the morning. After getting next to no sleep, we checked the forecast for the next night, and found that there were pockets of clear skies a couple hours away. What else did we have to do? We began the next stretch of our journey into the Yukon. We took to the road, and rarely saw another car, or even another human when we stopped for gas. We were out there. And, not only that, but out there in a different country... with no cell service. Everywhere I looked, there was a new mountain range popping out in the distance — it was spectacular. Scary and spectacular. We were driving into, what felt like, the end of the earth. Meanwhile, we kept checking the forecast, which was still looking good for a strong aurora light show. We ended up finding a desolate town on one of the Yukon’s largest lakes. Time to prep gear, scope out possible locations, and make some dinner. It was only 4 hours until nightfall. Around 9pm we started seeing the greenish hue across the sky. By midnight, they should be strong enough to see. We moved further south towards the shore of the lake. By 12:01am, there they were. And, they were dancing. It was like nothing I’ve ever seen in my life. I kept joking that I wanted to see the lights as if it was a scene out of Balto. And, it was. To the naked eye, they swirled, twirled, and frolicked across the sky — dancing to some secret, electron-packed tune. And, in that moment, all of my fears and doubts lifted. I realized that this is what I needed to push me out of my comfort zone. Strangers, isolation, and time to disappear into the Canadian tundra. When I saw the lights, I wasn’t afraid anymore. And, I wasn’t anywhere but in the present. Those couple of all-nighters with minimal sleep disappeared only to be replaced with adrenaline, and running with my camera kit in hand to capture as much as I could. Oooh’s and ahhh’s filled the otherwise silence of the night. I couldn’t contain my laughter and joy jumping around rocks and watching the patterns of the lights. Was this real? I had to pinch myself to make sure it was. The next couple of nights the same pattern followed with the storm strength. And, we never encountered another photographer… or person for that matter. It was just us, our cameras, and nature performing her dance to the wind’s whisper. Somehow, that was comforting enough to me. This trip pushed me to my limits — reversing my sleep schedule (if there was any sleep), surrounding myself with people I didn’t know, driving hours into the unknown, searching for something that could quite possibly not occur (and freezing my ass off doing so). But that’s life, right? Driving into the unknown. I told myself that this trip would change my career, but really, it changed my life. I realized, that I was letting doubts and fears consume my mind rather than taking in the experience… until I saw the aurora borealis. There was no sense in thinking of what-if’s, and worrying about what would happen when I got back to Colorado. Time stood still in the lands of forever 4pm, and the only moment of happiness stood in the present with me laughing and dancing to the rhythm of the lights. And, that will be forever stamped in my mind."
Medium.com,Life,Can you help me? I am lost,Travel,https://medium.com/begoner/can-you-help-me-i-am-lost-32af85033d85?source=topic_page---------29------------------1," Puedes ayudarme? Estoy perdido. It must have been strange to see this Norte Americano, with the flat-brimmed light grey baseball cap approach her at 10pm near a bus stop where she was playing with her 7 year old boy. Le Virgen Earlier, around 4pm, I started the hike to visit “Le Virgen” — a famous statue of the Virgin Mary on top of the highest hill in Santiago. By the time I had started down, it was getting dark fast. It took over 3 hours for me to hike up, and I didn’t start to head down till after sunset, around 7:45pm or so. In the darkened terrain I didn’t notice how the road down looked different till I was a quarter of the way down. At that point, a certain inertia took over, and I thought: ‘I’ll figure it out once I get to the base.’ But, the surroundings looked completely different — more like a suburb than part of the city center. And there were tall gates lining the highway, with barking dogs to keep people from approaching too close. I passed a couple of guys sitting on an old ratty loveseat who said something to me I didn’t recognize as I passed. I knew at that point that this was not a situation I could get out of by myself — I would have to ask someone for help. I went into a small grocer and asked, ‘Necisito direcciones.’ I pulled out the map and pointed out where I was trying to get to. ‘Esta lejos,’ he said. It was far. How far? ‘Tan lejos caminar.’ Too far to walk. He tried to explain how I needed to get to the metro (subway). What he didn’t know was that I had tried to get a metro card earlier, but my card was rejected because I failed to notify my credit card company of my travels. ‘Pero, me gusta caminar.’ But, I like to walk. A younger man walked in, and asked about the situation. I could only catch a few words in his rapid Spanish, something about it being way too far to walk, that I needed to go down this street, and take a left, and a right blah blah blah. He seemed to get increasingly frustrated every time I said I wanted to walk. I was wondering why he was getting so worked up, and in my ignorance of language, body language, I thought the worst. I went, ‘Bien, qual modo esta metro?’ Something like: Okay, which way is the metro? He thrust his arm to the right, and I left. The route followed more of the high fenced wall, then I moved to the other side, which turned from a sidewalk to a wide dirt path. I passed a construction area, and a security guard took a look at me, then down to his paper he was reading. I kept looking behind me, expecting me to see the young man with a group of friends after some easy prey. In my anxiety, I couldn’t grant him the benefit of the doubt. I just kept walking, even though I knew that really I should just stop and try to find another place to ask for help. For all I knew I could be walking exactly away from where I wanted to go. I thought of the worst. His last known location was a hostel in Santiago, Chile. He told no one his whereabouts. The last photo he posted to his Facebook account is this one: A young guy passed, and I was about to ask him, but I saw him stumbling and weaving — casualty of a night out. Finally, the bus station came into view, with a few people waiting for a night bus, and the young woman playing with her child. Her eyes were wide, cautious, as she assessed me. I tried to look as harmless as possible as I asked for her help. She was possibly the best person I could have asked. She told me her name, but I have forgotten. I will just call her Mary. She told me that the men were right: it was way too far to walk. ‘Cinco kilometres.’ 5 kilometers. She didn’t know how far I’ve walked, but walking that far, and not knowing my way, would make things difficult. She spoke some english, ‘You are in a poor neighborhood,’ she said. ‘I am poor,’ she said and laughed a small laugh. When I speak Spanish or French, and other people respond in English, (like in Montreal) I think they believe I cannot speak their language well enough, and instead of hearing me mangle their language that it would be easier if everyone involved would simply speak English. They are right. But her motives seemed more simple: she knew I could understand her little english better than her spanish. I responded in my meager spanish for the same reason. Vive acqui? Yes. All my life. Cuanto anos tiene? (pointing to her boy) He is 7 years old. Solo uno? I have 2 kids, my other kid is 3. I am a young mother (laughs). Como joven? Fourteen. Cuanto anos tiene? I am thirteen three. Thirty three? Yes. I did the calculation in my head. She was 26 when she had her first son. Where did the fourteen come from? Something was lost in translation… A taxi passed. I said I could take a taxi. ‘No, it is too expensive,’ she said. ‘It is very far.’ She saw me take some peso coins from my pocket. ‘The bus does not take money. You need a card.’ Pero, no tengo una carte. I will talk to the bus driver. After about 30 minutes, the bus arrived. She stepped up ahead of me, and I could only catch a few words, but the gist of it was: He is a tourist. He doesn’t have a card. Can you take him to the station? He nodded. ‘He will take you,’ she said, and offered her cheek. I only encountered this in Buenos Aires, the cheek kiss, and I brushed her smooth cheek with mine, kissing air. I felt so grateful to her. I wished I had given her a card, an email address, something to stay in contact. And I regret not taking a picture. But perhaps this is for the best. She probably had a husband, or not, or whatever. And this way, it was another selfless act from a young woman to a foreign clueless traveler. I pondered my luck. I have, except for a couple exceptions, felt fortunate in my life. Then a thought crossed my mind: why was she playing with her kid at 10pm on a Saturday near a bus stop? And then a thought: there probably were no playgrounds in her neighborhood. That she worked odd hours, and this was time she made for her eldest son. And a bus stop with people is a safer place than a random piece of dirt. I made it back to my hostel, to my Macbook Pro, my iPhone 6s, my ability to make money, and realized I had no problems at all. I turned on the light to my shared room, and my roommate shaded his eyes, and I quickly disrobed, turned off the light, and went to bed."
Medium.com,Life,Thirty Years after the Wall,Travel,https://medium.com/@brenda.arnold_2441/thirty-years-after-the-wall-bce106230a17?source=topic_page---------30------------------1," Marginal musings from then, now, and in between Tomorrow, November 9th, is the 30th anniversary of the fall of the Berlin Wall, the most visible in a series of events that triggered German reunification. My German husband had assured me back in the 1980s that the country would never reunite. They’ve grown apart, he said. They’re two separate countries now. It’s over. This prediction was earth-shatteringly wrong, but more important it shows that he was a child of his generation. The politicians in charge of Germany when the Eastern Bloc disintegrated of an age that knew one Germany from their youth. For them there was no question: Of course the two countries belonged together. The Cold War had split Germany in half and had finally ended. Now that it was over, reunification was the obvious final chapter in that story. When East Germany fell apart, I was amazed at how all the talk was not about whether the two countries should reunite, but when. That whole discussion was fast tracked. It turned out that there was an underlying desire to reunite, particularly among those in power. When the historic opportunity presented itself, the ruling politicians at the time, notably Helmut Kohl, jumped on it and bent over backwards to make it happen and happen fast. Hans Dietrich Genscher, Foreign Minister at the time and instrumental in supporting reunification, was himself from Halle of former East Germany. Given his personal history, who could blame him for championing it? While Angela Merkel was famously in the sauna while her comrades were storming the Wall, my husband and I were sitting dumbfounded on the couch in faraway Munich watching the events unfold on TV. Our mouths had been pretty much agape for several weeks as the Eastern Bloc crumbled before our very eyes. Now it was East Germany. “Good thing we’re far away down south in Bavaria,” I said, clicking off the TV before we went to bed. That illusion lasted one day. That was the length of time it took for the Trabbis, the nickname for the tiny (and only) cars driven by East Germans, to come chugging down the Autobahn on their way to Munich. Along the way they choked the highway since their two-stroke motors only allowed them to drive 80 km/h. Just imagine a caravan of rider mowers on the highway. Anyone who has ever been anywhere near an Autobahn knows that someone driving at 80 km/h is either entering or exiting the highway — but certainly not driving on it! Unless, of course, you’re sitting behind the wheel of a Trabbi. In no time they had arrived and lined the streets and sidewalks of Munich. The police turned a blind eye, allowing our East German cousins to enjoy their first taste of freedom without a parking ticket. The sight of this flood of tiny cars that had been designed in the 1950s gave rise to all kinds of jokes, like this one: A cow pie on the highway gets run over by a Trabbi. The Trabbi stops and looks down. Trabbi: Sorry, I didn’t see you there! The cow pie hesitates, then looks up at the Trabbi and responds: What in the world are you? Trabbi: I’m a Trabbi, silly. A Trabbi! The cow pie shows no reaction. Trabbi: I’m a car! Cow pie: Well, if you’re a car, then I’m a Black Forest cherry cake! For me as a foreigner, it felt as if a time capsule had been cracked open. Suddenly reporters were scurrying around interviewing people all over East Germany, an area that had just until recently been sealed off and completely inaccessible. They were eager to interview real people on the streets, which is exactly what they did. The first time we tuned into the news I couldn’t believe my ears “What kind of an accent is that?!” I exclaimed to my husband. “I didn’t understand a word!” “It’s Sächsisch,” he said. “It’s what they speak in Saxony.” I had never heard anything like it. I had been so proud of my mastery of differentiating between a Bavarian accent and an Austrian one (something that is glaringly obvious to native speakers but tricky for foreigners). Now I had a whole new batch of accents to recognize and understand. Fortunately for Bavarians, Sächsisch has since joined Bavarian at the top of the list of accents to poke fun at in German comedy shows (all three of them) or when talking to friends who are from anywhere but Bavaria or Saxony. For people in Berlin and Northern Germany, nothing beats making fun of a Bavarian. Or a Saxonian. Up until reunification, Bavaria had to take all the punches. It was very kind indeed of Sachsen to line up and join ranks with their southern neighbors and share the glory. No wall, but now what? My husband, my sister Katie and I had taken a trip to East Germany after the Wall came down but before reunification when East Germany’s fate was still in limbo. There was a strange sensation afoot. What would happen now? Reunification? And if so, how and when? What form of government would they have? It was a very anxious time for East Germans. This was no ordinary vacation. During this period there were no hotels, hardly any restaurants — and no tourists. Planning our trip was very much off the cuff. Some enterprising individual had compiled a list of private homes in East Germany that would host people, so that’s where we stayed. In Dresden, we stayed with a woman in her early 60s. She kept referring to me as English. After correcting her gently several times, I finally figured out what was going on: She had had so little exposure to the outside world that the line between English and American was blurry. I was some English speaker and whether I came from the one side of the Atlantic Ocean or the other was irrelevant. I spoke English; she didn’t. That’s all that mattered. For her, I may as well have been from the moon. In East Berlin, the heart of divided Germany, we stayed in the apartment of a nice young couple in the neighborhood of Marzahn, one of those areas that screams Eastern Bloc. It was a Plattenbau, the name for the socialist housing consisting of row after row of sterile, high-rise apartment buildings commonly found in Eastern Bloc countries. Our host told us he was just about leave on an extended trip through the socialist brother countries, as fellow members of the Warsaw Pact were known. Prior to the fall of the Wall, those were the only countries where East Germans were allowed to travel since there was little danger of defection. The crucial detail in this case, however, was that he could spend his Ostmark in these countries. Nowhere else. He correctly guessed that reunification was imminent and that his money would then become worthless. He was right. Up to a certain amount East Germans could convert their Ostmark 1:1, after that in reduced proportions, and above a certain amount it was not accepted. That meant for many East Germans the loss of life savings. Unknown freedom Getting out of East Germany felt like being let out of a cage. Suddenly the impenetrable boundaries that had been life-defining fell away. Many East Germans had previously not bothered to dream about what lay beyond the border. Why should they? It was an exercise in frustration. This made the shock all the greater once they were able to travel and leave the country. My friend Anja from Dresden describes seeing the planes lined up at Frankfurt International Airport for the first time. “To think,” she exclaimed, “that all you had to do was get into any one of those planes and it would take you anywhere in the world!” I thought about this for a moment. Here I was, an American living on the other side of the ocean, simply because I had decided one day that I would like to give it a try. The only difficulties I wrestled with were in my own mind: Should I stay for good or go back? In the end I decided to stay. It was wholly my decision. I could not fathom what it would be like to have no control over where I live. But Anja has more than made up for lost time. The only corner of the world she hasn’t visited is really the corner — Antarctica — and possibly the Galágapos Islands, although those two places are most certainly on her list. When I started rhapsodizing about my amazing trip to the American West, I was quickly put in my place. “Bryce Canyon, fantastic! I absolutely loved it. And did you go to Arches? Antelope Canyon? The Grand Canyon?” Not only had she visited them all, she had hiked and camped there extensively. She also used the opportunity to get selfies with the park rangers and got close-up shots of all the wildlife with her giant telephoto lens, photos which are now carefully sorted and labeled in thick albums. I decided not to show her my vacation photos. It’s not that I hadn’t taken any, I had plenty on my phone. At that point I made a firm decision to sort them, too. No problem. They’re somewhere between detailed shots of spring flowers in the yard and my annual batch of Oktoberfest photos. Anja has also been to Vietnam, Malaysia and Cambodia. Together with her husband they rented a motorcycle and traversed the back roads, hitting all the temples, which she dutifully photographed — with her telephoto lens, of course. She took pains to arrive at either sunrise or sunset, depending on the optimal slant of the sun, to get just the right shot. She also knew exactly what season was the prettiest and the best way to avoid the throngs of Chinese tourists. Old, older, oldest My friend Michael lived in Paris for years and came to Munich to visit. He was baffled by its appearance. Michael: Why does everything look so new? Me: Well, they clean the buildings you know. Come on, it’s Germany. Michael: No, it’s more than that. Paris looks really old. Why does everything look so new here? Finally, it hit him. Michael: It’s the bombs! Munich was bombed in WWII! But Paris wasn’t. That’s why everything looks so extremely old there. Because it is old. Here it’s new old. I was reminded of this on our trip to East Germany just after the Wall came down. Everything was so run down. The buildings were covered with soot and many still showed damage from WWII, which at that point was 45 years in the past. Buildings badly needed renovating and the facades had crumbling stucco and warped wooden doors and shutters. A few years after reunification, walking through an East German city feels like walking through the town in Chitty Chitty Bang Bang. Everything is freshly renovated, painted and scrubbed, a Brothers Grimm fairy tale come to life. This is the Solidaritätszuschlag or solidarity premium, a tax to finance reunification, at work. There are also huge shopping malls, hotels, restaurants. It’s hard to imagine how different it looked not so long ago. Now East Germany looks even newer than the West, or as my friend Michael would say, now it’s new old. Go West! The resurgence of the far right in the new states, as the states of former East Germany are referred to, is troublesome. To understand how this could happen, imagine a high school where all the top students change to the private school across town, leaving only the average ones and especially the bullies and troublemakers. That’s what happened to East Germany after reunification. The young, moderate, and hard-working people who had been keeping the economy afloat left for the West. After all, that’s why the built the Wall in the first place — to keep everyone in. Once it was gone, the floodgates were open. There was not just a population shift, but East Germany is also treated somewhat like a colony. They criticize this situation, referring to themselves as an extended workbench. All large companies have their headquarters in the old states or former West Germany. There are subsidiaries in the East, but few headquarters. The federal government has made promises to relocate a certain quota of ministries in the East, but this program has not been rigorously enforced. Let them eat — Stollen People who are young enough not to remember the fall of the Wall or who were born afterwards, feel more like citizens of one single country. Older people had a much harder time adjusting and many lost their jobs. There are still inequalities to be sure — and the right-wing movement is not to be ignored — but most young people by and large feel like neither East or West German — just German. It will take a generation or two, but eventually the scars from the former division of the country will heal and fade. It will become part of the collective memory and a chapter in the history books. In the meantime, I am learning how to make the famous Dresdner Stollen from my friend Anja. Legend has it that this Christmas delicacy originated from her hometown. She proudly shared her own personal recipe with me. This may not be so important in the grand scheme of things, but it was unimaginable 30 years ago. Germany may not yet be truly unified, but there is no doubt that it has come very far indeed. Originally published on expatchatter.net"
Medium.com,Life,Flower power in the air: the story of Aloha Airlines,Travel,https://medium.com/@tomclarke77/flower-power-in-the-air-the-story-of-aloha-airlines-563af174cabd?source=topic_page---------31------------------1," Nowadays our air travel experiences are likely informed by overcrowding, delays and procedures actively designed to stir feelings somewhere between helplessness, enmity and exasperation. But 70 years ago it was very different. Mid-20th century air travel was pitched as modern, stylish and inclusive. & sometimes it really was. The 1950s and 60s were the golden age of the independent airline. Operators on every scale could source cheap wartime DC3s, Dakotas and even flying boats straight from the US Air Force, repaint them and put them straight into service, often flown by their original pilots. As corporate jet fleets came to dominate the longer international routes, smaller independent carriers sprang up to provide short distance and island hopping services across the world. These cheap and accessible connections revolutionised travel for locals as well as tourists, especially across the coastal regions of the Pacific Ocean. Of all the small scale commercial airlines that launched at this time the most interesting (aesthetically, at the very least) was Hawaii’s Aloha Airlines. Founded by publisher Ruddy Tongg and initially known as Trans-Pacific Airlines, Aloha was formed in response to racial prejudice. In late 1940s Hawaii, Tongg and his friends had felt the sting of discrimination. They had been bumped off flights on the only inter-island carrier, Hawaiian Airlines, which reportedly excluded Asian pilots, flight attendants and passengers in favour of Caucasians. The solution from Tongg and his business partners was to create their own airline. Says Pacific aviation historian Peter Forman. “When Aloha first came in, they were responding to the prejudices of the time,” Forman said. “They created an airline that a person of any ethnicity could fly on and feel equally welcome. There are many old timers who supported Aloha over the years for this very reason.” The airline launched with three war-surplus DC-3s and soon become a favourite of passengers by actively embracing and celebrating Hawaiian culture. For in-flight entertainment, attendants danced the hula and played the ‘ukulele. The un-pressurised DC-3s featured holes in the fuselage so that passengers could takes photos whilst travelling from island to island. However by 1958 the airline was in financial trouble so early investor Hung Wo Ching stepped in take control of the airline and re-name it Aloha Airlines, heralding an era of upgraded planes, new routes and an unrivaled tropical aesthetic. The 1960s were the golden age of Aloha Airlines graphic design with every aspect of the carrier embracing the colours, iconography and language of Hawaiian culture that led the local population to embrace and identify Aloha as their own airline. Even through the filter of our over exposure to the‘holiday Hawaii’ cliché, the application of the Aloha Airlines style guide across everything from boarding passes to advertising to the planes themselves was a perfectly realised floral aesthetic. In the late 60s this flower-driven design ethos led to conflict between Aloha and Boeing over their newly delivered 737–200s — named ‘Funbirds’ by Aloha and branded accordingly. Boeing objected to their jets being emblazoned with what they considered visuals more associated with pot-smoking hippies from San Francisco than a reputable Pacific airline. Unperturbed, Aloha Airlines design ethos continued to thrive into the 1970s. The 70s and early 80s saw the Aloha brand develop with employees from across the airline featured in posters and timetables alongside the familiar orange flowers. Aloha Flight 243 in April 1988 brought global attention to the airline when, due to explosive decompression, a large piece of fuselage ripped off mid-air causing the fatality of a flight attendant and a dramatic landing in which the remaining crew and passengers survived with only minor injuries. A heavily dramatised account of the incident was the basis for the made-for-TV 1990 film ‘Miracle Landing’ (worth avoiding, if at least for the sad lack of Aloha Airlines branding) In the 1990s Aloha struggled with competition from the larger corporate airlines and got mired in mergers and acquisitions from rivals. Hung Wo Ching passed in 2002 (funeral attendees were advised to dress in ‘Aloha attire’) and the airline eventually ceased operations in 2008. Aloha Airlines left a legacy of local entrepreneurship, inclusion, Pacific cultural pride and a positive modern aesthetic unrivaled by any contemporary airline. A hui hou Aloha!

One time I got stuck in Alaska for more than two weeks. It was 2006 and I was staying in a remote fishing village after finishing up a contract working for the Department of Fish and Game. I know that sounds like a setup to a joke, but it’s not. I was trying to get a flight, but there was something about a volcano and ice and lack of pilots that kept me stranded in this tiny town for longer than I had hoped. I had a job lined up working on a fishing schooner in New York City that was supposed to start at the beginning of April. Each day, I used a calling card with an 800 number to dial my new boss and tell him it would be a little longer before I could start work. Finally I got on a small plane which took me to a bigger plane which carried me across the country to JFK airport. I took a big blue shuttle to the South Street Seaport and shouldered my heavy bag as I walked along the battered docks towards the new boat that would be my home. I was 24 years old and two years out of college. While the rest of my friends were starting careers and getting married, I was taking a more meandering path to adulthood. There was one year during this time in my life when I filled out tax returns from five different states. I lived out of a duffel bag and traveled from port to port, living and working on board all kinds of different boats. On this day, New York was a bewildering contrast to the hidden islands of Alaska. There were tulips and daffodils and everything felt like it was moving very fast. When I made it to the deck of the boat, I was greeted by a grinning deckhand who grabbed my bag and threw it into my bunk. He was wearing a yellow t-shirt with a giant pheasant silkscreened onto it. We introduced ourselves and got busy working on the deck of this restored fishing vessel that was oddly bobbing in the water next to oil tankers and multi-million dollar yachts. That summer, we drank beers, told stories and traded insults as we painted, sanded and scrubbed the hull of that old boat. At the end of the summer we parted ways — me to California and him to Michigan for another contract on another boat. A month into my time on the west coast, I got a thin envelope in the mail with a letter in it. It was from my blond haired deckhand. I wrote back with newsy stories about my new crew and funny drawings of things the I had seen in California. For more than a year we went back and forth writing letters. We mailed each other books and photos and finally met up one winter in Vermont for several weeks of scrabble, wine and late nights listening to Richie Havens cds in a cheap rented apartment."

The wind was pushing all around us, with the waves occasionally spitting foam at the bit of beach where we were failing to build sandcastles. It was lovely. As we were there, he started to collect water from a rockpool, pouring it into a lopsided hole he’d dug. The water drained away immediately, he’d sigh and harumph and plod back down to the rock pool with a big smile on his face. Three year olds do that. They find a small ritual which makes them happy, and do it again and again. It’s hypnotic to watch. Unless you’re in a hurry, in which case it’s finger-bitingly frustrating. When travelling, it can be hard to reach your usual ways to find calmness. Baths are often not an option, and your sofa might be thousands of miles away. Finding small habits in big places can be a good way to create a grounding moment when you’ve run out of the energy to be an intrepid explorer. My personal favourite tiny ritual is arranging stones or shells. It works as a parent, as small person can either help me find pretty specimens, or pootle next to me pretending to be a bear or a badger or whatever animal he’s channelling that minute. Sitting on the cold ground and making patterns with things around me is a perfect way to take a moment to just be, something I really struggle with. Try to look at your experience here as a mandala, Chapman. Work hard to make something as meaningful and beautiful as you can. And when your done, pack it in and know it was all temporary. Yoga Jones in Orange is the New Black Other tiny rituals could be listing all the things which have made you happy in the past 24 hours. It could be walking around a park and picking up fallen flowers, then twisting them into a bouquet for someone else to find. Draw pictures in sand. Run your fingers over bark, crunch through leaves or spend half an hour staring blankly at a stained glass window. Tiny rituals shouldn’t be broadcast. They’re not for anyone else: they’re for you. Sometimes sharing them (which I’ve done, and do, because that’s how we do it now, right?) dilutes the magic of creating or experiencing something small and beautiful and then walking away. Arranging shells on a beach might not help you win prizes, or get a job, or that Instagram post which pings you to the next level. But it might be the tiny ritual which adds essential fuel to your fire. When the world is too big, and your guidebook too overwhelming, look down and think smaller."
Medium.com,Life,"Airbnb is “in the Business of Trust”, But Should We Trust Them?",Travel,https://medium.com/writerontherun/airbnb-is-in-the-business-of-trust-but-should-we-trust-them-d599e81c4d76?source=topic_page---------39------------------1," In the last decade, it’s become an absolute no-brainer for travellers to book their accommodations using Airbnb. Since it’s launch in 2008, Airbnb has hosted over 500 million guests in over 191 countries and has an estimated market value of $38 billion. The peer-to-peer hospitality network has made tucking into a stranger’s bed surprisingly comfortable. And surprisingly safe. I’ve used Airbnb a handful of times and I’m yet to have a negative experience (knock on wood). The rooms I’ve rented have been accurately advertised and coordination with the hosts has been seamless. But not everyone’s had this luck, as the case with Vice writer Allie Conti who’s Airbnb experience went viral. Allie wrote about her discovery of the nationwide scam on AirBnB that can easily exploit its users, which eventually led to Airbnb’s response. Allie and her friends were set to stay at an Airbnb room in Chicago when she got a call 10 minutes before check-in time from her host. The host apologetically explained that the previous guest had flooded the toilet and that their stay in this unit would no longer be possible. But no worries — he arranged for them to stay at another property he had nearby. He sent some photos of the new place which appeared to be an upgrade from the original, so she agreed. Upon arriving, it was obvious that this wasn’t the same house as in the photos he’d just sent. The place was run-down, had holes in the walls, ripped furniture, and no décor. As Allie put it, “it looked more like a flophouse than someone’s actual home”. Refusing to spend their entire stay here, Allie booked a hotel room and requested a refund from the Airbnb host. Weeks passed with no response from the host, so she contacted Airbnb where she was informed that she was ineligible for a full refund. The best they could do was $339 of the total $1221. She reluctantly accepted that this was all she would get out of them. So what happened in Chicago? What Allie found was several red flags: the host’s phone number was an untraceable Google number, the listing photos were stock images downloaded from a media sharing website, and several other guests had shared the same experience. She discovered that these experiences happen nationwide far more frequently than she had imagined. And because of Airbnb’s loose rules and regulations surrounding host information, guests are vulnerable to falling into fake property scams as Allie did. Guest vulnerability has now become a major focus for Airbnb. Their entire business model is dependent on trust and people helping others, so leaving their users to fend for themselves is counter-intuitive. Since Allie’s article, Airbnb has publicly announced that they are taking action to ensure safety and comfort for all guests using their platform. By December 2020, they aim to verify all 7 million listings and every single host. This year-long project will ensure that all listings are accurately advertised so people don’t find themselves in Allie’s position. Airbnb will also be implementing a “24/7 Neighbor Hotline” to respond to any user concerns in real-time. And just for good measure, they will also guarantee their guests the option to rebook in a new listing or have their payment entirely refunded should their rental not meet quality standards. Since the public announcement, I’ve come across all sorts of opinions. Some say to boycott Airbnb; others can’t refuse the convenience and affordability of including Airbnb in their travel plans. Although Allie Conti (and many others) had a horrible experience using Airbnb, I still feel comfortable using the network and won’t hesitate to book my next stay in an Airbnb. I’ve genuinely enjoyed renting with Airbnb and staying in the unique charming places they offer. There’s also something about staying next to locals that just adds to the novelty of the trip. The plan that Airbnb has set out to ensure user comfort is surely a good sign and I don’t think these scams should deter you from booking on their platform on your next trip. But until the verification process is completed, you may want to be cautious with the listings you book."
Medium.com,Life,Tales of an AirBnB Host,Travel,https://medium.com/muddyum/tales-of-an-airbnb-host-c8e55cdf19dd?source=topic_page---------40------------------1," This is me and Armando Batista. He first arrived here a couple years back. Maybe it’s already been three years? Time really does move quickly when you are having a great time. Armando was attracted to my listing for “Just a Couch”. Literally the title. Still out there too. It was super affordable. Of course, the other alternative is couch surfing, which is free. But I share my fresh baked goods, so there’s that. Toni Morrison had carrot cake. I have banana bread. Armando is a self described multi-hyphenate. He’s pretty flexible and there’s not much he isn’t capable of doing. He came for a couple nights. We had fun sharing conversation and eating. Then he left. He found a friend’s couch nearby. Then, to my surprise, he booked again, and came back. And he kept coming back. Pretty soon, he had his own bedroom here. And was pitching in with household chores. He even started tagging along on my outings to go clean bathrooms and do laundry at other AirBnB homes I take care of. We would listen to music as we worked together, sing, and tell story, and laugh. In the evening, we’d tell more stories, cook, bake, drink great beer, and sometimes sake, put colanders on our Pastafarian heads, listen to more music and dance around the kitchen. We hosted other guests. We threw parties. We talked about past heartbreak and future love. At one of our larger parties, a pipe burst in the basement and water was gushing into a room, all over the floor, in the middle of the event. I quietly, but with urgency, informed Armando about my discovery. Unknown to the guests, he and I disappeared into the basement, and began to trouble shoot and solve the problem. I thought, wow, this guy. Any woman who falls in love with this guy will be so blessed. He has it all. Heart. Spirit. Determination. Critical thinking. Flexibility. Humor. Passion. And he’s learning to bake the best banana bread on the planet (mine)! What more could anyone want? He fell in love. He moved away. He got engaged. I love them both. I can’t wait to see their babies. And play Grandma. Last night, on my birthday (!), he published his first poem here on Medium. I hope you will support this wonderful spirit in a human spacesuit, this high priest of Pastafarianism, this loving HUMAN BEING, in his adventure here on Medium."

Of all the things I wanted to see in the country’s capital, this was top of my list. My husband, on the other hand, was less sure. He was quite keen to enjoy some down time at the pool, following a few days of intense temples in Siem Reap. Nevertheless, armed with face masks (and following a short negotiation on price) we hopped into a tuk-tuk outside our hotel in downtown Phnom Penh. Travelling along the broad, badly-paved boulevards on the outskirts of the capital was a precarious journey. Bicycles carrying long steel beams wove between large trucks carrying water. Dogs darted into the roads, and dust was kicked up into the passenger carriage. At first glance the Choeung Ek Centre betrays little of its brutal history. A former orchard site, butterflies flit among the greenery and tourists amble slowly around with their audioguides. A large Buddhist stupa dominates the entrance, surrounded by a carpet of immaculate grass. But it was on this site that between 1975 and 1979 almost 9000 people were brutally executed by the Khmer Rouge. Mainly political prisoners, these people were killed with machetes, bamboo poles and any blunt instrument available. Babies were smashed against a tree. Bullets were too expensive — and presumably, too humane. The Buddhist stupa, despite its serene appearance, is home to more than 5000 skulls."

recently completed 4 wonderful months of travel in Mexico and South America — collectively known as LATAM (Latin America). In Chile, I witnessed the majestic mountains and frigid temperatures of Patagonia. A 2-day trek along the Inca Trail in Cusco, Peru, culminated in breathtaking views of Machu Picchu. Not to be outdone, Piedra del Penol in Guatape, Colombia, made climbing more than 700 stairs one of the most athletic and rewarding experiences of my trip thus far. If that wasn’t enough, viewing the Pyramids of Teotihuacan, Mexico, from the front-row seat of a hot air balloon was the ultimate icing on the cake! But like all good things, my time in LATAM quickly came to an end. The next four months would be spent on an entirely new continent: ASIA! My desire to visit Asia began over a decade ago after reading Elizabeth Gilbert’s Eat, Pray, Love. And now, that time had come. But I’d be lying if I said I wasn’t concerned about my impending 30 plus hours of transcontinental travel. Would I be able to sleep on the plane? Would the seats prove excruciatingly uncomfortable? Should I be concerned about developing blood clots? More than anything, would I grow increasingly unpleasant and cranky with each additional hour of confinement to an aircraft? I poured over internet articles providing tips for enduring long flights. I found most of the tips to be extremely helpful. More helpful, however, was incorporating the routine habits that keep me healthy on a daily basis. And when I emerged from my 30 plus hours of travel from Mexico City to Hanoi (complete with layovers in NYC and Seoul, Korea) I found that my preparation and implementation of the tips below resulted in one of my most pleasant travel experiences to date!"

Naivasha is known for a few things: Hell’s Gate, Mount Longonot, and it’s lake. First thing first, we had to get there. I have the feeling that I will always have something to say about commuting 😩. As I previously wrote, we took a Matatu to reach Naivasha. The waiting was a bit stressing. Our bags were loaded in the trunk, and the driver was constantly opening the door to add more things. Accra road — the Matatu station — is not a place inspiring confidence. There is so many people passing by, selling things, shouting, pushing. Make sure to keep an eye on your belongings. There are many stories about tourists being pickpocketed there. Anyway, after two hours on a bumpy road, Daniela noticed on her phone that we had just passed the town! She knocked firmly on the metallic roof to notify the driver to stop. (From now, on we alway check where we are and remind the driver.) In the middle of nowhere, some moto-taxi appeared. We gave our address, off we go. Obviously, no helmets on… plus my bike ran out of gaz. Eventually, we arrived in town. Wait, why? This is not the guest house’s location. Sure, but our drivers did not get where to go. They just dropped us to the center of Naivasha 🤦‍♂️. So we had to take another Matatu. This goes without saying, all the trouble we had to get a normal fare with everyone. They wanted to charge us 2€ instead of 0.5€. The most annoying thing was that they did not really care as where we wanted to go. They take charge you, load you and drop you somewhere. In the end, we had to walk for 3.5km to finally reach. We concluded that people were less welcoming than in Nairobi— to put it nicely. The trip costed just 4.25€, but quite some stress and a complete day. But our place is great. For just 15€, we have a breakfast and the shower is hot! It’s nice hot water 😅. Although, they did something “funny”. For our last day, we went to buy some vegetables to cook a soup. We went then to ask the cooks if they could make us a soup and some fries, as we had potatoes. Sure, they said. One hour later (yes), a tiny soup came with no fries, because it was not enough potatoes. Later, when I when to them to enquire for extra food, I found them all eating some soup! Just, fantastic. Yes again another mean of transportation. Matatus where full — we were 20 instead of 12 at some point — , we had to waive at a utility motorcycle. To visit the park, you can go by car of course, but you can also walk, or use a bike! It’s not that hard, it’s great to ride just a few meters away from the animals. We were lucky to see: pumbas, zebras, giraffes, elands, buffaloes, baboons, gazelles, Impala and multiple birds! Count 1–2 hours to get to the end of the main track while taking pictures. For this you have to pay for: bike 5€, entry fee 25€ and a fee for the bike 2€, guide 15€. One of the main attraction is the gorges. Sadly, some people died a month ago with their guide… Until they increase the safety and rework their handling of emergencies, you can only walk above. The view is amazing! There is also a Masai shop. They were quite angry because we did not buy anything… Luckily for them, a group coming from tours came right after us and made their month. The downside is that you have to pay an extra fee to do this “extra”. Official price is 20€ for a guide, we got it for 10€. Seriously!? Why is the National Park fee for?"

Medium.com,Life,10 Ways to Travel Light this Holiday Season,Travel,https://medium.com/@karwickca/10-ways-to-travel-light-this-holiday-season-b6effa4d3aa8?source=topic_page---------51------------------1," In everyday life, you wear the same four or five outfits in various combinations week after week. You have the combo down, and it makes your morning routine mostly painless. So why is packing for a trip so hard? Suddenly, you’re asking yourself how many fur vests you should pack. What about gloves? Are three pairs enough? Four? By the time you’re zipping up your suitcase, you’ve convinced yourself to bring that dress in the back of your closet that you bought six years ago and never worn, three pairs of identical black jeans, and every pair of shoes you own. You know, just in case. Traveling over the holidays can be particularly tricky, given the massive airport crowds and unpredictable weather. But the more I travel, the smaller my bag gets. I can usually fit everything I need in one backpack or small roller and a large purse! It takes practice and a lot of self-awareness, so I’ve put together some of my simple tips and tricks. Before you start going through your clothes and accessories and throwing them in your suitcase, put pen to paper and write down what you’ll need. Begin by outlining the trip day-by-day and writing down what you would like to wear for each occasion, what accessories you might need (raincoat, boots, etc.), and how many of each you’ll need to bring. For example, if the climate is cold and rainy, it’s reasonable to reserve more space for things like socks that might get wet. Rather than packing a bulky coat or heavy shoes, plan your travel outfit based on wearing the larger items instead of packing them. Traveling this way saves you space and gives you some wiggle room to add extra things you otherwise couldn’t fit. Plus, I’ve never regretted having a comfy coat on a longer flight to help me bundle up when the air conditioning kicks in. Three shirts. Three pairs of socks. Three pairs of pants (one pair to sleep in, two pairs to wear.) I’ll let the number of undies be a personal decision. If you must, three pairs of shoes, including the pair you’re wearing on the plane. I usually go for one pair of sneakers, one pair of flats, and one pair of sandals. This one is pretty simple. If you’re bringing your laptop, don’t bring a tablet. That way, you can easily carry one or the other in your bag without weighing it down too much, and you’ll have easy access to it throughout the flight. You can download Netflix or other streaming services and E-books on your phone, making it easier to limit how many electronics you need. You can purchase most toiletries when you arrive, or your hotel may provide what you need. Toothpaste, mouthwash, shampoo and conditioner, face wash, etc., are all items you should have easy access to in almost all parts of the world. If not, opt for travel sizes or purchase travel bottles to fill with what you have at home. When packing just-in-case medications, ask yourself if you’ve used it in the last month. If you have, it’s probably worth packing. If not, save yourself space and leave it at home. The one exception I make is Benedryl, which both helps me sleep on longer flights and is handy in case of an allergic reaction. Blow dryers are bulky and don’t easily fit with other items typically packed. Most hotels and even smaller AirBnBs provide a blow dryer to use upon arrival. Check with them first, and think about purchasing a travel-size dryer online if your hosts don’t offer one. One of my favorite things to bring on nearly every trip, hot weather or cold, is a sarong. It’s used as a skirt, a towel, a dress, a shirt, or a blanket. I like to bring one that’s a solid color, usually black or grey, that goes with nearly everything and hides my makeup stains when I inevitably fall asleep on it. I can wear it on the plane and use it as a pillow, and it provides an additional accessory on the trip. Other ideas could be a backpack you can empty when you arrive at the hotel and then use for hiking or to hold items like coats, water, and snacks while sightseeing, or cleaners that are all in one for hair, face, and body. The rule is one carry on item and one personal item. As a workaround, I like to fill the pockets of my coat or jacket with additional items, such as my medications, chapstick, glasses, headphones, and extra socks and gloves. I have extra space without going over the carry on allowances. When in doubt, assume you won’t need or use whatever you’re trying to talk yourself into bringing. Plan for the best-case scenario, and know that you can always pick up something at your destination if you get in a pickle. One incentive I give myself when packing light is to know that I have a little bit of spare room for anything that catches my eye at my destination. I love to buy small articles of clothing or jewelry where I go, and it’s a little reward for packing light."
Medium.com,Life,How Do You Choose A City That “Gets” You?,Travel,https://medium.com/swlh/how-do-you-choose-a-city-that-gets-you-77bdad6b147f?source=topic_page---------52------------------1," If you’re moving — for work, family or just for the hell of it — you’re probably experiencing the typical feelings and emotions that go with moving (excitement, anxiousness and fear). In
a world of endless opportunities and choices, how in the cahoots do you choose where to live when you are so lucky as to be galavanting to another region of the world to reside? You make a list of non-negotiables in the realm of lifestyle preferences and perks specific to YOU. Coming from someone who is about to embark on city lucky #4, I’ve learned rather quickly how to decide if a place is going to lift me up or piss me off. Here are my 10 non-negotiables for thriving, not just surviving, in a new zip code. Dive deep into these places, to-dos and thoughts to see if your future destination will live up to par… Because I’m a writer, I spend a lot of my working hours at coffee shops. Everything from the atmosphere and vibe to the customer service and actual taste of caffeinated beverages matters. While going out to eat happens rarely for me at this current phase of life (cooking at home is much more practical when you have a 3-year-old), having a good variety of places to dine out matters. Explore your potential neighborhood by grabbing lunch and dinner at local eateries. Is the food delicious? Is the waitstaff charming and funny? Working out — indoor cycling in particular — is a huge part of my life, and my demands for state of the art instructors, well-established workout areas and interactive sweat sessions are only growing. Book a class or two at nearby studios and see how you feel during and after. Are your fellow class attendees chatty and motivated? Is the facility clean and well taken care of? Is the desk staff cordial? Can you picture yourself part of this fitness community? Going to the movies is one of my favorite things in life. While I know I have to twist my husband’s arm to escort me to the cinema (aka I don’t frequent the movies as much as I’d like because #StudentLoans), knowing I have the option that a quaint theatre is down the street from me is comforting. This one is tricky to pinpoint, but is so, so important. You can’t take someone else’s word on this one either, because their perception of “good people” is probably different than yours. Do you want to meet new people and make new friends? Do you want to be around people who are cooler and smarter and more successful than you are? Do you care about diversity? If
you care about feeling connected to the people of your city, you need to do some research as to whether or not you can hang with the locals. Break down your “self-identifiers” to see if you’ll mesh with your new peeps. My self-identifiers are (1) millennial, 30-year-old woman (2) young mom (3) new wife (4) freelance writer (5) wellness enthusiast (6) family-and-friends-focused individual I like to think I have a bit of an edge — sometimes I have purple hair, I come with sass, and I won’t tolerate small talk — so if I feel like I’m out of place in that way, that particular town is probably not going to work for me. Recognize your self-identifiers and see if they align with your sought-out area. I swear by trusting your gut in just about anything in life. From job interviews to shady people to major life decisions, my instincts rarely fail me. Do you have a pit in your stomach when you walk the streets of your future downtown at night? Or do you feel a calmness wash over you when you take a stroll through the dog park? Follow your instincts on your initial reactions to the people, places and things that you’re exploring and trust they’re telling you the truth. I’ve got to hand it to my fellow millennial generation for being proactive about community involvement. Whether it’s finding a new church we resonate with, volunteering for animal rescue shelters or campaigning for political rights, we know the value of community. Find out what your future community is like in this regard. Is it a tight-knit community where everyone knows everyone else? Is it more spread out with groups here and there championing for like-minded causes? Realtors, local magazine editors, small business owners, and friends of friends are your best bet on getting the inside scoop on how active (or not) a community is in getting together. Reach out to them and pummel them with questions. While bustling cities may seem like they have a lot going on on the outside, it’s easy to fall into a hermit trap once you do actually move. This is always due to fear and insecurity because everything and everyone is foreign to you. First of all, you can’t let anxiety and fear stop you from going out into the wonderful, wild world. You will become bitter. Second of all, putting yourself out there is literally the only way you can meet new people, stumble upon fabulous opportunities, and form genuine friendships. S
o, go to a public place like a coffee shop, library, clothing boutique, salon, or lunch spot — anywhere where the people will be — and ask them what there is to do in the new digs you’re checking out. Does this town have live music? Are there jazz bands or comedy clubs around? Are there breweries and wineries and street festivals and outdoor places to commence and mingle? What kind of social events does this city have, and do people attend them? While you obviously must love the new city you’ve landed on, you know variety is the spice of life. Therefore, there’s gotta be other cities and neighborhoods close by to fulfill your need for different when the inevitable feelings of routine and boredom sink in. Take a gander as to what’s nearby and if those surrounding places are worth exploring once you move. Whether you’re looking to grow in your career or expand your social circle, you should always be looking at avenues to grow personally, and there’s really no better outlet for that than moving someplace brand spankin’ new. The amazing thing about moving somewhere new is having the power (and privilege) to reinvent/rediscover yourself. If you foresee growth opportunities in the city you’ve got your eye on, that’s a good sign for your future there. Everything from an inspiring atmosphere to the buzz of the people is crucial to both your wellbeing and ability to grow. Don’t overlook this part. Opinion: You should judge places (harshly if you want to) on the quality of wellness, work, culture and fun when moving. Ask yourself what your ideal day looks like, and estimate whether or not a particular city or neighborhood will exceed those laid out expectations. When deciding where to relocate, do not rely on Google. Immerse yourself in your newfound culture and let your intuition take over. Nail down what is important to you in terms of quality of life, and make damn sure your non-negotiables make the list. I
feel like city-hoppers like you and I are really lacking the right resources to steer us in the proper direction — there’s only so much realtors can do in recommending the perfect-place-for-us to live. I just may invent a village critic profession for this reason. There’s obviously a need.

Medium.com,Life,Kindness (and Food) — the Universal Language(s),Travel,https://medium.com/@shuyichua/kindness-and-food-the-universal-language-s-9cdec4f6fd66?source=topic_page---------53------------------1," I don’t pick up languages easily and often have difficulty communicating in a foreign land with locals. I get by through gesturing and trying my luck with the little bit of vocabulary I’ve picked up. Many incidences over my travels have shown me that language is not a barrier to friendships. Two of my most memorable encounters were with senior men who do not speak English at all. The first friend was Gonzalo who I met in Puebla, Mexico. I was wandering the streets and as usual, I would slow down my pace whenever I pass a street food stall. I am always curious about anything edible. Gonzalo, who was sitting by the stall, having his meal, invited me to join him. It was there that I had the most yummy braised pork wrapped in my choice of dough or bread. That was during my first month of traveling and I still had trouble making friends. Touched by his invitation, I stringed out a sentence in Spanish, ‘Tú es mi primero amigo,’ which translates to, ‘You are my first friend.’ Gonzalo took upon himself the role of a friend and took me to his home and showed me photographs of his daughter and grandson who now live in Denmark. Over the week, I often came over to his place for coffee and he brought me to the city center to have the best mutton tacos. Besides going out to eat together, he also brought me to visit his friends, gave me some clothes and we even went to church together. My second friend was a man whose name I do not know. He was my neighbour in Chiang Mai, Thailand. I don’t ride a motorbike or bicycle so I always walk past his home slow enough to smile and greet him every day. I only know how to say ‘hello’ and ‘thank you’ in Thai. But it seems that was all that was needed to start a friendship. He had a kaffir lime tree and I always eyed it as I like to pick fruits from the ground. One day, there was a heavy storm, causing kaffir limes to be shrewn all over the road. He caught me picking a kaffir lime, and with enthusiasm, passed me a bag full of them. This incident sparked off a friendship that involved a fruit exchange. Touched by his kindness, I returned it by giving him jackfruit I bought in the market. And then he gave me a pomelo and lukus. One day, he even gave me a chicken leg with sticky rice. He works in this backyard making soy milk, and twice, gave me pots of it, a very welcomed familiar drink for me. One day, he gestured to me something rather complicated. He pointed to me, gestured the sign of a baby, of being far away, and then pointed to his heart. After many tries with Google Translate to understand what he was trying to say, I understood him. He was telling me that I reminded him of his child who lives far away and he cannot help but treat me like his own. I have never tasted such pure love in friendship where people gave so freely without asking for anything in return. They were so kind to a foreigner who could not speak their language. It showed me that there’s no barrier to love. Neither nationality nor language could stop someone from loving another person. Both touched me with their kindness and their simple acts of providing me with something to eat."

Medium.com,Life,How Halloween in Shibuya Became Notorious — Unseen Japan,Travel,https://medium.com/@unseenjapan/how-halloween-in-shibuya-became-notorious-unseen-japan-b593bf3845b1?source=topic_page---------55------------------1," By Alyssa Pearl Fusek Japan is no stranger to wild, drunken parties. We’ve written before about the riotous celebrations that marked the end of the Tokugawa Shogunate and the ushering in of Japan’s modern era. But these days, one event in particular — Halloween in Shibuya — has become particularly notorious for its over-the-top excess. Last year’s Halloween festivities in Shibuya took a drastic turn when drunk crowd-goers took things too far and overturned a small truck (軽トラ; keitora). Police arrested at least five other revelers for groping and unwanted touching. As a result, this year street drinking bans were introduced in June and over 100 security guards employed to guard the famous Shibuya Scramble. Mass retailer Don Quixote agreed not to sell alcohol during the Halloween season. Shibuya has long been the venue for out-of-control Halloween celebrations. Yet other fun Halloween celebrations happen in other metropolitan areas. Kawasaki hosted a parent-child parade, and cosplayers gathered in Ikebukuro. There’s also the gimmicky Jimi “Mundane” Halloween contest celebrating the everyday. So why is Shibuya a magnet for unruly behavior and the sole target of criticism by the media? Marketing and consumer behavior professor Matsui Takeshi (松井 剛) resolved to figure that out. (JP) Link: “Japanese Halloween” — How Madness Led to An Overturned Truck Matsui suspects that part of the attraction to Shibuya is due to media coverage: “…未知なるものを「発見」するために渋谷に来るのではなく、メディアで見たことを「確認」するために来ているのです。 “…people don’t come to Shibuya to “discover” the unknown, but rather to “confirm” what they saw reported in the media.” Matsui describes the event as attracting, not just party-goers, but “rubberneckers” who are there to see a spectacle — like a drunken brawl, or an overturned truck. They look for these things because it’s what they’ve been conditioned to expect to see. He cites the work of English sociologist John Urry, who argues against the notion that tourists go to a place to “explore” and discover new things. Tourists, Urry argues, largely take trips to “confirm” the things they’ve already seen on television and in other media. In other words, if you see hundreds of costumed people having fun, of course, you’d want to go see for yourself. Shibuya draws crowds year-round, so it’s inevitable for something like this to happen. It’s ironic that the media criticizes something they had a hand in perpetuating. This year no trucks were overturned, although some people got creative and dressed up as the infamous truck for a good laugh. At least 4 arrests have been made, with one arrest related to unwanted groping. Despite the public drinking bans, people still found ways to get booze, and beer cans littered the streets. Fortunately, over 100 hosts got together for a massive cleanup effort of Shibuya. Roughly 100 hosts (all in coordinating outfits, no less) gathered to help clean up Shibuya in the aftermath of Halloween. Young people and alcohol is a difficult combination to crack. Drinking bans and more security can only do so much. If one outlet is blocked, people will seek out another, even if that means toppling trucks over. If the media stopped focusing solely on Shibuya, would that keep people from gravitating there? One can only wonder.

Medium.com,Life,California is Running Low on Natural Resources,Travel,https://medium.com/@codyvision/california-is-running-low-on-natural-resources-31d0bbe084ce?source=topic_page---------57------------------1," In the Golden State there isn’t enough nature to go around. By
1912 the seventy-four year old John Muir had spent a lifetime advocating for America’s wild places. He co-founded the Sierra Club, pushed presidents to designate National Parks and wrote numerous books preaching his gospel of nature. That year he published “The Yosemite”, writing: Everybody needs beauty as well as bread, places to play in and pray in, where nature may heal and give strength to body and soul. Muir spent most of his life in California and valued the region’s untouched places not only for recreation but their restorative powers. Heading to California for the first time, I was eager to get my fill. Muir had good taste. Some states compete, but none beat the breathtaking variety of California landscapes. In a few hours drive I’d seen the lowest elevation in the continental United States (Death Valley — 282 ft. below sea level) and its highest (Mt. Whitney — 14,505 ft. above sea level). That evening I stood in the shadows of Sequoias, marveling at sunset on Yosemite’s El Capitan. I was overwhelmed by California’s natural places — at least those I was allowed to see. In San Fransisco with a day to waste, I headed north across Golden Gate Bridge for “Muir Woods,” a rare grove of old growth redwoods designated a National Monument in 1908. I got close, but didn’t make it. Driving the 15 miles north I watched mist burn off the coast and gawked at the glass homes. It was early and I owned this Wednesday morning. Except that by the time I wound my way to Muir Woods the parking lot was full and I was out of luck, as explained by a young NPS Ranger guarding the lot. “Reservation?” He asked. “Uh… no.” I said, surprised. I hadn’t planned to eat or sleep there and never thought to make one. “Nothing available until 1:30 today,” he offered and handed me an info card. I could either park a few miles down the road and hike back or return later. I was confused and holding up traffic. Licking my wounds from the ambush I accepted the card and drove off."

When you’re travelling, the world can seem like an endless pit of places to put your money. Arriving in a new town, the first things you’ll probably notice are the shops, or the people selling tours or the restaurants who have translated the menu into your language and added 20%. These are all part of the experience of being in a different place, and can be delightful experiences. But sometimes, travelling can make you feel sad and lost. Sometimes, even being in your home country — even your home town — can make you feel strange and low. From my experience, a place which can offer a moment to regain your balance is the local library. Public libraries are there to welcome you without charge. They’re peaceful, and give you a moment to sit down and get your bearings. In practical terms, they offer toilets and a place to recharge your phone. They also offer a chance to merge for a moment with folk working and studying there. You can be surrounded by books; even if you can’t understand the language, seeing that many words and worlds around you is a reminder that you are still amongst humans and humans are (often) tolerant of a curious stranger. “Well-run libraries are filled with people because what a good library offers cannot be easily found elsewhere: an indoor public space in which you do not have to buy anything in order to stay.” Zadie Smith, writing in the New York Review of Books Libraries are places which can be used by people who’ve lived in a town for 60 years, by refugees and those just passing through. They have spaces for young children, and worried people and happy people and interesting people. There’s a space for a spectrum of community. There’s room for older people sighing over newspapers, and for worried teenagers searching online for birth control when they should be studying for exams. And for you. When the world is spinning too fast, the library offers steady ground. “Walking the stacks in a library, dragging your fingers across the spines — it’s hard not to feel the presence of sleeping spirits.” Robin Sloan, Mr Penumbra’s 24 hour Bookstore And if you’re travelling, and worried about using public facilities in place where you don’t pay taxes? If you can afford it, spend money locally. If you can’t afford it, remember that you being there won’t use up the library. Your presence adds to the fabric of the library’s purpose, it doesn’t wear it out. You are sitting in a space made for people and ideas. “Libraries have a special role to play in our knowledge economy. Your institutions have been and should be a place where parents and children come to read together and learn together. We should take our kids there more.” Barack Obama, speaking to the American Library Association’s annual conference in 2005 Others will use your hometown’s libraries, and you will use theirs. Libraries are an international exchange programme of community. They’re part of a global creative economy, which you’re allowed to be part of. Your intellect is welcome there, but so are your tired limbs and your sore heart. Read a book, write a book or stare at the wall while your heart slows down. And, once you’re back on an even keel, then you can explore the world again, knowing there are infinite ones you can escape back to, just beyond the library door."

Medium.com,Life,My Midwest,Travel,https://medium.com/@vrob125/my-midwest-30480710b89d?source=topic_page---------60------------------1," We
arrived crumpled and tired in South Wichita, Kansas after having spent three years overseas at Clark Air Force Base in the Philippines. We were already outsiders, of course, but there were others like us already there who were able to help us adjust to Wichita and to America again. We knew of some soldiers who had left their families stateside while they rambled overseas to places like Spain, Germany, and the P.I. Not us. Once I asked my mother where we were from. “We’re from wherever we are. We go wherever your daddy goes,” she said. “Home is where your family is. You’re stuck with us, girl. How about that?” She talks like that. October 1978: I didn’t want to leave the Philippines; it was my senior year — the year that had been meticulously planned by myself and my friends to be relaxed, all-knowing, confident, sexy (yes, sexy) and the pinnacle of our lifetimes! I had new contact lenses! A new perm! My life was ruined. Nothing would ever be the same again! Ok. Rant over. There was no Google to consult about the possibilities of Kansas. The encyclopedia blandly focused on cattle, corn, wheat, and the beautiful Flint Hills. Which aren’t even really…hills? Actually, they’re more like mounds. We were already outsiders, of course, but there were others like us already there who were able to help us adjust to Wichita and to America again. After receiving the news, some of my schoolmates started making comments. They went something like this: “Damn. Do they even have black people there? What are you going to do?” “Tell Dorothy we said hi!” Ironic. It wasn’t too different from what some said when they found out we were leaving New York and going to the Philippines a few years back. “Damn. Do they even have black people there? What are you going to do?” “The Philippines? What is a Philippines?” It was 1975; Muhammad Ali and Joe Frazier fought that October in the ‘Thrilla in Manila’. Five months later, the Jackson Five arrived and the concerts were glorious! Well, at least, that’s what we heard. We were there! Kind of. Well, We weren’t at the concert. We were on the base in the same country, I mean. We were nearby, ok? Quit asking. It was national news. Those we left behind in Plattsburgh AFB, New York? They knew what ‘The Philippines’ was then."
Medium.com,Life,How I Learned to Appreciate Florence,Travel,https://medium.com/this-must-be-the-place/how-i-learned-to-appreciate-florence-68e362fde659?source=topic_page---------61------------------1," If the two trips I’ve made to Florence taught me anything, it’s how much I changed in the 14 years between them. The first time around, like any respectable gay man one month into his thirties and back on holiday, I was all about the nightlife. Up to then (and probably for at least a decade after), my appreciation for any city was directly proportionate to the number of opportunities I had to meet good-looking gay men after dark there (hence my unmatched love and affection for London circa 1994 to 2001 and Buenos Aires in the mid aughts). Not outside, naturally. I’d learned from George Michael’s “lewd act” arrest — plus park and community-toilet hookups were never my thing. The more gay bars and gay clubs, the merrier.

On that front, Florence failed miserably in 1999. Never mind that it’s one of the most spectacularly gorgeous cities on earth. I was too busy looking — hoping — for a gay bar that was better than Tabasco to really notice. I knew I was in a lovely Italian city with an abundance of man-made beauty, but I wasn’t overly concerned about any of its details.

When the visuals faded from my memory, all I could recall was that I had been kind of bored and frustrated by the pesky tourists. So I must admit that upon my second arrival in Florence in 2013, all the stunning scenery caught me off guard. Had it been so breathtaking the first time around? There was still a surplus of tourists and way too much traffic for a city center with such narrow streets, and the architectural density made me long for the wide open spaces of Rome. But that first time, how did I miss (or forget) the dramatic interplay of shadows and spotlights on the buildings right around sunset? Were there as many joggers running around town 14 years earlier, and I just didn’t notice because I didn’t take up running until 2006? And was that statue of Neptune (which I clearly remembered — though more as a concept than in specifics) next to the replica of King David in Piazza della Signoria always that smoking hot?

For the first time, I noticed that Florence, though distinct from Rome in both its look and its vibe, had one crucial thing in common with Italy’s capital city: the power to evoke a vivid sense of place and time. If traffic in Florence’s centro storico had been banned (or had been as limited as in Milan’s), and all the tourists had gone home, I could have tilted my head and almost felt like it was 1890, or 1790, or any given century, going back to the Middle Ages.

But alas, there was no escaping traffic and tourists, both of which were made more imposing by narrow sidewalks. That often meant stepping into the street to avoid bumping into passersby while risking being struck by an oncoming vehicle. At times, both times, Florence’s historic center felt like a crowded elevator, or a packed dance floor that you must elbow your way across to get from one side of the nightclub to the bar on the other. Sometimes I was too busy watching where I was going, trying not to fall on or off the uneven sidewalks, to grab magic moments. And if one were to come knocking, who would have heard it, with all of the noise?

So although I was finally really noticing Florence, and I couldn’t care less that, unlike Rome, it still had no thriving gay village and that Tabasco was closed for the summer, the crowds were once again ruining it for me. They were messing with my art appreciation, too. I quickly grew tired of tourists spoiling my view of masterful works of art (like that glorious Fountain of Neptune) because they just had to pose for photos in front of it.

“Why?” I kept asking myself. I was pretty sure that to most onlookers, it probably was just a naked statue; travel guides had told them it was important. And why, anyway, was art only of interest to them if it was interactive? Would those people have gone to the Louvre in Paris and posed next to the Mona Lisa? If they somehow could have worked their way into the Sistine Chapel ceiling scene in Vatican City, it probably would have been the greatest holiday coup.

Watching them descend upon monuments to mythological, historic, and Biblical figures, appreciating them only long enough to get another photo of themselves to show their friends on Facebook, cheapened what could have been so many magic moments for me. It was like sitting next to a loudmouth at a concert who insists on singing the wrong lyrics to every song.

Or like that terrible dance version of The Byrds’ “Mr. Tambourine Man” that was blaring from somewhere while I was trying to appreciate the replica of Michelangelo’s King David that overlooks Florence. He stood, in all his unclothed glory, in the middle of Piazzale Michelangelo, up on a hill on the south side of Florence, otherwise known as the good side of the Arno River, if only because fewer statues, churches, and notable landmarks there also meant fewer tourists. Unfortunately, I couldn’t say the same about Piazzale Michelangelo, which was full of people angling to get their close-ups with another replica of King David, as if they’d luckily stumbled onto the real thing, and locals hawking assorted trinkets. Sadly, the lady howling the words to The Byrds classic (written by Bob Dylan) didn’t really seem so out of place. And in the end, in Florence, neither did I, and I have my friend Shirley, whom I’d traveled to Florence to see in the first place, and her mother to thank for it. I quickly discovered that Florence was best explored at night when there were fewer people crowding the same key spaces, or via those short, dark alleys that connected the roads most traveled, or from several stories above, or from one of the half dozen bridges that weren’t Ponte Vecchio. But the pleasures of experiencing Florence from these vantage points were all too fleeting.

Then Shirley and her mom led me down Via di San Niccolo. On our final night in Florence, just after sunset, we walked down the mostly deserted street where minimalist lamp lighting accented vintage apartment buildings along roads that passing cars and tourists only occasionally marred. By the time we reached Bevo Vino, a restaurant Shirley and her mother had stumbled upon on the way back from a trip to Piazzale Michelangelo, I was completely rethinking my first and second impressions of Florence. Even the tourists who surrounded us during dinner seemed cooler, calmer, than the ones I’d encountered in Piazza della Signoria and Piazza San Croce on the other side of the Arno. They appeared to be less interested in posing for potential Facebook profile pics and more appreciative of the local charms of an area that had no tacky bars or photo ops that they’d read about in a tourist guide. It looked and felt like Florence the way people who lived there enjoy it, and that made it all the more enjoyable.

“If I lived in Florence, this is exactly where I’d want my apartment to be,” I announced. And for a fleeting moment, a magic one, the city that I’d never thought much about, the one that had previously been a footnote in my Italian experiences — seemed full of possibilities. If it wasn’t exactly love, it was something damn near like it."
Medium.com,Life,In Search of Van Gogh’s Yellow House,Travel,https://medium.com/thinksheet/in-search-of-van-goghs-yellow-house-1b18340871d4?source=topic_page---------62------------------1," In 1888, Vincent Van Gogh spent one of the most creative years of his life in the small town of Arles in the south of France. Most of the books and films made about the painter — form Kirk Douglas in Lust For Life to Willem Dafoe in At Eternity’s Gate — concentrate on this period of Van Gogh’s life. In Arles, he made his home in the “Yellow House” on the Place de la Cavalerie. It was here that he painted some of his most recognisable and indicative works of art. He painted the interior of his house, with the blue walls, the wooden bed and chair. He also painted the town’s night cafés, with their prostitutes and lost bohemians. It was in Arles that the stars rained out of the night skies like comets. Arles shimmered and burned in Van Gogh’s thick musical brushstrokes. The artist shimmered and shattered during his twelve-month stay. He watched the sporting ravaging of a beast in the town’s Roman bull-fighting arena, where at the culmination of each match, according to tradition, the victorious fighter would take a souvenir from the defeated bull: its ear. So it is thought that the severing of this particular piece of flesh inspired Van Gogh to cut off his own, in Arles in the year 1888."

It’s beautiful country. Tall mountains rise on either side of the bright blue waters of the Soca river, which the Italians call the Isonzo. A perfect autumn day, bright and warm, the leaves glowing gold as they fell, dry and rattling, from the trees. On a lonely mountain road, I stopped my rented car to watch the sun gild the mountains as it guttered like a failing candle into twilight. Across the fields, the chiming of cowbells drifted through the still air. The herds were heading home. The white spire of the village church caught the last of the light before the white-veined mountains cut it off. Molto bella, no? One more picture to store on my hard drive. But for some men, it was the last thing they ever saw."
Medium.com,Life,When the Stories We Tell Ourselves Are True,Travel,https://psiloveyou.xyz/when-the-stories-we-tell-ourselves-are-true-6a8c0b88b2fc?source=topic_page---------66------------------1," In her book of essays, poet Mary Oliver wrote, “…you must not, ever, give anyone else the responsibility for your life.” It’s a lesson I learned the hard way, after breaking free of a very long, unhappy marriage. I learned it once more, as if to make sure I understood, when my Plan B failed to materialize into the kind of life I desired — and the only solution I could come up with was leaving, again. My best friend told me, gently, and with regret, “I’m sorry to say that our problems generally follow us wherever we go.” But I had to believe this wasn’t true. I had to believe I’d shed a lot of those problems in divorcing a man who did not love me, and in moving away from an environment in which good health was a constant struggle. As I shared my desire to leave my temporary Montana home, another acquaintance echoed this prevailing sentiment, saying “Thinking that you’ll be happier anywhere else is just a story you’re telling yourself.” He followed this pronouncement with advice to focus on the present, not the past — when I wanted desperately to focus on my future, a future that did not seem possible after five years of trying in my small, mountain town. These two thoughts were lodged like hidden burrs in my mind, as I chose to tell myself a more hopeful story: You will find a beautiful and affordable house in a safe neighborhood. You will join writers’ groups and hiking clubs where you’ll find other people with similar interests, and you will not feel so alone. Dozens of accessible trails in a variety of habitats will allow you to maintain a healthy, outdoor lifestyle without risking broken bones on icy streets. In a larger metropolitan area, you’re unlikely to ever feel bored or lonely at all — but in the case of unexpected cabin fever, you can drive to another vibrant city full of artists, craftspeople, and fascinatingly diverse cultures, only an hour away. And, at the very least, you will be eating truly authentic northern New Mexican food: posole, green chili, blue corn enchiladas, and the occasional Margarita, made with agave wine, not tequila. I headed South through the scenic Big Hole Valley and pulled over to wait out a snow squall. When the sky cleared, I was surrounded by a 360-degree mountain view of the Bitterroot Range, the Anaconda-Pintlers, the Pioneers, and the Beaverheads, with the dark dots of approximately four-thousand cattle decorating a plain of sparkling white. I followed the Big Hole River for a while and popped up over the pass, leaving Dillon in my rear-view mirror. As I followed the I-15 through Idaho, the sun dropped low in the West, lighting up the golden, grass-covered hills and turning the still-frozen lakes to sparkling mirrors. After a night in Salt Lake City, I woke early and continued driving South in the pale, lavender dawn. I cruised through the red-rock Disneyland of Moab just as the rising sun began bouncing off the canyon walls. After turning East in Monticello, I crossed the southwestern tip of Colorado, before hitting the New Mexico state line. The sight of all the turquoise and canary-yellow license plates gave my winter-weary mood a lift. I played traditional Ranchera music, which cheered me through the stark badlands and into the juniper-dotted, red-rock hills of O’Keefe country. Lyle Lovett helped me push myself a little further, and finally, after two long days on the road, I cruised into Albuquerque to the pleasant calm of “Closing Time.” Just before sunset, I spent half an hour stretching my legs, walking the trails of the Bosque. The Rio Grande was a turbid whirl of rust-red, muddy with spring runoff, but huge flocks of ring-billed gulls had gathered bravely on the sand bars. Thickly immersed in salt cedar and coyote willow, weaving between the welcoming arms of cottonwoods, it was hard to believe a thriving city of more than 800,000 souls arose just blocks away. Heading south, I crossed the river, drove slowly up Rio Grande Boulevard, and swung left through the gate into another world. The house I was visiting had wide plank floors, canary-yellow walls covered with magnificent photographs, ten-foot-high ceilings, stained glass windows, and lazy fans circling overhead. That night, there were five of us snuggled on the over-sized couch watching “Kill Bill.” We had seven dogs between us, for warmth and comfort during the particularly gruesome scenes. Our hostess, who takes her role seriously, was explaining the Uma Thurman character’s backstory. And the living room was warmly it by the glow from a trio of devotional candles — The Virgin Mary, Our Lady of Guadalupe, and Robert Mueller — flickering in the middle of the coffee table. (This is the kind of thing that can happen when your new friends are card-carrying members of the New Mexico Religious Coalition for Reproductive Choice.) Over the next few hours, many bottles of wine were consumed. When we got a little rowdy, the top dog pointed his head at the ceiling and howled. For the first time in too many months, I was not lonely, and I wondered what it would be like to feel this way all the time. Eighteen months have passed since that night on the couch with women and wine and the song of a good dog’s howl. I’ve gained ten pounds eating New Mexican food, and developed sturdy legs from hiking daily along the Bosque. As the months tick by and the seasons turn, I’m learning the river’s patterns and cheerfully greeting its returning visitors: I have found my place, and it is home. Yesterday, I witnessed a sandhill crane separated from its flock, calling mournfully, in real despair. It followed me for miles up the river, as if desperate for contact with other living beings — or, because I was wearing a splash of red. Even a lone sandhill crane will circle in the sky, calling, until it is grounded with exhaustion or pulled joyously back into its flock. And sometimes the stories we tell ourselves are true. I am steadily finding my way back to my flock. We are gathering in growing numbers, providing warmth and comfort. We are, all of us, so tired of circling in the sky."

We left my kids with the grandparents and took a trip to Auckland for our one-year anniversary celebration. The first day of our holiday, he suggested we take a walk up a volcano. We both love the outdoors so I was much happier with that idea than wandering around the posh big-city shops. Mount Eden Volcano is only 15 minutes walk from the city centre (and has my last name!) so we headed for it. At the base of the volcano we started up Kelly Street (what?!) and on the corner was a beautiful bridal shop. “Hey, look,” I said. “A bridal shop on Kelly Street at the base of Mount Eden! It’s a sign.” I laughed — I don’t really believe in signs like that. He didn’t say anything. At the top, we were greeted by stunning views of the city and a serene grass-covered crater. The light shimmered through the clouds, making the whole thing seem like a movie set. After eating a picnic lunch — serenaded by a Tui in the tree over head — he slipped a ring out of his bag, leant in close and whispered, “Will you marry me?” Two days later, he jumped on a plane and left for six weeks in Australia."

Medium.com,Life,Species Collide,Travel,https://medium.com/@ashleygramolini/species-collide-82cf647d2049?source=topic_page---------69------------------1," As I made my way down the street I saw a dog with a skinny black and white kitten dangling in its mouth. I feared the worst. I slowed my pace as I crept closer down the road towards the animals. Ahead of me, a bo-ab (Egyptian slang for doorman/guard/janitor) calmly walked up to the dog, who had now placed the kitten gently on the ground, and began to pet the ferocious creature. The man spoke some soft Arabic words to the dog and gently nudged the kitten out of the way with his foot. Its skinny body came to life as it stumbled back up on its paws. It did not run away, even when a second dog joined the gathering. By this point, I was upon the scene. I thought that the man was attempting to protect the kitten from the dogs so I walked over and put my body in front of the kitten to block the canine’s curious mouths from latching on to the kitten again. To my surprise, the dogs seemed calm. I noticed that the tips of their left ears were clipped, a sign that they had been “fixed” by an Egyptian veterinarian. A sign that a white person had taken notice of the creatures and paid the standard $20 fee to prevent these strays from making more strays. The bo-ab seemed to know the dogs, for he was petting them affectionately and speaking to them in Arabic. While I am usually wary of street dogs, these two actually did seem friendly. I crouched down to get a better look at the kitten and, sure enough, she was uninjured. She purred at my ankles as I kept the dogs distracted with ear scratches. I was wearing a scarf which the skinny kitten immediately began to enthusiastically tug upon. As I pulled it out of her thimble-sized claws the dogs then noticed my cloth chew toy and also started to take little nips at the scarf. I pulled it away more forcefully but this only added to their playful joy. As I stood up they took leaps to get to the strands of my scarf again. I put out my hand which they put in their mouths. I could feel their pointy teeth but felt no pressure against my skin. Curious. As I prepared to leave the dogs I caught sight of the kitten again and before I left, I said aloud to the dogs, “No no. Leave her alone”. I nudged the dogs’ heads away from the direction of the kitten, ostensibly to offer her with a chance for a quick getaway were the dogs to come at her again. This time, the bo-ab stepped in. He continued petting the dogs and attempted to communicate with me in Arabic. I could not understand what he said with the exception of kuwais (“good”). The tone of his voice and the sounds of his words communicated to me that “they’re fine, they’re just playing”. While I only looked up at the man’s face for a moment, I could detect empathy in his eyes. He was calm. He was clearly familiar with these dogs and was looking out for the kitten. His demeanor suggested to me that he had the situation under control. Sure enough, the dogs did not seem violent and the kitten did not seem afraid. I bowed my head down and muttered a few words of feeble thanks to the man. For what exactly, I’m not sure. I had stumbled upon a simple street interaction, an inter-species connection. Every day, man and beast roam these Egyptian streets, indifferent to one another. The dogs and cats avoid the humans and the humans, in turn, avoid the smaller mammals. Occasionally our worlds crash and barks and screams and yelps fill the air as each creature fights for dominance and safety. It is a losing battle for anything that walks on four legs. As a foreigner to this land, I am the interloper. When I saw a dog with a kitten in its mouth and a man standing by, I assumed the worst: that violence was occurring between the animals and that the local male human did not care in the slightest. I was wrong. I am often wrong in this place. Life is intensified in Egypt. Conversations are louder, emotions are higher, greetings are longer and relationships are deeper. As a foreigner, I am subject to much misinterpretation. My ears perk up at the sounds of shouting, only to find that it is two friends having a passionate conversation. I stop dead in my tracks when I see dogs in the road up ahead on my solo morning runs, expecting them to be there waiting to attack me, only to find that they are just waiting for the “dog lady” and her early breakfast delivery of kibble. When I walk down the streets in Egypt I look over my shoulder every few minutes, expecting to see a dark and ominous stranger following me. Indeed, I have had several negative clashes with individuals on the street, but more often than not, my stumbles upon local life here have proven to be delicate and delightful. Some days, I feel like the kitten held in the jaws of a muscular dog, vulnerable to the potential sharp teeth pressing against my skin, ready to destroy my body with the most subtle of a pressure increase. I feel like a walking target on these streets and I feel compelled to always have my guard up and be prepared. This mindset, while protective, does warp my judgment as I am now quick to assume the worst. But today, a small kitten and I were spared. Contrary to my initial impression, we found ourselves not under attack but surrounded by loving creatures."

arlier this summer, I spent a week stretched out on a Spanish beach. When I wasn’t sprawled on its supple sands, I was walking up and down it, stepping over swimmers and paddlers who idled along the water’s margin, supine, lost to the swells of the sun and the loose nakedness of it all. The pleasure of being on a beach belies the very strange nature of the environment. As well as the people, one comes across inflatable rubber rings, buckets-and-spades, beachfront cafes with overweight habitués sucking on plastic straws, a little pretend train hooting and wriggling along the promenade, graceless nik-nak stores selling all things plastic, bars with wicker seats and neon signs, tattoo parlors, the smell of cooking fats sliding through the air, volleyball courts and exercise parks where only the beautiful dare to venture, hawkers, masseuses and water-sports guys — all these things constituting a place where thousands come to prostrate themselves in strange reverence. To what exactly? The beach I was enjoying — because I was thoroughly enjoying it — was the 12km long Alcudia Bay, a beach on the Mediterranean island of Majorca. It is something of a miracle among beaches because of its length and also the gentle gradient of the sand into the sea, meaning that swimmers can wade out some 50 yards before their toes no longer touch silky terra firma. A beach like that is no secret. It gets so amassed with people that, as you approach it from a distance, it looks like a great earthworm stranded on dry ground, one great twitching pink-and-brown eel. So as I stripped off and paddled in the twinkling waters, I started to wonder why so many of us had chosen to spend our time here — and how close to paradise a beach like that really is."

Edinburgh is dark from daylight savings time, and drizzly from tradition. It’s perfectly dismal, and I know I’m not the only half-naked woman in the city, staring into the murk and planning Cullen Skink for dinner. Cullen Skink — a creamy leek and fish stew — and homemade soda bread generously buttered, and maybe a few shots of Jura single-malt. But Eddie’s fish market opens at 8, and if I don’t get there soon, all the smoked haddock will be gone, and my Skink will have to wait until the weekend. The coffee comes out weak and bitter at the same time — a result I never understand— but I sugar it up and gulp it down. The kitchen is unforgivably clean; we do not talk to each other but we will scrub happily, side by side. There are five of us in this gorgeous old Victorian house— all women, all writers who’ve run away from home, to sleep alone on rainy nights, to finish our novels or start our memoirs, to scare ourselves to death. We have not become friends yet, these women and I. We cook in our own pots and buy our own eggs. We smile in the hallway, we knock politely, we say No worries! when we collide. The two youngest — 30-somethings hailing from Argentina and Italy — have snapped themselves together like life-sized Legos. They don’t appear to enjoy each other much, but they haven’t yet learned to be alone. The other two — Margot and Jen — are deep into their 40s. These two circle each other warily. They sometimes ignore each other in French, but they can’t ever seem to say what they mean in English. I am often their referee, sometimes their emotional interpreter. “I believe Jen would prefer the aubergines,” I’ll interject into an icy discussion of the Thai leftovers in the community fridge. Or “Do let Margot have a fire, she’s got a bit of a chill, hasn’t she?” when Jen is fanning herself, affecting heatstroke in November. Just call me Kay the Lion Tamer. These women, who are not yet my friends, sit with me in the great room downstairs, almost every day for the last four weeks. We write together — we’ve contractually committed to this togetherness as part of our writing programme, even though we each have desks and wifi in our lovely, individual suites. We distribute our work round the table, pour ourselves tea or whisky, watch the rain run down the glass. I give them my stories, newly hatched, raw and quivering. They drop their traumatic tales on my plate, still too hot to consume. The stories talk to each other, console each other, clasp each other’s hands. We are silent. Aren’t you lonely? is the most common question asked by my friends and family back home, but few can understand the answer. I am not. I am, in fact, entirely too happy with my own company — and so, too, I think, are Jen and Margot. We share a writer’s delight for solitude, which impedes our ability (and desire) to share our real lives. Jen’s story today is about riding an open jeep through a desert, with grim results. She leans back in her chair and closes her eyes, as if watching us read it is too painful. Margot’s piece details a woman lost in her own pain and anguish. I offer up a humorous essay about a love affair gone wrong, which gets a smile, at least, from the Lego twins. Are the stories fact or fiction? We each make extensive notes on our own copies. Our writing coach arrives, and as usual, reminds us to put our stories in the middle of the table, where they can’t fall off."
Medium.com,Life,Climbing A Mountain Made Me Realize What Life Is All About,Travel,https://medium.com/swlh/climbing-a-mountain-made-me-realize-what-life-is-all-about-d97a6c379f89?source=topic_page---------72------------------1," About 5 years ago, I never imagined myself climbing a mountain. It was tough, dangerous, and took a lot of time and effort. Being a city boy, most of my activities were tied to the hustle and bustle of noisy agglomerations of buildings, and hordes of people with zombie-like faces going about their business, not paying attention to the thousands of other people surrounding them. Nature was a far away place that I would sometimes see through the window of a car, but never actually experience. This would all change in 2015, when I set out on an adventure that would change my view of the world and give me perspective on what is important in life and what isn’t. Ancient wisdom states that this type of reflection is fundamental to living a good life and the ancient Stoics advocated contemplating the vastness of the universe as a way to find your place in it. This broad view then allows you to zoom in and focus on your own existence. Marcus Aurelius in his personal journal “Meditations” noted down his reflections on how things are connected in the universe. “Frequently consider the connection of all things in the universe and their relation to one another. For in a manner all things are implicated with one another, and all in this way are friendly to one another; for one thing comes in order after another, and this is by virtue of the active movement and mutual conspiration and the unity of the substance.“ However, for a person who spends their entire life in the city, this is quite challenging. All the noise and impersonal ways of doing things distract you from being able to focus on the whole. The Stoics once again had an answer to this: live according to nature. Living according to nature can connect you to the whole, and give you a particular place in the order of things. In the words of Marcus Aurelius: “This you must always bear in mind, what is the nature of the whole, and what is my nature, and how this is related to that, and what kind of a part it is of what kind of a whole; and that there is no one who hinders you from always doing and saying the things which are according to the nature of which you are a part.“ Reading these words, the city boy in me only had a very theoretical idea of what they meant. Something more was needed in order to awaken a magnificent wanderlust and to gain a connection to what it really means to live according to nature. This realization came on one fateful day in 2015, standing on the top of Africa. However, before that a whole series of events transpired which led me on the course with destiny. My brother had lived in a place which was close to the mountains and gained a craving for mountain hikes. He had already climbed Kilimanjaro once before and came up with the idea of doing it as a family adventure. I was hesitant at first, but finally decided to give it a try. While Kilimanjaro is not an impossible climb, and is quite doable for fit city-dwellers, you still need to have respect for the mountain. It is 5895 meters high, and has been known to scuttle the advances of even the fittest of sportsmen. A few months of intensive preparation are required if you want to be sure that you are fit enough to climb it and also to enjoy the experience. I had spent hours in the gym working on my cardio, but the first real test came in the Alps. In order to acclimatize to the low pressure and lack of oxygen in the high altitudes, you need to slowly build up your mountain conditioning. Things are different in the mountains and your body needs to get used to it. So we started off on a series of hikes in the mountains, which culminated in the attempt to climb Mt. Breithorn, 4164 meters high, but considered one of the easiest peaks over 4000 meters to climb. This proved to be a wake up call. At one point of the climb, my head started aching really badly and I had trouble even taking steps. I managed to push myself and reach the top, but it was very painful. After coming down, I realized that if I had so much trouble reaching the summit of a mountain which is barely above 4000 meters, I would probably fail scaling up a mountain which is much higher. I needed to work harder. And work harder I did. Then in August 2015, we arrived in Africa, in the country of Tanzania where Mt. Kilimanjaro is located. This is the highest mountain in Africa, and while at its bottom you find sub-tropical rain-forests, the top is covered with snow (although unfortunately the glaciers are constantly shrinking due to global warming). The days you spend circling the mountain allows you to see nature in all its stages, you trek through forests, then enter areas full of small bushes and weird tiny trees, to be followed by landscapes which literally resemble the Moon. 1) Willpower is something you can build up Climbing a mountain is the ultimate test of your willpower. For you are always going up and up, and the walk gets harder and harder. What you could do easily at lower altitudes, now becomes much harder. Just putting one foot in front of the other is an act of conscious will, biting through the pain in order to reach your goal. When you are on the verge of quitting, your mind says “no” and you push through the pain. At that point you learn that willpower is something that you can work on, something that you can control. Your body has hidden reserves left, which you can utilize to power through when the going gets tough. 2) Pole, pole — go slowly Mt. Kilimanjaro also teaches you another lesson. Your mountain guides always remind you to go: “pole, pole”, which in Swahili means slowly. For if you rush too fast at the beginning, not only might you not have enough strength to finish the journey, but even might make yourself sick. The point is to go slowly, but surely towards your goal. 3) Each problem you face is like a mountain you are climbing A mountain is sometimes used as a metaphor for life, and by scaling one, you begin to understand why that is. Getting to the top and then descending safely down (for getting to the top is just half the journey) you have accomplished something which most people will never do. Also by climbing the highest mountain in Africa, all the other mountains that you will face in your life will feel smaller in comparison. Getting to the top is also a success that you can keep in your memory for the rest of your life to inspire you. For when the going gets tough in the future, you can look back at this accomplishment and inspire yourself. You pushed hard through this challenge and got to the top, you will be able to do so in other circumstances as well. Things might get tough, but they can be overcome, just like a mountain can be climbed. 4) You gain a perspective on how other people live While on the mountain, you meet a cast of characters, which helps put your life in perspective. You are required to hire local guides and porters, which then aid you to negotiate the mountain. Through constant exposure to them, you learn a bit about who they are, and where they come from. Some of them are on the mountain to support their families, others to secure a better job. One guy we met was there lugging around heavy packs in order to pay his way through university. Life isn’t easy for these guys, which makes you more thankful for some of the things that you have. For you this is an adventure of a lifetime, for them, this is their job. 5) You connect yourself to the greater whole Standing at the top of the mountain, you are at a point higher than anyone else in Africa. Around you, a desolate landscape reminds you of the power of the natural world, for this is the edge of the caldera of an ancient volcano which had exploded long ago. The experience is further heightened when you realize that where you are standing at, Uhuru Peak, is the highest part of the Kibo volcanic cone, which is lying dormant, but not extinct. Powerful forces are stirring around underfoot. Your eyes stop their gaze at the huge swathes of snow and ice that are lying scattered around, the last remnants of a glacier, which just a hundred years ago covered virtually the entire peak. This reminds you of the wonder of nature, but also of the human power to destroy it. The rugged beauty that you see in front of you transports you to another plane of experience, as if you were entering another world. You sense being part of something more powerful than yourself, and it makes you feel a sense of other-worldly awe. This not only connects you to the rest of the universe, but according to scientific studies even makes you a better person: “New research from UC Berkeley and UC Irvine suggests that experiencing awe can actually prompt us to act more benevolently toward others. In other words, awe can help make the world a better place.“ When you are at the top, you realize how retarded some of the problems you face back home really are. You are confronted by stupid people, useless work, and bad luck. Yet, here you are, literally at the top of the world. You should remind yourself of the old Stoic mantra of focusing on what you can control and forgetting about the rest. At this moment, you are experiencing the ultimate triumph, something that all those other petty people who ruin your life will never get to experience. They will focus on their stupid little wars, back-stabbings, and selfish acts, while you have pushed yourself and done something real. In that moment remind yourself of another saying by Marcus Aurelius: “Begin the morning by saying to yourself: I shall meet with the busy-body, the ungrateful, arrogant, deceitful, envious, unsocial. All these things happen to them by reason of their ignorance of what is good and evil.” Being in the mountains shows you what living according to nature really means. It connects you to the greater whole, and reminds you how the worries that you have back in the “real” world are unimportant, even stupid. For where you are living at is not the real world, but instead a fake construction. Nature is the real world. It has been here for millions of years before us, and it will survive us all. If you want to read more: Here is the original story I wrote on my blog describing my experience of climbing Mt. Kilimanjaro. I also wrote a short guide on what you need to do to prepare for climbing the mountain. The thing is that this was just a beginning of the experience. Since then, I have climbed several other mountains, including Mt. Blanc. Credit: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5"

Medium.com,Life,My Longest Ride…Yet!,Travel,https://medium.com/@abhijath/my-longest-ride-yet-331a17546df3?source=topic_page---------74------------------1," Dhanushkodi….The first time I heard about this place was from my cousin brother. He told me that he’ll take me to this Wonderful place someday and told me many things about it. This got my attention and I got interested and wanted to know more about Dhanushkodi; its geography, history and about the people there. I found out that not many people live in this town anymore and the town is a Ghost town. And after a year my brother took me on a road trip there, along with 2 of his friends and this was a new experience for me, because I have never done a road trip before. But this record is not about my first visit to Dhanushkodi. This is about my second visit! Before that, here is an overview of the place. Dhanushkodi is a ghost town, located in the state of Tamil Nadu in India. It is about 20 kilometers from Rameswaram town, located in the Pamban Island. The town was destroyed in the 1964 Rameswaram Cyclone. It destroyed everything, and what remains now is the ruins dating back to those days. Dhanushkodi is also the only land border between India and Sri Lanka, which is only 45 meters in length. Before 2016 there were no roads built up to Dhanushkodi, which was only reachable by foot along the shoreline or by jeeps. But now people can take their vehicles to reach the Dhanushkodi beach tip. The name Dhanushkodi means ‘End of Bow’, and YES!… We are talking about Lord Rama’s Bow. The Legend is that Dhanushkodi is the place where Lord Rama and his army built the Ram Setu (also known as Adam’s Bridge) across the sea connecting Rameswaram and Sri Lanka, to rescue Sita from the Demon king Ravana. Dhanushkodi was marked by Lord Rama as the Start point of the Bridge using his Bow and hence the name-Dhanushkodi. Also after rescuing Sita, Lord Rama destroyed the bridge using his Bow and Arrows. The legend also says that Lord Rama threatened the seas to calm down for him to build Ram Setu. You can experience this certain phenomenon at Dhanushkodi. People who visited Dhanushkodi might have noticed this; The sea on the left side is very calm, but the sea on the right is fierce and the winds are strong."

Medium.com,Life,Bangalore Jam,Travel,https://medium.com/@shirishandhare/bangalore-jam-e77a6e776688?source=topic_page---------76------------------1," It is 7:30 AM and I am all set for an early start to my Bangalore workday. Based on vehement recommendations from my friends who have lived here longer than I have, I have subscribed to a cab service. My driver arrives on time and I get into the car. An arctic blast of imitation Jasmine fragrance knocks me into my seat. Since I paid for the AC car service, the driver has dutifully rolled up all the windows and is running the car’s AC at a freezing 21 degrees with a freshly opened Jasmine deodoriser to give me my money’s worth. I am quick to have him turn off the AC and roll down the windows to welcome some balmy Bangalore air. We roll out of my residential complex and I sense we are out on to the Bangalore streets as the hint of Frangipani flowers in the air has been replaced by a mix of exhaust and spice. Almost at once we come to a grinding halt, my laptop which I have foolishly begun to work on, lurches forward as we encounter a big yellow school bus making a seemingly impossible U turn in front of us. Two-wheelers buzz around it, like flies around a wounded mammoth, making it harder. My window still rolled down, I notice the decibel levels of automobile horns rising with the urgency of those waiting for this school bus to pass. My driver uses the down time to tell me how the road is going to be widened and there will soon be a flyover to ease things. I think I have heard that a few years ago when I was visiting. Maybe it’s deja vu. The bus finally bellows and grinds forward in the direction it wanted to. The car is moving again at the normal Bangalore speed limit of 10 mph. After the first lurch I have given up on my laptop and I now give up on reading email on my phone, or doing pretty much anything that requires my neck to fixate on a screen as we drive over a dot matrix of potholes. I wonder what message they were conveying. Neck straight, looking out of my window I focus on the still fresh morning scenery punctuated by real-estate billboards, enticing me with visions of California, Italy, and Spain. Residences with exotic names like Palo Alto Estates, Walnut Creek, and Tuscany, with pictures of azure waterbodies and sumptuous villas are in sharp contrast to what I am experiencing at the moment. Between those billboards I see glimpses of the real Bangalore waking up. Lazy coconut palms and banana plantations, steamy Darshinis (breakfast spots) serving hot Idlis, spicy sambar, and strong filter coffee to hungry standees; mini temples of variegated gods and goddesses, their bells chiming in with the sound of growing traffic; fragrant flower baskets and loads of coconuts urging passers by to indulge in an express blessing; and freshly bathed school children in uniform, all vie for attention. Life goes on. No, it thrives, much faster than the traffic I am in. A red public transport bus obstructs my view momentarily. It is loaded twice over capacity with bleary eyed passengers floating through their commute with the life rafts that are their smart phones and headsets. The bus passes, and I am greeted by a mother — helmet on and a flowing orange gajra (floral hair arrangement) fluttering in the breeze — ferrying 3 uniformed children to school on her two wheeler. One child is squeezed between her handlebar and front seat. The other two cling for dear life on the back seat with arms stretched in a human chain anchored by her girth. They peer into my car with just one passenger and I look away guiltily, right into the eyes of a little girl no more than 6, in a crisp white school uniform, pigtails tied with the brightest red ribbons her mother could find, a heavy school bag, walking alone, no footwear. Older college-goers in trendy clothes flit and dodge around my car, fixated on their smartphones, probably playing a virtual game and the real-life traffic dodging game at once. A little further, a concerned driver citizen has disembarked from his car in mid-traffic to help an old couple navigate the jammed road. We inch towards my destination, which I was told about 30 minutes ago, was just 5 more minutes away. Newton and Einstein are both turning in their resting place somewhere. I stay blissfully immersed in my experience as Bangalore limps by. Sacred Ganesha statues for sale next to a meat shop; a Pizza hut next to a biryani joint; a locksmith next to a Nike Factory store; a glossy Intel building next to a single fruit seller selling only pomegranates; and a pungent sewer by a brand new hospital pass by in the backdrop of what was once old Bangalore — rows of vibrant Gulmohars, imposing Acacias, cheery Frangipanis and retired seniors on long morning walks outside rows of peaceful, low rise, shaded, private residences. My reverie is interrupted by the thick of traffic. I roll up my windows, preferring the synthesised Jasmine to a diesel exhaust draining into my face. I cut out the city noise some more by putting on my headsets. Bob Dylan reminds me that the times they are a changing. Finally, ten miles and 60 minutes later, I am told I am at my destination. I enter my office which is no different and probably better than some I have occupied in the Bay Area. It welcomes me with the blip and growl of a power outage and diesel generators coming on simultaneously. All is well, I think, as I fire up my laptop again and begin my day. News of a $1B investment in Bangalore based Flipkart greets me, followed by Amazon’s counter attack of committing to $2B in the Indian market, along with a clip about Uber creating a presence in India to disrupt the conveyance market. Dichotomy is the word I think I should use, but it falls so short of what I experienced in just this one hour. Is there a single word conveying an emotion of contrast, exhilaration, calm, chaos, anticipation, disparity, frustration, and optimism happening all at once? Maybe the word I am looking for is “Bangalore”."

Medium.com,Life,Why I Won’t Use AirBnB,Travel,https://medium.com/writerontherun/why-i-wont-use-airbnb-25aefe8316b2?source=topic_page---------78------------------1," The other day I was on the phone with my travel writing coach Tim Leffel. I’d always eschewed using AirBnB because they demanded my passport, and I wasn’t comfortable. To clarify, all international hotels and hostels require your passport; that wasn’t the issue. The AirBnB person was both strident and militant, which put me off, and giving such a large company so much personal information bothers me a lot more than handing my passport to a tiny hovel on a seaside in Spain. That’s not an attractive target. AirBnB is a very attractive target with a huge payoff. They are so big these days that like the NSA and other low-hanging fruit, they are nearly screaming for a hacker. Lots of juicy personal information. He was comfortable. For now. He might not be after he reads this article by the very smart and determined Allie Conti for Vice. In it Conti speaks to precisely what my intuition was barking at me: nobody is watching the farm, and as long as AirBnB makes money, nobody gives a damn if you and I get scammed. It’s a long article, but it is very, very important to read if you’re a regular user or considering AirBnB. I am not going to bother, because what I found out convinced me to stick with hostels and hotels. There is a widespread scamming industry on AirBnB, she outs it, and you need to know what to look for so that you don’t get suckered. It’s a very serious issue. While several of the folks interviewed said that AirBnB is still cheaper than hotels and so are sticking with it (interestingly, including Conti herself, go figure) if you end up getting scammed out of thousands, your vacay is ruined when you landed in a flop house full of vermin, how is that cheaper? Your time, your trouble, your peace of mind, your trust and your entire trip are shot. And, according to Conti’s story, much of it isn’t recoverable, if at all. On top of that you end up getting vicious reviews which make it hard for you to stay elsewhere. That’s if you have the temerity to call out the bad guys for cheating, scamming and false advertising. I can’t speak for anyone else but I’d rather pony up for a low brow place that I can review on Trip Advisor, or go through Booking.com (my preferred, or hostelworld.com) where there are some rules in place and people on site. Look, you might not like Motel Six, but by god you get precisely what’s advertised. I worry a lot less about scammers. Besides, since most of the time I’m there I’m sleeping, how can it matter? AirBnB, like so many other platforms, started out as a great idea. Like Facebook, Twitter, Linked In and the now-defunct Tumblr, it is swiftly getting overrun with vermin in much the same way. Caveat emptor. There is good news, though. As of 11/1/19 the FBI is involved. If that isn’t an indication that something very, very serious is wrong with AirBnB, I’m unclear what is. While the FBI does their due diligence (which is going to be much assisted by Conti’s ground work) you and I are still vulnerable. If those scammers get evicted, and AirBnB has to make a public and long overdue apology, you can also be guaranteed those scammers will simply zip up their luggage and move to another platform, as close to your wallet as possible. The Invisible Tourist provided this view that includes some of the problems you and I might run into both at home and abroad (home being America in this case, but no matter, it all stands). But it’s much bigger than that. From that article: As someone who lives in a city where over 200,000 properties sit vacant due to landlords not renting them to locals (or anyone at all), I’ve seen first-hand how this has negatively impacted the rental market by causing prices to skyrocket as long-term rentals for locals become scarce. It isn’t really fair (or ethical) on the local population trying to get by. There is no longer anywhere in America where someone working full-time on minimum wage can afford a decent two bedroom apartment. Hell, not even a one bedroom. No rooms in houses any more, which is how I began my work life when I left home at 16 some fifty years ago. For ten bucks a week I had a bed, access to the rest of the house and the kitchen, and almost always a sweet old lady keeping an eye on me. Now said sweet old lady is the landlord, managing that same bedroom at $185 a night. By the same token, why shouldn’t she, when her medical bills are so high she can barely buy groceries? You see my point. She has to, in order to survive. That’s the other side of the equation, before folks get demonized for using their open space to stay solvent. If I could make sure that I was staying in that kind of place I would use AirBnB. But it’s not so easy to know what you’re getting when you hand over your CC. As Conti’s article makes clear, anyone can hijack photos and make a place look yummy. By the time you arrive, you’re committed. And sometimes, SOL. For my part, those homeowners were the folks that I once thought were going to most benefit from AirBnB. AirBnB benefits, that’s all that matters, and it’s at the expense of a great many folks who not only want a safe place to stay as advertised, but also those who desperately need housing. AirBnB has provided owners and landlords plenty of incentives, both legal and ill- if you will, to forget about the needs of teachers, firefighters, nurses and everyone else and just rent out. So those of you who are frustrated about rents but you’re willing to do an AirBnB in Aspen or Jackson Hole? Folks, AirBnB renters are the one of the reasons the people who flip your burgers are having to live in vans on the asphalt parking lots in those towns. People in the Colorado high country are so strapped to pay the million-dollar mortgages that AirBnB is their only way to manage. And with that, people who need to rent, as in all the support folks who make a community run, are run out of town. This doesn’t even begin to address what happens to bucolic neighborhoods that suddenly see strangers, parties, and constant ins and outs. With the exception perhaps of gated communities (and guess who that leaves out?) our neighborhoods are trending towards the short-term rental, with all the attendant loss of value and damage to quality of life for the real residents who didn’t sign up for the constant parade of strangers across their yards. Or the noise, or the trash, or the unwanted interactions with kids and pets. That’s already happened to the very nice Denver neighborhood where my masseuse lives. I am not a fan. Not ever and most certainly not now. Especially with so many scammers, skimmers and skaters, which of course includes bad guests as well as bad owner/operators. More so from a moral standpoint, I am unwilling to support an industry that is ravaging the housing market, making it far more profitable for speculators to buy up and rent out the very homes so many Millennials and others desperately need. Build it and they will come. The cockroaches, that is, which infest that expensive room you thought you booked for a bargain, and the cockroaches who schemed you out of your vacay. The cockroaches at AirBnB who bank your bucks and refuse to help you with legitimate disputes. The investors who buy up properties that everyday folks need and flip them into vacation rentals, the space that might have been the reasonable spot that you so desperately need that isn’t a two-hour drive from your barely-over-minimum-wage job. Things to consider before you book AirBnB. It’s not just someone’s extra bedroom any more. These days it’s developed into a very lucrative business for a bunch of folks, some who are clearly scammers, and hurts a great many more. That would include some, if not many, of their AirBnB clients. I can’t speak for you. But I am sticking with Motel Six. At least they leave the light on for ya."
Medium.com,Life,"Before You Move to Another Country, Do Your Research",Travel,https://medium.com/the-expat-chronicles/before-you-move-to-another-country-do-your-research-8ffacd101113?source=topic_page---------79------------------1," I thought I knew everything about China when I moved there at twenty-one. In 2009, I took part in the study abroad program in Beijing. I stayed for a year and went back. Because I took so many Chinese courses, I didn’t think I needed to do any other research about living there. Within the first week I arrived, I found out how wrong I was. I tried to go on Facebook to connect to my family and friends, but I couldn’t get on. One of my classmates told me, later, that Facebook, YouTube, and Twitter are blocked in China. My first month in China was me trying to figure out VPNs. If I spent time researching, I would’ve found a reliable VPN before I came. It might’ve cost a little money, but it would’ve been easier to get a hold of loved ones at home. You think you know, but you have no idea. Take every opportunity to move to another country like the quote from MTV Diary. (I hope I got the name of the show right.) My major in college revolved around the Chinese language and culture. I ate, drank, dreamed, thought, and shat China. But there were still things I didn’t know. Things that should’ve been common sense for someone that studied as extensively on China as I have. You don’t have to go so deep in the history of the Great Firewall that you know whose idea it was. However, it’s a good idea to research enough that you’re prepared for something as simple as needing to look for a VPN before you come to China. Sometimes, there are things that research doesn’t prepare you for. In China, banking is a slow process. Imagine the sloths from Zootopia. That is the most accurate depiction of Chinese banking I’ve ever seen. No amount of research could’ve prepared me for something as unexpected as that. If you have special dietary needs or have certain medications you need to take, this is where research comes in handy as well. Especially medicine. If you can’t get a specific pill in another country, you will need to research what the alternative is for that country. Researching things about everyday life in another country will help fight off culture shock, as well. I don’t limit this to places I’m living in. I’ve been to a lot of Asian countries while I lived in China, and I made sure to look up every single one. Not just for the different tourist spots to go, but things a tourist might do that would be offensive to the locals. I wanted to make sure I was as good as a guest to any country as I could. After I came back from my year in China, I made sure I knew what I was getting myself into before I traveled again. I went back to China years later, and I remembered to buy a VPN before I came to China. A good thing, too. Because four years after I arrived in China, the country banned all VPN usage. Now you can’t buy a VPN unless you do it outside of China. The free ones aren’t reliable at all. Moving to a country blind is one of the worst things you could do as a fresh expat. You could end up cut off from your loved ones that way, or it could be potentially dangerous if you don’t know the laws of the country. If you know the culture of the country, the locals will appreciate you more. It will make your stay in your new home a more pleasant experience."
Medium.com,Life,The Best Parts of Queer Travel Might Surprise You,Travel,https://medium.com/@zoeymilford/the-best-parts-of-queer-travel-might-surprise-you-3a29f0f796d4?source=topic_page---------80------------------1," Traveling as a queer person can have its ups and downs, and in my time writing on Medium I’ve lightly delved into some of those negative aspects. However I want to take the time to appreciate, exhibit, and examine the positives of queer travel! The positives are often the most unexpected and delightful parts of rainbow adventuring. They’re a mix of both frequent and rare occurrences that really do make LGBT+ travel great. Getting starred at in public might not be the first thing on everyone’s list of a good time. But when I’m traveling through the streets of another country or passing through airport after airport, the stares of children and teens that land on my short hair, my bare face, and my butchy fashion are pretty special. Why? Because from their staring it’s clear they don’t often (if ever) see people who look like me, and by my simply existing in their world for a moment, I’ve expanded their concept of what other’s can look like and how their own self-expression can look too. The stares of teenagers, who look like I once did in their uncertainty about themselves, particularly pull at my queer heart with the mix of hope, awe, and sometimes intense contemplation I see on their faces— it reminds me that the search for queer role models and queer inspiration is a world-wide one. Everywhere I go, I love to play Queer Historian at museums of all kinds. How do you play Queer Historian? It’s simple: in the examination of museum placards and exhibits, keep a Queer Historian’s eye out for anything that is obviously queer but has strategically been avoided being labeled as such. Then respectfully collect images of these on any device and share your discoveries with friends, family, and fellow queer people. For example, a recent Queer Historian discovery I made was in Washington, D.C. at the National Geographic Museum. There I read about Margaret Benson, a British Egyptologist, who became “fast friends” with another British traveler named Janet Gourlay while in Luxor. Gourlay subsequently accompanied and assisted on all of Benson’s excavations, and the pair then became “life-long companions” (quotes are directly from placards). Here’s the museum’s picture of them: Hmm, can’t hide that one from me NatGeo; I’m a Queer Historian! Traveling with a partner of the same gender is so incredibly, wonderfully, handy. Aside from the fact you can borrow clothing from each other if you’re similar sizes, there’s also the huge packing and luggage benefit that comes from sharing travel items. For example, my partner and I only need one mini-hairdryer between us, and that saves space for one bottle of shampoo between us, which saves space for one small medicine bag between us, which saves space for… You get the idea. Additionally, when in need of an item in a pinch, such as a sanitary item, a razor, a chapstick, or some gender-affirming deodorant, it’s almost 100% likely your partner will have just what you need! So handy, and so strangely bonding. Thankfully, queer adventuring says f*ck no to all the gender roles commonly associated with travel. Gender doesn’t dictate the way we work together to share the weights of adventuring, and this means we have the freedom to enjoy every part of being on holiday. How? Here are some ways my partner and I are free from the gender roles we still see being played out by many cis-het tourists around us: To summarise, it’s all equal when there’s no gender roles and we’re always left with more time and energy for fun. It’s a comfort that in most places I’ve travelled there’s one thing I can always search for: a queer space. Whether it’s a popular gay club, or a small LGBT+ bar that’s tucked away in a corner of town, or a quaint lesbian-run cafe that has some local queer zines for sale at the back, or even an independent bookstore (english or not) that’s made a considerate point to stock a selection of LGBT+ texts. When search engines and local guidebooks can’t help me find these spaces (sometimes they simply don’t exist on the map), the tell-tale rainbow stripes above a building’s doorway, in the window, or chalked next to the doormat outside is the signal I look for and feel welcomed by. It’s wonderful that small businesses in communities all over the world are loving and aware enough to put a small (or huge) flag above their door to shepherd us weary, queer travellers into the relaxed warmth of a space that’s made-for, or inclusive-of, us. The best part about queer travel is that me and so many members of the LGBT+ community are being bold enough to do it. And as we do, we’re finding more and more aspects to love about queer travel that are unique to our way of experiencing the world."

But also, notably, Greta has changed her modes of travel to be more environmentally conscientious. She’s out there preaching the science, but what can you do if you still have a need to see the world? Many who travel want to feel better about how much carbon they pump into the atmosphere, even while many more remain in a numb denial, (or in some cases righteous indignation that they are asked to be less selfish at all.) Fortunately, there are many avenues to a cleaner world and a less stigma stained passport. If you are like most people, there are places within a one day drive you have never seen. There are parks, and museums, and sculpture gardens, and concert halls, and antique stores, and private rock collections, and historical monuments, and outdoor activity hubs. And more. There is much more than you can imagine not far from your door-step. Visit your local chamber of commerce, or any city gateway activity center and find out what is offered. Here in Hawaii, shopping centers are dotted with little kiosks that offer brochures and ideas. Your family and kids will benefit greatly from learning about the unique natural offerings and cultural wonders in your own backyard. Organize and post bulletins in your community for outings where you connect to people in your own area. Your life and theirs, will be greatly enriched by taking the time to learn about, and support, local culture. Back in 2014, my husband and I signed on for the People’s Climate March in New York City. He was raised in New York, but I had never been to — only through — this major metropolis. It had been on my list for a lifetime: the Empire State Building, the Statue of Liberty, Central Park, and so many museums! The march gave us the opportunity for a “two-fer” We had at least two reasons to go and tick off our ‘to do’ list. Seeing the many sights that he had talked about for years made it a three-fer rather than a two-fer. Because we knew we would likely never return, we did a bit of everything. Most rewarding of all, solidarity with so many organizations that love Earth and nature as we do, offered much more than just travel guilt. Since that day, the Earth movement has grown to a worldwide campaign. So have the myriad number of ways for anyone to make their voices and their concerns heard. For a recent anniversary, we visited both Toronto and Niagara Falls. We went by train and reduced our personal Flygskam. Although challenging, it was amazing and rewarding to get so much squeezed into one vacation. Naturally, we had to fly to return to Hawaii, but we did a stop over in Seattle and saw relatives. More than two snowbirds killed with one stone, as we scheduled it. All over the world there are hot spots of discontent with tourism. In Venice, overcrowding, garbage, vulgar behavior, lost culture and housing, traffic and loss of quiet, are concerns. In places like Waikiki, too many people make the former paradise seem more like a parasite patch. In Rome, the Spanish Steps became so mucked up with wine and gum they have prohibited people to linger there for more than a few moments. The woes of reefs and corals due to overlove and acidification are well known. More than 600,000 tourists swarmed Machu Picchu in just the first six months of 2018, rumors of naked selfies have apparently become a thing — and an obvious threat to a once magnificent wonder. Maya Beach in Thailand has been shut down to tourists indefinitely. There are many more such examples. We went to Iceland some years ago and lamented that there was no nature to be seen without the cluttered cover of people on every trail and at every attraction. Rather than go to the most famous geothermal springs, we found small municipal pools with just as much relaxing hot water without the disturbing ripples of too many visitors. When you go to less ‘in demand ‘places, you may lose a feeling of seeing the rarest and unique place of its kind, but you will gain a much greater experience, both in cultural immersion, authenticity and natural beauty undisturbed by defiling mobs. For as many places there are worth seeing in the world, there are times to see them which are less crowded. If it is not to late for you to do so, consider the freedom of childlessness. Without kids you can skip the madness days of spring and summer breaks. You can travel light. You can go when fewer people visit. You can also gear up for cold weather trips . The sun you soak up will be that much more appreciated. You will very much enjoy less traffic and less toxic fumes from traffic. There is less light pollution for the star-gazing, less roaring noise of congestion, and less cost in most cases. Finally, look for travel opportunities that offer you the chance to make a real difference. You absolutely will find this more rewarding than another mad consumption binge at a theme park or crammed city center. There are wildlife safaris that support local economies and guard against poaching. There are volunteer activities that allow you to release turtle hatchlings, collect data on biodiversity, help rehabilitate animals, learn sustainable farm methods, and plant trees. Places in Africa and India offer community outreach programs to support crafts and culture. You can even teach local children English while you learn their environmental lessons and cultural wisdom. We are currently planning to travel to rainforest areas where ecosystems are under threat. Local community programs that support biodiversity help in several ways: you can help make eco-tourism more profitable to local economies than poaching and wildlife ‘pet’ trafficking. You can participate in hands-on rescue and supportive science projects that share data worldwide. You can simply tour, and in doing so, provide meaningful jobs to local hotels, restaurants, guides, and artisans. Find places that need you. Simply supporting the notion that more people are eager to see beautiful and rare species than are eager to pay big bucks to kill them, is rewarding in itself. Where ever you go, go with grace. Take time to learn the difference between exploitation tourism and giving back tourism. Learn every day that there is so much more beauty and joy in the world when we share it. Many people argue that overpopulation is not a true threat to our planet, but most of us who travel strongly disagree. Yes, there is enough food if we shared, and yes, there is enough space if we cared, but when it comes to rare and very special places, they are definitely finite. We have to find ways to preserve and protect all that is worth touring, or we all lose much more than just our patience during routine travel stress."
Medium.com,Life,Do You Need to Travel to Find Yourself?,Travel,https://medium.com/swlh/do-you-need-to-travel-to-find-yourself-b24ef5894c48?source=topic_page---------84------------------1," Many people go traveling to find themselves … and they do find new strengths they never knew they had. However, their new-found sense of self seems to disappear when they return home to a familiar environment filled with friendships and habits. Some people then believe the answer is more travel, so they plan a new trip. Others fall into a depression and wonder if the new, strong, positive self that emerged while traveling was just an illusion. So, what is it about travel that helps you find yourself? Do you need to keep traveling to continue to find yourself? Is it possible to find yourself during your daily life without traveling at all? Travel puts you in difficult situations that are way beyond your comfort zone. You have to deal with these situations quickly and wisely, digging deep within yourself for wisdom in the present moment. Once you’ve successfully dealt with a challenging situation, you feel fantastic — strong, wise and positive — and ready to take on anything that life throws at you. By contrast, daily life doesn’t ask you to step outside our comfort zone very often. You’re rarely confronted with an unfamiliar situation on your way to work or while chatting with friends. As a result, many of us go through life on autopilot and today seems very similar to yesterday and tomorrow. Over time, a feeling of dissatisfaction creeps in. We know we want more from life, but we don’t know exactly what we want or how to get it. The answer is to challenge yourself to step outside your comfort zone every day. To do one thing that scares you. To take one risk. Although you might feel as if you don’t want to do this, once you’ve done it, you’ll feel wonderful and that feeling will encourage you to take another risk. Getting out of your comfort zone helps you grow as a person, whatever your circumstances. You can find yourself by getting out of your comfort zone, even if you stay at home and remain in your current job. When pushing yourself out of your comfort zone, start small. Choose one small thing each day. This could be: Once you feel ready, move onto bigger challenges, such as: Break each of these bigger challenges up into smaller, daily challenges. Write each challenge or risk down and, once you’ve done it, cross it out. Then write down tomorrow’s task. Over time, you’ll see how much you’ve grown as a person. You’ll also see your external circumstances change as they start to match your inner world. You won’t need to go traveling to get outside your comfort zone because you’ll be doing it every day. While traveling, you meet a multitude of new people naturally and effortlessly. You get to know fascinating folk from different races, cultures and nationalities with a wide variety of outlooks on life. This makes life much more interesting than at home. It opens you to perspectives and opinions that you may never have come into contact with or considered before. It also makes you realize that the world is a wonderful place filled with a diverse bunch of people who you can relate to on a human level. When you return home, you’re surrounded with people you’ve known for years. You know what they think about every issue under the sun. You also realize their views haven’t changed much — if at all. However, you continue to socialize with your old friends and rarely meet new people. This means you no longer feel as interested in the world as you did while traveling. So, how can you widen your social circle while you’re at home? Here are some ideas: Resist the temptation to do these things with a friend. If you do, the chances are that you’ll just chat with each other most of the time and won’t meet many other people. Be bold and daring and branch out on your own. Go up to people who seem interesting and start a conversation, just as you would while traveling. While traveling, finding your way around a busy city where you don’t speak the local language gives you a sense of achievement, as does going on a three-day expedition through a tropical rain forest. By contrast, living your life day in and day out may not give you much of a sense of achievement, especially if you could do your job with your eyes closed and all you do in the evenings is slump in front of Netflix. To counteract this, set yourself some goals. Think of what you’d like to do and achieve in your life. Write down everything that comes to mind, no matter how crazy or impossible it seems. Then, choose just one of those goals and start to turn it into reality by writing down just one small step that you can take towards achieving it. Take that step as quickly as possible — within 24 hours — and feel that sense of achievement! Let that positive feeling encourage you to make the next step, and so on. Imagine how great your sense of achievement will be when you’ve reached all your goals. The only person stopping you is yourself. It’s been said that travel brings out the best in you but that’s not entirely true. Dealing with the unexpected and unexplored, as well as meeting many people from different backgrounds, brings out the best in you. By contrast, your usual environment may demand much less of you. Human beings need to put themselves in unfamiliar situations that help them grow. However, we also tend to be afraid of these situations and avoid them. If we confront these fears every day, we’ll feel as fulfilled in our daily lives as we do when we’re traveling."
Medium.com,Life,What I’ve Learned Working Remotely For The Last 4 Months,Travel,https://medium.com/@MarkGalvao/what-ive-learned-working-remotely-for-the-last-4-months-9c31e038de52?source=topic_page---------85------------------1," “Travel is the great leveler, the great teacher, bitter as medicine, crueler than mirror-glass. A long stretch of road will teach you more about yourself than a hundred years of quiet introspection.” — Patrick Rothfuss, The Wise Man’s Fear. Since I can remember, I’ve wanted to do nothing but travel the world. All I’ve wanted to do is sit on a beach in Thailand, drinking Tiger beer and watching the teal waves breathe upon the sand. Then as I grew older and learned cash is king, I realized nobody would pay me to bum around (or maybe I just haven’t found anyone yet!). So, I did the next logical thing. I started my hunt for a career that would allow me to explore and still manage a steady income. I had done work for accommodation before, but I wanted something more flexible. It wasn’t a linear voyage, but after 2 years of working at a marketing agency, I earned the opportunity to write and work remotely. “Woo-hoo, dreams do come true!” Unfortunately, they never tell you when you chase your dreams; the victory doesn’t taste as good as the journey. I’ve learned a lot about the world and myself. But, working on a laptop isn’t always what it’s cracked up to be. Unlike what some Instagram accounts will have you believe. I wouldn’t trade this experience for anything and will continue to venture into the world. But, before you purchase a new laptop and throw yourself into the digital nomad game, I want to give you a sneak peek into a nomads perspective. Writing down goals is known to give you that extra push in accomplishing them. Here are some important steps you can take to becoming a better goal-setter. Travelling Builds Discipline For the most part, since the day we turn 4 years old, we’ve had at least one-third of our day planned out for us. Our grade schools decided what time we need to be there, and how many hours we’d spend at the fine establishment. Then, for those that attended post-secondary, more of your schedule’s decided for you. Even though you could pick your courses now, there was still a time that someone else decided they required your physical presence. If you happened to opt for the work route right away, odds are your employer didn’t let you choose what time to turn into work. It’s a little scary at first when you have to be your own timetable. We’re programmed to follow somebody else’s watch for so long we’ve forgotten how to tell time ourselves. But, when you do start to carve the time out to work, something miraculous happens. You gain discipline. This discipline then pours over into other aspects of life. A planner becomes your best friend. You’ll start to learn how to manage your time more efficiently and allocate space for other activities. Events such as journaling, meditating, exercising and playing an instrument become part of your life. Time is on your side. But, that being said… Keeping A Routine Can Become More Difficult I know this sounds like the exact opposite of what I just said, but hear me out. The previous section was assuming you’re staying on your own in an Airbnb or a shared house. If so, then I stand by everything I said. But, if you’re staying at a hostel and staying in a dorm, the game changes a bit. Now, this isn’t a knock on hostels whatsoever; I love them. It’s the best way to meet friends when in foreign lands. They help organize events and guide you through the city. But, most of all, they’re cheaper than staying by yourself in hotels and Airbnb's. And when travelling for extended periods, cutting costs is essential, especially when staying in cities that like to burn through your wallet. I’m looking at you Vienna! The positives when staying at a hostel are numerous, but building a solid routine that is difficult. Most hostels are perfectly set up to let you work. But good luck meditating in a dorm room or shared living space when people are always coming in and out. The Art Of Currency Conversion What if I told you that I know of an investment that will make your money more valuable instantly? It’s not a pyramid scheme or a startup you’ve never heard of that’s going public tomorrow. Nope, what I’m suggesting is much easier and safer. It’s called taking your money to a country that it’s worth far more. If you add up the cost of living in most metropolis North American cities, you’re looking at about $3500 to live comfortably. That’s if you’re single, renting, don’t have kids and haven’t locked yourself into unnecessary debt. To put it in perspective, the median wage in Portugal is 860 euros a month, or about $1200. An apartment in cities such as Faro, Loule, Lisbon and Porto range from 300 to 1000 euros for a very nice setup. Not only is the housing much cheaper than North American, but food, drinks and entertainment are all adjusted to their income! Lot’s Of Travel Becomes Exhausting Anytime I’ve mentioned that extensive travel becomes exhausting when you’re still working, people laugh at me. On the surface, it’s excellent, and it’s an issue that’s easy overlooked. That doesn’t change the fact that when you’re bouncing around from city to city, working, missing flights and sleeping in trains, the energy reserves will start to fade. I learned this the hard way. And after visiting far too many cities in a short period, my batteries needed replacing. It’s exciting to get to hop on a train and see the Romanian countryside, then 3 days later to take a bus to beautiful Serbia. Just don’t try to see too much without charging up the batteries and smelling a rose or 2 on the way there. Life Is The Greatest Teacher While the energy may get a little drained, the soul fills in equal parts. There’s more than one way to skin a cat, but travelling teaches you more lessons than you can handle at times. Some of them are subtle; others come hurling at your face like a pitch from Randy Johnson. When you’re tossed out of your comfort zone and mingle with people from all walks of life, it opens up your perception of the world. There’s only so much you can learn from a textbook or blog post. The real value comes from sitting in a coffee shop and talking to a local about their experiences growing up in Naples. Or from taking a break at a park and watching parents with their kids. We’re all essentially the same in terms of needs. We want shelter, food, and for our family to prosper. This doesn’t change whether you’re in Moscow or Manitoba. However, you learn to appreciate the ease of life that we’ve been gifted in Canada. When a Croatian mother and her daughter talk about hiding in the bathroom while bombs fell and assault rifles ripped through their kitchen, you listen. And in listening, you learn humility and compassion towards others. Every Day is A New Challenge This one is a bit of a mixed bag. On the one hand, always adapting and having challenges to hurdle makes you stronger in the long run. But, sometimes you want to have a day where you know how everything’s going to pan out. Walking to an ATM and having it eat your debit card usually isn’t a problem. But not if your bank located 9604 kilometres away. Then it becomes a bit of an issue. Or when you take a 6-hour bus ride, get detained in Bosnia, finally arrive in Split to realize that your bag didn’t make the trip. It looks like the clothes on my back will have to do for the time being. Situations like these arise quite often, and it sucks, but it’s all part of the game of life. You either shake it off and keep going or sit there crying over the milk you’ve spilled. There are 2 sides to every coin. To paraphrase the great Epictetus, you can’t control everything that happens to you, but you can control how to react to it. Your Baggage Becomes Smaller You can take this as emotional or physical baggage, but you can bet your bottom dollar that the need for extravagant and excess starts to fade. There’s nothing that hits your soul like watching little kids play with what you’d hardly call toys and grinning like a Cheshire cat. Or adults that have a Galaxy s5 and couldn’t give two hoots about upgrading to an iPhone XR version 5, model 7. We’ve become accustomed to living in a world where product advertisement bombards our feeble little minds and plays with our insecurities. Embracing a sense of minimalism and appreciating what you have relieves stress and helps put your energy and focus on what matters. You don’t need to go full-blown monk and drop all material goods, but find a balance that works for you. Working Sucks When Everybody Is Having “Fun” Nothing hits harder than a severe case of FOMO (fear of missing out). It’s natural for us as humans to grieve when we feel as if we’re missing out on all the fun. Don’t leave me behind! Well, I’m telling you right now, you’re going to miss some good times and you have to live with that. This sums up working remotely. Being there will most likely be a difference in time zones, you’re required to work late at night, or early in the morning. That means no shenanigans at the local bar or club until 4am. Or a hike to a pristine lake, nestled away in the beautiful mountains of Poland. Yes, surprisingly for some, the reality is that working remotely means work is the priority. It Can Get Lonely I’d be lying if I didn’t say at this very moment, I miss my friends and family. They’re an integral part of my life and are always a central focus when I’m at home. It makes staying at hostels even more important. There are always people doing the same thing as you and travelling and looking to make friends. So, it’s easy to meet new people and make connections abroad. To me, it’s one of the main reasons to get out and see the world, the people. The people you meet shape your life and who you become. And by meeting open-minded people that are looking to for a better understanding of this rock we live on, it helps better define what we are looking for. Still, that doesn’t change the fact that there’s something inherently peaceful and fulfilling about being with your family and or simply shooting hoops, playing video games or having a beer with your friends. You Learn Who You Really Are Without trying to sound existential, I’ve found travelling reveals you to yourself. Not in a sense that you’re going to become a completely different person, but things will change. We are the products of our environments and it’s inevitable to change when you find yourself in a new landscape. Our personalities are collections of experiences, psychological traits, feelings, genetics and behaviour. It’s a very complex subject, but studies have shown that personality, for the most part, is learned and not something that we’re born with. Our cultural differences, friends, tastes in music, sports, entertainment, books and everything from A to Z help determine who we are and how we engage with others. But, what happens when being thrown into a foreign land where you don’t like the same music, get the same commercials, sports, and friends telling you what to like and what to watch? By giving yourself some time alone and away from all the distractions of society, you may find what moves your soul. The Grass is Always Greener Your day to day struggle might be a challenging one and you dream of being elsewhere. Maybe you’re working 14 hour days to support your family. Maybe life would be better if you finally got that promotion you feel you deserve. You know what, things will be good when you finally get that spoiler added to your Subaru. Through various methods of persuasion, our minds and ego have convinced us that we’d be better off somewhere else. Only if you could move to that city, you’ve been dreaming about. The truth is if you don’t take the proper measures to be happy content right where you are, the eternal want of more will always follow you. That’s not to say you shouldn’t work for a better future. But, we have to embrace what we have right here. It has been one of the greatest lessons I’ve learned from travelling. Some would do anything to have a fraction of what I’ve overlooked as a privilege. It’s easy to forget how lucky we are in North America when we’ve been living most of our lives in comfort. It might obviously be a bit of a gross overgeneralization, as many people do struggle to make ends meet. But for the majority of you that are on your laptop or phone reading this, I encourage you to step outside your boundaries. It’s important to see life from another’s perspective. You might just find that you’ve always had what you’re looking for. “All problems are illusions of the mind.” Eckhart Tolle"
Medium.com,Life,The Dangers of Traveling Solo as a Female,Travel,https://medium.com/soccer-domme/the-dangers-of-traveling-solo-as-a-female-570f96a298f0?source=topic_page---------86------------------1," T
raveling alone as a female is dangerous, and yet I’ve done it many, many times. I’ve flown off to foreign countries alone to travel for a week, a month, or even for a few years. I’ve been solo-traveling since I was nineteen years old, and even at almost fifty, I still go off to foreign countries by myself. Two years ago in November, I went to Rome by myself for a week. A month afterward, I went to Costa Rica. That was after having lived in Costa Rica for two months by myself the previous summer. So let’s just say I’m a seasoned traveler and a seasoned solo traveler at that. I’m not going to lie: it is a little nuts for a female to travel alone. Anything can happen to you— and sometimes it does. Typically I’ve been pretty circumspect in trying to stay safe. One of the biggest things is not going out by myself at night. This is especially true after one bad experience on my first trip to Spain over twenty-five years ago, when I was just twenty-one years old. Had I been from Madrid, I would’ve known that the Casa de Campo park was not a safe place for a young woman to walk alone after dark. The park is now famous as Madrid’s second red-light district. By day, families go there to enjoy the restaurants, a zoo and an amusement park. But by night, it’s known as a place to buy and trade sex for money. But as a visitor to Spain, all I knew was that there was a cheap hostel there. Looking back, the man who attacked me probably believed I was there to sell sex. As a woman alone, I was interpreted to be a prostitute. Or because I was a woman alone, I simply deserved to be raped. I was asking for it by committing the sin of being alone as a female at night. I’d been in Spain for two and half months by then and during that time I’d done everything from work as a nanny in Seville, to sightsee around Andalusia, to live for a week with two Spaniards in their home in a desert village. By the time I set foot back in Madrid, I was ready to return to California within just a few days. My intention that night was to go out in the city center. The metro stop was two miles away from the hostel, but by then I was used to walking everywhere. And, yes, though it was dark, around eight p.m. when I set out, I didn’t feel unsafe in the area. There were plenty of other people out walking at that hour. Cars drove by on either side of the road. Though there wasn’t much light and the park was wooded, there were enough other people around for me not to worry. As there was no sidewalk, just a dirt embankment, I walked there. I remember strolling along the road toward the metro station without a care in my mind. I had yet to experience a true assault. An assault steals something from you. It steals your sense of ease. But at that point, my sense of ease had yet to be robbed from me. I was oblivious to my surroundings. I was intent only on getting to the metro stop. About halfway there, I came upon a taxi pulled to the side of the road. A man knelt beside it, tying his shoe — or, as I’d realize later, perhaps only pretending to tie it. I’ll never forget the way he looked at me as I walked past. We made eye contact, and he narrowed his eyes, curling his mouth into an ugly smirk. Then he cracked a smile. I’d only understand later the joke was on me. I now see the way he eyed me was his way to separate me from my humanity. It’s also ironic to realize that his position of kneeling was not one of submission, but one of aggression. He was not bent on one knee out of respect. Instead he crouched like an animal ready to pounce. My upright position was one of vulnerability, lightness. I’d known from the start that I’d have to endure a lot of harassment in Spain. Even before I landed there I was well-aware that the country was known for its machismo. And I would indeed deal with a lot of harassment. Over the course of my trip, I’d soon find that I couldn’t even stop to catch my breath on a bench in a city square after having walked for hours in the Spanish heat without every man in the vicinity slowly but surely inching their way closer to me until they had me surrounded. No one ever touched me, but I understood enough Spanish to comprehend that they were often asking me if I wanted to have sex. That I was a young woman alone was enough to indicate that I was sexually available to them. No one ever imagined that I was just there to rest for a moment after having walked for miles in the heat. A month into my trip, while walking along a road in Southern Spain, a group of young men drove by in a car, one of them yelling out the window: “How much do you cost?” As a woman alone I was always being interpreted to be a prostitute. I don’t know if the man who attacked me that night in Madrid had come to the park with the intention to rape a woman. Maybe he’d come to buy sex. Or maybe he’d simply dropped off a customer, and then decided he was in the mood to rape. I’ll never know if the attack was premeditated, just like I’ll never know if this was the first time he’d tried to rape a woman. Maybe he’d already raped many times before. That, or he’d never raped a woman and only after arguing with his girlfriend or wife had he decided to take out his anger on some other female — a stranger, a foreigner, someone he could humiliate and damage with impunity in retaliation. I don’t know. This is all conjecture. This is just how I’ve made sense of why this man tried to do what he did to me that night. I forgot about him after I passed him by. I kept walking. As far as I knew, I’d never see him again. He’d given me a creepy look, but that was it. I wasn’t worried. There were still other people on the road. I wasn’t alone. Until I was. I came to a patch of road where it became darker, and suddenly there weren’t any other people or cars. That’s when I heard footsteps pounding the dirt behind me. It was the sound of someone running. I realized then it was the man from earlier, and that he was now jogging beside me. He’d been following me the whole time. “Hola,” he said almost flirtatiously before he swung out his arm, wrapped it around my shoulders, and knocked me to the ground. That was his first move — to knock me off balance. He wanted me in a vulnerable position, so he could easily subdue me. I fell to the dirt on my back where I flailed like an overturned beetle. I remember considering how lucky I was that I didn’t have my backpack on. When I’d showed up at the hostel days earlier, I’d been wearing it. My backpack was full of all the things I’d needed for a two-and-a-half-month trip around Spain. Not wearing that backpack might have been what saved me from getting raped or worse by that man. Without the backpack, I had more control over my body. And yet on my back, on the ground, I was still at his mercy. He loomed over me. I knew intuitively that his next move was to drag me into the nearby bushes — wherever he needed to take me so that we’d remain alone. And I knew that if I didn’t want that to happen, I had to fight — hard and fast. I screamed as loudly as I could. Pumped full of adrenaline, I kicked my legs into the air. One, two, three, four, five, six. Kick, kick, kick. One or more of those kicks must have landed on him. All of a sudden he was limping away. Maybe I got him in the groin. I’ll never know because I don’t remember my feet making contact with his body. High on adrenaline, I couldn’t feel anything. I hadn’t felt the blow to my back when I’d been knocked to the dirt. I didn’t feel my feet make contact with his body. All I know is that he was there one minute, gone the next. He disappeared. I was simply too difficult to rape. I swung up from the ground and ran as fast as I could to the metro stop. I sprinted the entire remaining half-mile. When I reached the station, I was out of breath, shocked to see other people milling around, waiting for the train. They seemed so peaceful, bored even. At that moment, our two worlds were cleaved apart. I was the victim of an attempted rape while these people were just going about their lives. The train came. I got on. I was gone. That night I stayed in a different hotel. I couldn’t go back to the hostel. I would only go back during the day to get my things. Even as the result of this attack, one thing that’s never occurred to me was to stop traveling. Men could try to steal a lot of things from me, but traveling alone would never be one of them. If there’s one thing about gender inequality that irritates me the most, it’s that I don’t have the same freedoms to go where a man does. I can’t just walk around at night without being afraid. In a sense, it seems like the world wants to send me a message. You are a woman and therefore you are not allowed to go out alone. Travel alone? Don’t even think about it. Go home and stay inside where you’ll be safe. Otherwise we’ll make you regret it. I’ve never listened. And I never well. I’ve never been known to be obedient."
Medium.com,Life,A tale of beer in Havana,Travel,https://medium.com/@barbara_torresi/a-tale-of-beer-in-havana-crazyabouthavana-com-9bd92f4fb826?source=topic_page---------87------------------1," (Last Updated On: October 31, 2019) I saw it the second I turned the corner. There was a queue by the kiosk at the top of the Boulevard — a long one — which could only mean one thing: they had beer. Before I even realised, my step was catching speed as it tried to keep up with the half dozen people who had started to trot in the same direction. A guy on a bike yelled something as he swerved to avoid me. Close shave. I shuddered a little then went back to my calculations: I had one 10 CUC note, one 5 CUC note, another 5 CUC note, and a bunch of coins. Great, with a bit of luck I’d be able to buy a carton. I am always the last to find out about deliveries, and by the time I get to the shop the goodies are gone. Not today, hopefully. They must have just taken a consignment, since when I walked by half an hour earlier everything was quiet. The line is fattening fast though, with a hail of “ultimo!” shouted out in quick succession. I go stand behind the last in the line and start fiddling with my phone. - “Hey, what are you doing? You can’t film this.” I raise my eyes to see the owner of the voice, a short, balding mulatto built like a bulldog. - “I am not filming anything. Taking a selfie, ok?” - “Mi amor, I am trying to help you. Last week a guy was filming and the police confiscated his camera.” I thank him and continue to take pictures of the queue. And: Then an old lady pokes me gently from behind. “Mami, what are they selling?” I tell her it’s Bucanero. “For how much?” I look at her, slightly confused. This is a state shop (aka a chopi, from the English “shopping”), so one beer costs one peso. Or it should, but someone mid-way to the window shouts out that it’s one fifteen today. The old lady shuffles away. Resigned sights and a curse or two waft up from the back of the line: one-fifteeeeen, did you hear that? Descarados! They can’t put up the price, this is a state shop! - “Oh but this is nothing, last week in Marianao a guy was selling Cristal at 1.50.” It’s the mulatto again. More eye-rolling and head-shaking ensue; some refuse to believe it: - “No it wasn’t. It was a state shop. He sold 80 cartons in less than one hour.” I am back to doing mental arithmetics, and from the silent frowns on the faces of half of those around me I know I am not alone. A woman clicks her tongue as she realises that this dude made 960 dollars in 60 minutes, an amount that the average Cuban earns in six months. On my part, I realise that I don’t have enough money for a carton, whose price has gone up to 27.6 bucks from the 24 that I have in my bag. Fuck. A bit of background here. Beer in Cuba is sold both in state shops, with Cristal and Bucanero retailing at the fixed price of 1 CUC, and by private resellers called particulares, who sell it for however much they feel like selling it for. Actually, in August the government capped at 35 CUP / 1.5 CUC the amount that street resellers, who must purchase stock from chopis like the one I am queueing at, can charge customers. The lack of wholesalers isn’t ideal, but the system would work semi-ok if it weren’t for two things: 1) A chronic lack of supplies in state shops; and: 2) State shops that are manned by employees who don’t feed on air, and who thus would die of starvation were they to try and live on their 15 CUC salary. You may be starting to see the problem here. So yes, fuck. Should I run home to get the rest? I could try to buy 20 cans, but there’s a chance that the shop guy, who has all the interest in clearing his stock before an inspector rocks up, will refuse to open a carton. And I can’t fit more than a few beers in my bag anyway. I hesitate. It’s not like I have a pressing need for eight litres of Bucanero, but the thing in Cuba is, whenever something prone to vanishing appears in a shop you better buy as much of it as your wallet allows. One two three… seven… fourteen people ahead of me and the line isn’t moving as fast as everyone wishes. I figure that if I dash I can get back in time to reclaim my place, so I do. Another consequence of the fact that there is no rational procurement system is that the particulares cannot risk being out of stock. This because chopis often are, which of course leads to wild hoarding and more empty state shops. Now, the less beer is available at 1 CUC, the more money private operators can charge for their lager, which keeps growing in value as scarcity skews the demand / offer relationship further and further. And either way, how can you sell something at no more than the state-mandated 35 CUP when you paid 30, or 35, or even 40 for it? Which you did because… the less beer is available at 1 CUC, the more money the rogues in the chopis can extort. Here’s a toxic feedback loop if there ever was one. By the time I get back to the Boulevard, three things have happened. First, I lost my place in the queue, and not because of an unexpected improvement in service efficiency, but because the kiosk has run out of beer. But by a serendipitous, not-at-all-planned coincidence, the twin state shop round the corner has just received its own booze consignment, which is what I, together with another dozen frustrated people, am now hoping to get my paws on. Second, the particulares have descended en masse, infiltrating the queue while scheming to loot the shop. This is prohibited, but implementation of such prohibition is limited to limiting the sale of beer to one carton per person — unless the person in question arrives with an elderly relative whom decency says should be spared from standing in line. Again, this would be semi-acceptable if it weren’t for the following: 1) In Cuba when a “relative” is urgently needed, anyone you’ve known for more than 5 minutes can be your cousin — especially if there’s a monetary reward for the impromptu kinship; and: 2) Does the shop guy care? Does he, really? The third interesting development is that during my absence a conspiracy theory has begun to form. I love conspiracy theories in Cuba because the more outlandish the paranoia, the likelier it is that the story is legitimate. - “Trust me, they’ve been hiding this load for weeks. They want us to be desperate so we’ll cough up whatever they say without blinking.” My bulldog-faced friend is holding court again. Some nod their heads, whilst others are skeptical. - “Nah, that’s crazy.” - “No it isn’t. It’s guerrilla sales: they withhold the cargo and then unload it at once and real fast. We scramble for our share and there’s no time for the inspector to find out about the multa.” - “Ha! As if the inspector cared.” - “…’course he doesn’t, but if he catches them with their hand in the jar they’ll have to pay him off. I would rather keep the profits for myself. Wouldn’t you?” I am starting to get weary of this mulatto. He seems to know a tad too much about everything and isn’t afraid of sharing his dangerous thoughts. The wheels of paranoia are spinning in my head: is he a provocateur? Is he Seguridad del Estado? Is he… an idiot? I feel a finger between two ribs and turn to see the elderly lady of before, turquoise eyeshadow caked in the creases of her lids. - “Mami, what are they selling?” She must have forgotten, so I remind her. She looks like a demented old aristocrat who’s fallen on hard times. “For how much?” - “It’s…” I am almost at the front of the queue now, and I could be by the window if the mulatto weren’t obstructing my path. He eyes me up with contempt and growls: “Are you sure you want that beer?” - “Why wouldn’t I?” - “Because you left.” - “So? I came back.” - “If you don’t want the beer I will give you two dollars in exchange for your allowance.” Ah, so he is a particular. - “I do want my beer.” I mutter. The old lady’s eyes widen: “I don’t. Give me those two dollars and I’m your mum.” - “I prefer aunty.” - “Whatever. Give me the money.” - “Here it is, dear aunty.” - “Thank you, my dearest nephew.” And with that she elbows me to one side, squeezing past the mulatto and to the top of the queue. The final observation that we can draw from an economy in which there is a private retail sector without private production or wholesalers, is that inflation for certain goods is determined not by the treasury but by a complex poker game between producers, transporters, sellers, and re-sellers. And policemen, inspectors, CDR representatives and in fact anyone in the position of throwing a spanner in the works of an honest compañero just trying to make ends meet. Having said that, it is possible that currently booze is being hogged not only by chopis (illegally) but also by factories (legally) in preparation for Havana’s 500 years celebrations in mid-November. But of course since this explanation is logical, it is far more likely that the desire to ensure that the big party doesn’t run dry has absolutely nothing to do with the fact that the city has been a desert since last month. - “ Muchacha, mu-cha-chaaaaa!” By the time I figure it’s me he’s calling, the shop guy’s face is a study in ill-concealed irritation: “So do you want this beer or not? I can’t wait the whole afternoon ’til you wake up. Look at the queue behind you!” As to underline his annoyance, a cloud of snorts laps the back of my neck. I throw a bunch of notes at him and leave with my Bucanero. Truth is, more than a beer what I really need right now is a shot of rum. … or make it a bottle."

Medium.com,Life,10 Things People Don’t Know About My (Less Than Privileged) Passport,Travel,https://medium.com/@mxrh0121/10-things-people-dont-know-about-my-less-than-privileged-passport-fa85ea5634be?source=topic_page---------89------------------1," I have a Colombian passport. My friends know that mostly because I always make a point of introducing myself as Colombian. I’m short, my hair is black and curly, I look pretty Colombian, in my opinion, like, I can pull off the title. “Why do I have this super Americanized accent, you ask?” “Oh, well…” I’ll say, acting shocked at the, not at all expected, question *eye roll* and I tell them the whole story of my parents emigrating, applying for asylum, living a life in limbo for seven years and then getting denied. Someone give me a book deal! What people don’t jump to is that, as a result, that means I do not have an American passport. In fact, I can’t travel to the United States right now at all. Unless I get approved for a tourist visa, but I’ve been denied twice in the past three years. In fact, I haven’t been there in over 10 years. This is slightly frustrating because during that time I’ve visited 15 other countries, give or take. I’m getting ahead of myself, though. I’m writing this because there’s a lot that people who have really nice shiny passports (I’m looking at you Japan, Singapore, Germany, Switzerland, etc.) don’t realize about people who don’t have one. So here are 10 things people don’t usually know about my passport privilege (or lack thereof). Sure, it’s not your fault! Why would you have to know that other people can’t just book a flight or see their family at a whim? So here’s your daily dose of privilege education in the form of a fun, easy-to-digest “Top 10” list. I’m not making this up, guys. There’s an actual list of the most powerful passports and you can see how yours compares to other countries as far as the number of countries you can visit visa-free. Curious? Find out here. Colombia is #43 in the world this year and I need a visa for 100 countries in the world. What does that mean? Well, I’ll compare it to the US passport only because that’s the one my sister (born in the US) as well as many other members of my family hold. The United States is #6 in the world and they need a visa for only 42 countries. However, passport power is hardly restricted to the ability to travel. Other opportunities like work and travel visas (Working Holiday Visas,) work abroad opportunities, and salaries can be limited just because you have a certain passport. For instance, I’m a native English speaker. I learned English when I was 8 years old and used it almost exclusively until I was almost 16 years old. I sound like I’m from the Midwest because, hey, I grew up in the Midwest. However, since my passport isn’t from a country that has English as their native language, I can’t be employed in a lot of countries to be an ESL teacher and not many countries are looking to hire a ton of Spanish teachers… womp, womp. I enjoy traveling, I’m slightly afraid of flying but it’s nothing a good podcast or movie can’t fix. What I can’t get over is how many terrible airport experiences I have. Nine times out of ten I’ll get pulled aside “randomly” at airports. They’ll search my bags, ask me a thousand questions, take my phone away, put me through X-Rays (no joke). It’s not just at foreign airports either, they do it right in my hometown as I’m leaving to fly abroad. Colombian + flying alone is a red flag, but I’ve tested the theory and Colombian + flying with an American boyfriend isn’t any better. Privilege isn’t contagious, it seems. At first, I’d cry, I’d be scared or nervous for no reason at all. I really do have just as much of a reason to be taking up space at an airport than anyone else. Now, I just sigh and walk where I need to walk, answer what I need to answer, and hope I don’t miss my flight. I really believe I ended up as a Digital Nomad for two reasons. I have to get really creative and learn fast. In some countries, I’m working with 30 days, 60 days, maybe 90 days for a visa. After that, I can’t pull the “leave and come back” method that my friends do. (This means they leave the country and return, get re-stamped start their time over). This works for them in a lot of countries in Asia, but for me, most countries limit my yearly visiting time and cut me off after that. So, when that time is done, I have to know what’s next, how much it will cost to go there, and hopefully, make it worth it to relocate so that my salary is enough to allow me to save money while living there. I know what you’re thinking, “just live in Colombia!” and I did for many years. However, there are so many benefits to living in other countries. I save more money, there are countries (like where I live now, in Taiwan) where it’s incredibly safe, among many others. If I didn’t work online, I’d be looking at $5/hour jobs in Medellin and…pass. So, how can I work online and not take advantage of mobility? So, yes, it’s hard, but I choose to do it, that I do know. When answering questions at immigration you’re not allowed to just “not know”. Well, maybe you are, but I’m not. If I don’t know where I’m staying because I want to walk to find a hostel or I’m not sure how many days exactly I’ll be staying, or I have no friends there, immigration agents get really serious. So begins a long line of “what do you mean?” questioning. “What do you mean you don’t know where?” “What do you mean you don’t know anyone here?” “What do you mean you’re traveling alone?” “What do you mean you work online?” So, now I hyper-plan my trips. I make reservations, I make itineraries, I do anything to limit the time I’ll spend being interrogated for trying to be spontaneous. I’ll keep this one short. When explaining to a stranger why you’d ever want to be a tourist in their country the following things, in their eyes, mean you’re likely to leave when you’re done. If you have none of these, you’re wildly threatening to the security of their immigration system and you must be interrogated and watched closely. While the Female Digital Nomad group is a great resource for a lot of things, it’s certainly taken with a grain of salt without passport privilege. Sometimes, girls just post “where should I travel next?” like it’s a game of darts at a bar after a couple of beers. For me, the question looks more like “where can I travel next and will my plans be ruined by a denied visa?” There are some blogs out there that have helped me during my travels, though some have led me astray (I was not allowed to go to Thailand because I didn’t know I needed a Yellow Fever vaccine). ColomViajeros is good, though low-budget. We need more idols and bloggers informing us of the possibilities and requirements of travel with lower-ranking passports. Knowing how to wade through the difficulties and what awaits on the other end would have been great before jumping in headfirst, especially following people who were more privileged than me. Finding out it was twice as hard for me than my friends was a splash of ice water to the face. I think the ranking for passports doesn’t always convey how difficult it is to get visas for some nationalities. Now, Colombians aren’t by any means the least privileged people out there. However, while “applying for a visa” for an American can mean red tape, or that that specific country requires more planning, for a Colombian it really is a nail-biter. Will we bet the application fee? Might be $100 out the window if we get denied. Will we be approved in time? I’ve had to show up, sweaty and scared, to visa processing offices on a Friday afternoon to pick up an approved visa before flying out on Sunday. After all of the bureaucracy, you might still have the door shut on you. Let’s say you don’t worry about that part. As a Colombian, I go to a lot of European countries visa-free. I visited Hong Kong (no visa required) in April. I was approved for a visa in Australia! In all of these places, I was stopped and questioned thoroughly upon arrival. There is no “easy” entry anywhere when your passport ranks low. You’re always looked at as, let’s face it, “less than”. Like you shouldn’t be there and they’re trying to figure out why, like it’s a puzzle. I couldn’t possibly be a regular Colombian woman just trying to spend some time in this country, I guess? This is #1 for a reason. For two years I’ve struggled with how difficult it is to date across passport lines. I dated an American man and it hardly ever felt like there were cultural differences. We both grew up in the Midwest, we were only a couple of years apart, we could relate to each other about music, pop culture, puns. However, he held a US passport, of course, and I didn’t. So when he got hired to teach abroad, I thought I could follow easily. Turns out it was a thousand times harder for me to try to make it abroad without that little blue book. Not being able to have the same privileges and opportunities led to some of the hardest problems I’ve had to face while dating. It’s that cliché where you love each other and can’t seem to coincide place/time/opportunity. Just, watch Jessie Reyes tell it better than I can: Anyway, I hope you learned something. I sure have over the years I’ve been lucky enough to be able to travel as freely as my passport and my circumstances allow. I’ve seen some really beautiful things, I live hilarity on the daily, and I’m just trying to make things better and teach other people if I can. Don’t hate, come along on the journey."

If you’re anything like me, when October rolls around everything is SPOOKY! Cemeteries are fascinating to visit any time of year, but especially right now when remembering ancestors is so important. In no particular order, here are the 13 spookiest cemeteries: This Victorian cemetery was opened in 1839 as one of London’s “Magnificent Seven” park cemeteries. These seven cemeteries were created in the 1830s as an effort to relieve the overcrowded churchyards closer to the center of the city. A highly sought-after burial ground, Highgate has around 53,000 graves, one of which belongs to Karl Marx. By the end of World War II, the cemetery had been neglected and was widely overgrown and rundown, adding to the already spooky atmosphere. In the 1970s, the cemetery was the focus of a media sensation involving claims of vampires and other supernatural activities."

It still happens. But it happens less and less. Its kind of like people finally learning that it’s not okay to say “that’s retarded” or “that’s so gay.” Please, never say those things. And please, don’t mention Pablo Escobar the second somebody tells you that they’re Colombian. It’s exhausting to have a complex mulitcultural nationality be boiled down to one infamous drug lord. Thanks alot, Netflix. Since graduating from college 6 years ago, I’ve noticed a signficant shift in people’s reactions when I bring up Colombia. Rather than reverting to bad and offensive cocaine jokes, people have started saying positive things like “I hear it’s beautiful” or “I really want to go!” Well, it turns out that gringos, Americans and Europeans alike ,are not only visiting Colombia. Since moving to Bogotá in August, I’ve met droves of European and a handful of American expats, many of whom initially came to Colombia as visitors and decided to stay. They loved this place so much and saw so much potential in it that they stayed. It blew my mind the first time I heard this narrative but now I’ve heard it so many times that its lost its shock factor. People love it here because they like to be kept on their toes. Because natural beauty abounds. Because Colombians are kind and beautiful. Because people with saved up US dollars, Euros or British Pounds can typically live a pretty cushy life here. Time for a vocab lesson on the word gringo/a. Urban legend says that the word came into use during the Mexican-American War, when people yelled “green, go!” at invading American troops. Whatever the etymology, it has come to refer to foreigners in Latin America, especially American foreigners. Up until recently, I actually thought it was exclusively used in reference to American foreigners, but I have since realized that people here tend to clump all foreigners of European descent into the same category. Whether British, French, American, or Australian, you’re a gringo."

Medium.com,Life,How to Survive the Dutch Winter,Travel,https://medium.com/@dangeddes_24241/how-to-survive-the-dutch-winter-7ebb85ae5009?source=topic_page---------93------------------1," September, when the sun still occasionally shines in Holland, is a good moment to prepare yourself mentally, physically and spiritually for the coming Dutch winter, which I half-affectionately call “the dark time.” Darkness will descend upon the land very quickly. One September morning you wake up around 7:00 a.m., and it’s still light out and the birds are singing, but seemingly only a few mornings later you will notice it’s as dark as midnight. And the same happens in the evening: during your after-dinner walk you suddenly notice that you’re shrouded in darkness. Every day it seems like you lose a half hour of sunlight. Some people embrace the winter. “Maybe we will get snow and ice this year!” they say hopefully, as if that’s a good thing. But not all are so enthusiastic. One Dutch woman told me the only sensible thing to do would be to “move all of Amsterdam, brick by brick, to the south of France.” The short days and long dark nights lead many to despair. Don’t let this happen to you! Here are some tips for surviving the Dutch winter. * Book a trip to a sunny location for December, January or February. Do it now. Right now. Today. You need something to look forward to. There must be light at the end of the tunnel. * Find a cozy café to make your second home. Look for one with a wooden interior where they put candles on the table and string up Christmas lights to create a winter ambience. Try some seasonal autumn beers, Glühwein, or a hot chocolate with whipped cream. * Put up Christmas lights and light candles to re-create this same magical ambiance in the comfort of your own home. * Get into the spirit of the winter holidays, which cleverly serve to break up the long dark time with festivals and other distractions: Sint Maarten, Sinterklaas, Christmas, New Year’s Eve and New Year’s Day are some of the best known holidays. As Americans my family and I also celebrate Halloween and Thanksgiving, so we have a holiday celebration, featuring truly excessive overeating, almost every week. Create your own holiday traditions! * However, if you have children, adopt some rules about holiday sugar intake. No child should eat more than 2,000 pepernoten per day, except of course on the day Sinterklaas arrives from Spain by ship and on 5 December. Upon these days, by sacred tradition, the 2,000 pepernoten limit per child is not enforced. * Oliebollen wagons will soon materialize on busy corners. Try to resist the siren call of the oliebollen (deep-fried sugary balls of white-flour dough, i.e., Dutch donuts). But if you must indulge, the apple beignet is the king of all the deep-fried winter-time sugar rushes. And while apple is indeed a fruit, remember that the apple beignet does not count as one of your recommended five daily fruits or vegetables. * Book some tickets for a show. Remember to book many weeks in advance for the most popular shows. This is a densely populated country! See http://www.amsterdamsuitburo.nl/extra/uitkrant for tickets. * Learn to appreciate traditional Dutch comfort food, such as stamppot, erwten soup, and boerenkool. * Winter, of course, is cold and flu season. Wash your hands frequently, especially when you find a bathroom that provides opulent amenities such as hot water and soap. * Despite all precautions, you may develop a condition known as “perma-cold,” whereby you have cold symptoms for four solid months and you may believe you are dying. No matter how miserable you become, most doctors will be philosophical about your suffering and prescribe only tea, sleep, and maybe, if they are feeling magnanimous, a few tablets of paracetemol (if you are a weakling or a foreigner). Other people will suggest traditional remedies such as jenever or Jägermeister. Use such remedies with caution. * Find indoor shelter for your bicycle, even if you must put it in your bathtub. If you leave it outside the whole winter, your bike will quickly be reduced to a useless pile of rust. * If you cycle frequently, buy at least two sets of rain gear. If you have a talent for design, consider designing some shirts and pants using rain-resistant materials. Your new all-weather fashion-line is bound to sell well here in Holland. * Don’t even think of bicycling on the icy streets unless you are Dutch. If you are Dutch, consider petitioning the International Olympic Committee to introduce “Ice Cycling” as a new Olympic sport, preferably for various distances (100 m, 500 m, 1 km, 5 km) and bridges as obstacles. This will help inflate Holland’s medal count at the next Winter Olympics. * Consider taking a short walk at lunch time, as this may be your only chance to have the sun shine on your face during the dark time (on the small chance that the sun is shining). Vitamin D is very important to stave off thoughts of despair or emigration! * Further develop and refine your convictions about Dutch weather. Is it better when it’s freezing and icy because at least you can see some blue sky? Or do you actually prefer the perpetual gray weather? Is the weather predestined, or just a matter of chance? If predestined, is the weather God’s way of punishing the Dutch for past transgressions or imperial hubris? Libraries are filled with learned commentary on the philosophical implications of Dutch weather. The endless dark mornings may remind you of the classic movie Groundhog Day (1993), where the Bill Murray character keeps waking up on the same day (2 February), trapped, with no hope of escape, in a never-ending winter. Try to take inspiration from Murray’s character, Phil Connors, who eventually comes to the realization that no matter what situation you are in, you should strive for excellence in yourself (learn piano, French, or ice-sculpting) and compassion for others (perform small kindnesses), even if it seems like you have been cast into eternal darkness forever by some malevolent force. Take heart: it’s only for six months. First published in The Satirist"

oday Britain was, once again, supposed to leave the European Union. Three days ago, once again, the EU extended the deadline. And on Tuesday, once again, the Houses of Parliament voted for a general election.

If it looks like Groundhog Day from a distance, try living as part of it for the last four and a half years. During which time we have had a referendum, three leadership elections in two different parties, two general elections with a third in six weeks’ time. I always hated that film, hated the main character’s character, hated how he ‘got the girl’, hated its facile humour. But at least, in movie terms, it had a happy ending. The British version is unlikely to be so cheerful. What’s worse is that this whole thing was dictated by party politics not economics, as David Cameron tried to quell a wing of his party that were un-quellable. Now the Tory infighting has become the country’s identity and no one is likely to be happy with the outcome. If we leave Europhile Remainers are unhappy and, I’m sure, many Leavers will be when they discover the true cost of losing free trade. If we stay, the Leavers will kvetch about the ‘brown’ people. Because, let’s face it, as A A Gill put it so succinctly before the first vote that got us into this mess, this is all about Johnny Foreigner.

Every economist agrees that leaving will damage the country. Johnson and his mates will asset strip. Hedge-fund managers will make millions, whilst pensioners won’t be able to afford food. Tax evasion will continue to be an accepted practice, since many argue that avoiding new tax-evasion laws is driving this whole agenda, whilst the basic infrastructure that that pays for collapses. I have just come from a country that is somewhat broke: Greece. And whilst there are plenty of shiny 4x4s, the roads they drive on are full of holes, unmarked and precipitous, a bit like their economy."

Medium.com,Life,5 unexpected lessons I’ve learnt by travelling alone,Travel,https://medium.com/swlh/5-unexpected-lessons-ive-learnt-by-travelling-alone-e653c7cfe6d3?source=topic_page---------98------------------1," by Stephanie Conroy This time last year I wrote a piece about mourning the death of celebrity chef and travel guru, Anthony Bourdain. I keenly felt the loss of this man, a man I didn’t know. His death highlighted to me how little I understood the myriad ways mental illness can touch us and take from us, and how much credence I had given to the belief that escaping the mundane through travel had the power to ‘fix’ us. At the time of Bourdain’s death, I was fantasising about binning the life I knew; just hitting the road with a backpack and a Lonely Planet guide. And a medicine case the size of my head and A LOT of mosquito repellent. I was searching for a fix. My life looked great on paper: I have degrees, I don’t have a criminal record, I hit my yearly quota for dental check-ups. But it felt wrong. I was bored to the bone, baby. Unhappy at work, feeling isolated and at odds with my colleagues, I came home to a place I shared with my nice but introverted housemate who spent his nights unwinding in his room. I was dating, but my heart wasn’t in it. I was acutely aware that I was approaching 30, and I hadn’t yet ‘achieved’ any of the markers that society tells women they should have by this stage of their lives. Like a house. And a baby. And a husband. I know, I know. This is an old-school mentality, but one which has been modelled to me from birth. It is implanted in my core, like the ‘knowledge’ that thin = beautiful. I don’t believe this bullshit. I hate it on principle, with all its misogynistic overtones. But the programming runs deep. In recent years, the damaging frequency I tuned into as a teenager that told me ‘You are fat, no one will ever love you’, began to pick up another broadcast: ‘You are a failure. Where is your husband? Your baby? Your house? You have nothing– and you’re a big fat loser, don’t forget!’ In a very deliberate effort to explore avenues outside of these traditional criteria and shush the evil step-mother of a voice in my head, I took a year off work to travel. It’s something I knew would rattle the cage of my bone-deep boredom, but more importantly, I thought it might help me combat the anxiety that has cast shadows of fear and doubt and unhappiness over my life. I’m now six months into my trip, and I’ve been reflecting on what I’ve learnt thus far. I’m no less anxious I can honestly say, travelling hasn’t fixed my anxiety, at all. However, it has helped me see it as something I don’t need to solve. Anxiety for me primarily manifests in distressing ‘what-if’ scenarios that would likely never eventuate because I’ve always been careful to keep myself insulated. And yet; what if? So, there’s also an unhealthy amount of catastrophising and repetitive, obstructive thought patterns which cause me to fret. This can happen when I’m alone, or around other people. When it’s at its worst, I seem to forget what constitutes socially acceptable behaviour and inflict my panic on whoever is nearest. Often, this is my friends, or family, and I’m filled with shame once I’ve calmed down. Travelling has forced me to face some of the what ifs. And I’ve done alright. Sure, I’ve had a few ‘stress-attacks’ and behaved in ways I am not proud of because I was panicking (say, at the airport), but being in the company of strangers who weren’t just going to accept and support me forced me to challenge my response to crises and learn to modify the impact of my anxiety on others. In situations where no one was available to talk me down, I had to step back and tell myself: ‘Hey you’re stressed, that’s fine, it’s a stressful situation, but it will be okay.’ This self-talk and acceptance helped me to navigate a motorbike accident where I ended up in hospital with no money to pay the bill, no friends to bail me out, no idea of my address because it was a house I was unofficially renting from a new Thai friend and she’d just drawn me a map, and four ‘tourist police’ escorting me back to said house telling me what big trouble this lady was in because our arrangement was illegal. Not even my wildest what ifs could prepare me for this. And yet, I survived. I paid the cops and they left. I waddled and hitchhiked to the hospital every day to get my bandages changed. And to my knowledge, they never followed up with the owner. I discovered that living with anxiety and not seeing it as an enemy feels empowering. Accepting it removed my shame, which made it easier to take a breath, rationalise and apologise to people I had burdened with my panic. Travelling, and exposing myself to anxiety provoking situations, has helped me to understand that I am capable of navigating crises, despite my discomfort. Saying ‘no’ to life feels good I have been a long-time sufferer of FOMO (Fear Of Missing Out). As someone who has never been comfortable entertaining herself, I have always craved the excitement of doing whatever other people are doing. Any social situation had to be better than whatever uninspiring activity I could conjure up. I wanted to get out, to do things; to LIVE. I was ready to say YES to anything! I wanted to climb to the tops of mountains; traverse big, bustling cities choked with scooters; sleep in a hut on the beach and hang out at reggae bars watching gigs with the coolest people on earth. The kind of life that one imagines when they hear the adage: live life to the max! Travel promised this, but did it deliver? Yes; on all of the above, in fact. For the first few months, it was incredible. I felt a part of something. I was excited to go out every night and party with my new friends and talk to so many people and see the sights. I loved being part of the action. But soon, I was exhausted. ‘You go without me!’ I’d find myself saying more and more. And instead of feeling I was missing something, I began to sense that I was exactly where I wanted to be; reading in my hammock with a kitten or having a dip in the ocean and lying in the sun to dry off. Or just wandering to a restaurant down the road to get some cheap food and turn in early. For the first time in my life, I was saying NO to things; and it felt good. If there was a party or drinking session I’d be invited to in the past, I’d be there, even if I’d slipped and fallen and split my chin open and had to stop and get stitches on the way, and yeah, that happened once; on my way to a barbeque. I think my unhealthy FOMO was a reflection of the fact that I didn’t know what I liked doing. So, I just did whatever everyone else was doing. I never gave myself the space or time or credit to work out what I enjoyed, and instead tagged along with my friends to places I wouldn’t dream of going now, only to be surrounded by people I really didn’t like. But I desperately craved companionship and connection with others; it didn’t matter where we were, as long as I wasn’t alone. Saying no has allowed me to discover the joy of my own company. Instead of feeling ‘stuck’ with myself, I now rejoice at the prospect of being alone. It’s difficult to find space and time to yourself on the road, even when you’re travelling solo. There are always other people, and a lot of those people are annoying as fuck. I can now appreciate that a ‘night in’ with a good book and a comfy bed and some rando cat and nothing but the sound of the ocean and the crunching of the snacks you’re eating has the power to be intensely enjoyable. Travelling has taught me to ask myself: Do you really want to do that? And to listen and abide when the answer is: Nup. Quitting stuff is easy when you give yourself permission to have it At the start of the trip I was drinking and smoking with abandon, because that’s what I’d done to relax and socialise since I was legally able to walk into a bottle shop and buy Black Douglas and a pack of Styvvos; and I was on holiday. But when one month turned into three, the novelty started to wear thin. Yes, alcohol here in South East Asia is cheap, and yes, ciggies are ubiquitous, but I noticed myself falling out of love with them. Saturation and absolute permission are the two factors I blame (and thank) for making me realise I had a choice. The easy choice, under the circumstances, was to smoke and drink because everyone else was doing it and that made it seem incredibly valid; sort of like riding a motorbike without any safety gear. Only, once I saw and felt the effects of these choices on my body and mind, they had lost their sheen. So, I made the choice to quit smoking and reduce my alcohol intake to a 4-drink maximum whenever, if ever, I get the urge to drink. Interestingly, having permission to smoke and drink all I wanted took the allure out of it. Once the cravings had passed, it actually wasn’t difficult at all*. I’ve done the same with food. No longer framing eating as some impossible mathematical equation of macros and calories, I’ve given myself permission to eat what I want, when and if I want it. And what do you know? Listening to my body has told me I can stuff myself full of noodles anytime I want, but it’ll probably make me feel yuck in the guts. I’ll grab a vegetable soup instead, because it’s tasty and satiating and I won’t feel bloated and lethargic after eating it. Listening to what your body wants is easier when you give yourself permission to completely fucking destroy it. Travel is not as romantic as it looks on Instagram Last week, I went to see the Borobudur temple complex in Yogyakarta, Java. Since it appeared on the Lonely Planet calendar my parents had in their toilet last year, I resolved to see it. I booked a room at a homestay nearby, which was…terrible. A tiny bedroom located off the bedroom of an older man who was also apparently a hoarder, with an external bathroom that comprised a filthy toilet, a bucket of water and a hose, oh, and a giant fucking huntsman-looking spider on the wall, centimetres away from the only tap. I’m no stranger to grim bathrooms these days, but this one took the cake; especially since I had to skulk back through the guy’s bedroom in my towel, under his intensely watchful gaze, because I forgot my shorts. The temple, which I paid a hefty amount to see, was jammed packed with tourists by 7am. Tourists blocking the stairs, tourists ignoring the many, highly visible signs telling them not to sit on the bells, sitting on the bells, tourists lining up to buy the mountains of cheap crap for sale outside the sacred Buddhist temple. Looking at my photos later that night I saw I’d managed to get one of myself with no one else in it. My first reaction was: Cool, this is the one I’ll put on Facebook. Why? Because it was the one that made me look the most intrepid, like I’d discovered a place no one else had. But it did not depict the reality of Borobudur. Like many of the photos we are exposed to on social media, it captured a perfect illusion. I wonder if people visiting these places ever admit to feeling disappointed it wasn’t like what they’d seen online? I want some of the things I bagged out in my intro This one is the weirdest. I have never really wanted a kid, but suddenly I’m overwhelmed with dreams of my (imaginary) daughter. In these dreams, I take her impossibly smooth, pale legs to my mouth, kissing the toes and folding the small body into mine. I imagine balmy afternoons lying in a hammock together, her asleep on my chest while I read in tee shirt and underpants. I think of pressing my nose to her chubby face and breathing her in and feeling her smile as she grabs handfuls of my hair. I feel her plant poorly aimed, wet kisses all over my weatherbeaten cheeks. In the distance, people surf while the sun sinks. It feels blissful. By the time this piece is published, I will have turned 30. So, it may be my biology talking when I say that I’m increasingly drawn to the idea of having a child…and cat and a house where we all can live, and some land where we can run around. And maybe some chickens. And a goat. The husband belonging to more traditional versions of this joyful future is notably absent from my vision. This is a relief, because it means I have stopped pining for something I have no control over. I haven’t ruled out ‘soul mate’ though. If they exist, they are welcome to join us on the farm. And to all the people who keep telling me: ‘Don’t worry, you still look young’– I’m not worried. I actually couldn’t give a fuck. I don’t necessarily want to look young, nor am I afraid to turn 30. Every year I’ve aged this past decade, I’ve grown closer to knowing and liking myself and understanding what I want. I have never been more excited about a birthday. No, escaping the mundane through travel doesn’t ‘fix’ anything. But it does give us space to step back from our lives and take stock of what we have. What we like and what we don’t. What is important to us, the things we need to live, and the stuff we could probably turf. Travel, space, and aloneness give us this perspective, allowing us to entertain infinite possibilities. Even those we never dreamed of considering before. *I also read the classic self-help book The Easy Way to Quit Smoking by Allen Carr, and this helped me to reframe my perception of smoking. I haven’t had a cigarette in 8 weeks."
Medium.com,Life,The Amnesiac City,Travel,https://medium.com/swlh/the-amnesiac-city-e24c87e02c38?source=topic_page---------99------------------1," My dad wants to ride in a taxi from Casablanca to Rabat. I tell him, first, that it’s too expensive. I try to explain that converting the price into dollars doesn’t make the proposition any less ridiculous. I try telling him the train station is right there, literally inside the airport, but he insists. He wants to ride in the taxi for three times the price. When we land, it starts to rain. I tell him, “Dad, the train station is inside the airport, and the cars are outside. We can just take the train.” He says no, he wants to ride in the taxi for three times the price. I almost choke when haggling with the driver. My dad just grins, happy he gets a private car to nap in until we reach the city. Then we start driving, careening down muddy farm roads through sheets of rain that part for moments here and there to give us a glimpse of small reminders of where we are, of Morocco — here the coastline, there the donkeys carrying their loads of produce to markets. My father dozes, occasionally coaxed into consciousness by a glimpse of a farm animal lumbering alongside our car or a particularly incomprehensible roadblock in the middle of a field of wheat. Every time he opens his eyes, he comments on a new little absurdity. The rainy world outside his private car, three times the price of the train, opens slowly to him, by degrees. We stop and go, breaking up puddles, covering the ninety kilometers between the airport and Rabat at a leisurely pace. He marvels at the small things that used to strike me — the roadside restaurants, the delicate dance of cars and livestock, the foil wrappers that litter the ground and line the pavement. When we come to the city, he comments on the whitewashed facades of the colonial quarter, the view of the ocean, and the call to prayer from the Mosque of the Martyrs. My dad and I are spending spring break in Rabat, where I once spent a year studying Arabic. For him, the city lives in these glimpses through the rain, these tableaus of the brief life I had here. He blinks, surprised, at the smoked sheep heads and pyramids of cumin and turmeric that line the cobbled roads of the old city. He cringes at the catcalls. He gets ripped off buying overpriced leather goods, because no matter how many times I tell him how terrible I am at haggling, he hears me speak Arabic and assumes I have more of a clue what’s going on than I actually do. For him, the city is something I own, present tense. He follows my footsteps from place to place, chats amicably in restaurants I picked out with the friends I made, and fills his phone with pictures that are identical to the ones I took two years back. I am careful to part the rain for him, to give him those glimpses. But as we walk through my old neighborhood together, I start to wonder what it is I’m seeing. I start to marvel at how different these tableaus are for me now, these moments, even as I witness them through his inexperienced eyes. There are places that have changed since I left and places that have not. There are walls repainted and scaffolding removed. There are blatant ways that these same tableaus are different for us, simply because for me they are composite images — formed from the overlap between who I was and who I am now. My dad has come here in search of revelation, to see what all the fuss is about, to see the place I used to live. At first, I thought that I came to guide him and to visit my friends. As I show him these glimpses, though — the cafes where I spent afternoons absorbed by my homework, the high places I escaped to when the going was rough, the people that became the cornerstones of my brief second life here — I realize that I came here for a resurrection. I came here to exhume something. I came here to recover the sense of newness and adventure I felt myself losing after a freezing upstate New York winter in a lonely, quiet town. I look for that feeling everywhere, but the city is amnesiac, and it is nowhere to be found. I cannot pull it out of the images I choose to show my dad, the places and people who remind me of that short, old life — the streets I used to walk, or the cafes I used to sit in. It is not carried by these walls or even by the people I love who live in them, not anymore. Places forget you the second you leave, and you can’t resurrect the old selves you bury in them, no matter how deep you dig. I think that the sense of newness and adventure I found in Rabat is probably buried for good now, deep under a layer of Ithaca permafrost. But buried does not mean gone. I am not a cemetery plot of younger, brighter-eyed selves I lay to permanent rest after I outgrow them. Nor am I the amnesiac city, perpetually forgetting. In Rabat, I start to see that I am my father’s footsteps. He follows where my memory leads him, undaunted by the sheep heads and catcalls and rain. He knows the old self and the current one, and he trusts them both. It rains almost every day in Rabat this time around. I try to let the rain be for myself what it is for him — a baptism, a newness, a painting in watercolor. I let it soften the ground below me and try to feel the person I was two years ago in Rabat underneath, with all her boundless idealism and adventures. I do not try to resurrect her, not anymore. I trust that she lives in me somewhere, or in the footsteps of my father, his eyes on the city I used to live in. I trust that she is alive in the earth beneath me, that she learned from the permafrost. I trust that she will not let me become a cemetery. I trust her, and I let myself grow."

A perfect day under a perfect sun in Rome’s Piazza del Popolo, my favourite place in the world. Even the puffy clouds are only there to provide a welcome break from the heat, and tourists gasp with pleasure at their tables as the light dims. They applaud when the sun comes out, as though it can hear them. And it can. But not even the sun lasts forever. And every time my wife gets on a plane to visit her parents, I remember again what we all try to forget. One day, one way or another, we’ll say goodbye for the last time. How do you love without being afraid? There’s nothing like the ruins of an empire to remind you that everything is temporary. What gives the place its gorgeous melancholy glow––the edges of the cobblestones worn smooth by ten million footfalls, the marble benches rounded and softened by six hundred winters––is the lives that have been spent and vanished, never to return. The radiance of a life is visible only when it’s lived as though it matters. And there I go again, putting up glass walls between the world and me."
Medium.com,Life,Finding Home in Friendship,Travel,https://medium.com/the-chorus/finding-home-in-friendship-a9e37c23a793?source=topic_page---------101------------------1," When people ask me where I’m from, I have a choice to make. Do I tell them the whole story, from the beginning? Do I engage in the same conversation that happens every time I elaborate — wow, how exotic? Or do I give a simple answer that doesn’t turn me into a curiosity? Answer: It’s complicated. My parents had a sense of adventure. By the time I was three years old, I had already lived on three continents. My first words were in Hausa, a tribal language of northern Nigeria and my next words were in Dutch, my fatherland tongue. I have my mother’s Indonesian dark hair and features, and I stand at a whopping 5’2”, all oddities in the Netherlands, where I was born. When I was three, I carried this incongruity to the Midwest, where Nigeria, the Netherlands, and Indonesia were like places you read about in fairytales. So yeah, I get a lot of questions. I caught the nomad bug and spent my young adult years flitting from country to country, collecting stamps in my passport, investing in adventure over relationships — living in the Netherlands, Denmark and Indonesia, and traveling through India, Asia and the Middle East. I’m a textbook Third-Culture Kid — I grew up in a different country than either of my parents and I feel more at home exploring a new culture than I do staying in one place. Throughout my 20s, I lived and breathed the idea that without human ties, life could be rich and free. I was so committed to this tether-less way of life that I once told a handsome Dane that I dated in Laos, “no commitment, no pain”. Shows like Friends and Sex and the City bothered me because they focused on friendships fraught with little dramas, petty fights, and funny make-ups. But underneath it all, I envied the characters on TV because they had friends who were there no matter what shenanigans each week had to offer. I longed for connection and deep friendships that felt impossible when I was always on the road. It took a disease and two deaths in my family for me to recognize what was missing. Eventually, I settled in New York City. Sure, I had plenty of friends. People whom I met on one continent and blipped into my life on another. People I would see at parties, who accepted that regular Sunday brunches and Thursday game nights were not part of my lifestyle. I prided myself on the global sprawl of my network — but if I had a break-up, or a broken bone, or a bad day at work, I dealt with it on my own. It took a disease and two deaths in my family for me to recognize what was missing. I was diagnosed with endometriosis, a painful disorder that affects women around their periods. The pain was often so great that I spent days in bed and disappeared from my social circle. My world got very small. When I reached out to ask for help, or cheering up, responses were scarce. It grounded me for several years, and I became very close to my Netflix queue. Then one summer, my aunt and my uncle passed away in quick succession. In many ways, they were my connection to my Dutch-Indonesian roots when I went to visit the Netherlands as a kid. While my older cousins were too cool to hang with their little American cousin, my aunt and uncle would tell me family histories and share our culinary traditions. Their deaths shook me to the core. The infrastructure of family as I knew it crumbled, and the mortality of my own parents began to haunt my thoughts. How on earth would I — an only child so far from any sense of home — be able to deal with death? Who would I turn to? That was my Bummer Summer, when I wallowed in pain — not just the pain of losing family and love — but the pain of realizing that I didn’t have many close friends to confide in. Invites to nights out and group drinks, late dinners and crowded bars felt thin and unsympathetic to deaths and diseases I thought incessantly about what I would do if my parents passed; I would have no one, I told myself. After a life priding myself on independence and self-sufficiency, I had never felt so alone. It made me take a hard look at my relationships. I felt a gaping emptiness. I knew I had to do something. Some people think friendships just happen, but they take work. It was a conscious decision for me to reach out more, break open my veneer. As if flipping a switch, I woke up one day and decided to invest in friendship. Some people think friendships just happen, but they take work. It was a conscious decision for me to reach out more, break open my veneer, share bits of myself, appreciate those who were there for me, cull down those who were fair weather, spend my precious time on the relationships that counted. I invited people in, even when I was ill, to be part of the ups and downs of my life. It took checking in with people and accepting their pain so that they could accept mine. It took being honest about rough patches instead of running away. I started cultivating the kinds of friends whom I would miss when I left, and who would miss me. Cherishing the people I was with in the moment, rather than always seeking what’s next. For the first time, I put my heart into staying rather than leaving. A year later, when I had the surgery that freed me from endometriosis, a parade of friends came by to bring me food, jokes and flowers. I was finally at home."
Medium.com,Life,I Made Life Decisions While Walking the Camino,Travel,https://psiloveyou.xyz/i-made-life-decisions-while-walking-the-camino-21ef9562b4f9?source=topic_page---------102------------------1," The message came in on my fourth day of walking the Camino de Santiago, a 500-mile pilgrimage across Spain. It was time to make a decision. Northwestern Hospital needed to either move my partner’s sperm to longterm storage or destroy it. It was a decision that I had been wrestling with since Jeff died in June of 2018, so it was, perhaps, well timed to receive such a message while embarking on the most physically and mentally challenging thing that I have ever done. On Day Four of walking the Camino de Santiago, my body was still in the resistance phase. Sometime around the second week, it will go into straight-up survival mode, giving in to the reality of walking over mountains and along coastlines for 12 to 22 miles every day. It will begin to conserve all of its resources so that I would move on what felt like autopilot, needing less food, less water, and less sleep. But that wasn’t the case as I walked from Markina to Mendata across Basque Country four days in. At that point, I was exhausted and, when I allowed myself to think about it, every step rubbed hotly against the fast advancing army of blisters on my feet. My walking partner, Lizz, and I got lost that day. Hopelessly, completely, can’t-turn-back-now-we’ve-gone-too-far lost. At the top of a huge hill that was so overgrown with bushes and thorns that we had to cut a path through with our walking sticks, we met two other women who had taken the same wrong turn and who, like us, stood some miles off course with nothing but farmland in every direction. I didn’t know it then, but those women would become an integral part of our journey along“The Way,” a living sign that sometimes a wrong turn leads us in the right direction. Once back on course, we walked through a monastery where a Monk approached us and gave us a hug, thanking us for making the pilgrimage. It was then that I received the message about the sperm — during a moment when I was in high spirits and feeling full of the sheer guts and complete idiocy that it takes to walk across an unknown country. I don’t know whether our loved ones send us support from beyond when we really need it, but I would like to thinks so. It’s just what you do after a cancer diagnosis A cancer diagnosis for a childless man in child-bearing age means a trip to the fertility clinic. Jeff was still reeling from his diagnosis when he walked through those doors, but he never doubted that he — that we — would use that sperm. That after chemotherapy, radiation, and surgery, he would live to see his child born. It’s radiation that really puts a damper on the swimmers for a number of years, but Jeff didn’t even get to do radiation. Even writing that sentence makes me shake my head at the way that cancer turns the world upside down. In what kind of world do you think someone is lucky when they get to do radiation? Jeff was gone before chemo, radiation or anything else had a chance to stop the spread of his cancer. In his last days, Jeff gave me permission to use his sperm to create the child we had dreamed about. Setting the world back on its axis Somewhere out there on the Camino, things starting making sense to me again. There was a gravitational pull toward home that I hadn’t felt since cancer turned my world upside down. Out there, hard decisions seemed simple. Don’t get me wrong, making a decision like whether or not to use that sperm, wasn’t an easy one. But walking miles and miles with nothing to think about but putting one foot in front of the other, creates space and clears the clutter. I got to know my body and my mind really well. I knew when I had pushed my body to its limits and — as was more often the case — I knew when it was my mind and not my body that I was contending with. And when I finally figured out how to calm my mind, it was the silence that created space for the answers. Day Four on the Camino was the first time that I felt that silence. The decision factors There were a few things I had to clear out of the way before I could make a solid decision about what I really wanted in that moment and in my life. The first was the guilt. It was guilt compounded because, for one, I knew that Jeff wanted me to continue his legacy. That was one of his wishes in those final days. But would it be his wish for me now? Honestly, I don’t think so. Compounded guilt because, for two, I am a woman in my late 30s with single friends in their late 30s. And they are starting the process of freezing eggs and artificial insemination. But just because they are doing it, does that mean that I should do it, simply because I have this gift of the sperm of someone who I loved? That’s a rhetorical question, of course, but the guilt and the fear of losing my last chance were real. However, with the soles of my feet landing softly against the dirt paths of Spain, I alleviated myself of this guilt and literally and metaphorically walked forward. Which brings me to the part about really diving into my own heart to figure out what it is that I want. The answer always lies somewhere within us, but sometimes it's buried really deep. But there it was once I started digging: My dream is not to have a child. My dream is to start a family. And then there was the last thing to think through. The word “destroy”. To destroy Jeff’s sperm was to destroy the last physical part of him left on this planet. Certainly the last part of him that could give life. As I walked toward an unknown future, but toward a future that I am lucky to have before me, I realized that Jeff has given life. The life that I lead now is one that I only dreamed of in the world before cancer. It is a life that is inspired by him. The life that many of his friends and family live now is inspired because he lived. In the end, he inspired me to walk forward. Alone. And so I sent back the message from somewhere out there on the Camino de Santiago: Please destroy the sperm."

m sure many of you are familiar with the feeling that life is going quite well for you generally — you have a good job, a nice home, a partner, wonderful friends. Sounds all great, doesn’t it? But you can’t help but feel, if you pay close attention, that something is missing, and feel a slight fear that you are not fully living the life you’d truly like to live and do the things you’d truly like to do. Maybe you are thinking now “give me a break, thinking about these things gives me a headache and is too much hassle — I rather continue doing the things I always did, doing the things everyone else does”. I want to share with you the factors that helped me identify what I really wanted to do with my life and how I found my calling and created my own business — and ran with it. I hope this will inspire you and give you some hands-on advice on how to find your own way. And who knows, maybe the factors that inspired my own entrepreneurship journey can also be a guiding light for you. Life as a management consultant was exciting, brought me around the globe, and gave me lots of incredible learning experiences. But seeing the days race by like this and not truly feeling that this is my calling, I finally pressed the STOP brake. First, let me give you a glimpse of how my life looked like before I started my own business. Monday morning, 6am, the alarm goes off: Jump out of the bed, get dressed, eat breakfast in 5 minutes, race to the subway station, get to work at 8am. From there on — meeting over meeting over meeting over meeting. 7pm take the train home, take a quick dinner, open the laptop again and work, lights off at midnight, sleep. Next day: Repeat. Familiar anyone? L
ife as a management consultant was exciting, brought me around the globe, and gave me lots of incredible learning experiences. But seeing the days race by like this and not truly feeling that this is my calling, I finally pressed the STOP brake. I decided to take a full time-off from my work and live a totally different life for 5 months. A life free from long hours in offices and a fully-packed work schedule, a life of exploration and time for doing all the things I always wanted to do but never had time to do — and to figure out what I really wanted to get out of my life. And guess what, this was one of the best decisions of my life. B
eing a fully-fledged travel enthusiast who loves to explore new countries and cultures, I decided to live in China and South Korea for a few months. But instead of following a checkbox “been there, done that” kind of trip, I wanted to have a “slow travel” experience that would allow me to truly experience the Chinese and Korean culture, to get to know the people and their ways of living, and give me time to read loads of books and figure out my purpose. I made a promise to myself that I wouldn’t return from this trip until I had figured out what I truly wanted to do with my life, and commit to it. And here I am, 10 months later, having found my purpose, committed to it — and living a life with more meaning. 10 months ago I was standing in front of a crossroad. One way was heading towards a life on autopilot and working towards a career and life I felt was not truly right for me, the other one was a “black box” that had lots of opportunities up for grabs — but not unless I would grab them. I
was asked a lot about what it actually was that made me find my purpose and to commit to it. I thought a lot about this question and identified three key factors that helped me take the leap. Here they are: If you live a life anywhere close or even just a bit similar to the one I lived before I pressed the STOP brake, you likely have hardly any time or maybe even no time at all to think about the bigger picture and the purpose of your life, and the things you truly want to do. Or you simply don’t want to think about it. Frankly, it can be even a bit scary as you never know what you’ll discover — and you might find that you need to do some major life changes to live the life you’ve dreamt about. And so you are stuck in this “hamster wheel”, wondering where the days have gone, and worse even — wondering what you have done in all these days that has been truly meaningful to you. I can tell you something — unless you change this mode of operating, you can’t expect that your situation will change. And as Einstein already knew years ago, “doing the same thing over and over and expecting a different outcome is the definition of insanity”. So my key advice to you is — hit the brake and make time to think and figure out what it is you truly want to do in your life, and the things that are most important to you. Now, HOW you do this can be different from person to person. For one it might mean to make time for 1 or 2 hours each week and read a book that can be a guiding light for you, yet for another person this might mean to take a few months off and think about these questions while traveling. Do whatever suits your life situation, but make time. Many of the things we do day in and day out are because of the environment we are in, the society we live in, the people we spend time with. Seeing others doing the same things we do day in and day out, seeing the same familiar faces, makes us feel secure and accepted, and in a way makes us believe “we are doing it right”. But it also makes us believe “ this is how life is supposed to be, this is what I am supposed to do.” But have you ever asked yourself how this is impacting your life, thoughts and actions? What kind of thoughts would arise if you would leave this familiar world of yours for a while? Having escaped my familiar world and diving into a whole new and unfamiliar one has been a key contributor in helping me to get away from my “autopilot” mode and stopped me doing the things I’m always doing without questioning them. Being in a place where hardly anyone knows you, where you can observe totally new ways of living, has not only extremely widened my world view and given me lots of new ideas and inspiration. It also made it much easier for me to think freely and clearly: Unattached to a certain society that can easily make you feel pressured to conform with how everybody else is living and makes you adopt the same view of how a good life should look like. Putting yourself in new environments gives you a great starting point for finding your own way without being biased by other people’s views and expectations. Maybe you’re lucky and the realisation of your purpose comes to you while you are making time and putting yourself onto unfamiliar grounds, but my experience is this: If you don’t make an active effort to figure it out and focus on it, you won’t find it. I started by reading a couple of great books about finding my mission and purpose in life and stayed for almost a week in a Buddhist temple in Korea that involved lots of meditation and didn’t allow much speaking. All this helped me to figure out the things that are truly important to me — and made me realise that I was giving only minimal attention to the things that are in fact most important to me. And so what — great insights, but what to do with them? Once I figured out what was really important to me and the area I wanted to work with in the future, i.e. to help tackle climate change while using my background in international business, I needed to get some ideas of how this could look like in practice. But how to get the ideas? I started doing some online courses in entrepreneurship and sustainability that sparked loads of potential businesses ideas. Finally, after having taken lots of courses, written down all my business ideas on paper, talked to lots of people for feedback and input, revising my ideas, I made a final selection based on how viable they were and my personal fit to them. And voilà, my idea of creating sustainable sportswear was born. As you probably figured, this idea didn’t come over night and I had to create all these opportunities for myself and make an active effort to eventually come up with that one idea, and to make it a reality. And it took a few months for me to arrive there. The result? An ocean full of invaluable experiences, new friends from the other side of the planet, a widened horizon — and best yet, I figured out my purpose and how I can put it into practice. The result? An ocean full of invaluable experiences, new friends from the other side of the planet, a widened horizon — and best yet, I figured out my purpose and how I can put it into practice. T
en months ago I was standing in front of a crossroad. One way was heading towards a life on autopilot and working towards a career and life I felt was not truly right for me, the other one was a “black box” that had lots of opportunities up for grabs — but not unless I would grab them. So I decided for the second option, took the road less traveled. I promised myself not to return from the trip until I had figured out what I truly wanted to do. The result? An ocean full of invaluable experiences, new friends from the other side of the planet, a widened horizon — and best yet, I figured out my purpose and how I can put it into practice. This is how my own business was born."
Medium.com,Life,Breaking The Single-City Curse,Travel,https://kalaharireview.com/breaking-the-single-city-curse-f25f0da7a8ee?source=topic_page---------105------------------1," If there was a rule that you cannot form an opinion about a country after visiting only one of its cities, I would understand. In fact, I would even endorse it. I mean, there must be a reason I can write so easily about Nigeria, the United States and Kenya, but cannot find the right words for Belgium. Maybe I first need to explore Bruges, Antwerp and Ghent before writing an essay about it, regardless of how magical my time in Brussels was. Maybe I did not see enough. It’s a question I have pondered since my return to South Africa in September: How much of a country do you need to explore to have an opinion that holds weight? Are the questions, “Where else did you go? How long were you there?” a sort of scale we use to determine the legitimacy of another person’s travel experience? In Belgium, along with the amazing memories of performing at the 2019 Brussels Planetarium Poetry Festival (a huge thank you to Philip Meersman and Suzanne ter Haar for making this happen) on the 13th and 14th of September, I also got a tour of the city from my Belgian beloved, Tom. We visited the Jardin du Petit Sablon, where Tom took me on the “statue walk” and told me the story of the people immortalised by the statues. We also went to Place Poelaert, where The View Bruxelles, the gorgeous Ferris Wheel, stands. I was fascinated to hear that the wheel will be disassembled and moved to the Christmas market in November. Tom also took me to the Palais de justice de Bruxelles and told me that the scaffolding around the building has been there for over thirty years, longer than we have been alive! When he started to tell me about Ghent, the town where he went to university, and other interesting places in Belgium, I immediately wanted to stay and explore. I cannot wait to go back and see more, although Brussels is a breath-taking capital city I would be happy to stay in again. On the topic of capital cities, many of the people I have met on my travels are often surprised to find out that Johannesburg is not the capital city of South Africa. The actual capitals — Pretoria (the administrative capital), Cape Town (the legislative capital) and Bloemfontein (the judicial capital) — have their own charm, Cape Town being world-famous for Table Mountain and wine, and yet Johannesburg cannot seem to shake the label of (pseudo-)capital. It’s understandable, though. Abuja replaced Lagos as the capital city of Nigeria on the 12th of December 1991, exactly eight days before I was born, and yet, nearly twenty-eight years later, many non-Nigerians still believe that Lagos is the Giant of Africa’s capital city. Being Pretoria or Abuja must be like having a more famous sibling — no matter what you do, you cannot escape their shadow. It’s a good thing that cities don’t have egos or feelings, there would be wars on these streets if they did. I will be traveling to Zimbabwe in a few weeks, a trip spanning over the months of November and December. The cities I will get to see are Harare, Gweru and Bulawayo. It will be my first visit to a neighbouring country in Southern Africa and I am looking forward to it. My previous travels have taken me to West and East Africa, so it feels good to be staying close to home while still doing what I love — I will be performing at LitFest Harare and hosting workshops on poetry and mental health — in a place I have never been to before. The other day, a friend asked if I was flying or taking a bus to Zimbabwe, which emphasised how close the two countries are to each other, and I am ashamed at how quickly I exclaimed, “I’m flying!” It’s not that I do not enjoy bus trips, but I prefer them when I have the company of a friend. I have taken a 23-hour bus ride from Cape Town to Pretoria and it was not fun, especially because I later found out that the flight time is less than two hours and only a few hundred rands more costly. It seems terrible that now I want to put convenience over conservation (flying is terrible for the planet) but the state of the Beitbridge Harare highway, the narrow accident-ridden strip of road connecting South Africa to Zimbabwe, is just as much a cause for concern. Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie’s TED Talk, “The Danger of a Single Story”, was in the back of my mind as I began this essay, and it made me think of all the stereotypes I have come to accept about certain countries based on what I see or hear from the news, the experiences of other people, or my own brief encounters during single-city tours. These stereotypes are the reason friends were excited for me when I was off to New York or Nairobi, but slightly apprehensive about my trip to Iseyin, even though it was my third visit to Nigeria. The single story, in this case the story of one country based on events in one city, is the reason I continue to travel. I want to see more. I want to see more than the gloss that the tourism industry wants to polish, and more than the grit they want to hide. I want to be able to say “I was there” but more than anything, I want to feel it. I wish the same for you, dear reader. May all your future trips break the single-city curse. May you see more than what glitters."

Medium.com,Life,"Tokyo, A Water City",Travel,https://medium.com/@TheW2O/tokyo-a-water-city-a81264141bf4?source=topic_page---------110------------------1," It is pouring a mighty rain outside and the sound captures my memory, the so many variants of water moving through the atmosphere, falling on lakes and streams, down through cascade and rock formations, over dams and through sluices, into backwaters and turning eddies, over sand and stone along the coasts, and then amplified to crescendo of breaking water, waves returning from land to sea, breaking around me in my small vessel of a sensibility listening here. I reflect often on the magic of water. Here is an excerpt from Nature writer Annie Dillard from her wonderful book Pilgrim at Tinker Creek: “It has always been a happy thought to me that the creek runs on all night, new every minute, whether I wish it or know it or care, as a closed book on a shelf continues to whisper to itself its own inexhaustible tale. So many things have been shown so to me on these banks, so much light has illumined me by reflection here where the water comes down, that I can hardly believe that this grace never flags, that the pouring from ever renewable sources is endless, impartial, and free.” But water is not limited to the pastoral place; it defines major cities like London, Shanghai, and New York. It presents river confluence on which inland cities are built. And it outlines the histories of first civilizations where water flowed in aqueducts, hidden pipes and submerged ponds, and then canals built for the distribution of goods, the provision of services, the movement of people from place to place. We know these cities: Venice, St. Petersburg, Amsterdam, Suzhou, Bangkok, and more. Many such cities polluted these waterways with manufacturing run-off, toxic and human waste. They were filled and covered over to make streets, while the polluted water was conveyed invisibly through engineered underground tunnels and sewers ultimately to empty into lakes, inlets, and industrial harbors from which the modern city frequently turned away. Only in recent decades has there been a resurgence of urban waterfront development whereby the rotting abandoned urban water’s edge has been reclaimed as filled land on which entire new areas of city are constructed or restored as linear parks and recreational facilities or as high-rise expensive apartment buildings with water views. Given the ubiquity and need for water for health and solace, it is hard to believe that the water connection could have been so easily abandoned, now so expensively recovered as a civil space. When this essay posts Iwill be in Tokyo, a city known for its intense, quirky modernity, an inner-directed hive where people work and play with special abandon. To move through Tokyo is to submit to its manic system of transportation — subways, trains, congested traffic, effusive sidewalks, under and over passes, and labyrinthine passages that often duplicate the activity on the surface, a second, even third, level of city, illumined artificially with light-marks by which to navigate and artistic neon that is as sculptural as it is informative. When we read about Tokyo history, we think of the floating world, a system of stylized behaviors and formalized structures that express the special cultural identity of Japan. We think of ukiyo-e woodblock prints of ladies and gentlemen in bright kimono, smiling and whispering behind their fans, reading and writing poetry, and engaged in political and romantic intrigue in a watery world of manners, expectations, and traditions. But I recently discovered that this Tokyo hides a neglected, seemingly forgotten, network of several rivers — the Arakawa, Sumidagawa, Edogawa, and Tamagawa, — and over 100 natural streams and man-made canals — that wind often invisibly through springs, ponds, , hollows and hills, reservoirs, parks and neighborhoods to which residents have been long indifferent as a coherent, integrated element in the urban topography. But today, a group of passionate urban historians called Suribachi Gakkai (see Recovering Lost Tokyo in The Japan Times), are engaged in advocacy, planning, and public communication toward their restoration as the physical embodiment of memory and a pastoral softening of the hard edges of Tokyo city life. And so the revival begins. I intend to take part, having found a guide to show me by kayak through this vestigial labyrinth of water-ways and by-ways that once were the circulating force of Tokyo, the water city. I intend to paddle quietly in the great noisy city and to listen for the water, for the grace that never flags, that “pouring from ever renewable sources (that) is endless, impartial, and free.”"

As we drove off in a van crammed with way too much stuff, we were given encouraging support from so many people, from ‘you’re so lucky’ to ‘we’re so jealous’ to ‘where will you go to the toilet?’. And they’re right: we are lucky. There’s more privilege wrapped in up in our ability to make this choice than I could go into in one blog post, and I can’t begin to vocalise how grateful I am that we have a crashmat back home if it all goes wrong (please don’t tell my Mam I called her a crashmat). However: there’s one aspect of travelling which I don’t think is talked about enough. Just how constantly, epically, embarrassing it can be. To be clear: I know there are people who travel with style and confidence. Who either speak all the languages, or are confident enough in their ability to use sign language and volume to get their point across. Who stride around new places like they are unmarked territory, awaiting their approval. I am not stylish or confident. Travelling is a lesson in what happens when you’re constantly stumbling around, looking for toilets and not being confident to ask where they are. It’s like being a shy 6 year old again. I am terrified of breaking rules, and constantly worry I’m in a building, or on a pavement where I’m not meant to be. When sitting down for food, I try and watch what everyone else is doing, to make sure I’m not committing some grave cultural sin by holding my fork weird (I always feel like I’m holding my fork weird), or touching a napkin which is for display purposes only. I’ve travelled in a world before smartphones and easy googling and love the fact that you can now quickly check the routes into places, the opening times and how to say ‘I’m sorry I tried to learn more of your language but I’m crumbling under the pressure of saying it to you out loud’ in 40 different ways. Then, of course, you get the rollercoaster of elation when you get something right: when you manoeuvre your way through a day without doing anything terrible and seem to be asleep in the place you’re meant to be. For those travelling who have easy access to their inner-squirmer, or who find shyness a barrier to their happiness, I’d offer these three pieces of advice: Good luck, travellers. If it all gets too much, there is one final thing you can do…bring a book, find a bench and sit. That counts as travelling too."

Medium.com,Life,Life and Death in Tasiilaq,Travel,https://medium.com/@OceanRiverRob/life-and-death-in-tasiilaq-8af3312bc953?source=topic_page---------114------------------1," Tasiilaq on Amassalit Island was our first encounter in East Greenland, having crossed the Denmark Strait in a following sea from Iceland. With a population of about 1,000 people — one of the largest in East Greenland — Tasiilaq rises steeply out of the water. Red, yellow, green, and blue wooden houses pop like dice off a wrinkled carpet of green. There are no trees, no shrubs to hide the concrete foundations that hold structures level above the rise and fall of gray outcropping bedrock. Reminding me of bleached whale bones, dog sleds lie about before houses. Some upright, others tipped on their sides or upside down. Behind houses and out on the hillside are sled dogs. Tawny lion-colored dogs with the broad-shouldered stature of huskies and the long fluffy tails of Bernese Mountain dogs. Two smaller dogs run about us, wagging their tails, barking, and bowing to play. We name them Rough and Ready. I am instantly taken by this attractive community of friendly people and the wildlife. It felt like a step back in time before the industrial age, where life was good with the simple gifts of food, shelter, and companionship. Having gone for many days without cellphone or Internet access, I imagined that I could live happily in the embrace of the likes of this town. But I was wrong. Life is hard because it is the wildlife that sustains the Inuit people, not government housing, nor the amenities the government provides. The animals that the people depend on have moved further away. This vast land is impassible until snow and frost smooths the passage so that dogs can pull sleds once more. The hunting season is curtailed when cold weather arrives later and departs earlier. The weather has also become more erratic. A cold snap snares in an ice hunter returning by kayak. A few hundred feet from the village, his kayak is cemented in a sea that is too solid to paddle through, and too thin to venture out for a rescue. For three days, the town watch him slowly die, helpless on the other side of the fatal expanse of ice. In Tasiilaq, Gedion Qeqe carves exquisite figures from bone. By his skillful hand, he captures what we may cherish when the land is one day gone. A town so picturesque. So colorful, yet ever overcast. What was once thriving wildlife in the vast tundra has diminished and receded. The people of Tasiilaq are paying with their lives while we spend pennies on the gallon of fossil fuel. Our selfish consumption must stop. Nearby in Iceland, they are taking 6,000 tons of carbon from the air, letting microorganisms photosynthesize to produce 4,000 tons of carbon in ethanol to power cars and trucks. Iceland does not want to transport or burn fossil fuels. If workers must live far from work then we should provide them green mass transit for free. We could all then breath a bit easier. The real costs of fossil fuels are too great, too many people have died. Help us put a stop to climate change (click here). You may write for more information: rob@globalwarmingproblemsolvers.com"
Medium.com,Life,I Turned My Passion into My Job,Travel,https://medium.com/the-ascent/i-turned-my-passion-into-my-job-and-it-didnt-go-as-expected-c2c6490b38ed?source=topic_page---------115------------------1," It’s a story we are told over and over again: we should find our passion, work hard to make it our job, and then “we won’t have to work a day in our lives”. But what if this story is completely wrong? My passion is to travel. I discovered it in my late teens, back in the mid 2000’s, in a time when, for the most part, travelling wasn’t a job — at least not in my world, in the small Portuguese town where I lived. So, I went on to make something else my job — I got a degree in communications and started working as a journalist. Luckily, my job allowed me to travel a fair bit but the travel itself was never my job, just a very nice perk I always tried to make the most of. Fast forward to today, travelling sort of became a job. There are more travel writers, bloggers and vloggers than one can ever keep track of. People who get paid to share their experiences of travelling: my dream job — or so I thought. In the Spring of 2018, I was working as a freelancer. I worked from home and had the freedom of time and space to organize my days as I pleased. At the same time, I increasingly started watching travel vloggers’ videos and, having some video editing skills myself, an idea started to form in my mind… It took me about a month to make the decision. During that time, I defined the outline of my project: I wanted to go backpack and make videos about the places from the point of view of the locals. At the same time, I wanted to make other videos explaining the whole process of becoming a travel vlogger — something that I felt was missing online. But I didn’t decide much more. I wanted it to be as spontaneous as possible and I wanted to feel free every day, while I wondered the world with my camera. I booked a one-way ticket from Lisbon to Krakow and off I went. I was super enthusiastic while making my first videos! I walked the streets of several Polish cities with an eagerness and the kind of happiness you get only when you are making your dreams come true. I talked to locals, asked them for their tips, filmed the places they recommended, tried the foods they suggested. As I discovered new places through the lens of my camera, I started to notice that the experience was different from other trips I had done, where I travelled just for the sake of travelling. I didn’t decide where to go and what to do based solely on what I felt like. I had to be at certain places at certain times. I had to learn the history of what I was seeing, just so I could explain it on the videos. I was filtering my experience of taking in the places, when my favourite kind of travel had always been the raw exploration of anywhere and everywhere. But, to my deep disappointment, I came to the realisation that this pillar of myself that I had shaped my identity around was actually… not true. About a month and a half into my trip, I started to get tired of making videos. For another two weeks, I tried a different format of storytelling, based on my travels but not as exhausting, giving me some more freedom. But it still wasn’t fulfilling. I decided to stop the videos, but I kept travelling for another month. I had always believed, with the strongest conviction, that I could spend all my life on the road. I love waking up in a different place every day, I am a pro at living out of a backpack, I have no fear of the unknown and heck, I even love 10-hour long bus rides. But, to my deep disappointment, I came to the realization that this pillar of myself that I had shaped my identity around was actually… not true. How could it be that I turned my passion into my job, and I was unhappy at work? How could it be that the thing that had always given me the most pleasure in life was actually feeling like “too much” and like I had had enough of it? After this 3-month long trip, I settled down. In a new city, one that I visited during my travels. It’s been a year now, and I found a job that has absolutely nothing to do with travelling and that, surprisingly, makes me very happy. I still love to travel, and I do it every time I have a chance. I still love to read about distant places, watch travel vlogs or hear about friends’ travelling stories. My social media feeds are still mostly filled with travel related content. I still find myself looking at the world map for hours at a time. Travelling is still my passion. But I learnt, the hard way, that making your passion into your job takes all the passion away from it. And I don’t want my love for travel to go away — that’s why I will work every day of my life just so I can use every single bit of my free time doing what I love the most.

Medium.com,Life,5 Things you can do to lower your carbon footprint while traveling,Travel,https://medium.com/@mmckinley/5-things-you-can-do-to-lower-your-carbon-footprint-while-traveling-3f7cf3116c4e?source=topic_page---------116------------------1," While I preach green living and even how to travel more sustainably, it’s not the most sustainable to be traveling, especially on long-haul flights. I honestly never really thought about it until recently. Traveling is something I have loved for years. I love just getting up and going somewhere new, I love planning a trip for over a year, I love quickly planning out a trip, I love exploring new places, I love going on a trip AT LEAST once a year. But, all of that isn’t sustainable. Because my trips aren’t to the beach only an hour away. They’re often to Europe, 8 hours by plane. Plus, two more hours to get to a big enough airport that flies directly to a European city. That’s a lot of carbon being emitted into the air just so I can feel fancy in a new place. Although I don’t think I’ll ever be able to stop visiting Paris, and I’m always looking for new places to explore, I’ve decided that after my next two big trips I’ll be focusing on smaller ones that won’t break the bank and that will have a much smaller carbon footprint. I like to be honest with myself and I know I’ll still be traveling, especially to Paris, but I’m hoping that by adopting this new way of thinking, that if I only get to go on a long-haul trip every two years, that’s okay. Here’s what I’ll be doing instead: Be a Tourist in my Own City
It’s funny, but you rarely care much about the city you’re in. You’re always looking for bigger and better things out there that are much more exciting than where you’ve been born and raised. Except, I’ve slowly been exploring my city, and I have to say, Winnipeg is pretty cool. I know, I know, no one ever says that. But, we’re full of culture and full of amazing restaurants. We even have our own major tourist attraction: The Museum for Human Rights, a place I haven’t yet been to! There are so many cool things in my city, and in surrounding communities that I’ve been missing simply because I think that Madrid or London is going to be better. Here’s a secret: foreign cities are only fun for a couple of days. After that, they’re simply cities. If you’ve found one that speaks to your soul (like my love for Paris) and that’s where you feel at home, then that’s amazing. But, I bet you’ve felt the same way I have. A few tourist attractions were neat, some weren’t, and it’s busy and loud and dirty. Aka a city. Find those tourist attractions in your own city, those hidden gems people talk about in places like Amsterdam or Zurich. Find them in your own city, without leaving a huge carbon footprint behind. Travel by Train
This is two-fold. I’ve never traveled by train in Canada and it’s something I’ve wanted to do for so long! Instead of driving, or flying, I’m hoping to find a good deal on train travel and explore more of home. And, then, I’m going to train A LOT more when abroad. Most people probably do this already as it is a pretty affordable way to travel. But, when you’re crunched for time, grabbing a flight and shaving 4–5 hours off of your journey is sometimes the best option. But, planes aren’t the easiest on the environment. I’m going to try to take the train a lot more once I arrive at my destination. It’ll save me money, I get to see a little bit more of the country-side and tiny, adorable towns and villages dotting the way and it’ll be a much greener option. Travel Longer
If I’m going to use the train a lot more, I’ll need to be staying overseas for a lot longer. I always wanted to jet off to Paris or London for a few days, do some shopping, eat some great food, and then head back without using too many vacation days. So far, I haven’t had enough money to casually jet off to Europe, instead, opting for 2–4 weeks vacations. As much fun as it sounds to be such a cool jet-setter, I’m going to continue on with my trend of staying for weeks at a time in a place. It’s way easier to see more, stopping you from coming back for another trip, and it feels amazing to be in one country, or even region, for weeks at a time. Some of you may not be able to swing 4 weeks vacation all at once, and that’s fair! Sometimes, you have to start small and work your way up. Or, use other options, like the ones listed in this post here and here. See your own Country
I don’t know where you’re reading from, but my country is huge. There is so much to see in Canada that, after 30 years of living here, I haven’t seen it all. Granted, I haven’t tried to see it all much like I do when I’m traveling abroad, but you’d think that I would’ve gotten pretty far in 30 years. Nope. I’ve seen places from B.C. to Quebec City, but I haven’t gone further and I haven’t gone up North. I always viewed seeing my own country as a family type of excursion, a bit of disdain dripping from my voice anytime I mention traveling locally. And, I still think of it as a family type of trip. It’s easier to pack up a camper and head out West than to get a passport for a baby and/or pay for extra plane tickets for children who aren’t yet going to appreciate seeing the world. But, I’m tired of thinking that way. There are so many cool places I want to see in Canada, but haven’t the time or money to spend because I’m busy flying everywhere else. Research More
I ranted about how you shouldn’t go to regular resorts or cruises, but what about all the things in between? While I usually book apartments when traveling, there are times when a hotel will be better suited or is the only thing available. Instead of looking for the best deal on the fanciest hotel I can find, I’m going to add sustainable practices to my list of must-haves. And, research a little more to make sure that the ‘eco-friendly’ hotel/resort is actually eco-friendly AND that they’re not involved with anything shady on the side.While it’s always a good practice to stay away from wildlife tourism, ESPECIALLY without doing mass amounts of research first, it’s not on this list because it’s something I’ve been regularly doing for years. When it comes to animal treatment abroad, we all have to begin with education and learn that pictures aren’t worth the price of an animal’s safety and well-being. It’ll be hard to get everything right every time, but it’s okay. Baby steps and learning to travel better, for everyone involved, is what we all need to do. Instead of just going to a city to see the sights, try seeing it from a locals eyes. Instead of buying up the cutest clothing and souvenirs in big stores, try supporting locals in their craft. I absolutely love perusing markets when abroad and finding those one-of-a-kind items. And, things like this: There are so many little things we can do to make traveling a more sustainable and enjoyable experience. It doesn’t matter if you incorporate one, or all them, as long as you’re changing bad habits for good ones. What’s your sustainable go-to’s when traveling?"

It’s likely. I’ve told a lot of people. Some of them even put up a brave effort to pretend they cared. Actually, it wasn’t only a bracket. That’d be ridiculous. Even I wouldn’t pay that much money for a piece of plastic with no real function. There was also a sheet of paper that came with it. The paper was a form-type certificate, indicating that one or more people — none of whom I had ever met — were officially notifying me that I had ridden over a thousand miles on my motorcycle in less than 24 hours. Of course, I already knew that. Yeah, I know. Looking at it in print, none of it sounds like the sum of a particularly intelligent thought process to me, either. But, like so many poorly-made decisions that end up generating great stories later, it seemed like a good idea at the time. It started when my best riding friend said it out loud. Here, for the sake of clarity, is a good place to add a little background. We have this thing we do, my friend and I. Talking about potential adventures is fine. Dreaming of traversing the rugged, rock-strewn Dalton highway in Alaska, hammering coast-to-coast in some insanely short amount of time, spending a week exploring the old-growth forests and craggy coastline of the Pacific Northwest…those are things we talk about whenever the conversation drifts toward motorcycles. Which is pretty much most of the time. But if one of us declares something — if somebody actually says, out loud, that we will do something — it must happen. Bridges are burned, shore lines are untied, cut up and thrown into the sea, wives are notified. There is no going back from it. Our deal is that what is said cannot be unsaid. We’re normal guys, with families and jobs, so usually, (though I’ve done nothing to prevent it sounding that way) it doesn’t happen in quite the “damn-the-torpedos” fashion I’m insinuating. It’s not nearly that glamorous. Planning proceeds slowly, and usually well in advance. We hint around about it at work, check our schedules, double-check with our wives that we aren’t overlooking something unforgivable, look at maps and weather forecasts. Then the day comes, after the ‘T’s are crossed and the gutters are cleaned out, that we officially say we’re leaving. This time was different. We were driving to Starbucks — the wellspring of so much of our genius — and just talking normally. Bikes, of course. Weather, chainsaws, politics. Innocuous, average stuff. But then my friend just says it. Casually. Like he was telling me he needed to stop at the hardware store or that he had a hamburger for lunch. He says we’re riding a thousand miles in 24 hours or less. An “iron butt”, he called it. What a horrible name. As soon as the words left his mouth, there was an awkward silence, like one of us just urinated in his pants in a crowded elevator. Neither one of us could believe he had broken protocol by not slowly leading up to an idea, but there it was. We had it to do, and we would leave in a week or two. The Iron Butt Association, despite how it sounds, is a bona fide, honest-to-goodness, legitimately recognized organization. The rides and rallies they certify are the de-facto benchmarks for long-distance riders — a fringe sub-group of the larger class of motorcyclists. The Iron Butt Rally, held every two years, is, to the uninitiated, a bizarre suffer-fest of ridiculous proportions: To finish the rally, the rider must ride at least 11,000 miles in 11 days. Points must be earned by hitting checkpoints, and extra points are added by completing mind-numbing rides-within-the ride, so most finishers actually ride much further than the 11,000 mile minimum. No consideration is given for weather. Or breakdowns. Or being late to a checkpoint. You may have just ridden from Boston to Colorado Springs to pick up the bonus, but if you’re one second late, it’s all for nothing. No points are awarded. You rode all that way just to burn gas. It’s not so terribly difficult to see why fewer than 600 people have ever finished an Iron Butt Rally. But the Iron Butt Rally is the domain of nut jobs and the psychologically deficient. And they’re proud of it. For the rest of us, the IBA certifies more realistic rides, too. That’s why many riders refer to riding 1000 miles in 24 hours as an “iron butt”, because it’s the shortest ride one can complete to receive credentials from the association. Looking at the map, the most direct route to ride an unbroken thousand-miler from my home in eastern Illinois, is to head straight west on Interstate 70, through western Illinois, Missouri, Kansas and Colorado. So that’s what we did. In hopes of arriving at our destination with some daylight remaining, we left at 2:30 AM. Departure and arrival times require verification from a third-party observer, so Corky (that’s what it says on my time sheet) at the gas station finished his contribution to the day’s ride with a signature. We thanked him, and made a left turn into the blackness to finish ours. We were through St. Louis, 150 miles away, before daylight. We watched the sun come up over the Missouri farm country, cut through blistering wind in 104 degree heat across Kansas, became ensnarled in rush-hour traffic in Denver. But then, just like that, we were there. “There”, in this case, was Silverthorne, Colorado. The sun was long gone behind the mountains, but it wasn’t yet dark when we arrived. We found a gas station, thanked “Greg” for his autograph, and that was it. I mean, that really was it. Sure, we got a little sore. We were ready to get off by the end. We couldn’t sit around and talk at fuel stops because we were on a tight schedule, but we had Bluetooth headsets in our helmets, which allowed us to talk ourselves hoarse while on the move, anyway. It was actually pretty easy. You might think from the trip summary, that the whole thing was hugely anticlimactic. A waste of time, fuel and tires. It wasn’t. Not even a little. As surprised as we were at how quickly the time passed, at the utter lack of exhaustion we felt at the end, we were even more taken aback by the elation. The feeling of accomplishment, like we had flung ourselves through the gauntlet and shown that we were it’s match. But why? Why, when it was so uneventful, so seemingly without purpose, was the psychological reward so disproportionate? Anyone who can sit still for awhile, and who doesn’t mind a little boredom could do it. Seriously. Anyone could do it. But I think that was part of it, for us: Just because anyone could do it, doesn’t mean that just anyone does. Not everyone decides to do something, just to see what it would be like. Not everyone climbs the wall — even the short one — to see what the other side is all about. The world shrinks, when you push yourself a little. Places that once seemed so far away, now feel like the next town over. We left our homes in small-town Illinois in the morning, only to eat steak in the Rockies on the same day. Without ever entering an airport. We breathed fresh air, watching — and feeling — the world go by, for a thousand miles. That fact opened up possibilities we hadn’t even considered before. We could tour Yellowstone, Glacier, The Four Corners and Mesa Verde again. Only now, we could do it all on the same trip, if we wanted. The distance was, of course, the same as it had always been. Our perception of it would never be so again. That’s why I’m glad we do that thing. That “saying it out loud” thing. Not only does it put second-thoughts in their rightful place, it puts me in a mindset that makes more things seem possible. A thousand miles is a long way, if one only plans to ride a hundred. So that license plate frame…it’s hanging in my garage now. I’ve since sold my bike, under pressure from distracted drivers and errant deer. The funny thing about age, is that you have fewer years left to live than when you were young, which often leads one to become more cautious with them. But that ride really never had much to do with motorcycling. To me, it’s a reminder of the places I have yet to go and the things I have left to do, and that I will do what it takes to get there."
Medium.com,Life,5 Ways to Reduce Your In-Flight Guilt,Travel,https://medium.com/@janmflynn1537/5-ways-to-reduce-your-in-flight-guilt-65f9ac262840?source=topic_page---------121------------------1," I love travel. There’s nothing like getting my feet on the ground someplace that is distant from my daily environs, whether geographically or culturally or both, to recharge my sense of wonder and bring home to me what a spectacular and multifaceted little gem of a planet we all share. When home, I live in the western U.S.A. where cities are spread across vast stretches of land. Train service, compared to the East, is comparatively spotty and clumsy. Add to that the fact that my adult children live four states away. Also, one of them is a pilot for a major airline. So I fly. Not terrifically often, and rarely for work these days, but at least every couple of months. And while I am as alarmed as any thinking person should be about our heading collectively toward the tipping point of climate chaos, I keep boarding planes. I regard airplanes as everyday miracles. How it is that a monstrously heavy metal tube, full of people and luggage and pretzels, can lift off the ground at all is something that quietly astounds me — every time I think about it, while I’m ignoring the flight attendant’s ritual recitation of the safety instructions. And sometimes, when I catch myself feeling bored on a flight or irritated that my seat back won’t recline more than an inch, I remind myself that I am sitting in an armchair 30,000 feet above the ground, moving at hundreds of miles an hour. Little old middle-class, risk-averse me is thus able to experience parts of the world that until the last century would have taken weeks or months to reach, and many of which were off-limits to all but the extremely hardy or the fabulously wealthy. And my kids and I can visit each other. But there’s a dark side to the magic of human flight. It takes a whole lot of energy to get a plane airborne, loft it up and over a mountain range or a continent or an ocean, and set it back down where you can text your Lyft driver. If you fly at all, there’s no getting around the fact that by doing so you’re making a significant contribution to the gases that are warming our planet so disastrously. So, how to square your love of/need for air travel with your nagging environmental conscience? It may not be possible to entirely erase your stinky carbon footprint, but there are ways to lighten its effect. Beyond saving you the exquisite torture of waiting for your bag to be hurled forth onto the carousel of checked luggage, lightening up your load means a lighter plane. And lighter planes take less fuel. It’s as simple as that. Roll up your multi-purpose clothing and find a pair of shoes that will work for your whole trip, and enjoy. Not to be crude, but the more butts an airplane can fit inside itself, the less fuel it has to use per buttload. I know what you’re thinking: the first-class compartment is going with the rest of the plane anyway, so how does my wadding myself into a cramped seat help anything? Yes, it would be lovely to stretch out on one of those decadent in-flight beds, or at least to pop for business class, but doing so only creates more demand for fewer seats and thus less fuel efficiency. Cozy up to your fellow travelers and tough it out. You’re experiencing a miracle, remember? I’m not going to name names here, but when it comes to fuel efficiency and sustainability, there are airlines and then there are airlines. A German organization, atmosfair, provides an index of the 200 largest airlines ranked according to their carbon efficiency. It’s worth considering the carbon cost of your trip: sometimes the cheapest ticket isn’t really cheap, you know what I mean? Some airlines, like United, are using biofuels for at least some of their flights, and that’s a good thing to encourage. Also, United is one of several carriers that have programs that allow you to make charitable donations to organizations that conduct carbon reduction projects, like planting trees in Peru, when you book your ticket. It’s another good thing to encourage. Which leads us to the next tip: Again, some airlines make it possible for you to purchase carbon offsets when you book your ticket, though you may have to do some digging and extra clicking. You can also check websites such as Carbonfund.org that allow you to calculate the carbon load of your trip and figure out how to mitigate it by making a targeted purchase or donation. No, you don’t have to shell out the same amount you did for your ticket. For a round trip flight across the U.S., you’re looking at maybe $10 to $12. Bring along a reusable water bottle (filled, of course, after you’ve cleared security) and eschew the little plastic cups on board. Favor hotels that have wall-mounted shampoo and shower gel dispensers instead of those horrid teensy bottles that each hold about one morning’s worth of ablutions before becoming part of a gigantic floating island of plastic waste somewhere in our oceans. There are many things you can do to lighten your impact once you get where you’re going. So do them. Be at least as respectful of the country or region where you’re a guest as you would be if you were staying at your in-laws’ house for the holidays. Maybe more respectful than that. None of these methods are all that heroic or dramatic or particularly sacrificial. But if we all did them each time we traveled by air, it would make a difference. After all, whether in the air or on the ground, we’re all in this together. Safe travels, my friend. You might also like:"

Given the stiff competition — Table Mountain, Robben Island, District Six, Victoria and Alfred Waterfront, the plants must be pretty stunning and indeed they are. I had the good fortune to go in October, spring in the Southern Hemisphere and the flowers were in full bloom, very different flowers than I have seen anywhere else in the world. Did you know that the small tip of the Cape Peninsula (not even all of South Africa) is home to one of the 6 floral kingdoms of the world? The other 5 are the size of continents or bigger! It also has the most biodiversity per square inch of any place in the world. It represents less than 0.04% of the Earth’s surface, but is home to 3% of the world’s species of flowering plants. It has been designated a UNESCO protected area, but sadly, many of the estimated 9000 plant species in the region are under threat."
Medium.com,Life,That Time We Paid Spa Prices for a Prison Experience,Travel,https://medium.com/lela-life-education-literature-arts/that-time-we-paid-spa-prices-for-a-prison-experience-bd4fb8d42147?source=topic_page---------123------------------1," My mom wanted a spa weekend for her 75th birthday. Since you do not deny a 75-year-old black woman anything she wants, especially for her birthday, my aunt flew in from Chicago to meet me in St. Louis. We flew into Oklahoma to meet my mom. Then the three of us drove to Texas to meet her friend at our hotel at Spa Castle. That name sounds simultaneously decadent and medieval — and a wee bit terrifying. What part of the castle would we be in? The dungeon? Would we race across the parapet in death-defying maneuvers, like Robin Hood? Would we wait behind arrowslits spying on the enemies encamped beyond the moat with their catapults and flaming projectiles? Would we have to build a battering ram and storm the castle to even get in? Ever since I learned the difference between a castle and a palace on my trip to Vienna, my imagination runs wild whenever castles enter the conversation, which is suprisingly frequent. So imagine my disappointment when we arrived to find only a hotel, which didn’t look like a castle at all — not a palace, not even a turret. Nevertheless, we checked in and planned our spa activities for the weekend, beginning with a group massage that evening. We went to our room to stow our bags before our services, and our adventure began. The lights came on when we opened the door, which was great, especially since as soon as we opened the door we were met by an unexpected stairwell. We hadn’t signed up for any sort of lofted room, but we trudged up the stairs with our gear, anyway. Getting one 40-something, three 70-somethings, and all of our bags (yes, lots of bags — we traveled not just with clothes and toiletries but also with car snacks, hotel snacks, cakes, beverages, and a vase of flowers) up those steep stairs took some time. And just as I reached the top, the lights cut out. In a moment, the glow from our phones illuminated the stairwell, and I spied on the wall at the top of the stairs what looked like a keycard lock you would find on the outside of a hotel room door. I stuck in my keycard hoping for the best, and power returned to the room. My husband tells me that only having power when your keycard is inserted into a device is common around the world, but I had never seen it before. I understand how this is probably a great way to save energy, but it was the first of several occurrences that left me feeling powerless as Spa Castle. The concept of castle always transports me back to Vienna, where I learned that palaces are sumptuous city residences while castles, also residences, are built to be defensible. Castles discourage unwanted entry by employing defensive building design and fortifications. Castles are usually made of strong materials, such as stone, and placed high for maximum visibility. They have ramparts patrolled by guards and heavily defended main gates. Some even have moats. You know what else has all of these same castle elements? Alcatraz. Is it a residence? Check. Is it built of strong materials? Check. Is it on high ground? Check. Does it have heavily defended ramparts and gates? Check and check. Does it have a moat? Check — Hello San Francisco Bay! Yes, Alcatraz, one of the world’s most infamous prisons, is a castle designed not so much to keep people out, but rather to keep people in. And the longer we stayed at Spa Castle, the more I understood why it was called a castle — to cleverly disguise its true identity as a sort of prison. The prisonification of our spa weekend began as soon as we checked in for services and were stripped of our identities. We each received numbered wristbands that we had to wear at all times in the spa, to scan for entry and exit and to receive services. For the rest of our stay, no one in the spa referred to me by my name, only my number — 237629. I held my wristband to the scanner to unlock the turnstile to enter the spa section of the building, but not the spa itself. After passing through a metal detector, I noticed the male and female populations herded in different directions. I joined the appropriate line and walked to the women’s entrance to the spa. This entrance led to an anteroom, but before entering, I had to remove my shoes and socks. Several of us lined the walls removing our footwear; we didn’t even have benches to sit on while we did so. Upon entering the anteroom, I had to find a locker whose number corresponded to my wristband. I found the tiny locker on the lower tier of the locker bank, crouched down to its level, waved my wrist in front of it, and heard it click open. I placed my footwear into the aptly named shoe locker, rejoined the line, and shuffled my way to the processing desk. At the desk, a brusque woman demanded my wrist, scanned my band, and issued me a uniform. Not to any one of us in particular, the woman repeated her instructional mantra at regular intervals and pointed to the board of printed instructions when not scanning wristbands: Take off all of your clothes, including underwear; put on your uniform; wear your uniform at all times, unless in the pool area; shower before receiving services. This is a barefoot spa — no shoes or socks allowed. Follow all posted signs. I followed my line to a bay of larger lockers, where we all stripped down, totally devoid of privacy, donned our uniforms, scanned our wristbands, and clicked open our lockers to store our civilian attire. My mom, aunt, and friend cheated, though. We didn’t shower before heading off to our group massage. We stuck it to the man and giggled about our infraction as we left the dungeon for the elevator to the main spa level. “237629?” It took me a moment to realize I was supposed to respond to my number being called rather than my name. The woman, agitated, repeated herself and beckoned me to check in for my massage. I waved my arm over the scanner and was led to one of four tables lined up in a semi-private room. Fortunately I knew the three ladies sharing the room with me, as I had grown up with all of them, and I thanked God we were all able to book the same massage time. I had seen enough of strangers in all their glory for one day. After our massages we descended back down to holding, waved wristbands by our lockers. Click. Put on our civvies, marched to our shoe lockers. Click. We walked to the door holding our footwear, paused immediately after exiting the spa to put on our socks and shoes, and walked to the exit turnstile. Waving our wristbands to gain egress, we re-entered the world as civilians. And that ended Day 1. Day 2 began the same way as Day 1. Days run together in Spa Castle. Enter holding. Wave your wristband. Click. Open your locker. Stow your shoes. Get back in line. Grab your uniform. Wave your wristband. Click. We changed up our routine on Day 2; however, as we set off to the mandatory shower and the pool. The inner pool resided in the women’s section and was a woman’s only nude pool. The outer pool, where we went, was for the mixed gender general population, where we wore our own bathing suits and told ourselves we were free to act according to the dictates of our hearts. We dipped into one of several hot tubs, but it was just hot. There weren’t any bubbles to whisk away our tension. We looked around for a timer and never found one, but what we did find was a button to depress for jets of water. To keep the jets coming, one person in our party had to get out of the hot tub to press the button every 5 minutes. Life on the inside was better with a crew, and we staked our claim to that hot tub staring down any would-be interlopers. Only when we were good and ready did we leave the pool area and re-enter the all-female zone. The posted sign limited us to two towels each, which seemed reasonable, until we saw the towels — hand towels. Each person was only allowed two hand towels for the day. Another sign also forbade us from ascending to the spa area proper while still wet. We did the best we could. Throughout the rest of the day, I answered to my number, scanned for my services and my food, and learned to sign for a tip before the services even ended. That’s how they hooked you. They held up your services until you signed for their tip. I thought it was a fluke when the night before, mid-massage, my therapist stopped, presented me with a receipt to sign for a tip, and then continued my service. But that was no fluke; that was standard operating practice in the Castle. My last service of the day was a manicure, where with wet nails, I had to sign for the tip before they would put my hands under the dryer. My nails didn’t dry all the way, and I ruined my manicure when I clicked access into my locker and changed into my civvies. I didn’t even care. I was ready to go and not hear the click of a lock again for a long time. We finally emerged as civilians and ended Day 2, thankful that no Day 3 waited for us. My mom ended up having a fantastic birthday weekend. We laughed through all of our experiences and have some pretty funny selfies to prove it. I would definitely do another spa weekend someday, but I’ll look for a Spa Palace instead."

Medium.com,Life,Complete Guide to Traditional Dress of UAE for Men and Women,Travel,https://medium.com/@shamalkareem39/complete-guide-to-traditional-dress-of-uae-for-men-and-women-a882eee60524?source=topic_page---------125------------------1," Traditional dress is a symbol of culture and honor for the Emiratis. It has deep roots in their culture and religion. You will rarely find Emirati wearing western clothes when they are in the UAE as they take immense pride in their traditions. Although the whole of the Arabian peninsula has similarities in clothes, there are several minor differences. Some of them are obvious, while others, only a trained eye can catch. Emirati clothing emphasizes on modesty. Let’s have a look at the different clothing items used by men and women in the United Arab Emirates. Click here to read about traditional food of the UAE. The traditional dress of Emirati men is a Dishdasha or a Kandura. This is a single piece ankle-length garment. In their homes, they sometimes wear half sleeved Kanduras, but formal Kanduras are always full-sleeved. Emirati Kanduras are mostly white though there are other variations like brown, beige, grey, etc. In Saudi Arabia, the Kandura is also called a Thawb. Their style varies from country to country. You can distinguish Emirati Kanduras from others because Emirati ones are collarless and have unobtrusive embroidery on the sleeves. Another distinguishing factor of is the long twisted piece of cloth with a tassel at the end. This ornament made of the same material as the Kandura which dangles out of Kandura’s neck is called Al Farukhah. Emirati men wear Gutra as the headdress. It is an integral part of their traditional Emirati clothing. Gutra, which is a square piece of scarf, protects their head and face from the scorching heat of the desert. They would also cover their faces with it when the dust is too high. Agal is used to hold the Gutra on the head. There is another variation to Gutra called Shemagh. While Gutras are made of white cotton with a smooth finish, Shemags have red checks on the white. Originally from the central part of the Arabian peninsula, it has also spread to other neighboring regions. You can find similarities in headdresses worn in countries like UAE, Saudi, Kuwait, etc. Oman and Yemen have a completely different type of head covering which looks more like an Indian Turban. There are so many ways to style the Gutra. Men wear Gutras depending on the occasion, age, and social status of the person. Young men mostly wear the Shemagh than the Gutra. They also tie the Shemaghs around the head instead of wearing an Agal. This style is called Hamdaniyya. The Kufi cap, or Taqiyah, worn under the Gutra and Shemagh is also a part of the UAE traditional dress. An Agal (Iqal/Eqal depending on the dialect) is the black rope-like band placed over the head to hold the Gutra in place. It is one large circular band which is folded to form two rings when it is worn. Agals are not worn in casual settings. But for formal occasions, Agal cannot be missed out. Besides the functional part of holding the Gutra in place, they are also an aesthetic element. Emirati agals have two cords (Tarbousha) hanging at the back or have two cords that become one with a few tassels at the end. The number of cords differs between countries. Like, Saudi agals usually do not have these cords, and Qatari agals have four. Perfuming the agals is also part of the custom. Sometimes you may come across white agals, usually worn by religious scholars. There are also decorative agals that are multicolored and comes with more than two rings. These agals resemble a crown when worn over the head, although these aren’t in fashion nowadays. Agals were also used to tie the legs of the camel to pin it down to the ground. The most expensive agals are those made of Iraqi wool, and more affordable ones are made of synthetic yarn. Also dubbed ‘wing of the Arab’, Bisht is the common factor that connects all of the Arab cultures. It has been used by them for thousands of years. Unlike all other pieces of traditional Emirati clothing, the Bisht is quite similar across all Arab countries. It is a ceremonial sleeveless cloak worn over the Kandura that are either black or beige and trimmed with golden or silver embroideries. The African Burnous is a cultural adaptation of the Bisht. Bishts are decorated with gold, silver, or copper. Fore that reason, the prize of the Bisht depends on the amount of gold or silver used in it. The intricate Embroidering requires the hands of a skilled artisan. Bisht, therefore, is a luxurious garment that can be very expensive, costing as much as 15,000 Dhs. Because this is worn on top of the Kandura, some people mistakenly think that this is winter-wear. Though, in the past, the Bedouins used Bisht in winter to combat the cold, nowadays it is used for special occasions. Hand made soft woolen Bishts are the most prized among all. Those made of camel wool are also prestigious. When you go to shopping malls and see one displayed on the shopfront, that’s probably made of cotton or polyester. Thick ones are from cotton or wool while the light see-through ones are of linen. Persian traders brought the Bisht to the Arab world. The word ‘Bisht’, which itself has Persian roots, means ‘something that is worn on the back. Even though the Bisht has two sleeves, usually it is worn with only one arm. In the past, everyone wore the Bisht regardless of the occasion or position. Nowadays, but, Bisht is something that is worn by Emirati men on ceremonies, graduations, and eid or by the royalty. And Emirati grooms wear Bisht for the wedding. You may come across Imams in the UAE mosques donning a Bisht during prayer congregations and Friday sermons. A white vest called Faneela is worn beneath the Kandura. Woozar, which is another piece of undergarment, is tied around the waist. Traditional footwear for Emirati men is called Na-aal, which is a sandal worn without socks. While the traditional outfit of Emirati men are mostly white and sometimes shades of light colors, the women wear black. The traditional outfit of Emirati women is Abaya. An elegant loose fitting flowing black cloak. The Abaya is always worn on top of other clothes. Underneath the cloak, women wear traditional or western clothes. The dark cloak also helps hide the bright colored clothes. Abaya is not a garment exclusive to Emirati women. Most of the Islamic world, including North Africa and Asia, has adopted this as a part of their Islamic custom. Abaya covers every part of the body from neck to bottom except for the feet and palms. Traditional Abayas are plain black. Modern Abayas festooned with simple embroidery designs are in vogue nowadays apart from plain grey and brown shades. Although materials like cotton and linen are used to make to suit the hot desert climate, the most popular material for Abayas is crepe. You can easily come across an Abaya designed by famous fashion brands like Chanel or Dior in shopping malls. When Arab women are within the household or among female relatives, they wear a Kaftan, otherwise called a Jalabiya. Kaftans are highly decorated with embroideries and come in a plethora of colors. A Kaftan is, in fact, a female version of the Kandura. Instead of the men’s white Kandura, women wear those with more feminine designs and colors. Loose pants called Sirwal is worn along with Kaftan. Hijab is the umbrella term covering different types of headdresses worn by Muslim women. The Hijab covers the neck and hair according to Islamic teachings. There are numerous hijab styles which we will talk about soon. Very light material which allows for aeration is used to make the headdress. Both headdresses and face veil comes under the Hijab. Shyla is a black scarf which is loosely draped around the head covering the hair. Some women also cover their face with light see-through fabric draped over their faces. It is a face veil which covers most of the face except the eyes. Emirati Burqas are different from those in South Asian countries. They have a distinctive look and are worn like a mask. Burqa is traditionally made of a special type of cloth unlike the main headscarf. At first sight, the Burqa looks like they are made of metal, but it is a special lightweight and sweat absorbing cloth. These burqas are of red, yellow and green colors among which the red ones are the most expensive while green a tad cheaper. A small piece of wood keeps the Burqa in shape and bridges over the nose without actually touching the face. Burqa is tied to the back of the head with white cotton strings. In the olden times, every woman made their burqas by hand. Burqas were worn by girls once they pass the age of puberty. The original idea of it was to provide modesty for women. Some women wear Burqas for special occasions as part of the culture. The younger generation of Emirati women only wear traditional Burqa for wedding ceremonies. There are a few ways to explore the old traditions of the Arabs in Dubai. A desert safari is one of them. The safari takes you to the desert and to the camp that is modeled like a Bedouin house. The camp lets you live like the Bedouin Arabs for a while. You can dress up in the traditional Emirati clothes, smoke Shisha, ride the camel, and many more."
Medium.com,Life,Chronicles of Economy Class,Travel,https://medium.com/@suchaeta/chronicles-of-suchaeta-d63c20e46c1c?source=topic_page---------126------------------1," A slice of my life: narrative style. For our first adventure, the goal is trying to survive the journey. You don’t suffer from claustrophobia. This is what I mutter to myself as I shuffle through the narrow aisle of the airplane, feeling the walls closing in. My overfilled silver carry-on was certified to fit in the overhead, but clearly no research had been done to ensure that it wouldn’t hit people as I made my way to my seat. I mutter apologies under my breath, becoming increasingly sweaty and desperate to find my seat; unfortunately, as usual, I am in the of one of the last rows of the plane. I glance over at the parents cooing at their baby in their gigantic, first class seats. The family was, of course, already comfortably seated, luggage stowed away. They were blessed with the chance to board earlier than other passengers, and had snagged the best seats on the flight. The baby stares smugly at me and my suitcase. It’s like the kid knows I only bought the bag because there was a sale at Costco. An air attendant’s voice booms over my head; the flight was booked to capacity, meaning that my chances of being moved next to that lucky baby was approximately zero. As I cross the emergency exit row, I notice empty space in the overhead. A glorious stretch of space, destined to hold my suitcase. I prepare myself to haul my suitcase over my shoulder into the overhead shelf. Unfortunately, I have the arms of a rag doll. I can barely lift my suitcase past my waist, let alone throw it above me. I pull at my stupid, glorified duffel bag, losing layers of my pride with each tug. I should have gone to that weight training class at the gym.Who am I kidding, I could barely lift the bar by itself. I can feel eyes rolling at me and impatient muttering. I consider leaving the flight. I glance around pathetically, resorting to search for a saviour with incredible arm strength. The flight attendent squeezes through the aisle to save me. She lifts my suitcase with one arm and stows it away in less than a minute. You go, girl. I whisper a mortified thank you and continue making my way to the back of the plane with my head down. I really need to start lifting. At last, I reach my seat. I don’t even care that it’s a middle seat anymore–my concern faded a couple rows back when I exposed myself as the weak, noodle-armed peasant that I am. In the aisle seat is a balding, middle-aged man in a suit, wearing a surly expression that said ‘I booked my tickets late but I was born a first-class flyer.’ He gets out of his seat to let me through…a gentlemen at heart? Okay, maybe I misjudged him. I swallow my thoughts as the man then proceeds to lean onto his right armrest–aka MY left armrest–with his elbow jutting into the side of my arm. I scoot closer to the person on my right, a woman with curly blonde hair. She’s fast asleep against the window, her thick hair probably muffling the hum of the plane, swaddled in a blanket that seems to be made out of clouds. She made herself a luxury experience. I bitterly reflect on my decision to forgo the plush, polka-dotted neck pillow I had seen in the airport giftshop. Luckily, the monotone voice of the flight attendant–yes, the one with the arms of steel–soon puts me in a blissful sleep. Yeah, I wish the story ended there, peacefully. But half an hour into my wonderful nap, I woke up to shrill screaming near the front of the plane. The baby apparently was not a fan of first-class flying."

Medium.com,Life,The Places that Sustain Us,Travel,https://medium.com/one-table-one-world/the-places-that-sustain-us-3fd98e24789d?source=topic_page---------129------------------1," There are so many wonderful places in this world, and it’s hard not to long to see some of them at least once. If you are like me, your bucket list of places to visit is longer than any one life could accommodate. And yet, the older I get, the more I realize that the places I really want to be are the ones I have been to over and over again. While I would love to see Ireland and Paris and Tuscany, what I really want to do is sleep in a tent on an island off the coast of Georgia, USA. Every time I board the ferry to the island, I feel the layers of stress and worry sloughing off and falling into the water, washed away in the wake of the boat. The days we spend on the island are filled with nothing more than beach-combing, swimming, hiking, writing, reading, and napping. Sunrises and sunsets, sparkling light through the majestic live oaks, air scented with salt spray and wax myrtle, and abundant shore birds are all part of the magic of the island. Simple meals, sleeping in a tent, cold showers and minimal creature comforts remind us that we don’t need much to live well — we just think we do. When it starts to rain, you head for the tent with a good book and a flask of bourbon and you read without guilt. There is nothing else to do, nowhere else to be and no one calling to disturb your quietude, because the cell phone coverage is spotty. When the rain stops, we take the rain fly off the tent and lie there looking up at the sky. The tree above the tent looks like a giant praying mantis (to me) or Bugs Bunny (to my husband.) A pileated woodpecker visits the live oak in our campsite and chisels a hole in the tree. The armadillo snuffles through the site looking for grubs, showing little concern for the humans that are 10 feet away from him. We swim with the sharks, unknowingly, until a young fisherman catches a small one and informs us that there was a whole shiver of them right in front of us. Oh! You mean that was not a dolphin that I saw? Now it is me that shivers. (A group of sharks is really called a shiver!) Sitting behind a dune, we escape the wind and trap the warmth of the sun. We eat our lunch; I write, my husband explores. Then he takes a dip into waters that are rougher than the day before. That’s okay, I say. You can take your chances with the shiver of sharks. I think I will sit here and write. We come to this island to be restored. We find solace in the beauty and wildness of the mostly uninhabited island. We get quiet, we slow down, we hear our “soul whispers,” the ones we sometimes miss in the rush and bustle of our daily lives. We come here to process the difficulties, the griefs, the losses and the sorrows. We also come to remember. To remember what matters, why we are here, who we are. Cumberland Island restores us to ourselves. I hope someday to walk the green swards of Ireland, to taste the wines in sunny Tuscany and to imbibe the magic of Paris. But it is this humble, glorious, wild island that holds a piece of my heart. It is where I want to be when things go off the rails in my life. It is the place I go to gather all of myself back up and knit myself back together. It has become the medicine for my soul. If I never get to see the world, I hope I will always be able to walk up the boardwalk over the dunes on Cumberland Island. When I get to the high point, I hope I will always burst into tears like I did the last morning I was there. There is something to be said for finding the place that sustains us and returning there over and over again. I hope you have a place like that. We all need one."
Medium.com,Life,The Best Cultural Experiences For Living Like A Local In Seoul,Travel,https://medium.com/@nataliepopow/the-best-cultural-experiences-for-living-like-a-local-in-seoul-e154a335e044?source=topic_page---------130------------------1," Korea was the fifth country out of thirteen that we are travelling to on our nine month honeymoon, and, after a full-on itinerary in Mongolia we were keen to spend at least a week in one location. Seoul seemed the perfect place to base ourselves for a bit and we were keen to delve into the experience of living like a local. I was lying on a cold metal table, completely naked and red raw — a few layers of skin had recently been scrubbed off every inch of my body with a brillo pad — when a bucket of cold water was emptied over me. No, this was not a scene from a horror movie. This was an extremely vigorous Korean-style full-body scrub that left me smooth and shiny as a new penny. It was our second day in Seoul and we were curious to experience a jjimjilbang (i.e. a public bathhouse). What better way to get to know the locals, get out of your comfort zone and expose yourself to a new culture than taking your gear off for a spot of communal bathing? My husband and I were staying in a guesthouse near Seoul station that left a lot to be desired. Bunk beds with sheets so short they might as well have not bothered as the slightest movement resulted in you sleeping directly on the stained mattress; air-conditioning that was so dusty and ancient it made my eczema and Keegan's asthma flare up; a shared bathroom so tiny you could shower on the toilet seat; and a common area with a smell reminiscent of a teenage boy’s bedroom. Such is the budget travel life; on a AUD <$30 a night budget you never quite know what you are going to get until you get there. Needless to say, we felt we were in dire need of getting properly clean. We visited Siloam Bulgama Sauna Spa and paid around AUD $14 to use the facilities. You could quite easily spend all day, and all night, in this spa as it is open 24 hours. Its five floors include the bathhouse spa, sauna, restaurant and various relaxation rooms that you can go and take a nap in. You can even get your hair and nails done for an additional fee. We were each given a t-shirt and pair of shorts to change into for the mixed gender communal areas. We agreed to meet up near the restaurant at a certain time and went our separate ways. From the changing room, I followed the naked people and descended into the women’s bathhouse area. I didn’t have a scrap on me but the key to my locker and a tiny towel. On the right hand side of the bathing room were the showers and treatment room where you could get a full body scrub and/or oil massage. On the left hand side were a range of heated medicinal baths, a cold bath, jacuzzi and sauna. There were around 50 women of all different shapes, sizes and ages in various stages of bathing. Having visited a Japanese onsen before, I knew enough about the etiquette of public bathing to know that you start with a shower. I booked myself in for a scrub with the assertive ajumma women who ran the scrub and oiling station, leaving me around forty minutes to soak in the baths and sweat in the saunas. The heated and medicinal baths included: I am always a sucker for anything that claims healing properties. Gimme gimme gimme! These baths were relaxing but extremely hot so I don’t know if I stayed in them long enough to get the full effect of the healing powers. The cold bath, by contrast, was so refreshing that the rapid change in body temperature left me a little dizzy. It’s important to take it slow at these bathhouses — this is not the place to rush around on a mission — and there were chill out areas to have a lie-down in between bathing sessions. Soon it was time for my body scrub. The expert, business-like manner with which the scrubbing ajumma— a strong, middle-aged woman wearing nothing but a dashing pair of matching floral underwear — handled every crack and crevice of my body removed any lingering prudish instincts to cover my modesty. These ladies had seen it all."

The interviewee was talking about a sabbatical from work for one year. Her main point was to plan for this, five years in advance. Some places of work will take 20% from your paycheck for four years and then pay out the following year from the accumulated funds. The focus was on university staff. I worked for a university at the time but not in the same capacity as the subjects. However, I decided to implement her ideas on my own. My father was born in Calabria in a small village in the mountainous region of southern Italy. I had never been there. My father had died some nine years before but I felt a need to visit his birthplace. I had been told that my looks were of a classic Calabrese woman. You need time to plan where and what it is you are going to do on your vacation. It is difficult to plan all that you want if you just pack up and go. There is a place for that type of holiday, but this was not it. I used that five-year plan. You don’t need that long but my plan was to go to a foreign country where I did not know the language. I needed to do the research on what to do there and what my husband wanted to do. All of this takes time and it is interesting that as time went on we learned more about where we wanted to go. We changed our minds a lot! A five-year timeline allowed us time to decide what we really wanted to do. Our trip was planned for three weeks. I including airfare, car rental, accommodation, food, wine and entrances to museums, etc. The cost was significant. We used a savings plan that took $75 per paycheck and automatically put this into a separate savings account before anything else came out. It was small enough that we didn’t notice but large enough to add up quickly. We bought our airline tickets and car rental the year before we went. That made the trip seem all that more real. I took courses in Italian at the university that I worked for. In the beginning, the courses were once a week but I soon found that it was not enough to speak the language. I ended up for two summers before we left taking an all-day, full week of immersion. This really helped. The month before we left, I worked two weeks of afternoon shifts so I could take another two weeks of all-day immersion. One thing I learned about Italy is that they speak almost exclusively Italian. In Rome, there was some English spoken but most of the towns or even the smaller cities there was very little English. By the last week of our trip, I could speak well enough to get by without my translation book! I think we were well received because I attempted to speak their language, despite how I fractured it. I contacted some relatives in Canada before we left. I had only heard of them and never spoken to them. It took time to contact and develop a relationship. Once that was done. I had the names of people and their relationships with my father with their contact numbers. This helped enormously. We also had them call and talk to the relatives and explain who was coming and who I was related to. The family here made sure that the person that would meet us was the one that could speak the most English. Through these family members, I was able to see the house where my father was born. Finding family was incredible. First of all, when my brother found out about our plan he wanted to come with his wife as well. We landed in Milan and had decided to go down the west coast of Italy and spend a lot of time in Tuscany. Then we carried on down past the Amalfi coast and into Calabria. When we went to the small town where my father was born, my brother and I looked at each other and he said: “Oh my God, they look like us!” It was so cool to see my maiden name on stores and streets. Here in Vancouver, there was only one other family with the name Guarascio. With my muddled Italian and their fractured English, we managed quite well. My brother and I would be saying someone looks just like Uncle John and they would be nodding at me and saying she looks just like Auntie Mary. The food was unbelievable! Everyplace we went to was another celebration of the specialties of the region. The one constant was the pasta. Never the same but always fresh and homemade. In Italy, the pasta is not just a starch that goes on your plate. It is usually the primi piatti. This means the first plate and is the start of the meal. I really could have pasta every day as some Italians do but then I would need to run every day, not just three times a week. I know how to make my own pasta at home for just my husband and myself now. The wine, well I am not going to stomp on any grapes, so the liquor store still has my business! Our time in Italy was fantastic and we do plan to go back someday. The one thing all of us enjoyed was the hospitality of the people. The food and the wine they shared with us was “Essere la ciliegina sulla Torta” or the cherry on the cake Ciao for now."

Medium.com,Life,The Subtle Art of Packing a Carry-On,Travel,https://medium.com/@joellemumley/the-subtle-art-of-packing-a-carry-on-6717155dbaed?source=topic_page---------138------------------1," Regardless of your destination, the duration of your stay, and the nature of your trip, one thing generally remains the same: your plane carry-on. Your carry-on has limited space, certain things you’re not allowed to bring, and your journey is greatly affected by what you include in it. Here are 4 things to keep in mind for your next trip, when you’re planning what to pack in your carry-on. This is basically the things you absolutely need in order to successfully reach your destination (passport, plane ticket, vaccinations record, etc.) and what you need to stay healthy (prescription medications, EpiPen, etc). Since the preparation prior to a flight can be a little bit hectic and stressful, make a list where you can check things off just prior to departure. It’s surprising how some of the most obvious essentials can be overlooked because you assume that, of course, you would remember something so vital. Essentials also applies to what not to bring. Make sure to read about the carry-on restrictions of your airline. Some of the regularly restricted items include liquids over 3.4oz / 100 ml, sharp objects, flammable items, agricultural products, and self-defense items like pepper spray. With a carry-on, it’s important to remember that you’re going to need to physically carry it across long distances in the airport, take it through security, and potentially heave it up into an overhead compartment on the plane. So it’s important to keep it fairly light and compact. You’ll need to remove your electronics and liquids when going through security, so pack in a way that makes that simple. Nobody wants to be the person holding up the line because they’re basically unpacking and repacking their entire bag in order to reach their laptop. It’s also a good idea to be strategic about where to put your essentials. You’re going to need your passport and/or boarding pass from time to time throughout the airport journey. Have them in a place that’s easily accessible and that you can always return them to. Are there any other essentials that you want to keep accessible? Maybe your phone? Your favorite chapstick? Personally, if I’m feeling cold on a plane, I won’t be able to focus on anything else. I won’t fall asleep, and I’ll have trouble concentrating on work, a book, or even a movie. But I also don’t want to overpack and weigh myself down, so there are a few key things that I have identified that always seem to help: Sleeping on planes can be challenging. I’m actually pretty good at it, but there are two key things that I need in order to sleep decently well on the plane: (1) a place to lean my head and (2) to be warm enough, as previously mentioned. A key purchase for me is an effective neck pillow, ideally one where I can fully relax my head without my neck leaning too far one way or the other. I fly at least once a year from East Africa to the U.S. and back, which gives me plenty of experience with long flights and sitting in a small place for hours on end can get really boring. I like to stock up on a few things that will keep me entertained, even if there’s no in-flight entertainment. (By the way, if the flight does have in-flight entertainment, I generally watch movies non-stop. I usually have an obsession with productivity, but planes ride feel like a free pass and don’t feel bad about it at all. In my opinion, it’s the absolute best way to make the time go by quickly.) No matter where you’re going, how long you’re staying, or what the weather will be like when you arrive, if you’re going on a plane, your carry-on needs won’t change. What are some of your carry-on essentials?"

If you’d asked me 10 years ago if I’d climb a single mountain, let alone traverse a mountain range, I would have snorted at you through a fistful of McDonald’s chips from the comfort of a chaise lounge, while watching the entirety of the Friends back catalogue for the 4th time. This unfortunately isn’t an exaggeration. This was how I spent the vast majority of my free time as a young adult, when I wasn’t drinking myself stupid in a club on a Wednesday night. It’s not a flattering picture. But it is an honest one. I had no regard for my body. I didn’t hate it. I just didn’t care for it. It couldn’t do much. It wasn’t very useful. I remember travelling with my uncle and aunt to Coral Bay one year as a teenager — a stunning little seaside town on the north west coast of Australia — and discovering that every morning of their idyllic beach holiday, they would get up at 6.30am to sprint up sand dunes. I legitimately thought the fuckers were out of their minds. I did three dune runs one morning (under duress) and puked my guts up shortly thereafter. Ahhh sweet summer memories. It was, ironically enough, that same uncle that sparked the idea of Kokoda in me. He’d done the track 5 years before and imparted to me what an incredible experience it was. I’ve always believed that discomfort is the key driver of growth. And after reading ‘Can’t Hurt Me’ by David Goggins at the start of 2019 I was reminded of this fact. His ethos is strongly centred on the idea that you should aim to push yourself to some kind of limit every. single. day. And that the easiest way to do so is through physical activity — because you can’t reliably manufacture any other kind of stress in your life that won’t sustainably fuck it up. Physical pressure and stress is easy to create and control — and instead of doing you long term damage like normal stress does it serves you by making you stronger and more capable. Kokoda, it turns out, was the most difficult physical challenge I could think of. It was brutally hard. Most day we were awake at 4 or 5am. Some days we’d wake up to torrential rail, put on cold, wet clothes that hadn’t dried from the previous day’s downpour and start hiking again in the pitch black hours before dawn. Other days the heat was so oppressive I didn’t think my body would be able to drag itself up the next summit and hike the 20+ kilometres required of me that day. When it was flat it was muddy and when it wasn’t flat it was steep as hell. Going down the side of a mountain is remarkably harder than going up the side of one, it turns out. The jarring of each downward step rattles bones you’d never felt before, hits joints you didn’t realise you had. And at least going up — you weren’t worried about falling On day one, as we sat down for dinner, I vomited in front of the 27 strangers I was doing the trek with. On day two, I fell several meters over rocks, roots and scrub, again in front of most of my peers. On day three, I burnt my one and only hiking shirt to a crisp, because I hung it to dry too close to the fire. Needless to say, things improved from day four. …. how could they not?! I trained hard for 6 months to make Kokoda a reality. But every person I spoke to told me the same thing — while I was physically as prepared as I could be, the real challenge would exist between my ears. My goal initially was to survive it but in the end I felt like I’d fucking conquered it. It is one of the best experiences of my life, to date. Because of what I discovered about the power of my thoughts. For the first 4 days though, I was waging a war. Every second spent going upwards was a struggle. Every couple of moments I had to catch myself. I had to send a constant barrage of corny-as-shit positivity through my brain. “You can do this”
“You got this, Beth”
“Stop being a little bitch”
“You’re a fucking warrior”
“You trained for this”
“Your legs are strong”
“You feel fantastic”
“You could do this forever!” It was the only way to stop the opposite from going through my mind: “I can’t do this”
“It’s too hard”
“My legs are burning”
“I’m too weak”
‘I’m not cut out for this”
“I should never have come here”
“You’re fucking delusional”
“You’ll never finish this” What I discovered was that your mind is what writes the story of your life. Your body will always follow. It’s the reason I never stopped, never quit, never felt sorry for myself. If I had to — which I often did — I would pause to catch my breath; I would motion those behind me to go ahead, so I wouldn’t slow them down. But I never fucking quit. On day 5 everything changed. We got into Bombers Camp early — midday. There were hot showers. The campsite stocked foam mattresses and pillows. There was even green grass, instead of mud! Luxuries we’d been without for days. We spent an idyllic afternoon in clean, dry clothes, lounging about in the idyllic weather. A game of touch rugby with the locals went on, some of us did yoga, others played cards. Around the campfire that night, our trek leader recited bush poetry and some of the porters gathered and serenaded us with beautiful songs in their native language. At some point that day, it seeped into our collective consciousness — we could make it. Our legs were strong by then. We’d spent 5 days working muscles we’d never used before — and they were ready now. We’d learnt the ways of the track, how to move through it. Not with ease necessarily, but with some grace. Slips and falls were normal, expected even, and they came without shame — instead just a few laughs. We met each new summit with determination instead of destitution. The track hadn’t defeated up — it had created us. I sat amongst the granite at Isurava.
I crossed my legs and closed my eyes and tried to hear what the mountains had to say.
I could hear the wind gently agitating the trees around the memorial and I could feel the morning sunlight warming my skin.
I could hear the sound of the waterfall nearby cascading over rocks along with the hum and buzz of the never-seen-but-always-heard jungle inhabitants. They were all just distractions though.
Because on a mountain top at Isuvara, I sat amongst the granite, I forgot everything — and I remembered how to breathe If you make it through the first 8 days of the track, on day 9 you reach the memorial at Isuvara. Polished granite structures proudly wear the four words that so fittingly sum up the spirit of the Australian soldiers that walked — and fought — along the track in 1942. Courage.
Mateship.
Sacrafice.
Endurance. It’s a very special place. After learning the entire military history of the track during World War II, you can’t be anything by awed and inspired by what the diggers did indeed endure. I don’t think I’ve ever experienced more present and peaceful moments in my life than those I spent at Isurava. There, alone, breathing with the wind, glowing with the sun, I felt more connected to my breath and body than I ever have before. This, I think, is the greatest gift Kokoda has given me. A finely-tuned radar, a keenly crafted sense of what my body — and my soul — needs. It seems strange that it took 28 years, and a mountain range to gain this insight. But I suppose we all take a winding road to get to know ourselves — and mine just happened to be across the Owen Stanley’s."

News headlines make us painfully aware of how many terrible things happen to people and how dangerous the world can be. Travel in particular can be scary, with stories of tourists targeted in foreign countries, tales of theft, blackmail, kidnapping, murder…
It’s easy to look at the world outside our own country and see a whole lot of differences and a whole lot of danger. We’re told to “keep ourselves safe” while travelling and taught to regard strangers with a wary eye. I can’t deny that some people have bad intentions. It’s absolutely true that travel can sometimes go wrong because travellers trust the wrong people. But if there’s one thing I’ve learned in the past 10 months of travel, it’s that people are just people. No doubt there are bad people in all countries but on the flip side of that, there are absolutely amazing people in all countries too. In our adventures so far, we’ve encountered so many people who have gone out of their way to help us. Wherever you go in the world, people are just people. And it seems to me that a huge number of those people are good. While travelling through the Australian Outback, it’s generally recommended that you make sure you’re always prepared. Take spare tyres. Always have plenty of water. Carry back-up fuel. And always, always make sure you don’t run out of petrol. In a dry, hot, desert environment with very little traffic passing, being stranded on the road could well be a death sentence. So, of course, that’s exactly what we managed to do. One sunny April morning, following a little miscommunication, we drove right past the last roadhouse between Exmouth and Karajini. We firmly believed that there was another, cheaper roadhouse just 100km further on. There was not another roadhouse. We drove 100km. And then 50km more. Then another 20km. And then the car stopped, because there was no petrol left. It was well over 30 degrees Celcius. Nearing midday, there wasn’t a cloud in the sky and it was scorching. There was no shade. We had plenty of water (apparently we’re not completely stupid) and some food, but zero petrol and another 288km to the next petrol station. So, we started taking turns flagging down passing vehicles to see whether anyone would sell us some petrol. There’s not a lot of traffic on the road to Karajini. Every fifteen minutes or so, we’d hear the noise of an approaching engine and get terribly excited. Unfortunately, after an hour or so of flagging down vehicles, we were still without petrol. But something surprising did happen: every single vehicle stopped. Without fail. Every single person pulled over to help. And every single person checked that we had enough food and water. Sadly, they all had diesel vehicles so couldn’t help us out with the petrol we needed. Eventually, a young couple pulled over and offered us a ride all the way back to the Roadhouse. So, my partner Chris and I rode in air-conditioned comfort for one hundred and seventy kilometres where we filled a jerrycan with (very expensive but much-needed) petrol. Then we headed back out to the road and prepared to wait for hours for another lift. It took less than a minute before another wonderful person picked us up and we drove all the way back, again in air-conditioned comfort. Not only that, but the lovely man who picked us up just happened to be a local who spent the entire trip giving us local tips on places to visit and things to see. When we eventually got back to the car, he also donated some big bottles of ice-cold water to our cause, so that we wouldn’t have to drink the water that had been sitting in the hot car all day. While we’d been gone, our travelling companions had been waiting with the car. In the couple of hours we’d been away, many more cars had stopped. Total strangers had shared their food, water and even cold beers. One group siphoned off enough of their own petrol for the guys to move the car to a shady spot. We got into an unpleasant, potentially dangerous situation just because we were trying to save a few dollars. It was really, really dumb. But it also showed us just how many good people are out there and how willing people are to help. I’ve never felt so positive about humanity as I did that day. The Ruta de las Flores in El Salvador is an absolutely beautiful road that runs between small villages, through coffee plantations and a whole lot of colourful flowers. The towns themselves are full of great food, coffee, wine, murals, historic buildings and even more flowers. With (very cheap) buses running regularly along the ruta, it’s a great way to spend a day or two. So that’s what we did. When we arrived in the town of Apaneca, we decided it was about time for some exercise, so we headed up the path towards the Mirador (or lookout) over the town. That’s where we met Ray. An Apaneca local who’d grown up in the town before moving to Los Angeles, Ray chatted with us for a while and then offered to show us the way up to the Mirador. Now, I’m well aware that this is the kind of situation that you’re meant to be very wary of, particularly when travelling in a country with a reputation for violent crime. In fact, I was busy trying to think of a polite way to decline when Chris happily accepted and took off up the hill with this random Salvadorean stranger. Just then Ray told us that he’d offered to escort many other tourists and they’d all said no — he was terribly disappointed as he likes to practice his English and make sure it doesn’t get rusty while he’s out of the States. So, stupid or not, we went up the little, secluded path with a total stranger. And it was great. He told us all about his childhood growing up in the area.Then he told us the hair-raising story of his illegal border crossing into the States and about how fantastic it was to be granted citizenship a few years earlier. He gave us tips for our upcoming travels in California. He taught us a few new words of Spanish and gave us a great, guided tour up to the Mirador and back. Ray could’ve been a murderer. He could’ve robbed us. He could’ve been a scammer wanting money for “tours”. But he wasn’t.
He was a genuinely lovely, fascinating guy who just wanted to help out some tourists, practice his English and share his love for his beautiful country.
This is just one example, but everywhere we went in El Salvador the people were amazing — friendly, helpful, kind and never trying to take advantage or rip off foreigners. There are great people everywhere, but if you want to really restore your faith in humanity, visit El Salvador. Crossing the border back from Uruguay to Argentina should’ve been easy. We’d done a bit of research online and found a ferry that crossed from Salto (Uruguay) to Concordia (Argentina) several times a day, for a low price. After spending the night in Salto, we had a nice sleep-in and then wandered the couple of kilometres to the port. We followed the directions from the Lonely Planet and found… well, nothing. No ferry terminal. No ticket office. Nothing at all, really. Increasingly concerned, we wandered up and down the waterfront until a nice older lady approached us and said a whole lot of things in very fast Spanish to which we smiled blankly. After a bit of miming and some very basic Spanish from us, she figured out what we needed and escorted us to the tiny little ticket window we’d completely overlooked. Seriously, it’s tiny. I’d thought it was one of those boxes that sells newspapers. She kept repeating something in Spanish and shaking her head, which was a bit of a concern… And then we figured out why. In the window of the tiny little ticket place was a big sign, declaring that the service was unavailable “until further notice”. We asked a few people at nearby building whether the boats were going today and they all shrugged. Things weren’t looking positive. And then our little old lady came back and kindly escorted us to the nearest bus stop instead. Then she blessed us multiple times, kissing us on the cheeks and going back to her shopping. We waited at the bus stop for a while, but nothing happened. Impatient as always, we started on the 4km walk back to the bus station, where we hoped to get a bus to Concordia. On the way, we ran into another friendly old lady, two police officers and a young man. All of them asked if they could help, all of them gave us great directions and all of them were incredibly friendly. Before too long, a local bus came along and drove us most of the way to the bus station for less than a dollar. We were sitting on this bus, gazing blankly out of the windows when the bus pulled over and five or six different people all gestured wildly at us. Apparently they’d all heard us say that we wanted to go to the bus station and this was the closest stop. The bus driver waited patiently for us to figure out what was happening, then a whole busload of smiling Uruguayans waved at us as the bus disappeared off into the distance. Again, people are awesome. Chicken buses in El Salvador are fabulous. Old school-bus style tanks from the States, they’re painted all the colours of the rainbow and often plastered with pictures of Jesus. They bump their way (very slowly) along all the roads of El Salvador, tooting their horns at every opportunity, whistling and shouting at passengers and often playing dance music at ridiculously high volume. I cannot explain just how much I love those buses. Our first chicken bus experience was on our second day in El Salvador. We’d crossed the border the night before and slept in the first hostel we could find in Sonsonate. The next morning we started walking to the bus station, which turned out to be a good few kilometres away. So we walked, carrying our packs, in 30 degree heat along the side of a busy road. It wasn’t fun. Just as we were starting to wilt in the heat, a bus pulled up and waved us aboard. There was nobody else on the bus. And it was the most amazing bus I’ve ever seen in my life. Beautifully painted in swirls of blue, purple and silver; decorated in thousands of colourful flashing lights; blasting “Happy” at full volume. It was spectacular. The driver took us straight to the bus station, waved off all attempts at payment and continued on his way with a huge smile, taking his flashing lights and his party music with him. It was the perfect introduction to El Salvador, quite possibly the friendliest country in the world. These are just 4 random examples of times we ran into people who helped us out of the goodness of their hearts. Honestly, I sat here for all of two minutes and came up with a list of 23. The more that we travel, the more that my faith in humanity is restored and the more I realise just how many good people there are in the world. In a time where we’re continually reminded of the dangers around us and the terrible things that people can do, I think it’s crucial to remind ourselves of the good people in the world. There may be bad apples out there, but there are also so many people who will go out of their way to help strangers. It’s a beautiful thing. And it’s something we need to talk about more."

If there’s a delay at any of the three stops, it might compromise the entire trip, because if you don’t make your connecting flight, you’re screwed. And once you’re there, you’re not leaving for a while. I’m endlessly fascinated by these far-off connections, these obscure airports that few people would ever think to travel to — and St. Helena is somehow more hopelessly obscure than the rest. But you’re going to know a lot about it by the time you finish reading this piece—about an island that you’ll likely never visit unless you have a whole lot of extra time, disposable income, or a sense of adventure."
Medium.com,Life,Locked down in Kashmir: A traveler’s view,Travel,https://medium.com/adinkra/locked-down-in-kashmir-a-travelers-view-38ac84374a21?source=topic_page---------145------------------1," By পান্থ রহমান রেজা (Pantha) | Translated by Rezwan Fatima Jahan is a Bangladeshi living in Bangalore, India. Travel is one of Fatima’s passions, and one of her favourite places to visit is Kashmir, which she describes as “a paradise on earth”-she’s visited the region seven times. This year, after she had made travel arrangements for Kashmir, the political situation there changed dramatically when, on August 5, the government of India revoked Article 370, the section of the Indian constitution that has provided special autonomy to the state of Jammu and Kashmir since 1950. The Indian authorities placed hundreds of political leaders and their aides under house arrest, and suspended access to mobile, landline, and internet networks. Read more: Inside Kashmir’s crisis Fatima’s flight was scheduled for the third week of August. By that time, the authorities had begun to ease some the restrictions and slowly lift the curfews, though there were still some controls in place. Fatima decided, nevertheless, to undertake the journey to the region, where staying for a few days before returning to Bangalore. She shared some of her experiences in a series of posts on Facebook that we have excerpted below. Here are some selected parts of her first two days of experience. This is my seventh visit to Kashmir. . . . I get off the plane and notice an ominous silence outside. None of the airport stores is open. I do not look the officers in the eye, for fear they might take it as an offence and send me back! As soon as I retrieve my luggage from the conveyor belt I leave the airport. Turns out that I was the only tourist on the entire flight. Exiting Srinagar airport, I take a taxi from the prepaid taxi stand. As we drive slowly into the city I witness the same ominous silence. It is 7:30am and the outside temperature is 13° C. The authorities lifted the curfew day before yesterday, but no shops are open. Some locals have come out to shop. They are walking; few people have come in their cars. There are even two or three women going to the market. The taxi driver, Ejaz Bhai, tells me he will go straight home after dropping me. One passenger is enough for the day in this situation. […] According to Ejaj Bhai, no one leaves the house unless it is absolutely necessary, fearing the army might arrest them on any pretext. Most shops are still closed, so people are using up their stocks of food. Who knows what will happen tomorrow?! Ejaz Bhai also told me that police have closed all the hotels here. On the 5th of August, they marked in hotel guest registers that no further guests will be allowed in. There are a lot of armed security personnel on the roads. Approximately every three meters an army officer is standing guard. I am going to Hussain Uncle’s houseboat. (I have known him for a few years). Ejaz Bhai drops me at Dal Lake Gate №7 and I take a shikara to the houseboat, which is also Hussain Uncle’s home. […] The Armed Forces Special Powers Act (AFSPA) has been in effect since 1990. The army has all the power. The law allows the army to pick up anyone, civilian or militant, and they don’t have to be accountable if people turn up dead or disappear. . . . There are mass graves of thousands in the districts of Uri and Baramulla. It’s alleged that suspected militants were picked up and they ended up in those graves. This is the story in a lot of villages in the Kashmir Valley. After the 5th of August many youths have reportedly been arrested, and no one knows where they are. Even though [the government] have lifted the curfew, the people here imposed their own, civil curfew. No one is opening their shops; no one anywhere is working. This is all in protest at the decision taken to revoke Article 370. […] The PSA [Public Safety Act] has been in force since 1978. This banned any kind of gathering or procession in Kashmir. However, people do come out for protests, and mass arrests take place. This time, it’s worse. Telephone, internet lines are down and there is no contact with the outside world. Before the curfew, the army had seized power from the police and took away their weapons. I did not see any police on my way into the city from the airport. […] [The authorities] have arrested many political leaders and sent them to jail in Delhi and Agra. Rumour has it that the jails in Kashmir and Jammu are already full. Even without the curfew in effect, no one is taking their car out. Because gasoline is not available. The buses are not running either. In the afternoon, I ask Hussain Uncle to take me to the lakeside to see the situation in the city. He suggests that I go tomorrow instead: “Today there is trouble in the city.” My second day in Kashmir. I, personally, am in no hurry. Because of the situation, I have no plans to go anywhere. Hussain Uncle lives in one of his two houseboats and keeps the other for tourists, so I am now alone on a huge houseboat. All tours are now closed in Kashmir. . . I talk with his son, Shehzad, during breakfast. Yesterday, a protest rally took place at Shalimar Gardens. Nobody knows what happened after that. There is no way to know how many were arrested, injured, or killed. There is still no telephone, internet. […] Once, in 2008, the government allowed people to protest. People from all over the city came out into the streets of Kashmir, which was very hard to control. The government became smarter, and protests rallies are no longer allowed. The common people of Kashmir want azadi (freedom). They have wanted it since the reign of King Hari Singh, before India became independent. I am not going to debate what the mass of Indian citizens want. . . . What Kashmiris want should be the main concern, because they are from this place. They have started to ration food distribution again. Uncle’s youngest son, Junaid, went to the centre of the town and learnt that from tomorrow they will start the distribution of rations. They are providing only rice now. Earlier they used to distribute flour and sugar as well. I spend the rest of the day sitting on the porch of the houseboat. Life on the Dal lake seems to be normal. People are going to their usual work or other places on small boats. During the curfew, the women here have nothing to do, especially as mobile phone and internet service have also been shut down. Except for TV, there is no option for entertainment. […] In the afternoon I go out, and Uncle sends his son Junaid with me. From the boat, I step on to land and walk along the lakeside. I see some army men patrolling the Boulevard Road. After that, every 10 meters there is an army officer standing. Barbed-wire fences have been placed in front of almost all public buildings. Today I saw several cars and motorbikes on the street. I saw some local people strolling on Boulevard Road. Usually, many people from Srinagar flock here in the afternoon. . . . Public transport is still shut down. A few shared taxis are waiting at the bus stand to take people to Jammu. All roads except those towards Jammu are closed. Photography is prohibited on the street Photography is prohibited on the street and there is an even stricter ban against photographing army personnel. Only a few journalists have permission to take pictures. I am a visitor and if they find out that I came here despite knowing about the curfew, I suspect they will send me back immediately. They could even book me on suspicion of extremism-and we know that after an arrest, there is usually no further news of the detainee. After spending a substantial time in the city, I return to the houseboat. Hussain Uncle tells me that there was trouble in downtown. He heard the sound of teargas shells. After the Maghreb prayers came the loud sound of prayers from the mosque. There is nothing else to do besides pray. On hearing that any words, positive or negative, are uttered in the mosque besides prayers, the army comes to arrest people. Ther are army spies inside the mosque listening to hear what’s going on. All the big mosques were closed after the announcement of curfew. Editor’s note: The Indian government continues to maintain that the situation in Kashmir is normal. Restrictions have been re-imposed in parts of Kashmir."

Medium.com,Life,Why do we Travel?,Travel,https://medium.com/@nicholasbmills/why-do-we-travel-35d8e9cc7ab3?source=topic_page---------149------------------1," I recently returned from a trip to Japan. It was my first time out of the country. Three weeks before the trip, I still didn’t have a passport. The mad rush to gather all the paperwork. The countless hours spent planning the trip. The money spent. The long flights. The setbacks. Culture shock. The language barrier. Why is it that we want to travel? What are we chasing? I didn’t choose to go to Japan for any other reason than we found inexpensive flights. International travel wasn’t even on my radar; let alone Japan. It is quite an ambitious notion to fly to one of the furthest destinations without any experience traveling. What was I thinking? And so that’s been the question on my mind lately. Why do we travel? Why do I travel? I took this trip to Japan with two of my best friends. It was a chance to experience the world with them. To experience life on the other side of the planet. It was a chance to get to know those two guys better than I already did. To grow the relationship and build something stronger through the adversity that foreign travel can create. And our trip did just that. I feel closer to these two than before. The intricacies of their personality came through and I was able to see the best qualities of them. One, who organized and planned and navigated the whole time. The other for his positivity and willingness to try new things. But where did I fit in on this trip? I felt carried along, happy to be along for the ride, but still unsure of the purpose. I’ve always been fascinated with Japanese culture. The minimalism. The respect for culture, person, and nature. The architecture and public infrastructure. The geography and the language. But after going to Japan I realized I didn’t really know much of the country at all. Its history. Its people. Its culture. And I came back and told all my friends and family how wonderful Japan was. How magical the cities of Tokyo, Kyoto, and Osaka were. How traveling was the best thing in the world. How the money spent was the best use of it. And for a second I believe all that. My perspective on life has changed. I value different things now. I want to prioritize different things in my life. But how do two weeks in another country create a definitive change in personality and character? I don’t think it does. My day-to-day life takes over. The memories and wanderlust I felt in Japan fall away. I have the pictures and moments to look back upon. I have the memories and stories to tell. But I don’t think this type of travel is for me. Going to a country and seeing it in one quick sprint. Inhaling generations of culture and meaning in two weeks. But really, I was just doing what I would in any city. Tokyo felt just like New York, Chicago, LA. The habit of travel, I think, would allow these small moments to compound. You become more aware that America is not the only country in this world. But my lifestyle in Japan was the same in Washington, DC. But even in a country with all its signs in English did I struggle with the complexity of travel. How would I do in countries with far less infrastructure? I don’t think I would enjoy it. But is the point of traveling to these places to enjoy it? Or is it to spread your awareness to something larger than yourself? Do you go there and come back and change your habits and behaviors in a country with every possible want you could desire? I doubt it. And so the more I think about travel, the more I think about this story of Emerson: “Emerson, who in his own life traveled to England and Italy and France and Malta and Switzerland (as well as extensively across America), pointed out that the people who built the sights and wonders that tourists liked to see didn’t do so while they traveled. You can’t make something great flitting around. You have to stick fast, like an axis of the earth. Those who think they will find solutions to all their problems by traveling far from home, perhaps as they stare at the Colosseum or some enormous moss-covered statue of Buddha, Emerson said, are bringing ruins to ruins. Wherever they go, whatever they do, their sad self comes along.” — Stillness is the Key, Ryan Holiday You can find that perspective in other ways, for far less money. I think travel is a worthwhile goal and expenditure. But I want to be a little more deliberate in where I go next."
Medium.com,Life,The Real Point of Traveling Solo,Travel,https://medium.com/swlh/the-real-point-of-traveling-solo-254f1b6d1df7?source=topic_page---------150------------------1," “We shall not cease from exploration, and the end of all our exploring, will be to arrive where we started, and know the place for the first time.” — T.S. Eliot A few years back, I took my first solo trip. It was a week-long endeavor to Ireland. There are two basic, human desires which drove me to make this trip: Clearly, this post is not about what I did in Ireland. This is not because I have a dearth of fun-sized travel tidbits to share. I did indeed have a middle-aged beer-bellied Irish tour guide who belted the Fresh Prince of Bel Air theme song into the bus intercom. I made an Israeli-friend-who-lives-in-Dublin at a comedy show and swapped relationship stories with him during a personal guided pub crawl. I learned that young Irish folk use the word “craic” (pronounced “crack”) for fun. So, “That was good craic!” means an experience was fun. The young woman who taught me that also warned me not to use the term at the border in Tijuana, lest you wish to be detained by border patrol (per her experience). Are you satisfied? Good. Now I want to get to the meaning of it all (see point 2 above). Here are a couple of things I learned from my emerald adventures: This doesn’t mean I no longer want to be independent, nor does it mean that I will never travel alone again. Rather, it showed me that we need not make decisions just to prove something. I do want to be independent, but never at the expense of having others in my life, of showing them how much I deeply appreciate them, of keeping myself open to the possibility that a fun-sized story — anywhere in the world — could become lifelong companionship."
Medium.com,Life,What I’m Learning from My Long-Distance Relationship,Travel,https://psiloveyou.xyz/what-im-learning-from-my-long-distance-relationship-7cff422bf490?source=topic_page---------151------------------1," My
boyfriend and I met under unique circumstances, which led to a unique dynamic in our relationship. This is something we discussed before we became “official”. Our ‘regular’ long-distance relationship — being a 2-hour drive away — became a long-distance relationship in which he would be traveling around the country for his work for over a year. As an OTR driver, he’d be driving all over the U.S. delivering loads of products. On Monday he could be in Arizona, by Friday he could be in New York. He can go from being 20 hours away, to being 45 minutes away. It’s not entirely what we signed up for, but because we had already established what we want for the future, we were willing to make it work. Thus far, we’ve been able to do so in a way that’s healthy and somehow gains attention from people on the outside looking in. One thing I’ve noticed is that when I’m talking to someone about it, their first response is usually something like “Oh, I’m sorry…that really sucks”. After I met some friends from his hometown, he also mentioned to me that they constantly ask him: “How do you even do it? Isn’t it hard?” I guess in their eyes we make everything look exceptionally easy. But in order to make our current situation work, there are a few things that we have to address, accept, and continue working on. We both knew that we wanted to continue our relationship even though it meant we would only meet each other every once in a while. It didn’t make sense for us to fuel ourselves with false hope of “this is going to be an easy experience”. When it comes to anyone for whom you care and love deeply, being away from them is extremely difficult. In times that you want to hug them, hold their hand, or even just be in each other’s presence, you have to deal with the fact that you just can’t. As far as how hard it hits, it really ebbs and flows. There are days when I’m doing just fine and keeping productive with my own activity and tasks. But then there are days when he’s the only thing I can think about. Is he getting enough sleep? Did he arrive already? Is he doing okay on this long drive? We know that there is no other person we’d rather do this with. By acknowledging the difficulty, we were able to set realistic expectations about ourselves and how we communicate. It’s not “This is hard”, it’s “This is hard but…”. Meaning that even though it’s hard, there’s a reason why we came to this decision. We know it’s not going to be like this forever. We know that there is no other person we’d rather do this with. As you can imagine, we talk to each other a lot. It’s all we have most of the time! Whether it’s texting, IM, phone call, or video call, we find a way to talk to each other even if it’s not for an extended amount of time. However, we quickly realized that our relationship especially called for effective communication. Even though it is a long-distance relationship, we still find conflict in certain things that the other does or says. Being at a distance plays to our advantage in terms of increasing our awareness in how we communicate with each other. We don’t have the advantage of falling back on physical affection when trouble arises. Trying to avoid the subject hardly ever works either. We’re put in a position in which we have to talk things out, we have to acknowledge and discuss our feelings, and we have to find a resolve for conflict. Otherwise, we’d either be trying to awkwardly dance around the elephant in the room or just not talk to each other at all. When I asked my boyfriend to take the 5 Love Languages quiz, we were surprised to find that we have the same dominant love languages: Quality Time and Words of Affirmation. For Word of Affirmation, we typically send text and voice messages to each other every day. They’re essentially nice little love notes. If someone were to take my phone and look through our text conversations, they’d probably cringe and gag. But we’re not saying “mushy stuff” for the sake of it. Whatever words we choose, we want to make the following clear when we send these messages: You’re special to me. You’re amazing. You’re working very hard. I appreciate you. I value you. I miss you. I’m proud of you. These conversations help us to focus on the exciting future rather than the difficult present. In terms of Quality Time, we had to understand that the emphasis is on ‘quality’. It is giving each other undivided attention, but it also means partaking in activities together. Being at a distance, our activity is limited to things that we can both do without necessarily being in each other’s presence. For us, that means listening to the same podcasts or reading the same books. One podcast we enjoy happens to be a love-oriented one, in which the husband and wife of 12 years share their take on their journey as spouses, but also provide insight on some issues and topics that arise between couples. Our conversations become more rich and engaging, as we have even more content to talk about and discuss. We even get to discuss aspects of our relationships that we haven’t even got a chance to talk about yet. By doing this, we’ve created our own version of Quality Time. My boyfriend and I admire each other’s work ethic. In fact, we met each other while networking. Before we met, we already had some lofty financial goals for ourselves. We found that aspect of each other very attractive. One thing that we made clear to each other is that 1) We want to see each other win and 2) We don’t want to become a distraction for the other. In his case, that means understanding that I might not always be available for a video call or that I could be in a meeting with a client. For me, it means understanding that he won’t always be able to talk because he’s too exhausted and needs to get adequate sleep. It would be selfish of me to pressure him to stay on a phone call with me longer simply because I miss him. Just the same, it would be selfish for him to believe I could just rearrange everything in my calendar at the drop of a hat. If we want to see each other win, it doesn’t just mean being a cheerleader. It means that we need to respect each other’s time. It also means that we shouldn’t fall short on our own daily activity that is going to get us to where we want to be a few years from now. Every day we let each other know how much we appreciate each other. And, for me personally, I express my gratitude knowing that our situation isn’t nearly as bad as it could be. We’re doing everything in our power not just to make our relationship work, but to make it flourish. I express how grateful I am because I know there are couples who literally live together but still feel emotionally distant. I also count my blessings. We’re fortunately in a situation in which we actually can communicate every single day. It’s not like that for everyone at a distance. For some, they simply can’t communicate every day because it doesn’t align with their industry of work. They have to go by faith that their significant other is okay wherever they are. I will admit that, from the outside looking in, we do sometimes make it look easy. But the reality is that it isn’t. No relationship is truly ‘easy’. But we manage. Every single day we make a conscious decision to manage it. And we manage it because we’ve already claimed that we won. We already know that it’s worth it."
Medium.com,Life,Top 10 Things You Didn’t Know About Japan II,Travel,https://medium.com/@ilenekuehl/top-10-things-you-didnt-know-about-japan-ii-e512350b7b0e?source=topic_page---------152------------------1," You’ve heard it all about Japan, time and time again: about why it’s such a great country to visit, how the vending machines are so convenient, and that finding a public garbage can is about as easy as trying to find a fairy in the middle of the forest. If you’re traveling to Japan for the first time, you probably want to learn what all the hype is about, instead of reading about a bunch of boring stuff that you already know. The info below doesn’t seem to be common knowledge (yet), but I hope that after reading this post, you’ll have a better idea of what Japan is really like. Below are some cultural things that make this country seem so strange, amazing, and unique. Now that autumn is finally rolling around, you know what that means: pumpkin-flavored treats are going to start coming out. If you’re in Japan, you might be tempted to order pumpkin-flavored things like kabocha (南瓜), which is Japanese for pumpkin. But hold up. While people here call it pumpkin, it’s actually squash. My first time ordering a pumpkin-flavored latte at a Tokyo in Starbucks left me pleasantly disappointed when it tasted a little, well, off. I was expecting my latte to be like the pumpkin pie flavor we have back in the United States, but it was a little bit bitter and wasn’t sweet. In fact, it didn’t taste remotely like pumpkin-flavored anything that you can get back in my home country. So if you’re in the mood for pumpkin-flavored goodies, remember that since what you’re ordering is technically squash, it will probably have a different taste than the pumpkin stuff you’re used to eating. I’d say it’s worth trying, just for the experience, if nothing else. I’m always surprised to hear that more people don’t know about this, so let it be known: if you go to the 8th floor of Hotel Gracery, you can go hang out with Godzilla. You can take a selfie with the giant monster’s head (because who wouldn’t want to do that?) I always think it’s a great thing to do if you’re visiting Shinjuku for a day, whether alone or with friends. If you want to find Godzilla and would like to take a selfie with him, here’s the address: 1-Chome-18–8 Kabukicho, Toho Building, Shinjuku, Tokyo, 160–0001 This is something that never fails to surprise me when it happens. I was walking near the park by my house by the other day when this sign popped up: Attention to the Bee. In America, bees are just a part of nature and we basically ignore them. We have a ‘you-do-you’ mentality when it comes to bees, one where humans keep walking, bees keep buzzing, and that’s the end of it. Except in Japan things don’t work like that. Not in Tokyo they don’t, at least. When I was working at an elementary school last year, I asked my coworker at the time why the school staff was taking a chainsaw to a perfectly good tree. “Oh, it’s because of the bees,” he said. “Bees?” I asked. I couldn’t believe it. But he was right. Sure enough, that tree was being chopped down because some bees had built a hive on it. Instead of getting rid of the hive, around here, we get rid of the whole tree. The elementary school had decided that it was too risky to keep the tree there, and a day later, it was nothing but a stump. So if you ever run across a sign that says, ‘Attention to the Bee,’ now you know why. In all fairness, the people here are just trying to keep everyone safe. (Although I still it’s kind of crazy to chop down an entire tree.) Japan is famous for its wide variety of colorful characters, but one thing that I didn’t know when I came here was that some cities and even some train lines have their own mascots. Once, when I was in Yokohama, I even saw mascots for Keikyuu Line being used to warn about chikan (痴漢, train molesters). So if you come to Tokyo and are wondering why there are a bunch of characters you don’t recognize standing around you, they’re probably affiliated with something, even if it’s just a restaurant or a bus. Illuminations aren’t a thing where I’m from. Your options are either decorating your yard with Santa and friends or driving around looking at Christmas lights, and that’s about it. Going to see the illuminations is one of the best things you can do if you’re visiting Tokyo in the wintertime though, because other than paying transportation, it won’t cost you a penny. Tokyo Midtown, Shibuya Blue Caves, and Roppongi Hills are all places that have Instagram-worthy illuminations. Walking away with great pictures from your trip makes it worth going, and who doesn’t want that? I still can’t get over this one. It costs an arm and a leg to call an ambulance in the United States, but in Japan, it’s free. In my home country, people are afraid to call an ambulance because of how expensive it is, but since it’s free in Japan, they don’t hesitate. As a bonus, they have a really cute name here, too: they’re called kyuu-kyuushaa (救急車), with kanji that translates to ‘rescue emergency car.’ I had never heard of key cases before moving to Japan. But they’re popular here, and most people that I know use them. Not only do they look nice, you don’t have to worry about your keys stabbing you in the thigh if you want to carry them in your pocket. This is an example of functionality and practicality, at its best. It keeps your keys organized, and it prevents you from having to annoyingly separate the ring on your keychain, something that every person on the planet hates doing. Key case prices vary depending on the material and quality, but they make great souvenirs for friends and family members, especially the ones that have unique Japanese characters like Totoro on them. From the anime you watch and the manga you read, it might seem like now you can finally wear your hair in that hot pink shade that you’ve always dreamed of and pair it with your katakana anime shirts without anyone giving you a second glance. But despite what manga might have taught you, once you get to Japan, you’ll find out that the fashion here is more classy than cosplay. This was a bit of a shock for me. A lot of the time no one bothers to de-bone the fish. Instead, you have to sort the bones with your mouth. It’s like eating a watermelon and spitting out the seeds, only instead of spitting out seeds you’re spitting out tiny little bones. If you accidentally swallow one, it hurts like a mother. (Luckily, this will never happen to you while you’re eating sushi, but eating pan-fried fish is another story …) Be careful if you order whole fish here, you don’t want to dig in and have a bone you didn’t expect to be there stab you in the throat! There’s something here that’s called pet manners, and it’s very different from the pet etiquette that we have in the United States. If you have a dog, after he or she goes #1 you can’t just let it sit there, you’ll have to pour water over it. The rules for #2 are the same as in any other country, though — it needs to be picked up in a garbage bag. (But since we have no public trash cans, you’ll have to carry it home with you. Fun.) I’ve also been to parks that say please walk your dog somewhere else so that it doesn’t go to the bathroom in the park, a notion that is pretty weird for us westerners. If you think about it from a Tokyoite’s perspective though, this kind of makes sense — space here is pretty limited, and what parent wants to worry about their kid accidentally stepping in dog goop? I used to have a neighbor who had two dogs, and while the female dog was allowed to roam free, the male dog was always forced to wear diapers when she took him outside (probably because he marked his territory more.) It’s something to keep in mind if you’re going to visit Tokyo with your dog."

Medium.com,Life,Why in the World Should You Choose Camping Over Cruising?,Travel,https://medium.com/traveltruth/why-in-the-world-should-you-choose-camping-over-cruising-149fdb59a49a?source=topic_page---------159------------------1," Or, how can a cruise writer also be the author of two camping guidebooks? I started camping when I was around four. The first time was in a tent, I think. Later my dad built a camping trailer — welded it up out of tubing and sheet metal right there in the driveway in front of our house on Rainy Street in San Angelo, Texas. I remember the sparks. We took that camper and several subsequent versions all over New Mexico and southern Colorado, often meeting up with aunts, uncles, and grandparents. I remember the first fish I caught, with my Uncle Harvey laughing and coaching from behind as my dad helped me reel in a whopping six-inch rainbow trout. To this day, my favorite scrambled eggs are those cooked in a cast-iron skillet over a campfire. I camp. Don’t get me wrong, I most definitely love cruise ships, but I also think you should camp. Here’s why. If you want to fall asleep to the rush of a stream, turn off the white noise app on your iPhone and sleep next to a real stream. Or try watching a meteor shower while snuggled in a sleeping bag — it’s okay if the sleeping bag is on top of a comfy air mattress. I have heard that for a price, on certain Celebrity cruise ships, they will make you a bed outside on a deck where you can sleep under the stars for a night — kind of cruise ship “glamping.” That’s something I’d love to try. Sitting around an open fire with other people is primal. If there’s just you and your special someone, it’s romantic. If it’s a guy’s group or a girls’ group, it strengthens friendships, as you rely on one another — literally for survival. If your kids are there, it’s a type of fun that they cannot have at home — cooking their own s’mores, helping gather the wood, and basking in the glow of Mom and Dad’s undivided attention. And maybe that level of attention is the number one reason it builds deeper connections. Camping forces you to deal with one another with fewer distractions, all while spending time together in a far more vulnerable state. Even if you are not truly roughing it, things are done a little differently outdoors. From cooking to bathing to sleeping comfortably, a little creativity is needed to make it all come together. Once you spend time camping, it becomes your superpower — there is no obstacle you can’t find a way around, through, or over. Camping behavior for kids is about helping with chores that seem more fun than the ones they whine about at home, obeying a new set of rules, and paying greater attention to their surroundings. They learn that silence is something to be cherished and that the sounds of nature are worth listening to. There’s a reason why scouting usually includes camping at some point — it builds kids up as they master new skills. Bonus: It may be easy to do a digital detox due to a lack of cell service or an easy way to recharge batteries. Camping is the proverbial running away from home you never got to do as a kid. Once you have a sleeping bag in your possession, there may be no stopping you. Before our daughter was born, Gary and I gave no thought to making a run for it on any given weekend. Two sleeping bags and an ice chest full of food were all we needed to go exploring. We gradually upgraded the gear and bought an actual camper, which made escaping even easier. We simply kept the camper loaded with everything but the food all season long. And of course, friends said our nomad days would be over once we had a baby. Boy did we prove them wrong. The camper became our cozy little family haven away from all of life’s challenges — like laundry and household chores. It was where we bonded as a super trio capable of tackling anything together. What you would spend on even the shortest 3-night cruise is enough to buy all the camping gear and groceries you need for a weekend, fill your car with gas, and pay the entrance fee to the nearest state or national park. Plus, then you have everything you need for the next time you run away from home. Melinda Crow has been writing about travel for 30+ years, long before there were “digital nomads” and “influencers.” And while at any given moment, she would rather be on a cruise ship anywhere in the world, she lives in Central Texas (yes, near Waco, and no, she does not know Chip and Joanna Gaines) with her award-winning photographer husband, Gary, 12 peacocks, two horses and one lazy cat. Besides writing frequently for Cruise Critic, she is the author of Camping Colorado and Camping New Mexico by Falcon Guides and blogs at FirstRead.Me."
Medium.com,Life,How Sailing Across the Atlantic Freed Me In Unimaginable Ways,Travel,https://blog.usejournal.com/how-sailing-across-the-atlantic-freed-me-in-unimaginable-ways-88d7f102b22a?source=topic_page---------160------------------1," It was a momentous journey, and the results were truly incredible! T
he journey started when I was 34. My 35th birthday was approaching. To set the scene for you — I lived a very comfortable lifestyle. I worked for a pharma company in Hampshire and lived alone in a four-bedroom detached house in Surrey. Owning a rental flat in an upmarket part of West London gave me a good additional income. I enjoyed regular visits from a cleaner and a gardener in addition to driving a brand new fancy convertible car. On the surface, all appeared to be going well for me — materially. However, material goods don’t equal happiness. I felt like I was dying. Although my life was comfortable, maybe it was a little bit too comfortable. I needed something but didn’t know what. Inside I was becoming miserable and dusty. My passion for pretty much everything was gone. I was just going through the motions. Every day I wanted to get into bed after work. Going to work the next day was incredibly painful. It was like a spiritual death — that of a bored, unfulfilled, but materially satisfied 34-year-old living a dull corporate life. My birthday. It was time to make up my mind. How should I celebrate what seemed to be quite a milestone of a birthday? Should I do the usual and invite friends over for a BBQ .. or should I find something to do that was more memorable? Something that might even give me a bit of a buzz? I found it. It was a sail over to France on a 72-foot-long ex-Whitbread racing yacht. It was refreshing to get out and do something completely different. The breeze blew away my cobwebs. I met some new people. The crew were friendly and recounted to me about the time they sailed the boat across the Atlantic Ocean. I found those tales had an ingredient that I was craving. There was something a little terrifying but compelling about crossing an ocean by boat. I needed more life in my life. During the following weeks, I couldn’t get it off my mind. I knew I had to do it. It was my next chapter whether I wanted it or not. I felt as though there was no other move I could make. I had no major relationship in my life beyond my parents and friends. Apart from work, all I had were a few financial commitments, it was now or never. Something you may want to note is that I’m a health and safety freak. Probably the result of having a very cautious and nervous mother. The kind of girl who is not steady on her feet, not the type to be a tree climber and lacking in body confidence. I’d been a recognised athlete as a teenager, but running along a track is not like hanging onto a rocking yacht that is moving swiftly through ocean-sized waves. After research, I chose the safest boat I could find. It had all the safety features that I knew about. It also came with tuition from a highly experienced captain on how to sail. I had done some sailing before, but nothing much although I did have my Competent Crew certificate. I took the plunge and booked the trip. Along with the confirmation was a list of items to bring with me. The trip was in May and it was now only October. On the night of the work Christmas party, my team insisted that I learned how to hang on tight by riding one of those automated rodeo bulls. The fact that I didn’t last long on his slippery slidey back was perhaps a little worrying. The thought of me sailing across the Atlantic and being so small and vulnerable to an ocean that is formidable and unmatchable frightened me. I felt the fear of it. I’d wake in the night and ask myself what I thought I was doing. It scared the beejeebers out of me. But, still, I had to go. I told my work colleague how I was freaking out, but that I would still have to do it. Overcoming my own fear inspired her to take the leap to emigrate to New Zealand with her husband. She’s been there for 14 years. Another friend told me that after I had done it, I would never be the same again. It would give me a new level of confidence. In some ways, it has but it’s given me more in other ways. I was packed for the journey with all the right gear. I flew to Antigua to meet my crewmates. It was hot, mosquito-ridden and sweaty. Almost immediately I developed a collection of large bright red welts on my pale Irish-genes skin from mozzie bites. Another discovery was how difficult it is to sleep in a very hot boat! We sailed to St Maarten the next day to buy food for the trip. Once we had moved our provisions onto the boat, we set off into the Atlantic. This for me was the scariest part. The captain put us into two groups of three for the sail. We had shifts of six hours on and six hours off taking it in turns to steer so that we were occupied and didn’t get bored for the five-week trip. The goal was to learn as much as we could about sailing and Captain Julian confirmed to us that he would be sharing his deep knowledge with us. Despite that, things didn’t go that way at all. We were told that coming along with us was a tall leggy 22-year-old girl who was to be our cook. Within a very short time, the inevitable happened. The egotistical captain and the cook began an affair and the crew were not impressed at having paid big money for very little access to the captain, let alone any decent tuition. The captain was following the cook around like a puppy and they would disappear beneath the deck for hours at a time. The journey continued. Some days we appeared to be in the same spot that we’d passed through several days ago. Being in a place where the horizon is a circle around you gives that impression if the weather looks the same every few days. Day and night we’d be out on the deck taking in the elements. Ironically, I clocked the fastest time on the yacht by sailing down large waves. My fear subsided a little as time passed. There were still times when I asked myself why I hadn’t just taken up knitting or crochet or something tame and safe instead of insisting to myself that I had to take this trip. Hitting rough weather that caused the ceiling panels to fall on my head in my cabin didn’t help. After three weeks, we landed at the first islands going east from the Caribbean — the Azores. The captain and cook overnighted in a hotel. Captain Julian was lost in the throes of his conquest and the sweet nectar of lust. The crew were frustrated and ill-tempered. There was even talk of a type of mutiny. What made things worse was that for the last few days of the sail to the Azores, I got picked on for being the weakest link. I was somebody to show their displeasure to and apply their frustration to. Since the first day on board, I had shown that I wasn’t like them. I had spent the first day feeling uncomfortable. I sat on the cockpit floor as we ventured into the Atlantic, making sandwiches for lunch. My sailing experience was limited and my confidence very low. I didn’t know what it actually meant to ‘sail across the Atlantic’. Were the waves going to be big? What if we came across a nasty storm and we were hundreds or thousands of miles from land? I had seen ‘The Perfect Storm’ and it was petrifying. The teasing made me feel like I was playing the part of Piggy in Lord of the Flies. Somebody who the others could pick on. It was beginning to wear on my sensitivities and I spent our first night in the Azores in tears. I wasn’t actively looking for an escape, but strangely, I was handed it on a plate. I met an English sailor and his son in Peter’s Sportsbar in Horta — the pub for all sailors who transited through the Azores. They were looking for another person to sail with them to England. The pair invited me to join them and even baited my soon to be ex-crew members for being unkind to me on the trip. Surprising myself, I stole away with them after having had more than a few drinks and we went back to the boat and I took my things. The next day we left. Myself and the son shared a bucket for the hangover as we hit the high seas. My new English captain was taking his luxury yacht back to the UK to sell it. He’d just spent ten years sailing it around the Caribbean and had purchased a piece of land on a Caribbean island ready to build a hotel. As darkness came over the boat, I felt frightened. What had I done? I had leapt into the unknown and was now travelling out at sea with people who I didn’t even know. I hadn’t checked out what kind of boat safety precautions and equipment they had. Any questions asked on the previous night were a blur. I was very worried. I started shaking so much that the captain had to give me a ‘chill pill’. I felt sick with worry. I called my mother as we were leaving the cell phone coverage of the island. She was furious and in a mess about the risk I was taking. The English Captain and his son were very well to do and my gut instinct wasn’t warning me that this was an entirely bad move to make. He must know what he is doing to have such a boat and to have had years of experience sailing it. When I got back to England, I was informed that my previous love-sick Captain hadn’t taken kindly to me leaving the boat, despite it not being something that I had wanted to do. Perhaps if he hadn’t been so ‘busy’ he would have attended to his official duties and the crew would have stayed more in line with how they should have and could have. Captain Julian was annoyed enough for him and his wife to take it upon themselves to send an email to alert everybody on their newsletter list that I had absconded. This list included my friends and work colleagues. The newsletter detailed how I had met a man in the pub and run off with him. It put me in a very bad light. I have no idea to this day who read that email. However, it is very ironic considering what was going on and he had the cheek to have his wife write it too. All this was unbeknownst to me at the time. Back on the more comfortable and spacious boat, I felt better the next day. We had a routine where we played crib and had drinks three times a day. The food was outstanding. Banana pancakes for breakfast, homemade bread and mahi-mahi for dinner. That took my mind off worry and the boat was bigger and more luxurious than the one I’d paid to travel on. It even had sails that were controlled by electric buttons and a full-sized washing machine. The journey was fabulous. The sunrises and sunsets were amazing and we often had dolphins with us. It was a breath of fresh air to travel with people who didn’t find it necessary to point out my failings. I felt free. I was now away from the crew who had taken a nasty turn and was enjoying myself. I was also free from the stresses of living in the UK where letters were delivered daily either pressuring you to buy something or to pay a bill or requesting you to conform to some new requirement or regulation. The pressure of living with all those constant communications was not something I was fully aware of until I left it all behind me. Now it was my time to go through a transformation. My new captain showed me images of the piece of land he was buying for his new hotel on the Caribbean island. This was a man who did what he wanted to do rather than what he had to do. He wasn’t pressured into doing a job that he had no care for.. a boring corporate job like mine. I had a lot of time to think. I helped with watches on the boat at night, but otherwise, I was free to do what I wanted. I spent a lot of my time sitting and looking out to sea. As my contribution to the new team, I also did most of the washing up. My biggest decision on this 2nd leg of the trip was whether I should wash my hair that day or not. It came to me that my work life had always been a series of positions that fitted into what I believed I should be doing. What other people thought I should be doing. What the English Captain was doing was the polar opposite of that. He was doing what he wanted to do. There was no whiff of him doing what was expected of him. It was my first exposure to a life model of this type and it opened my eyes to another way. When we reached the UK, I realised I had to get out of where I was. I had to make a change. The house went up for rent. The English Captain came and boarded up my loft. It was a place to store my belongings up there whilst I was away. I sold my fancy corporate-income-style car and resigned from the “boring job” in Basingstoke. After visiting the English Captain on his new piece of hotel land, I flew out to one of the more commercial Caribbean islands and took a job in the marine industry. This was part of my journey to becoming the freelance writer and marketer that I am today. I now run my marketing business from a Caribbean island, spending a few months each year in the UK. Every day I look out at the uplifting view you see in the image below and I’m happy to tell you that there isn’t even a postman here or a place for letters to be received! The English Captain built his hotel and hired me for the marketing of it. I also do marketing work for the people who previously employed me in the marine industry. Going across the Atlantic freed me from the chains of corporate life, other people’s expectations, miserable winters and a life of drudgery. It freed me from the pressures that come with living in a highly regulated country like the UK, a place where letters and pizza flyer ads landing on the mat is never-ending! Who would have thought that this would be the result of a weekend sailing trip to France? When you’re in something, you don’t realise there is more to life unless you take a risk. I took that risk and now I can never look back! If I were to give any words to those who feel stuck, I’d say to consider stepping outside of the comfort zone and try something new. You have no idea what may come of it."
Medium.com,Life,Things You Have To Do Before You Travel The World (And How To Do Them),Travel,https://medium.com/@romanarai/things-you-have-to-do-before-you-travel-the-world-and-how-to-do-them-e7dc5e1d361c?source=topic_page---------161------------------1," But you don’t have to follow any of this. Just go! Sometimes it might seem I’ve been granted this pass to go party all over the world because of an inheritance, rich partner or an account that fills up when I ask it too. None of this is true. Travelling is not that difficult. It’s also not that easy, but with a dream, a plan and set priorities it’s possible. I know I sound like a page out of Gwyneth Paltrow’s guide to life (out of touch with reality) but just stay with me. 1. Buy Your First Plane Ticket As Soon As You Make The Decision To Travel You can talk about travelling all you want but if you don’t take action right away, there will be no motivation. Print out your ticket and pin it to a wall you look at every day. It will be there to remind you not to tell Karen to stuff a corkscrew in her hole when she says you look tired for the fourth time this week. It will be there to motivate you to get up when you’re sick but your boss still wants you to come into work because “Jane was sick too but she is here and working!” [Jane’s a narc] 2. Save Money (duh)- Make Travel Your Everything You’ll need money, of course. If you are reading this and you don’t have a job, go get a job. If you can’t get a job, then make one. I’m talking to you, Netflix binging couch potato. I’m not talking to someone living in a country where jobs are impossible to obtain, I’m talking to people who sit and say- “I wish I could” when they can.
There’s a difference between deciding to travel the world and sitting at home, drinking and complaining about how life is hard and you wish you could travel. If you have your daily life all set, it’s time to start saving. You can do the usual save-10%-of-your-paycheck bullshit or you can do that plus sacrifice some things. Eat at home. Next time Jessica wants to check out the new tapas bar tell her you don’t want to pay 40$ for two pieces of cheese and old olives, or just say you’re busy. You’ll have real tapas in Barcelona. Drink at home. Do you really need to pay 15$ for a glass of wine? Or do you want to have domestic Chilean wine in Chile? Don’t buy clothes anymore. I don’t mean walk around naked, if you really need something, buy it in an outlet. If you’re one of those that will pay a fortune for a t-shirt because it’s a brand name you will have to let go of your vanity and get over yourself. Sure, sometimes, wearing the same clothes for a fuckin year gets old but you know what also gets old? Being 30 years old and asking for permission to go eat. Get a side gig. Or a few. I had my full-time job, but I also had a staffing agency, taught Croatian, worked events as a server, bartender even a busser, handed out flyers, ghostwrote articles online, was a bridesmaid for hire, transcribed audio files, played a brand ambassador, was part of marketing research for cable tv and a bakery. I thought I could teach yoga but I realized I can’t teach yoga. I was offered 500$ to yell at a guy once, but that seemed too sketchy. You’d be surprised by the amount of side cash you can make if you just go to the Craigslist gigs section and filter through all the prostitution ones. ( I mean you can do that too, but try to stay away.) I would find the gig offered, do some background research to make sure it’s a legit offer, let everyone know where I’m going, and I never had anything bad happen to me. People often want to work as little as possible, I do too, but to work as little as possible you have to throw in some 18 hour days because you weren’t born rich. Unless you were, you lucky bastard. 3. Do your research. Making a decision to see an unknown part of the world is intense enough, but seeing it without doing any research about the place you are visiting is just an extra added intensity no one really needs. What are the safe neighbourhoods in Bogota? What is the tipping culture in Prague? What is offensive in Japan? What outlets do countries use? (Why can’t we all just agree on an outlet???) These are the questions you need to know the answers to before going unless you’re like me three years ago and your thing is to just see how it goes (but trust me, I do my research now). 4. Shots (not of tequila) For South America and Asia we needed: Yellow fever, Typhoid, Tetanus, Hep A, Hep B and my personal favourite — Japanese Encephalitis — a disease spread through mosquito bites. Symptoms include fever, headache, vomiting, confusion, and difficulty moving. Symptoms that develop later include swelling around the brain and coma. You can pick and choose. After a while, you’ll realize you don’t necessarily need all these but… if you can! Also, we learned that FUCKIN POLIO still exists and that we have to get a year supply of malaria pills to drink every day and 2 weeks after our trip. Thank fuck we went for this consultation so early because there are shots you have to get two or three times and schedule in advance. Even though a lot of shots were covered by OHIP (thank you Canada), it still all came to 800$ per person. If you live in the Toronto area, I highly suggest Travel Med. They are nice, professional and give you solid advice. (I’m not sponsored by them) 5. De-clutter. It’s time to let go of your stuff. Make a packing list [click here to download the minimalist packing list] and put the things you’ll need for your trip aside. Then, create a safe box (one box where you’ll put things you just absolutely can’t let go), give that box to someone to keep for you and sell/donate everything else. Do whatever you need to. I hugged my shoes, kissed a coat and thought I was going to miss them, but until right now, for this post, I did not think of any of my old stuff. Let them go, be free. 6. Get Your Paperwork in Order. Unless you want to be lost in a gypsy neighbourhood in Vienna (happened to me) get all your Visas and copies of passports.
Write down the phone numbers of the people you can call if your phone gets stolen.
Write down the numbers — and addresses of your embassies in your destinations.
Write down your accommodation numbers and addresses. 7. Plan — B Not the birth control (do have that handy too) but think of the what-ifs. If you spend more money than you planned; How can you save money while travelling? Set up a Workaway account where you can work for accommodation and get a Couchsurfing account, so you can save some money, learn new things and meet new people. Freelance: Any existing skill can be used to make money. Hostels: You can always go to a hostel and work for a bit, they like foreigners to get involved and you can get free accommodation or food. Just be careful not to take local jobs away. If your stuff gets lost or stolen Have a piece of paper with the number of someone you can count on back home or do the crazy thing and memorize it.
Give copies of your cards and documents to a trusted person so you can access the numbers if you need to. Try to divide your money into more cards, cash and never carry all at once. If you are on the bus — keep your valuables in front of you, or under your clothes.
Tape them to yourself if you need to. Practice staying calm under pressure — maybe work in the service industry for a bit. You have to have the patience of a saint and skin tougher than sandpaper to work as a server in North America (shout out to that one lady from who called the cops on me because I refused to move people from the shade so she could sit there). It comes in handy when you travel. 8. Time To Stop Thinking — Just Go If I was waiting for a sexy bank account I’d still be planning to go on my first trip. The idea of travelling the world gets scarier the closer it gets. Discipline your mind to think it’s excited, not nervous.
It’s scary to go to the unknown, it’s scarier to wake up and realize you’ve lived a life of comfort and boredom."

Medium.com,Life,Unique Places: The Ouray Ice Park,Travel,https://medium.com/core-shot/unique-places-the-ouray-ice-park-40eb25b8c79c?source=topic_page---------163------------------1," The Ouray Ice Park is, basically, a free, outdoor, ice-climbing gym. Yes — it’s as unique as it sounds. There can’t be many places like this in the world. The Ouray Ice Park is located in Ouray, Colorado, a sleepy little mountain town in Southwestern Colorado (USA). Southwestern Colorado lacks the big cities of the Front Range (Denver, Boulder, Colorado Springs), but it is indisputably the best part of Colorado (try not to tell anyone). SW Colorado has less people, better mountains, more scenery, and amazing access to outdoors sports like fishing, hunting, climbing, kayaking, canyoneering… the list goes on. The region is well worth checking out. Ouray is about a six-to-seven hour drive from Denver. It’s far enough away that if you’re traveling from Denver to Ouray, you want to consider at least making a long weekend of it — which is what we did during Super Bowl weekend last year. We arrived on Wednesday evening, climbed on Thursday, Friday, Saturday, and Sunday. We hit the road around 4 o’clock on Sunday, and returned to the Front Range very early Monday morning. Cars in the Ouray Ice Park parking lot seemed to be a pretty even distribution between Colorado, New Mexico, Utah, and Arizona license plates. In the early 1980s, climbers noticed that a large water pipe running along the top of the Uncompahgre Gorge, right outside of Ouray, was leaking. Those leaks were forming 80-foot icicles down into the gorge — exactly the sort of beautiful formations which ice climbers drool over. Local climbers started knocking more holes in the pipe, intentionally, to form new ice climbs. When word got out about the climbs, more climbers started to come to Ouray. To meet the demand, more holes were punched, and more climbs created. This led, over the years, to the formation of the modern Ouray Ice Park. Today, the maintenance of the ice climbs is a little more involved, as you can read about here, or see in the video below: You can read more about the history of the Ouray Ice Park on their website. Today, the park has over a mile of nearly-contiguous, artificial ice climbs. On its website, the Ouray Ice Park claims over 200 routes, but the park feels like it might easily contain even more. The Ouray Ice Park is supported by the Ouray Ice Festival, sponsorships, and donations. Although it doesn’t generate much money directly, the presence of the ice park is a huge stimulus for the businesses in the town of Ouray, which would otherwise be almost deserted during the winter. Ouray’s executive director Dan Chehayl explained it this way in a 2016 interview: Without the Ouray Ice Park, Ouray would be a ghost town in the winter. There was little to no economy before the park really began to take off in the early ’90s. Over the years, as the park grew and became more popular and more climbers visited and moved into town, the economy grew with it, until it eventually became the ice climbing mecca it is today. The local businesses and the community as a whole rely heavily on the park to keep their businesses going through the winter season. Ouray now has one of the largest climbing communities in the United States. Behind practically every door in town there is at least one climber, and it is a strong community where we are all friends and are all working together to protect our climbing resource and keep it sustainable as it grows each year. It is a very welcoming community as well-new climbers roll into town every day and are welcomed with open arms. — https://www.smithsonianmag.com/travel/ouray-world-ice-climbing-park-180958428/ The Ouray Ice Fest is an annual weekend celebration and fundraiser for the ice park. The ice park raises more than half its annual operating revenue during this weekend. Although the weekend of the Ouray Ice Fest is the most crowded the park will ever be, it’s probably the best time to come visit. The atmosphere is festive, and for just $5 you can demo all the gear you’d like, including expensive jackets, ice tools, crampons, and mountaineering boots. In addition to affordable gear demos, many ice climbing classes are offered during the Ouray Ice Fest. I’d say the majority of these are “intro to ice climbing” classes or similar novice-level courses, but there are also more advanced offerings like: “how to lead ice”, “steep ice” and “intro to mixed climbing”. The clinics and seminars at the Ice Fest are taught by mountain guides and professional climbers. Some of the presenters in 2019 included Conrad Anker, Margot Talbot, David Lama, and Will Gadd. In 2019, these clinics cost $80 each. If you prefer watching to doing, pro climbers compete in the Elite Mixed Climbing Competition and the Speed Climbing Competitions during the Ice Fest. The speed competition takes place on an artificial wall, while the mixed competition climbs natural routes with significant rock sections (mixed climbing = mixed rock and ice). These competitions can be a real spectacle, with some of the best in the world coming to compete. There ARE other man-made ice climbing parks in the USA, including one in Lake City, Colorado, and a couple small ones in Minnesota (near the cities of Sandstone and Winona). Exum Guides used to operate an ice park in Jackson, Wyoming, but the land was sold and it’s currently closed. Ouray is undoubtedly the biggest ice park in the continental United States. As I said before, there can’t be many places like Ouray in the world. There’s the Eispark Osttirol in Austria, and an INDOOR ice climbing facility in Scotland called Ice Factor … but those are the only two venues *I* know of that compare to Ouray in scope and ambition. It wouldn’t surprise me if the Poles or the Russians had something like this… but I don’t speak Polish or Russian. ( Know of any others? Leave em in the comments!) Despite being (maybe) the largest ice park in the world, Ouray doesn’t seem like a big deal. Parking is free, admittance is free, and as long as you’re not endangering the lives of others, you can pretty much do what you want. The park estimates it receives between 7,000 and 8,000 visitors per year. Your local ski resort gets that number of visitors in a day, I bet. Ice climbing, by its nature, will probably always remain an extremely fringe sport. Although that certainly didn’t stop some of the old-timers on our crew from complaining that “back in the day”, there were less people and more ice. We spent three days climbing in the Ouray Ice Park, in the Schoolroom, South Park, and New Funtier areas. We also scared ourselves silly on the long routes near Pic of The Vic. Climbers pictured in this post are a mix of friends and strangers. All photos are mine. On the fourth and final day of our trip, we went into the mountains around Ouray to climb some alpine ice, which was a great change of pace compared to climbing in the park. More on the ice climbing around Ouray, a little further down. But first, let’s explore the Ice Park itself. The Ice Park is a great way to learn to ice climb, or for an intermediate climber to put in some miles without the long drives, approaches, and avalanche danger that usually characterize alpine waterfall ice climbing. The park is accessible, and anchoring is straightforward. Lead climbing is never required. Climbers can easily walk along the top of the climbs and anchor off using bolted anchor stations or the abundant trees that live along the top of the gorge. After setting your top-rope anchor, climbers can either rappel in, be lowered, or walk down into the canyon using fixed ropes. The park does have a couple rules: you cannot occupy any anchor for more than three consecutive hours, and you cannot occupy an anchor and then leave the rope idle. This is to prevent people bogarting climbs. From the parking lot to the closest climbs, one needs to walk less than 100 meters. To reach the farthest climbs in the park, it’s a moderate hike of one mile (1.6 kms). You could walk to the ice park from town, if you wanted to put in a little extra alpine training. Medical assistance is never far away in case of an emergency, and other climbers are always nearby to lend a helping hand if you need someone to double-check your anchor or help you out with the belay. When you get cold and tired and want a beer, it’s a quick and easy process to collect your gear, head back to town, and enjoy an adult beverage inside a nice warm building (or hot tub). The ratio of lead climbers to top-ropers in the Ouray Ice Park is probably 1:10. Maybe even worse. Could be 1:20. I wasn’t really counting. Part of this is due to the fact that the ice park is a zoo, with lots of novices and guided groups kicking down ice and crowding routes. Part of this is the fact that not a lot of people lead ice to begin with. And part of it is due to ice quality. Since the ice at the Ouray Ice Park is so frequently climbed, destroyed, and re-formed, it holds a lot of air. A couple of experienced ice climbers told me that they don’t like to lead in the park because of the ice quality. Lead climbing * is* allowed in Ouray, but make sure to occupy the top anchor of the climb before you start leading, so that other parties don’t throw a rope down on you. I saw two visiting Spanish climbers learn this the hard way, when they racked up at the bottom of a route to start leading it, only to have someone throw a rope down from above, and snake their route before they could even swing one tool. Lección aprendida. We chose to visit Ouray the weekend AFTER the ice fest, so as to avoid the crowds. This was Super Bowl Weekend (practically an American holiday). Even still, almost every route in the park was occupied on Saturday and Sunday. We were able to find sufficient routes for our group to climb pretty comfortably, but we were a lot of people, and able to pretty easily string up multiple ropes and rotate between climbs. The weekdays were blissfully empty. If possible, I recommend visiting the Ouray Ice Park on a weekday. The Ice Park was created because Ouray sits at a favorable location to form waterfall ice. There are plenty of long smears and beautiful alpine routes in the mountains surrounding the town, for those looking for more of an adventure than can be found at the Ice Park. Telluride’s Bridalveil Falls is the undisputed jewel of the area, and a testpiece for ice climbers from all across the world (Read a great trip report, here). There are also a number of gnarly climbs just outside of Ouray itself, including The Ribbon and Bird Brain Boulevard. Smaller, less intimidating climbs are around too, if you know where to look. Sunday morning, after a bout of drinking the night before, we got off to a slow start. It was the last day of our climbing trip; we’d climbed the three previous days, and many of our group were leaving: tired; or hungover; or pregnant. Five of us still had the stoke to continue. It was warm and raining lightly in Ouray, which never makes for fun ice conditions. If it’s warm enough for liquid to fall as water, it’s also warm enough for waterfall ice to melt. Into your face. As you’re trying to climb up it. That’s an experience best avoided. If you drive to the Ouray Ice Park and continue driving, you’ll end up on Camp Bird Road. This road is located along a steep valley, where significant ice seems to form. We only elevated about 100 or 200 meters (300–600 feet) from the town, but that climb was enough to yield significant changes in the weather. While it was sunny and rainy in Ouray, several inches of fresh powder lay on the ground at Camp Bird. Perfect. It was like walking inside of a perfectly dusted snowglobe. We continued up, found some ice all to ourselves, and spent our afternoon swinging sharp pointy things, going up and down. After three days climbing with crowds in the park, this was a perfect change of pace. After the weather turned more ominous and cold, we hopped in our cars and headed for home. Half the crew was from Grand Junction, so they were home in just three hours or so. The rest of us had a long, seven-hour drive back to the Front Range. It passed quickly, in a tired, satisfied haze. In winter, not much. “That’s why I like this place,” said one of the Ouray veterans on my trip. “You know everyone you see is either a local, or a climber. There’s no other reason to be here,” they added, laughing. There are five hot springs pools in or around Ouray: My party raved about the Orvis hot springs non-stop, but unfortunately, we never made it there on this trip. Sad!! There are a few restaurants and bars in town, but the whole place is more or less shut down by 10 or 11, even on a weekend night. Bring food and cook at your condo — you’re going to be exhausted after a day of climbing. Duckett’s Market on the main street has a decent selection of food at reasonable prices. There are a few bars and breweries in Ouray. Take your pick, but don’t expect much of a wild, late-night scene. We went to the Ourayle House on both nights we went out. Someone in our party had a loud and affectionate love for it. They called it “my favorite bar in the entire world.” I will admit: this place certainly had a very strong flavour! Whether you’ll enjoy it or not, I can’t say. (The TripAdvisor reviews reveal a pretty distinct division between those who “get it” and those who “don’t get it”) [This bar might deserve it’s own post. Unfortunately, we forgot about the flash on our disposable camera, which meant we ruined a lot of pictures here.] The bartender (alias Mr grumpypants) closed the bar, with us in it, around 10 both nights. We walked the three blocks back to our rental condo. I went to bed. Four of our party opened a bottle of whisky, and cracked in. In the morning, it was empty. Ouray is packed with tourists in the summer. The town’s location in the mountains is incredible, and it offers easy access to tons of nearby 14ers (14,000+ foot mountains), jeep tours, fishing, kayaking, hot springs, hiking, camping… the place is poppin’. So if you want to visit Ouray, go in summer, okay? Leave the winter for us ice climbers. Like Indian Creek, Ouray is one of those places that possesses a special energy. It’s rare; it’s unique; and it’s the sort of place that is becoming more difficult to find in this rapidly-shrinking world. Although the Ouray Ice Park can be crowded and artificial, the fact remains: there are few other places in the WORLD where you can rack up so much practice ice climbing in such a short period of time, with such minimal hassle. I felt that my skill level and confidence as an ice climber increased exponentially during the four days we spent in Ouray. Ouray is well worth a visit for any experienced or aspiring ice climber, or for those who just want to get a taste of something extraordinary."

Medium.com,Life,"If You Travel Often Enough, There May Be a Bus in Your Future",Travel,https://medium.com/traveltruth/if-you-travel-often-enough-there-may-be-a-bus-in-your-future-e4f9bc7ad1d?source=topic_page---------167------------------1," Here’s how to make the best of it. Love it or hate it, one of the truths about life as a travel writer is that we spend quite a bit of time on busses. It’s not always an ideal method of experiencing an area and not even an efficient mode of transportation in terms of speed. But when a group of like-minded travelers need to get from point A to point B (like on cruise excursions), it’s probably going to involve a bus. I was recently on a bus with a very mixed group of travel “reporters.” I’m using that term rather than my preferred terminology of “travel journalists” or “travel writers” or “travel bloggers” because while the group included those, there were also a number of “influencers” — those strange in-betweeners who’s writing generally involves more words with hashtags than without. Many of the influencers onboard specialized in something other than travel itself. The destination was more of a backdrop for fashion or whatever their Instagram accounts specialized in. That, plus the fact that some of us were quite jet-lagged led me to make some observations about the many ways to survive — and dare I say it — enjoy a lengthy bus ride. There’s an art to choosing a good seat on a long bus trip. With any luck at all, your journey will be on a cushy, full-size “coach.” These seats are always comfortable, so the decision on where to sit mostly comes down to convenience. For example, if you need to charge a device, look for a row with an outlet — I’ve been on buses with alternating rows. Gary and I like to be near the rear door, preferably the row directly behind it. There are two reasons. We like to get off quickly, and the gap for the door creates a wider field of view. Consider your seatmate when you choose seating for an extended trip, keeping the seats in all directions in mind. If your plan is to sleep, you certainly don’t want to sit near a loud talker. One more seating tip. If your bus is one of those smaller jobs, like the off-site car rental transfer “buses” found at many airports, do not under any circumstances sit in the rear. I won’t even sit there during a two-minute ride at the airport. What happens is that the rear of the bus sticks out well behind the rear axle. It makes for an incredibly bumpy ride in that unsupported backend. You’re going to be looking at bus butts now, aren’t you? The same people who pile into an airplane lugging neck pillows, headphones, water bottles, eye masks and smelly fast food bags for a one-hour flight somehow forget all of that on a three-hour bus ride. Bring it on people. This is the reason to bring your comfort items. You often won’t know until your butt is in the seat that the driver plans to make the trip in one go. Plus, traffic. We were once caught in a massive traffic jam in Guatemala on a bus. (Okay, travel truth moment here — all of Guatemala was a traffic jam.) Let’s just say it’s a good thing that the guide brought tiny packs of nuts (like smaller than airplane-size) or there may have been a homicide on that bus. So of course, the opposite is true. Your bus may stop for every goat crossing, every person standing beside the road and at every scenic lookout. That’s a good thing generally. Hopefully it means you can get off and stretch, possibly use some facilities, buy the snack you should have brought with you, and maybe even interact with the locals, yes, even the goats. Plan for those stops by having the correct currency in small bills and coins. You never know when the facilities require payment. You came all the way to this place where you now find yourself on a bus and have someone who lives here telling you what it’s like? Score! That usually is the best part of a bus trip. Okay, I’ve had a dud here and there, but in general, having a guide onboard is a big win. Put down your phone. Stay awake. Stop loud talking so that everyone else can hear. If you want to know where in the heck you are, it’s usually pretty simple. Map the route on your phone as if you were doing the driving. You’ll know the approximate time of arrival, traffic snags ahead, and what interesting things you might pass along the way. I’ve been that person who is so feverishly jet-lagged that nothing would keep my eyes open on a long bus ride to my final destination, so I understand sometimes you have to make the choice between arriving a tad more refreshed so you can enjoy what you actually came to see and watching the trees and farms fly by. You’ve got to do what you’ve got to do. If you know that your group is smaller than the capacity of the bus, feel free to spread out a little. Nobody else cares. If there is not a guide on board sharing insight, you can always take the opportunity to meet those seatmates you so carefully chose, if you don’t know them already. Making new acquaintances is often a bonus perk of any method of travel. Bus travel somehow gets a bad rap. We laud train travel as a charming way to journey through the countryside. I’m going to tell you that while I have loved the view from some train rides, there have been others that consisted almost entirely of tunnels of green intermittently broken by rail yards filled with graffiti-covered train cars, sooty industrial complexes and abandoned buildings (and I’m not just talking about Cleveland.) So what if you didn’t fly to Germany to see farm animals and wind turbines. It is all part of the experience. Every. Beautiful. Minute. A good travel experience is an education. It should open your eyes, not only to the most Instagram-able sights but to the mundane manner in which we all go about living. Travel is life. Melinda Crow has been writing about travel for 30+ years, long before there were “digital nomads” and “influencers.” And while at any given moment, she would rather be on a cruise ship anywhere in the world, she lives in Central Texas (yes, near Waco, and no, she does not know Chip and Joanna Gaines) with her award-winning photographer husband, Gary, 12 peacocks, two horses and one lazy cat. She is the author of Camping Colorado and Camping New Mexico by FalconGuides and blogs at FirstRead.Me."
Medium.com,Life,Forgotten Rails: A Photo Essay,Travel,https://medium.com/@TheunisCStofberg/forgotten-rails-a-photo-essay-139395846807?source=topic_page---------168------------------1," As our world moves faster and we are ever more glued to our cellphones between our double espresso coffees and twitter rants something has disappeared, something that has been the backbone of many nations for a century but is snow slowly vanishing. The sound of a train-whistle in the early morning and the rhythmic beat of metals wheels on metal rails is slowly quietening. In a search for my roots and my youth I visited a series of towns that were completely dependant on a railway system that has now become a part of history. I live in a suburb in a large town. Quiet and unassuming, middle-class, middle of the road. A leafy suburb filled with suburbanites, swimming pools and leaf-blowers making noise at unsuitable hours. But when the wind starts blowing from the North and the clouds start racing across the sky there is another sound that wakes me, the sound of a train hooting, of train-tracks squealing, of a broken tannoy system informing half awake commuters of the newest challenge to their timely arrival at work. It is the forgotten sounds of my youth, the sounds of a working railway system."

But I think I’m about to become that person. And so, too, I’m pretty sure, are a lot of you. My vice hasn’t been booze, dope, or cheap relationships. It’s been travel. I’ve been to 49 states (Maine, if you need it) and somewhere in the region of 75 countries. I’ve bunked down in grotty guesthouses in the Philippines, crashed on friends’ couches in Germany, upgraded to four-star suites in the Caribbean, and enrolled in loyalty programs from Starwood to Motel 6. For a number of years, I made my living as a travel writer and editor, enjoying the globetrotting lifestyle and encouraging others to partake. I wrote travel guides and books. I briefly edited a magazine for one of those cruise lines. I enjoyed the work, liked my co-workers, accepted the money. Back when I started traveling a lot in the 1990s, this made me a mildly interesting person to talk to at parties. But this is no longer the case. I have a schoolteacher, IT guys, government workers, even unemployed people in my life with more stamps in their passports than I have. According to various surveys, at least half or more of millennials would rather travel than do traditional things like buy a house and pay off debt. Americans aren’t unique: Tourism has become the habit of the world. In 2019, the United Nations World Tourism Organization (UNWTO) announced that international travel had increased, yet again, to 1.4 billion tourist arrivals. Like the data about warming oceans and melting polar ice, the figures measuring mass tourism have been surpassing forecasts years earlier than anticipated and are expected to continue their exponential climb. The UNWTO predicts a 3% to 4% annual increase in international travel. Travel is a drug, and a damn good one. Like any other user, I want to take a few more tokes while the good shit lasts. California offers the most striking example of wanton visitor growth in the United States. In 2018, the state saw 281.4 million tourists. That’s like inviting everyone in Indonesia, the world’s fourth most populous country, to traipse through the union’s most populous state each year. The Golden State’s popularity among visitors might account for the $35 I paid at New Brighton State Beach, south of the redwoods near Santa Cruz, to “camp” a few summers back. I pitched my tent in a site that literally abutted someone’s backyard. The flicker of the TV emanating from a room in their two-story house, not from my fire ring (a modified oil drum), provided atmosphere. That was the night I finally swore off camping in California. Elsewhere, the views are uglier, the reactions more dramatic. From Croatia to Thailand, anti-tourism campaigns are spreading. Most have appeared in a more or less organic and unconnected fashion. But it feels like only a matter of time before they metastasize into the next global cause célèbre."
Medium.com,Life,The Dharma Buddies of Auroville,Travel,https://medium.com/nomudnolotus-writer/the-dharma-buddies-of-auroville-e856ad729f8c?source=topic_page---------171------------------1," The water flows in from every state in India, from all corners of the earth, from as far as Siberia, even from nations on hostile terms, like the U.S. and Iran. It seeks its own level in a wide shallow basin where the procession marchers pour each precious vial, a peaceful solution. The Water Ceremony is the crowning celebration of the Golden Anniversary of Auroville, an intentional community in the southern Indian state of Tamil Nadu. Along with hundreds of others from near and far, I have gathered in the dark before dawn, as people have on this date for 50 years. We sit on clay-red steps of an amphitheater. The scuff and rasp of bare feet and saris settle into breath-filled silence. Each of us meditates on what feels like impossibly unanimous goodwill. With first light, a choir of voices elevates that feeling a few decibels. My eyes tear, gooseflesh raises. A roaring bonfire in the round reflects off the gold-leafed globe of the nearby Matrimandir, Sanskrit for “Temple of the Mother.” I recall spiraling up its dim chamber on Merino wool carpet to a shaft of natural light illuminating a large solid crystal. For the next hour, the water bearers, founders and their offspring, transport flasks. After each pouring, they insert blue teardrop-shaped placards into a grooved circle to reveal the water source. Next to the basin rises a lotus-shaped marble urn that contains soil from 124 nations, carried to Auroville’s inauguration in 1968. If it’s true that water holds memory, then this blending of the universal solvent perhaps will seep into world consciousness that once harmony reigned on our planet. That is my lofty idea as I marvel at this choreography of hope onstage. I think of the mingled sweat and sheer muscle power of the hundreds who shaped Auroville out of barren land in 1968, that water shed year. The Tower of Babel has nothing on this enterprise. Perhaps the thriving village with enlightened education, holistic healthcare, renewable energy projects, and sustainable farming is a microcosm of what can exist on a bigger scale. For a month here, I avoid the news that indicates otherwise. There is something patently special in this hallowed ground, the inspiration of one French Mirra Alfassa, spiritual collaborator of philosopher Sri Aurobindo. Their images abound in every corner, from the Town Hall to the visitor center to the grocery store. Referred to with reverence as the Mother, Alfassa joined forces with Aurobindo in the 1920s at the ashram in nearby Pondicherry where they lived and taught his defining belief: How we humans will evolve into “supra-mental” beings. Founders envisioned a populace of 50,000, but—many are called, few are chosen—Aurovillians today number a steadfast 2,500, representing some 50 countries, almost half of them Indian residents. Despite a dwindled vision, India and UNESCO have recognized this cultural treasure, offering financial support. To much pomp and ceremony, Prime Minister Modi even made a rare visit for the 50th anniversary, paying homage to the community’s endurance. To me the village feels like a giant free-form ashram, preferable to those where bells and gongs insist on strict schedule adherence. Many tranquil corners spread out from the central Peace Park where silence is observed. One evening under the waxing moon, as devotees embraced a giant banyan, a resident enchanted us playing her Tibetan bells. The sound waves floated like haloes over the Matrimandir that rises round and golden from twelve lotus petals (containing smaller meditation rooms). I tool around the mostly unpaved network of roads and trails on an electric bicycle, taking advantage of yoga classes, Ayurvedic massage, and frequent cultural events in the various pavilions and communes. Many events are free to all and everything is cheap. Food, lodging, and all business owners give a third or more of their profits to the town coffer in what seems a respectable compromise with capitalism. For about $17 a night, I lodge at Avision guest house among acacia and neem trees. My host works daily on his vision: a hydroponic greenhouse, soon to supply the town with organic leafy greens. My primary reason for coming to Auroville has been to connect with good friends Oga and Carsten. They live in Berlin and come here often to escape their harsh winters. We have known each other since the 1990s when we became dharma buddies at the San Francisco Zen Center. We all support the noble aspirations of the colony— “human unity in diversity.” But Oga is the one who puts her actions where our beliefs are. She volunteers her services, as visitors are encouraged to do while here. Gardens, farms, education, food service, and city maintenance can all use help. Korean by birth, Oga assists Wonja, owner of Goyo (meaning inner stillness), a Korean restaurant in the commune Luminosité. Oga helps cook and translate the daily menu into English, the local lingua franca. Twice during my stay, I have the honor of being one of only fifteen diners who sit around Goyo’s long table, eating in silence. The vegetarian meal served buffet style is delicious and copious. The second time we eat at Goyo, do-gooder Oga has invited a dozen Indian women from Life Education Center, where she also volunteers with its director, Devi, another dharma buddy (and native Indian who lived in Berkeley for years). The young women are shy but smile as I take photos of them, bedazzled by their swaying rainbow of saris. Although they come from neighboring Kottakarai, their home life is a distant cry from this utopia. It does not value a daughter’s education. When I see the intricate quilts, garments, and other textile work, that Devi guides them in making, I wonder if they know how skilled they are. I purchase a quilted purple and gold tapestried laptop case to support their handiwork (way underpriced). I admire that Auroville is no cloister but open-armed and outreaching to its disadvantaged neighbors. The boosted self-confidence of these few women is worth a thousand acts of diplomacy. The village’s multi-cultural population makes for a broad array of culinary options, from French and Italian to south and north Indian and all manner of Asian food, all of it breathtakingly inexpensive. Oga, Carsten, and I love trying it all. Part of the allure is just finding cafes tucked helter-skelter down a trail or hidden throughout the woodsy hamlet where mongoose chase each other across your path. The town is less a grid than a circular galaxy. Artsy signs near hidden paths and crossroads are helpful."

Medium.com,Life,Ten West,Travel,https://medium.com/@ryanerikduff/ten-west-11c75c58161c?source=topic_page---------173------------------1," Interstate 10, or I-10, or “the 10” as it’s known colloquially, is a trans-continental highway that travels east from the Pacific Ocean in Santa Monica (assuming you’re on the west coast) through Los Angeles and on towards Phoenix. From there it elbows south to Tucson, swings east again through Las Cruces, El Paso, and Scroggin’s Draw before reaching its Atlantic terminus in Jacksonville, Florida. Construction began in 1957 as part of President Eisenhower’s National Interstate Highway System and wasn’t completed until 1990 when they finished the Deck Park Tunnel near downtown Phoenix. It’s the section between Phoenix and LA I want to focus on, because it is that section that connects the city I live in (sing it!) to the city I’m from and it will, if I do this right, provide some sort of metaphorical resonance as to the point I’m trying to make when I wrap this thing up. So buckle in. Leaving Phoenix on I-10 heading west you pass through the pink stucco suburbs of Glendale, Tolleson, Avondale, Goodyear, and Litchfield Park. By the time you’ve reached the White Tank Mountains, you’re getting close to the formally remote, but quickly encroached upon, Buckeye. For most of my memory, you could spot a giant plywood baby sitting in a field somewhere around Goodyear. He was towering over a plywood tractor as a terrified plywood farmer ran for his life while a plywood woman wearing an apron, presumably the baby’s Mother, stood with her arms on her hips looking up sternly at her massive plywood son. This of course is gone because the universe needed another super-big-box-chain-restaurant-retail shopping center. Also around Goodyear, and before the real estate speculators arrived, you’d spot Trotter Park, an abandoned horse track purportedly owned by the mob. This “fact” had been repeated at least once on every California-bound road trips since time immemorial. I have no idea if it’s true. The tracks lesser known, but I think more important claim to fame is that it was blown up in the 1998 film No Code of Conduct starring Charlie and Martin Sheen and directed by Bret Michaels from the 80’s glam-metal band Poison. Past that is Tonopah and the Burnt Well Rest Area, the first, or depending on how tight your family’s ship runs, the last rest stop between Phoenix and Anaheim or Newport Beach or Dana Point. It’s here you know you’ve left the protective dome provided by Best Buy and Chili’s and are officially entering the harsh unforgiving desert. Not completely of course, you still have your vehicle and 373 miles of asphalt tethering you to civilization, but the veneer is more visible out here. For those unfamiliar, the Sonoran desert covers 260,000 square miles of southwestern North America. It extends from large portions of Arizona deep into the aptly named north Mexican state of Sonora. It spreads out a little into north-eastern Baja, and south-eastern Alta California, though these sections may well be considered different deserts as far as I’m concerned. The tell-tale sign you’re in the Sonoran desert, at least the main part, is the iconic Saguaro Cactus. It’s the tall, multi-armed cactus frequently used in logos for mediocre burrito places or seen in the background of classic Hollywood westerns set in Texas but shot in Arizona. It produces blossoms on top between April and June and its trunk provides shelter for Arizona’s state bird, the cactus wren. The fruit produced is a favorite of the white-winged dove, a notable mondegreen often misheard as “one-winged dove” in the chorus of Edge of Seventeen, a classic rock staple by fellow Sonoran native Stevie Nicks. Other common plants are the barrel cactus, prickly pear cactus, mesquite tree (recognizable from it’s dried seed pods) and my personal favorite the creosote bush, a small scrub plant who’s leaves are covered with an oil resin that when wet releases an aromatic scent many desert dwellers associate with “the smell of rain.” Temperatures during the summer months regularly reaches over 110 degrees. And rain fall is all but non-existent save for the few violent monsoon thunderstorms that roll through the area during July and August. If this weren’t enough to deter human settlement, the desert is also full of scorpions, rattlesnakes, coyotes, mountain lions and wild javelina. Honestly, the fact we’ve managed to build thriving cities in such an environment is, as stated by Bobby Hill from the animated show King of the Hill, “…a monument to man’s arrogance.” It’s okay though, you’ve got air conditioning in your car, and tunes on your phone. You should make it to Los Angeles in one piece. The next sign of civilization is Quartzite, a small town just east of the California border. Originally known as Tyson’s Well, it was at one point the last waterhole before you’d reach Erhenburg, a steamboat landing on the Colorado River 25 miles to the north. This of course was before we dammed the great river in order to build our sprawling Southwestern metropoli. (You’re welcome Vegas.) The most interesting thing about Quartzite, aside from being the cheapest place to get gas before you reach that eco-socialist-dystopia across the river, are the camel murals on the highway underpass. Apparently in the 1800s the United States Army imported a herd of camels from the middle east to help tame the Great American Desert. They were run by, among others, an Ottoman man of Greco-Syrian heritage named Hadji Ali. He became known to the local cowboys as “Hi Jolly.” The camels ultimately proved ineffective because they spooked the horses and mules, but Mr. Ali married, settled and was eventually buried in Quartzite where a modest pyramid monument in his name still stands. A little further west and you hit the once Mighty Colorado, the natural border between California and Arizona, home to the future Arizona Bay and the current agricultural town of Blythe, CA. Blythe is a great place to break down because it has a Hampton Inn, a Starbucks, and a Denny’s parking lot that doubles as both a safe place to sleep when you’ve been up for the past twenty-four hours and a moderately-safe place to teach your best friend Nate to drive stick because you’re to tired to drive and he has to make it back to work by 8:30 the next morning. These are just hypotheticals. From here you can continue straight on till morning or, if you have some time, take a detour south on California State Route 78. The desert here’s a harsh, desolate moonscape until you reach the North Algodunes Dune Wilderness Area, a large expanse of sand dunes used for dune buggy racing and, I assume, Mad Max LARPing. Up the road you’ll turn north on State Route 111 and drive along the eastern edge of the Salton Sea, a massive body of water created by an engineering accident in the early 1900s. You’ll know it’s the Salton Sea because it reeks of dead fish and instagram influencers, both of which contribute to the post-apocalyptic aesthetic of the once popular tourist destination. Before the fish die-off it was marketed to Hollywood elites as “the California Rivera,” a name now more appropriately applied to Santa Barbara. Around here you’ll also find the ever popular Salvation Mountain, a large mound of dirt covered in plaster, brightly colored paint and bible verses. The phrase “God is Love” is painted in big letters and a singular white cross is perched on top. The whole thing resembles an electric kool-aid Golgotha. It was created by now passed folk-artist Leonard Knight and is kept up by a group of volunteers. If you haven’t stopped, you really should. There’s something endearingly earnest about the whole project and in a world where religion is often used as tool of division, Mr. Knight seems to have created a faith inspired work that brings people together. Nearby is the desert dwelling community of Slab City, immortalized in Jon Krakauer’s great book Into the Wild and Sean Penn’s okay movie of the same name. Consisting of RV’s and make shift dwellings built on the abandoned concrete slabs of a former Marine Base, it’s the United State’s largest unincorporated squatter community and a popular place for LA’s failed-artist class to project their Kerouacian back-up plans. From here you can jump back on the 10 near the city of Indio. But before we get to that, what happens if you continued on from Blythe like a normal person. Not much you might think, and you’d be right, but there are a few things to pay attention to: Desert Center. Founded pre-interstate as the mid-way point between Blythe and Indio by an eccentric man named “Desert Steve,” it once boasted the suckers deal “Free Room and Board Every Day the Sun Doesn’t Shine in Desert Center.” It’s now a post office and RV park comprised of snow birds intent on eeking out their last days in the hot desert sun, and not worth stopping unless you’ve blown a tire and need to call a tow truck from Blythe. Chiriaco Summit. 19 miles west of Desert Center, this is a proper travel stop and decent bathroom for those of us whose ship doesn’t run quite so tight. It also comes complete with its very own General Patton Memorial and Museum. There’s a cool statue of the General and his dog, a few old tanks and though I’ve never seen it, a large map he used while planning war games in the Army’s former California-Arizona Maneuver Area. There’s also a small airfield nearby for those weekend Cessna fliers who chose to forgo the I-10 all together, but really need their George S. Patton fix. Cotton Springs Rd. 12 more miles past Chiriaco you’ll reach the turn off for Joshua Tree National Park, a place so magical it requires its own post. It’s one of my favorite spots on the planet and you should definitely check it out. Maybe bring mushrooms. I’ll also point out that during this desolate 100 mile stretch the drive reaches its most transcendent. I’d recommend putting on something like Epic by Kamasi Washington or Hallogallo by Neu and just enjoy cruising through the desert. Time your trip to arrive at this portion around sunset and you’ll see what I’m talking about. A side note: You may also notice that the desert has changed since crossing the Colorado. It’s still full of creosote, rocks and sand, but no more saguaros or other tell-tale flora. You’ve entered a sub-section known as the Colorado desert, it’s here we see the landscape transitioning toward the other great western desert, the Mojave. There’s actually a demarcation line inside Joshua Tree where ecologists have documented the switch. Nature’s great. Soon you’ll be heading down into Coachella Valley and re-entering the protective dome. You’re still on the periphery, but Target and Panda Express are silent reassurances that everything will be okay. The polo grounds are nearby and if it’s late spring the hoards of eponymous concert goers will have infiltrated the valley, so… happy hunting. Coachella Valley is surrounded on four sides by distinct mountains or mountain groups (ranges? I don’t know). Santa Rosa to the southwest, San Jacinto to the west, little San Bernardino to the east and the 11,500-foot tall San Gorgonio Mountain to the north. The place I stop most is the In-N-Out off Ramon Rd in Thousand Palms. In-N-Out’s been in Arizona and other states for years, but something about eating it in California seems to please the gods. Coachella Valley is also home to Palm Springs, so if you’d like hang out with some googie architecture, hip LGBT seniors, or the hot-rich (at least pretending to be) people at the ACE Hotel, take a detour here. Past this is the wind farm, the final threshold and the tell-tale sign “we’re almost there” since I was a kid. At night all you’ll see is a bunch of blinking red lights. These are the windmills. If you’re a particularly anxious child, they’re also mysterious harbingers of the coming alien apocalypse. Why aren’t the adults more concerned! Also, as makes sense for the location of a wind farm, it can get pretty windy in this area so be careful when driving. Around here you’ll also find the Morongo Valley Casino, a trumpian tower built for corporate conferences and those admirable golden-state gambling addicts for whom Vegas is just too damn far. There’s probably a burned-out 90s pop country act playing there if you’re interested. As you exit San Gorgino pass and enter the final stretch you’ll be met by a couple of well-known threshold guardians, the Cabazon Dinosaurs. Made famous by Pee-Wee’s Big Adventure and built in the mid-1960’s by Knott’s Berry Farm designer Claude K. Bell, they were originally intended to attract travelers to The Wheel Inn, a shuttered roadside diner, and are now owned by a young-earth evangelical family who’ve opened a creationist museum next door in case you were wondering why we can’t have nice things. Next you’ll reach the mysterious Inland Empire, a metropolitan area in its own right, it consists of cities like San Berdoo, Riverside, and Ontario, and is home to what I imagine are roving hoards of Hell’s Angels, LDS cyclists and disaffected heavy metal kids. From here it’s a straight shot into LA unless you make a trip up to Glendora to check out Donut Man and their infamous strawberry donuts (or peach, depending on the time of year.) After passing through the outer LA suburbs of Rosemead, West Covina, Monterey Park (home of LA’s best Chinese food), and a little passed the junction with the 710, you’ll turn the corner and come upon the Downtown Los Angeles skyline. If you’ve ever wondered what Dorthy felt like when she found the Emerald City, probably this. It’s also the sign you’ve arrived (physically at least) and the end of your journey. Like I said, I’m going to try and bring this sucker down for a clean landing. I-10’s been a major artery in my life. It connects the two cities that have had the most impact on me and in a lot of ways it represents the bridge between who I was and who I am. It’s been, at different times, the yellow brick road that led to adventure and the ruby slippers that brought me home again. To most people it’s just the boring drive they take because it’s cheaper than whatever deal Southwest is running. The important part is to stop and look around. Explore. Because (roll credits)… life. is. a. highway. (Cue sax solo.) Subscribe to my mailing list here. I post essays, short fiction and playlists a couple times a month."
Medium.com,Life,An Education in Dirt,Travel,https://medium.com/indian-thoughts/an-education-in-dirt-dfaedc9bf5d6?source=topic_page---------174------------------1," How the rhythm of farming can change your mind and change your life I can still recall the first time I heard of WWOOF ten years ago. I had stumbled across a fellow’s blog on his work travels on America’s farms. Images of cows in green fields and rows of cheese in farmers markets made my mouth water and my mind yearn for a knowledge beyond that of what I knew. Farming certainly isn’t the most sought after profession these days. Once 45% agrarian, the number of Americans in the farming occupation is down to 4%, with most of them over 60 years old. Agrarian experiences and values have taken a hit, with less and less people spending their childhoods on family farms. As such, tending to your garden’s soil health and milking the family cow simply aren’t skills on the radar. In response, more than wanderlust or an inability to settle down, WWOOF’s popularity with the millennial generation could express a deeper yearning. That of a connection to the modes of living of our ancestors and grandparents; a familiarity with the work that built our land and food, beyond that of digitized world. It’s a different type of education; an education in dirt. I couldn’t believe my luck in getting hired as WWOOF’s ambassador for Alaska last summer. After years of experiences as a volunteer farm hand, I felt I knew just what to look for. My task as ambassador was to spend the summer verifying all 60 farms as safe and provide data for incoming fellow WWOOFers. It was a task I approached carefully and joyfully; the chance to encourage a positive bond between intern and farmer, to share the love of farm life I’d experienced as an epiphany years ago. Working for WWOOF was much like WWOOFing itself: you must possess a willingness to dive into new experiences, to throw yourself at the mercy of spontaneity. To gamble, and choose trust over suspicion, love over fear. To embrace not quite knowing what you’ll learn, what connections you’ll make, or how your experience will add its thread to the tapestry of the whole; your becoming. On the farms, catching the WWOOFer’s eyes, busy weeding in the fields, I remembered vividly doing work trade on intensive vegetable farms. Work trade — a system in which tomatoes do not have dollar signs on them when they come out of the ground; a fact that had blown my mind years earlier. They, instead, have the terroir of the soil, the color of the sunlight that summer, and the taste of the current moment; transient and unique."

Upon landing in the Philippines, South Korean travelers are warned of both hurricanes and terrorism, in Russia, the possibility of street violence. Nowadays, the ministry feels compelled to warn Koreans that their safety could be imperiled in Japan, which is, by nearly any measure, one of the world’s safest counties. This perceived danger has its roots in politics and history. Over this summer, South Korea and Japan have been engaging in an unprecedented trade war. The turbulent relationship between the two hit rock bottom in July when Japan imposed trade restrictions on South Korea, posing a significant challenge to its already sluggish economy. South Koreans responded with tit-for-tat action by boycotting everything Japanese — from beers, cars, apparel to even travel to the country. Little did I know that this feud would affect my recent vacation to Japan."

I was warmed by his glacier-blue eyes, seduced by his cowboy French. He was a Utahan by birth, an Alaskan by design. I followed him into the mountains out West. He made me confront my fear of heights. I confused fear with love. We fought like ferocious beasts. When it was all over, a crone told me to make a collage of what I missed: someone who climbs mountains, is fearless, artistic, wise, compassionate. “Be that,” she said. Eventually, I would settle down with myself and a man less hirsute. Following my break with the Bear, I threw myself at the feet of the Great Land. I sailed the Inside Passage to gaze longingly at the glaciers where his eyes came from, backpacked in the chill, immolating rain over the treacherous Chilkoot Pass, rafted the Sheenjek River above the Arctic Circle, and contemplated blood-red streams in the Kenai thick with salmon. I flew into a lodge deep in Alaska’s roadless heart to watch sled-dogs with his eyes mush through the famous Iditarod race. I knew Alaska like one knows a long-distance lover. In fits and starts, I explored nearly all her parts, from the hidden folds of her inner passages to the hairless plains of her arctic refuge. I could drink repeatedly from her icy veins and never get chilled. In Freudian terms, this obsession was a classic case of transference. Years after the demise of our would-be marriage, I can still thrill to the sound Alaska elicits, an emulsion of tender and raw."

Visited August 2017.",Travel,https://medium.com/@dooleyyoung/poignant-mermaid-and-power-wars-vilnius-lithuania-visited-august-2017-1651fca33ca2?source=topic_page---------183------------------1," *This essay first appeared on my personal dooleyyoung.com site.* It took us a few minutes to find the Mermaid of Uzupis during our August 2017 visit to Vilnius, the capital of Lithuania. My husband and I were on our own in that quest, where a few days earlier we had followed a stream of fellow tourists to see Copenhagen’s statue of the Little Mermaid. The Danish mermaid appears quite sad, yet she may draw comfort from the thick crowds of her adoring fans. They know that things will work out well for the Little Mermaid by the end of Hans Christian Andersen’s tale, even if she doesn’t get her prince. Maybe that’s not a surprise to modern readers of the story. Danes for decades have enjoyed a remarkable social safety net, fostered in part by the nation’s geological windfall inheritance of North Sea oil and natural gas reserves. There seems to be no such certainty about the fate of the beautiful Uzupis mermaid, a bronze statue created by artist Romas Vilčiauskas. This mermaid’s hair springs out from her head. Her eyes hold questions. For a visitor who’s been reading up on Lithuania, she seems to reflect the nation’s turbulent recent history. Lithuania suffered one heck of a 20th century. The nation still wrestles with its own local guilt about the Holocaust deaths of an estimated 190,000 of its Jewish citizens, or 90 percent of that group. Writer Ruta Vanagaitė gained both enemies and new readers with her book “Us,” written with Nazi hunter Efraim Zuroff, about the participation of ordinary Lithuanians in the Holocaust, according to a December 2017 article in the New Yorker. Lithuanian participation in the Holocaust “involved a huge number of people rather than a handful of freaks, as I’d always thought,” she told the magazine. Author Steve Stern contemplated the cultural losses due to Holocaust’s devastation of Vilnius in this 2012 blog about his time spent teaching in that city: “It was a storybook milieu, complete with an argosy of hot air balloons overhead, and it dazzled me to the point where I forgot to miss what was missing. What was missing? Only about 1000 years of the most vibrant Jewish life to be found anywhere on the planet. It was here that the Vilna (Genius) sprang from the womb reciting Talmud, and the poets of Yung Vilne kept the printing presses busy until the plates were melted into bullets for the resistance.” Vilnius, which shifted over time from Polish to Lithuanian and Russian control, long attracted Jewish scholars and artists from other parts of eastern Europe. The Expressionist painter Chaim Soutine studied art in Vilnius before heading to Paris, where he created works such as “Return from School After the Storm,” which the Phillips Collection owns. This painting done in 1939 can make the viewer feel dread. How vulnerable these two little figures seem. Shortly after completing this work, Soutine would flee Paris to hide from Nazis in rural France. Back in Vilnius, the Nazi occupation emptied the once vibrant Jewish quarter of Uzupis. Some Lithuanians had welcomed the Nazis, seeing them as liberators from Soviet oppression. But Moscow quickly resumed control of Lithuania. Large-scale deportations in the 1940s sent Lithuanians to the gulag and to work camps in Siberia and the Arctic. Ruta Sepetys brings these sad stories to life in “Between Shades of Gray,” a novel based on her research into the fates of Lithuanians torn from their homes during Soviet times. Families with young children were taken in the night and put on cattle cars, often with little more than their pajamas, according to her book. The KGB museum in Vilnius shows how Lithuanians struggled to keep faith during the deportations. On display is a rosary made from leftover bits of bread, an incredible sacrifice considering how little food many prisoners had. The museum occupies the same building where the KGB once had its local headquarters. Its exhibits show how the Soviet occupation affected many Lithuanians in their homeland. More than 1,000 prisoners were killed in the execution chamber there between 1944 and the early 1960s, according to the museum’s web site. As the author Stern put it in his blog on Vilnius, today it is a “beautiful city…a hard place in which to imagine the unimaginable.” There’s not one showstopper monument or site that makes Vilnius stand out. Its charms instead are more evenly spread. During our August visit, my husband and I also saw hot-air balloons lifted into the sky above Vilnus. We stopped over and over during our visit to the city to admire its handsome brick apartment buildings and old churches and attractive cafes. A small sample of these appear in the photos below. The Jewish quarter of Uzupis has revived as the bohemian section of Vilnius. It has declared itself to be an independent republic, with its own whimsical constitution. Item №3 of the constitution declares: “Everyone has the right to die, but this is not an obligation.” Item №12 states: “A dog has the right to be a dog.” The Uzupis mermaid sits perched on a little alcove above the Vilnia River. The river swept her away in 2004, but she was recovered and restored to her perch, according to news reports. Who knows if this will happen again? If it does, one would imagine the people of Uzupis sending out search parties armed with creative banners and mounting a lively social media campaign to seek her return. There’s actually a nicely strong hipster vibe to much of Vilnius, mixing well with its centuries-old winding streets. My husband and I started our short stay with a trip to the Snekutis cafe. An older guy with a wild mane manned the counter. He looked a lot like the subject in this portrait hanging on the wall. I wanted to ask if it was him, but didn’t. During our lunch, Iggy Pop crooned away via speakers about Miss Argentina. Bearded guys lounged around. Some of them worked here, getting up from time to time to ferry plates to tables. An old Apple sat like a dusty relic in the window. You felt that you could be anywhere with a good local scene or college-town vibe. Painting in cafe. First dill sighting Old Apple But you knew you were someplace offbeat and wonderful when the food arrived. My husband had a dish made with pig’s ear and his first glass of a bread-based drink called kvass. There was a sprinkling of green dill in my sour pickle soup, the first sign of an herb we’d see often in the weeks ahead on what we call our TransEurasian adventure, or our 13-nation semi-vacation of late 2017. Vilnius turned out to be our favorite stop in the Baltics. We’d initially planned on spending only an afternoon in Vilnius, passing through the city on our way from the Lithuanian coast toward nearby Latvia. But we missed a ferry from Sweden’s Karlshamn to the Lithuania port of Klaipeda, leading us to reroute our trip. We ended up flying from Copenhagen to Vilnius, where we lingered a few days. We stayed long enough to feel possessive about this table at a little French cafe overlooking one of the most historic churches in Vilnius. An historic event took place in Klaipeda about a week before we made it to Lithuania. In late August, the tanker Clean Ocean brought the first shipment of American liquified natural gas to Lithuania, which is trying to ease itself from the grip of Russia as its energy supplier. America in recent years has become an exporter of LNG due largely to hydrofracking. Only a few years back, the nation expected to need sizable imports of natural gas. But scarcity and high fuel prices for consumers prompted greater creativity among producers of natural gas. They increased their ability to shake loose more of the nation’s underground supply through fracking. Advocates for cleaner forms of energy may see this as akin to a desperate person using a knife to dig the very last bits of peanut butter from a jar, the ones a spoon can’t reach. Tom Bouman explores LNG’s toll on communities in his excellent mystery novel. In“Dry Bones in the Valley,” he describes the natural history of the Appalachian Range: “Creatures in the sea died and sank, and the mountains eroded, and over a hundred million years this mix of sediment and organic matter was buried and turned into shale, the Marcellus shale. Because of the once-living things in it, the Marcellus contains a lot of natural gas, all wrapped up in layers of rock like a present to America.” It’s a present that comes with significant strings attached, as Bouman makes clear in his book. (It’s well worth reading. I won’t reveal its surprises here.) In the same vein, Lawrence Wright in the New Yorker called fracking “a dark bounty.” “It has created enormous wealth for some, and the flood of natural gas has lowered energy costs for many, but it has also despoiled communities and created enduring environmental hazards,” he said. Neela Bannerjee of InsideClimate News last year revealed how a pivotal EPA study on fracking downplayed the concerns of scientists. As a Washingtonian and fan of the Chesapeake Bay, I’m glad that an effective local nonprofit is keeping tabs on Dominion Energy Inc.’s plans for an LNG export site. The Chesapeake Bay Foundation has said it doesn’t oppose per se a proposed LNG site at Cove Point, Maryland. “Our concerns for the cumulative impacts of natural gas development do, however, call for a thorough and region-wide assessment of impacts from drilling and the subsequent natural gas distribution system,” said the foundation, of which I’m a supporter. Yet, some Lithuanians see the expanded U.S. supply of natural gas as quite a blessing. LNG shipments are giving countries long dominated by Russia leverage in energy bargaining. Lithuanians deliberately gave the name Independence to their new floating LNG storage vessel at Klaipeda. The project’s “mere existence” let Lithuania negotiate its first-ever gas price discount with Gazprom, Agnia Grigas, the author of The New Geopolitics of Gas (Harvard University Press, 2017), wrote in Foreign Affairs . While Norway’s LNG reached the Lithuanian market first, the shipment from the U.S. “may hold more significance in the long term,” Grigas wrote. “Its delivery signals that the United States is now a powerful global gas supplier and that American companies are willing to compete even in Gazprom’s most traditional markets,” she wrote. Natural gas long played second place, or even an almost understudy role, in the global energy debate. It largely was bound to pipelines for delivery, while oil moved in great ships as well as in those underground channels. In recent years, companies and nations have invested in making natural gas more nimble. Cooling natural gas to around -260 degrees Fahrenheit shrinks the valuable fuel to liquid form for transport. It’s often said this reduction is akin to making a beach ball the size of a ping pong ball. After it reaches its new market, LNG is warmed up and allowed to expand again like a genie freed from a bottle. Domestic exports of LNG averaged 1.9 billion cubic feet per day in 2017, 1.4 Bcf/d higher than in 2016, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration. EIA said. New LNG terminals are under construction in Georgia, Texas, and Louisiana, in addition to the Cove Point project in Maryland. The nation’s key LNG export site, Sabine Pass terminal near the Texas-Louisiana border, is running at near-full capacity, EIA said. It was a Cheniere Energy Inc. business deal, and not a government pact, that brought the LNG from Louisiana’s Sabine port to Lithuania’s Klaipeda, an American official in 2017 told Natural Gas World. “The US government was not involved in this specific deal,” Howard Solomon, deputy chief of mission at the US embassy in Vilnius, is quoted saying in the article. Still, there’s been great interest from American lawmakers in LNG shipments to Russia’s neighbors. These exports will “strengthen our diplomatic hand when dealing with countries like Russia that like to use their energy resources as weapons,” said House Energy and Commerce Chairman Greg Walden, an Oregon Republican, at a January 2018 hearing. His powerful committee is pushing to change federal laws in order to increase the flow of LNG exports from the United States. The top Democrat on his committee, Rep. Frank Pallone Jr. of New Jersey, objects to the measures that Walden supports, including a bill (HR 4605), titled Unlocking Our Domestic LNG Potential Act. If enacted, this bill would clear the way for exports of LNG without prior approval from the Department of Energy and would remove longstanding consumer protections, Pallone said. “As a result, the public would not have an opportunity to know about or provide input on natural gas exports to any country at any level,” he said at the January Energy and Commerce subcommittee hearing on efforts to expand LNG sales. Yet, two of Pallone’s fellow Democrats were early backers of this bill. Among the five original cosponsors of HR 4605 are Reps. Tim Ryan of Ohio and Henry Cuellar of Texas. Both men serve on the Appropriations Committee, a natural home in Congress for pragmatists and dealmakers. And a former Senate Democratic appropriator Mary L. Landrieu of Louisiana was one of the most ardent champions of expanding LNG exports, arguing a need for it even beyond her state’s parochial interests. LNG exports could be“a powerful geo-political tool, particularly in light of Russia’s illegal aggression” in Ukraine, Landrieu said at a 2014 Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee hearing. As that panel’s chairwoman, Landrieu invited Lithuania’s energy minister as a witness to this hearing about increasing energy exports. Then Lithuanian Energy Minister Jaroslav Neverovic urged the senators to ease restrictions on U.S. LNG imports, arguing it would help nations now captive to Russian supply. Russia’s Gazprom had in the past cut off supply of natural gas to Ukraine, citing concerns about unpaid bills. Others saw this disruption of gas supply as a result of Russian leader Vladimir Putin’s displeasure with an Ukrainian government that sought to more closely ally itself with the West. “The present situation in Ukraine has taught us one lesson,” Neverovic said. “No nation should be able to use its monopolistic energy supplies to punish any other nation.” Neverovic also told the panel about the progress made on the Independence LNG import terminal, which some Americans see as a chance to build a new market for the nation’s natural gas. “The last thing Putin and his cronies want is competition from the United States of America in the energy race,” she said. Landrieu said in her opening statement for the hearing. In August 2017, Lithuania’s Foreign Affairs Minister Linas Linkevičius celebrated as the tanker Clean Ocean arrived at Klaipeda. “#US & #LT strategic partnership stronger every day. 1st #LNG shipment from US arrives today in Klaipėda. Crucially important for whole region,” tweeted Linkevičius, who also earlier served as his nation’s defense minister and as its representative to NATO. Linkevičius may have a little more clout than one would expect for a minister of a country with a population of about 2.8 million. He’s very well spoken in English and understandably hawkish about the Russian threat for former Soviet republics. Linkevičius appeared in recent years on programs such as the BBC’s Hardtalk to discuss the Russian involvement in Ukraine. In trying to explain the regional threat, he told Politico about seeing Soviet tanks roll into Vilnius in 1991 to crush independence protests. “Russians were here as a Soviet army,” Linkevičius is quoted saying. “But they were Russian troops and they were invading us, so the last thing we are on this subject is naive.” Relations between Russia and Lithuania remain uneasy. The Economist in 2015 reported that Russia was investigating the “desertions” of Lithuanians who failed to complete their military service to the Soviet Union in the 1990s. “25 years on, Lithuanians wonder why Russia would try to reopen a case involving a country that no longer exists,” the Economist said, referring to the U.S.S.R. “Nobody in Vilnius doubts that the timing is linked to the international situation. Lithuania has been one of Ukraine’s staunchest supporters(.)” Russia appears unlikely to placidly allow expansion of American LNG sales into its neighborhood and its customer base, particularly when its leaders seems to want to regain some form of control of those lands. Putin’s “unabashed desire to recover territories that became independent after the fall of the Soviet Union is a threat to European security and to American leadership,” Bruce Goldwyn, a former State Department official who then was a scholar with the Brookings Institution, told the Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee at the 2014 hearing on energy exports. Power politics between the United States and Russia took a strange turn in late January 2018, when a tanker brought LNG from Putin’s nation into a Massachusetts port. The Boston Globe accused RT, a news organization backed by the Russian government, of taunting with its headline- “Sanctions anyone? US receives Russian LNG shipment, 2nd tanker reported on its way” The shipment raised questions about the trade restrictions placed on Russian. The United States in 2014 imposed sanctions intended to weaken Russia’s energy sector after Russia annexed a chunk of Ukraine, known as Crimea. The Washington Post explained that these sanctions block financing for projects belonging to Novatek, Russia’s biggest independent producer of natural gas, but not the purchase of this fuel from Yamal, a giant company-run project in northern Siberia. Still, the delivery outraged Ukrainian-Americans, according to the Globe. It cites Peter Woloschuk, who writes about Boston’s Ukrainian-American community, as pointing out that a local nonprofit sends about $100,000 a year in surgical supplies to Ukraine. Massachusetts hospitals have helped treat victims of “Russian aggression,” yet the controversial LNG shipment into Boston would result in sending “money to Russians and a Russian government that’s going to be used to create more victims,” Woloschuk says in the Globe article. “How is it that our government hasn’t spoken up?” Woloschuk asks."
Medium.com,Life,Bass Fishing in America,Travel,https://medium.com/@pwhite545/bass-fishing-in-america-f6b8bc4a2832?source=topic_page---------184------------------1," By Peter White We fish down in the creek about half mile from my tiny hovel in Cheatham County, Tennessee. I actually like my little house. There’s less to keep clean. The bass hang out under the rocks in a hole just downstream from a concrete bridge a farmer built over Turnbull Creek years ago. It’s posted but he lets locals pass through his gate and fish off the bridge and in this he is very neighborly. He knows I’m a Yankee but since I live just down the road, he lets me pass. He always wants to know if we’re fishing or hunting snakes. We do both. The creek has a snaky reputation and so locals don’t fish it much. Osprey and bald eagles sometimes fly down the winding creek to the Harpeth River about a mile away. But here’s the bad news: used to be you could pull over just about anywhere and get down to any one of Tennessee’s many streams and rivers. Most folks hereabouts made their money, bought land alongside waterways, and fenced them off. No public access anymore. It’s getting to be just like Malibu or Palos Verdes and there isn’t even any surf. Nowadays you can only put in kayaks at designated spots. And the fishing has gone to hell because the places you can get to legally are all fished out or so crowded up with anglers it just puts you off. Same thing with hunting. Tennessee used to be Davy Crockett country. Not anymore. Like spawning gar roiling the water below the bridge, builders thrash about with bulldozers tearing up old farms like nobody’s business but unlike the gar they don’t disappear after a couple days. Where bear and elk once roamed they build subdivisions that go on and on and on. There is one big wildlife management area in Cheatham County but except for deer there is no more big game. No more doves either, or ducks, or bobcats. Turkey, coyotes, and armadillos are all that remain in those desiccated areas that were once part of a vast wilderness that stretched northward to the Ohio and westward to the Mississippi. Forest bison and black bears once inhabited this country and quail once lived in the grasslands that have been turned into commercial timber operations growing two by fours for the housing industry. Ground-nesting birds, quail have all but disappeared here, and nobody hunts them anymore because there aren’t any to hunt. Like global warming we humans are to blame. Dove and duck hunting has been a bust for several years running in Cheatham County. They still have a duck bind drawing every year here but there is no excitement or anticipation to it anymore. I don’t now how Bass Pro shops are still in business. They have the market hereabouts on camo stuff, guns, and expensive bass boats that cost much more than my used Toyota. On weekends you see them on trailers headed for Percy Priest Lake or Cheatham Dam. For me, fishing on foot along Turnbull Creek is pretty much what I’m left with to find some solace in this world. Now there are two ways to catch bass: with a fly rod or a spinning reel. You can use artificial flies and lures or live bait. I usually catch minnows with an 8-ft. cast net along the shallows above the bridge and then fish on its downstream side. Purists like my friend Tony are partial to fly-fishing. There is an art to it. Tony can cast 50 feet with his 9 ft. Scott fly rod and lay an artificial fly just under an overhanging tree where he hopes the bass will be. Sometimes he’s right. Sometimes he’ll catch a pan fish instead. Beautiful little pumpkinseed, all orange and blue, will strike a fly or take live bait. But you have to catch half a dozen to make a meal of them. But who would want to? They look like something you’d see in a saltwater aquarium. They are a freshwater species, endemic to Eastern U.S. and Canada. In mating season, they build circular nests, sometimes a half dozen are within inches of each other along the sandy creek bottom. They often build them near colonies of blue gill, aka brim, with which they have a love hate relationship. The two species are in the sunfish family and interbreed. But the aggressive pumpkinseed sits on top of its nest and chases away any competition. Bass or pan fish, sometimes catfish or gar or red horse, and an occasional carp, we catch them all and then let them go. The fishing gestalt along Turnbull Creek is catch and release but old timers generally ignore that rule. My 16-year old son, Caley, turns over rocks upstream until he spies a crawfish that he puts on a hook. He rarely gets skunked as he, too, has learned to cast in just the right spot. There are a couple of holes below the bridge and if the fish are biting Caley will get one. When a bass strikes you know it. Even small ones fight like the devil. They pull your line one way and then the other. You can see them flash like lightning under the water zigzagging and tugging to get free. As you reel them in, they will jump clear out of the water. And sometimes they get off the hook and swim back down under the rocks where you just might hook them again. We’ve caught the same bass more than once along Turnbull Creek. It annoys the hell out of Tony when Caley has better luck with his $30 dollar spinning rig than he has with his $500 fly rod. He’s always quitting early and swears he’s never coming back. He says the creek is all fished out, or it’s too hot, or something, and packs up his gear in disgust. Fact is, he’s just mad at the fish for not biting. They are there. You just have to get lucky. After a few days he’ll be back to try again. And so it goes all summer along Turnbull Creek where for a short while you can find yourself in a little bit of paradise. October 2019"
Medium.com,Life,Integration: To the Shadows and Back Again,Travel,https://medium.com/@jupiterrain/integration-to-the-shadows-and-back-again-414cb68b11c6?source=topic_page---------185------------------1," I returned from Peru four months ago. In the time since I arrived home I have navigated a deeply complicated, confusing, and often emotionally painful and overwhelming integration. I also moved into a bustling new community home and began grad school for integral counseling psychology. I’ve hardly seen many of my beloved friends, from a combination of re-orienting myself to a new pace of life in Oakland and from the huge energy drain that has been required by the processing of the events and insights from my time in the jungle. In the past few weeks many threads have started to weave together, to a point where I am beginning to be able to articulate my biggest takeaways and I know what my biggest challenges and goals are moving forward. While I was in Peru for 2 1/2 months I spent most of my time at a center called Mayantuyacu, deep in the remote jungle of the Amazon, under the guidance of my teacher Maestro Don Juan Flores. There I drank ayahuasca every 2 to 3 days, drank other non-psychoactive teas of plants 3 times a day, and spent most of my time in isolation deep in the jungle sleeping on a wooden platform with no walls — just some candles, a hammock, and a bed with a mosquito net. I spoke to people rarely, slept a lot, and passed the days by singing and writing in my journal and staring at the trees. With so much free time you get a chance to think about pretty much everything you ever did and didn’t want to think about. I think there is a common misconception that the hard part of this whole process is the ceremonies. Drinking ayahuasca can be total bliss, or total hell, or sometimes you just fall asleep. Some nights are harder than others for sure, or hold more insights into yourself, the world, or spirit. The isolation was hard too — less loneliness and more a mixture of boredom and fear (particularly at night). But the truth is that the hardest part of this whole process began the day I left Mayantuyacu, left the watchful care of my teacher and the jungle that had become my mother, and ventured back into the loud, intense, chaotic world. Integration doesn’t look like one thing. It’s not all meditation and yoga and healthy eating and celibacy and self-care and sobriety and therapy (though it is all of those things at some time or another for me). It’s being overly sensitive to that comment a friend made, it’s staying up and waking up late, it’s forgetting to leave the house some days, it’s not singing for a week because you feel too sad, it’s procrastinating homework, it’s spending some nights crying and praying in front of your altar because you just want to feel okay for one day. At some point I realized I needed help doing this, because as loving and supportive as my friends and community members have been it hasn’t been enough, and I needed to give myself more time to focus on my healing. So I quit my job, started therapy, started going back to yoga, and began seeing an acupuncturist. I’ve given myself full permission to turn down all social invitations and rest as much as I need. And still, it hasn’t helped lift this crushing weight off my shoulders. In a bid of desperation I had a phone call with a mentor who has worked with plant medicine for almost 30 years last week and finally the build up of the past six months clicked into place. One of the dominant symptoms of my integration has been a growing and unquenchable fatigue. I sleep up to 10 hours a night and nap often, and still feel tired. I also have struggled during integration with anxiety, loneliness, and troubling focusing on tasks. As soon as I gave my symptoms to my mentor he knew I have unresolved trauma bubbling in my subconscious. The trauma in question has been made known as a root cause of much of the suffering in my life in a ceremony in Peru. I had addressed it in July but hadn’t realized that I had set it to the side, leaving it open like a festering wound that was now causing me a great deal of suffering. Without going into the details of my trauma and resultant behaviors (as they are too numerous to describe here), I have a fixation on and deep fear of death that drives most if not all of my less desirable behaviors and causes my chronic health issues. This in some ways feels like an insurmountable fear to overcome, and on the other hand I find great comfort in the leagues of humans who have also been overcome by this fear and the depths of writings and philosophies for how to come to peace and acceptance with this inevitable fate and no longer be controlled by my fear. I’ve been shocked by how much research and writings I’ve been finding on trauma, particularly childhood trauma, that lists the symptoms of repressed trauma and includes every mental/emotional/spiritual issue with which I have struggled throughout my life. To discover all the things I thought were innately wrong with me and are an essential part of me are actually the result of trauma shakes me deeply to my core. The way I form the concept of my identity now feels like shifting ground beneath me, a spiritual earthquake that threatens to rip my ego from me and start anew. I am now actively pursuing trauma therapy and alternative treatments. I do not have a clear idea of what healing looks like, and no idea who I am on the other side of this. Take just about every emotion you can name and I can identify with it in some way about this process. While I move through this I share my gratitude to my entire community for their patience and support, whether in person or afar. I dream about the way I want to show up in the world and in my community once I am not under the constant barrage of my shadows and ailed by this spiritual sickness that prevents me from living fully. I give my thanks to my teacher, Juan Flores, for helping to bring this fear to my conscious mind, to the land of Mayantuyacu for helping me begin my healing journey, to the many plants I have dieted and will diet that are my humble teachers and guides, and to la medicina, Ayahuasca, for shining light into the darkest corners of my soul and mind. It is now upon me to do the work, to make the choices that will allow me to move into the role of service that I feel is my calling, and to let fear dissolve in the face of pure, shining love."
Medium.com,Life,Stepping across a controversy in Venice,Travel,https://medium.com/publishous/stepping-across-a-controversy-in-venice-1698da543bab?source=topic_page---------186------------------1," This past June, I returned to Venice, Italy for five days to visit my daughter who was serving an internship at the U.S. Pavilion in the 2019 Art Biennale. While there, my goal was to experience three sights I had missed during my first visit to Venice in 2017: 1) The Basilica of St. John and St. Paul (known in Italian as the Basilica dei Santi Giovanni y Paolo); 2) The Venetian Ghetto (where Jews were segregated starting in 1516 and curiously, the origin of the word “ghetto”); and 3) The Constitution Bridge (known in Italian as the Ponte della Costituzione, but also known as the Calatrava Bridge). On the last full day of my visit in June, my daughter and I took a vaporetto to Cannaregio, the sestiere of Venice where the Jewish Ghetto and the Ponte della Costituzione are located. I had first learned of the famous — or infamous, take your pick — bridge, when I read The Politics of Washing: Real Life in Venice. This book, written by Venetian transplant Polly Coles, reveals the daily routines of ordinary Venetians who have made the lagoon city their home. In her book, Coles gushes about the bridge. She writes, “There is something in the way the wide, shallow glass steps curve upwards in a long sweep that invites you to quicken your step and widen your stride; it makes you feel suddenly lifted and for a few lovely moments drawn up into the sky. It is these moments that make of the bridge a masterpiece.” It’s an accurate and lush description that honors the bridge and its designer, the renowned Spanish architect Santiago Calatrava. However, four sentences later, Coles laments other aspects of the bridge. In a parallel fashion, she writes, “There is something in the way the stripes of metal, glass, and concrete play with the eye that leads people to misjudge their next step and fall.” Coles even goes further to dismiss the bridge as part of “Venice the stage set”… “a subtle and depressing symbol of the demise of Venice as a place where people can really live and function efficiently from day to day.” It’s a prevalent concern, especially in the wake of cruise ship collisions, overcrowding, and the resultant tourism taxes the city is adopting to deal with mass tourism. I first learned of the bridge’s architect Santiago Calatrava when I visited “Sculpture into Architecture,” a 2005 exhibition of the artist’s work at the Metropolitan Museum of Modern Art in New York City. The architect’s unusual skeletal forms intrigued me and still do today. For example, the Oculus transit hub near NYC’s One World Trade and the 9/11 Memorial & Museum is one of Calatrava’s more recent U.S. designs. The Oculus’ soaring bird-like structure is a fitting symbol of recovery and growth for the formerly devastated Ground Zero area. However in Venice, Calatrava’s bridge is a controversial piece of architecture that continues to gain attention today even though it was completed in 2008. Indeed, its troubles started long before the current ones listed below. For example, during its construction, the bridge was budgeted to cost 7 million Euro, but wound up costing 11.6 million Euro. In addition, several delays were required during its construction. Moreover, other problems have come to light since its construction and subsequent use. These have added to the bridge’s notoriety. Some of these problems include: So how was my walk across Calatrava’s Constitution Bridge? Let’s just say that I was glad it was dry the day we ventured across. With its low-rise steps and glass walkway, the bridge felt precarious even then. (Still, the marble steps on nearly every other Venetian bridge are slick, too. On these bridges –and there are hundreds across the city–one must take care to avoid the worn, rounded edges of centuries-old marble). On Calatrava’s bridge, there is a narrow walkway of another material (stone? concrete?) you can step across on. And truth be told, that optional surface was more comfortable to use even though it was only a strip the width of a narrow sidewalk positioned in the middle of the walkway, far from a handrail. Its long arch gracefully extends across the canal. If you have the chance to take the lengthy stroll across it, do. Despite its controversy and shortfalls, the bridge is beautiful, minimal… a refreshing contemporary note amidst Venice’s historic and achingly beautiful facades. Personally, I think the bridge isn’t so much a symbol of Venice-the-amusement-park as it is merely a bridge with design issues. It’s also one of those lesser-known Venice sights worth seeing. When you venture beyond the city’s major landmarks, you’ll discover interesting sights that millions miss."

Medium.com,Life,Going Dutch,Travel,https://medium.com/@redrabblepoetry/going-dutch-cfd52a1fcb64?source=topic_page---------190------------------1," As some of you may know, I moved to the Netherland around three months ago. While I can’t say the move has been easy, I can’t say it has been difficult either. Most of my time here has been great, but as with any move, it comes with some significant readjustments. I’ve moved countries a few times, so I’m kind of used to the resettling process. I think that’s part of the reason it’s taken me this long to feel the strains of moving. But today something happened that rattled me. It shouldn’t have rattled me, but it did. Now, this particular social interaction has happened a few times in a few ways but today’s was, for some reason, more painful than normal. I guess it’s like the glass finally got too full and now everything is spilling out. My seams got cracked. Today I forgot my public transport card. That is not a big deal, I can still buy tickets and get where I have to go, it’s just slightly more expensive than travelling with the card. I figured out how to buy a ticket and proceeded to meet up with the Dutch girl I was travelling with that day. We were heading to roller derby practice. When I told her about the incident, she said something that I am finding it difficult to move past. “You’ll never be Dutch if you keep making these mistakes.” I’m not entirely sure what she meant by that, this was the first time I had travelled with her and the first time I’d forgotten my transport card. So while I should’ve taken this comment and thrown it in the trash along with my bus ticket for some reason I held onto it all the way home. I carried it around in my coat pocket while walking my dog, and I pulled it out to glance at it every now and again. I couldn’t figure out why this comment bothered me so much. I realised it’s because this wasn’t the first comment of it’s kind. Throughout my time here I’ve been told that I’m not Dutch enough, that I’m not integrating fast enough and that I’m making too many mistakes. The interesting thing is that it’s not all from the same person. Many Dutch people in my life have made comments like this. The most rattling thing these Dutch people have in common is that they all expect me to want to become Dutch. They think that’s why I’m here. That hurts. I don’t want to be Dutch, I’m British. Its who I am. I’m not changing who I am to live in this country. I have been asked on multiple occasions when I will be applying for Dutch citizenship. The answer is not for at least fifteen years… why? That’s how long I will have to live here while being married to be eligible for dual citizenship. If I want to become Dutch before that, I have to give up British citizenship. It’s shouldn’t be as hard as it is to explain to someone why I wouldn’t be willing to give up my British and Irish citizenship. Dutch people think that the Netherlands is the best, and yes, it’s great. I love it here, it’s a good place to live… but I’ve lived a lot of places, and I wouldn’t say that it’s the best. When I suggest that I don’t want to be Dutch, people get angry. That’s fair, but I’m not Dutch, I’m not proud to live here. I don’t want to give up a part of who I am to belong here. Yes, I will learn dutch. Yes, I will get used to riding a bike everywhere. No, I will try not to forget my public transport card. That’s as far as I’ll go. I’m not willing to compromise on this one I’m afraid. I’m already losing so much to move here, I won’t lose my nationality for this country. There are little things that happen in everyday life that pile up, and it is slowly breaking me down. These things include but are not limited to: So I’ve shared a lot of negative experiences, but I don’t want this article to be about that, I want this to be a learning moment. If you find yourself welcoming someone new to your culture in there are a few things you can do to help us settle in. There are some days that we feel like practising, and there are other days where everything is too overwhelming. Letting us decide which language to use is helpful, there are so many emotional factors that go with speaking a new language. It’s okay if we want to take a day away from mental fatigue. Sometimes when I’m trying to speak Dutch people switch to English to make it easy for me. That doesn’t help me learn. If someone is trying to speak your language, please let them try. We won’t always understand your responses, and you won’t understand ours, but when you switch languages, it makes us feel like you’re giving up on us. I know that it’s hard to respond to us, it takes a lot of thinking to change your natural words to the ones that we will know. We appreciate the effort. So thank you for trying! We don’t move places to give up who we are in favour of another culture. That’s never the reason why we do it. We are not going to change who are the moment we enter your country. We might pick up habits or sayings as we go on living here but changing is not our intention. There are things that both parties can do to make the transition from culture to culture easier. Here is a list of some things that movers can do to ease some of the internal tension. Don’t do it like me, I bottled up all of the things that bugged me until it caused me to stop functioning for a weekend. It’s hard to learn a language but keep trying, the faster you learn, the easier your transition will be. Try to talk to strangers, fool the cashier into thinking you speak fluently, keep going and pushing. The more interactions you have, the easier speaking comfortably will become. People will do things that offend or hurt you. Let it go, and do your best to move past it. Holding onto hurt won’t help your transition, so do what you can to get it out of your system. Write a blog post, a poem, a short story, go on a walk or a jog do whatever it is that you do to process information. Know that they probably didn’t mean to hurt you, they didn’t even realise they were doing it. If it keeps happening mention how it makes you feel. Explain your point of view and let them explain theirs. I know I’ll be taking some of my own advice."
Medium.com,Life,Why I Love Flying,Travel,https://medium.com/@flyinis4me2/why-i-love-flying-b3dda089e891?source=topic_page---------191------------------1," A pilot’s perspective of the thrill of flight Flying has always been a part of my life. My dad always owned small airplanes as I was growing up, and we would go flying often. I got my pilot’s license at age 19. Read more about me here. I wrote this story to describe some of the reasons why I love flying. As power is advanced for takeoff, the engines spool up. I feel the subtle rumble of the engines and hear the increasing roar of the jet. The force slowly starts to pull on me as the plane starts moving forward. My body feels heavier as I’m pulled back into my seat. My mind is acutely taking notice of all that is happening around me, as if it’s happening in slow motion. I’m completely zoned in on the task at hand, and I’m vigilantly focused on the most important things. Did the engines spool up evenly and correctly? Is the thrust setting correct? How do the oil pressure and temperature look? How about vibration, anything out of limits? I scan the engine instruments looking for any abnormalities. Next, I scan the length of the runway, making necessary inputs to the flight controls to remain on runway centerline, and I take a quick glance at the windsock to see if the wind is still as was last reported and as we were expecting. Keenly, I’m looking out ahead and in my periferal vision to ensure no aircraft are approaching to cross the runway in front of us. Similarly, I’m listening intently to the radio frequency and mentally taking note of instructions being given to other aircraft in the area. This is vital for situational awareness. Knowing where other aircraft are located and what is going on around us could be instrumental in making a good decision should a split second require. Also, having studied it carefully at the gate, I’m now looking out at the weather. Is it the same as expected? We must be prepared for anything. As we roll down the runway, rapidly accelerating, we are ready to take immediate, decisive, direct action with no hesitation, if we need to reject the takeoff and bring the aircraft to a stop. We train for this in the simulator. There is no room for error. Therefore, this is a very critical phase of flight. Mere seconds can make a huge difference in the outcome. After reaching a critical speed known as V1 (decision speed), we are committed to the takeoff. We no longer will be able to stop the aircraft on the remaining runway. After reaching V1 speed, we must take the aircraft into the air, no matter what. At this point, even if one engine fails, we must rotate and climb out on one engine. This is the most critical time for an engine to fail. Because of the loss of thrust on one side, and the extremely high thrust of the engine on the other side, the aircraft strongly yaws and rolls toward the side with the failed engine. Prompt and correct control inputs are immediately necessary to correct for this and keep the aircraft wings level and flying straight. This is not easy. Therefore, many hours of practice are required to learn and perform this maneuver. We extensively practice this in the simulator. This is an adrenaline rush for sure. All pilots, I believe, get this same feeling every takeoff, and all pilots, I believe, love flying. Eventually, as we reach our rotation speed, we lift off the ground and begin climbing. We are flying! It’s amazing that something so heavy and so big can fly. With mere fingertips, I move the flight controls, which direct the aircraft’s movements. It is the most liberating feeling of freedom I have ever known. Of course, taking off is just the start of the flight. Next, the en-route phase of the flight can also present many challenges. Probably the most difficult en-route challenge is dealing with weather and thunderstorms. We must make decisions about how to avoid the weather. Many constraints play into these decisions. The most common constraints are fuel on board, type of weather, aircraft capabilities, and airspace restrictions. A little bit of bad weather can make what should have been an easy day much more difficult and stressful. Carefully monitoring and thinking about fuel planning is also imperative. Wind speed and direction at various altitudes and off-route distance of deviations around bad weather must be considered in order to stay within the planned fuel burn. Also, we need to monitor for the possibility of a fuel leak. Additionally, turbulence may require us to try different altitudes to find a smooth ride. We also have to be prepared to handle medical emergencies or deal with any passenger issues that might come up. Mechanical problems may also occur and must be handled promptly and correctly. Air traffic is another concern. Another consideration we sometimes face is special navigational procedures for routes out over the water, far from shore. Of course, preparing for and accomplishing arrivals and landings is a similar heightened sense of awareness and can be an extreme adrenaline rush. Some landings are smooth, straight-forward, and easy. Some are much more challenging. Sometimes the weather is great, sometimes not so much. No matter how many thousands of landings a pilot has done or how many hours of flight time a pilot has logged, each day is still different. New challenges present themselves in various ways. In conclusion, I love the challenge, the complexity, and the variety of flying. Flying can be thrilling. I love the artistry, airmanship, and finesse required to do my job well. Additionally, this job offers a very unique social aspect. I get to meet and work with so many people, and travel to the most amazing places. It’s hard to be gone from home a lot, but I’m so glad I get to experience this. I love flying."
Medium.com,Life,Finding Balance by Losing Control,Travel,https://medium.com/swlh/finding-balance-by-losing-control-6359c99e6027?source=topic_page---------192------------------1," I
love travel. My favorite day is the one when I wake up, ready to fly off on a new adventure. I have been very fortunate to visit so many countries and to experience their culture. All credit goes to my father who could not sit still. He trolled the newspaper for travel deals and was always ready to pick up and go at a moments notice. He used to say, it’s cheaper than staying home. I am not sure that part was true. This week, I am lucky to be in Aruba. What an incredible island. The openness of the people and their happy outlook makes it a pleasure to spend time here. Plus it is 88 degrees and sunny every day which doesn’t hurt. I have my 12 and 13 year-old kids in tow which changes the activities to a more adventurous list. They saw a crazy speedboat pulling a giant inflatable sombrero and insisted that we sign up for a ride. Ok, here we go. I climb onto the enormous yellow contraption pulled by the Speedy Gonzales. Yes, seriously. I rode a yellow sombrero pulled by the Speedy Gonzales. So the sombrero takes off behind the Speedy Gonzales bumping and bouncing over the boat wake. Our driver, Miguel takes wide turns and then cuts back the other way, just to make the ride a little rougher. You need to have a death grip on the sombrero handles so you don’t go tumbling off into the ocean. I think Miguel was really pushing the limits once he saw we had the strength to hold on. About halfway through the ride, I felt the sombrero softening. Does anyone else feel like this thing is deflating? Um, yeah. Miguel was blissfully unaware, continuing to bounce us over wave after wave. It became increasingly difficult to keep a grip on the thing as I sunk into the middle of the hat. Then I heard a loud POP. That can’t be good. The softness turned into mush as the sombrero became a tortilla. And Miguel wasn’t turning around. I sank completely forward as the flattened float started to sink. I thought he was going to leave us behind in the middle of the ocean. In my mind, I was planning our escape. But all I could do was close my eyes and hang on as we finally made it to shore on our deflated ride. My vacations tend to attract near tragedy. It may be from pushing the limits. But my sombrero experience made me think. I couldn’t help but remember all of the wild situations I encountered while traveling. There was the drunken priest in Ireland who crashed the car we were driving into a ditch. And the time I drove into oncoming traffic and crashed my Vespa into a palm tree in the Caribbean. Stories for another day."
Medium.com,Life,How to Travel Like a Tourist Because That’s Exactly What You Are,Travel,https://forge.medium.com/how-to-travel-like-a-tourist-because-thats-exactly-what-you-are-936445c2ddc0?source=topic_page---------193------------------1," bartender once stopped me from ordering a creme brûlée while I was on vacation in Paris because, as he put it, he “couldn’t let me eat like a tourist.” I figured it couldn’t hurt to throw something as surefire as dessert to the wind, so I let him order for me. He returned with a plate of very mediocre canelés, and I’ve therefore still never enjoyed a creme brûlée in Paris. Which is probably precisely the place you want to be when you’re in the mood for a creme brûlée. I don’t know why the word “tourist” is so dirty. I don’t know when “tourist” and “asshole” began to mean the same thing, or when “like a local” became the ideal way to travel. But it’s nonsense. I’m not defending bad tourists. You know the type: People who leave home and go somewhere else only to expect it to be exactly like home. Those tourists are assholes, and I can understand the desire to disassociate from them. I also, in small part, blame Anthony Bourdain. He inspired everyone to travel like a local, but he never pointed out that he, himself, was entirely a tourist (an incredibly skilled one with producers and staff to make sure everything was awesome). If I really wanted to explore a place “like a local,” I’d get a job there. I’d have rent and bills to pay, and a commute to survive every morning. When I travel, I never want to pretend I’m anything but the wide-eyed visitor I am. I’m too scared of what I’d miss. If the locals think I’m one of them, how on earth are they going to guide me to amazing sights and tastes that make them proud of where they’re from? One of my favorite examples of this is Fortnum & Mason, a department store in London. Fortnum & Mason is crawling with tourists. Absolutely swimming with them. This isn’t a place Londoners casually pop into at the end of the workday for a tea restock. It’s where tourists load up on copious amounts of well-packaged items to gift to people back home. (I, for the record, kept all those purchases for myself, hoarding rose biscuits like a squirrel.) If you read up on how “touristy” this place is, you’d probably skip it. But regardless of that, you really need to go. It is awesome. My best friend and I spent an hour there, and when we left, she turned to me and said, “That was a good stop.” Yes, it was. No one gives trophies for traveling “like a local.” If you want to go someplace you’ve never been to and skip everything it’s famous for, fine. But I think it’s a much better idea to acknowledge that you are, in fact, a tourist. You’re just one that travels well. How does one travel well? I have some ideas. … and also “please,” “thank you,” and “how much?” in the language of the place you’re traveling to. Never start speaking in English to people unless you are in the United States, England, parts of Canada, or somewhere else where English is without question the language of choice. If you expect a place that doesn’t speak English to do what is most comfortable for you instead of what is life for them, you’re an asshole. Stop. Most people will make an effort to communicate with you, and people who do speak English might use it to reply. But people will be far more inclined to help you when you have made an effort to communicate with them respectfully first. Also, always start with “hello.” Don’t just launch into your wants and needs — come on, now. You’re not here to eat like you eat at home, you’re here to find out what they eat in this place you’ve traveled to. If you have dietary restrictions, do your research ahead of time and only visit locations that have suitable menus, or are accustomed to accommodating people with your specific needs. Do not be annoying in restaurants. Remember that you’re there to let this place show you things you haven’t seen before. Before you leave for your trip, spend some time with a map. Any map. Google is fine. Review the city layout, especially in relation to where you are staying, and familiarize yourself with the general scheme of things. Bonus points if you get to know the public transit system, as well as the cost and mechanics of taking it. No one is expecting you to Magellan your group around like a pro, but showing up to a city with no idea how people get around in it is a huge waste of your time. Think through your decisions and what you’ll get out of them. You’re right, a local isn’t going to wait in line to go to the top of the Eiffel Tower. But you know what? A smart tourist isn’t, either. Because you know what you can’t see from the top of the Eiffel Tower? The damn Eiffel Tower. The view is amazing from the restaurant at the top of the Centre Pompidou, and if you buy a Paris Pass you can skip the lengthy line out front and go straight up. Spend the time you saved by not waiting in the Eiffel Tower line having a picnic in front of it. There are shops and markets all over the city just waiting to sell you bread, cheese, and really cheap wine. It’ll be great. One thing bad travelers have in common is that they don’t do downtime well. They hustle from one activity to the next, never really just chilling out and enjoying their surroundings. Good travelers cut themselves a break. They sit in pubs, hang out on park benches, and sit in front of paintings for excessive amounts of time. They bring a book. They pause long enough to soak in their surroundings. If you’re a planner like me, plan your downtime into your schedule. I think you’ll find that some of your favorite vacation moments happen when not much is happening at all. We need to give the word “tourist” the image rehab it deserves. Tourism is amazing. It means people are exploring the world. It means a place has additional revenue opportunities. There are some wonderful things to experience as a tourist, and I hope you experience them. I also hope you’re respectful of the people and places you’re visiting. We are so lucky. We can be tourists anywhere we want, and the only place we really have to behave like locals is at home."
Medium.com,Life,How facing a Bear alone empowered me to live courageously,Travel,https://medium.com/soul-seekers-blog/how-facing-a-bear-alone-empowered-me-to-live-courageously-ff2e58dfdecc?source=topic_page---------194------------------1," Hiking is a soul level joy for me, I love to get out on the trail and be immersed in nature, it evokes my sense of adventure and takes me to a wonderful place of peace and contentment. Hiking always raises my spirits no matter the conditions. Even on wet days when I am out on the trail, moving my body, one step at a time, breathing in the sights, sounds and smells of the forest, lakes, mountains and wildlife, I feel alive and connected to the universal source of life. Hiking has been my life support system and has saved me from going under with the weight of grief many times in my life. My soul soars with exhilaration when I get to a peak and I take some moments to absorb the breath-taking view. I would not be where I am today if I did not have this coping mechanism. A way to step out of the daily grind and bring me to a place of calm, connection, joy and wonder. Planning my next hike excites my curiosity, where to go, when to go, what time to start. Loading my backpack with the essentials I need is a self-care practice for me. Nourishing food to give me energy, ample water supply to keep me hydrated, a flask of hot coffee so I can indulge in a cup in a scenic spot. Layers of clothes to keep me protected from the elements and ticks. A first aid kit of lotions and potions for survival. A solar power bank to keep me connected just in case I am stranded. And last but not least, since I started hiking solo in the US, my trusted Bear bell to make me feel empowered. Before my move to the US, I had hiked in Ireland, Wales, Scotland and Switzerland and had always been in a group hike with a club or friends. I loved the social element and experiencing the soul soar with others added to the experience. The comradery and support of others in a group is amazing to experience, moments where you may be struggling, someone will always offer a helping hand up. When packing up my life to relocate from Switzerland to the USA, one of the things I was most looking forward to was taking road trips to go hiking in the scenic State Parks. Back then I was in a place of my life where I was not feeling very social. I was raw from the heartbreak of divorce and resonated towards solitude as my solace. I knew getting myself to the wilderness would work wonders for my healing process. I just wasn’t ready to expose myself to the wildlife yet . Hiking came with a warning that I was in Bear Country. Bears are beautiful creatures so I reasoned that s eeing one in its natural habitat would be a wondrous e xperience. Except that I was scared of the situation playing out in real life. I wondered how would I react. My spirits were low and I was already feeling insecure. Would I be paralysed in fear, would I scream, would I be attacked, would I survive? Every time I thought I was ready to go out hiking, those fears would play out and I would change my plans. I researched hiking groups and meet ups but my heart was not in it. I didn’t feel the desire to get connected with a group, I felt strongly that I needed to venture out alone. But the thought of being exposed to the danger of meeting a wild Bear held me back. I researched how to protect myself from the dangers of Bears and found out that Bear spray was available at Outdoor stores. I went to the REI store, I loved going there to indulge my senses in the outdoor lifestyle. I picked up the Bear spray can and hesitated. The thought of being armed to defend myself against a Bear seemed upsetting to me. I couldn’t bring myself to buy it even though it was a protection strategy. In my heart I knew that it would be a fearful purchase because it catered for a close counter with a Bear, which was what I was trying to avoid. Then my eyes were drawn to a Bear Bell. I picked it up to examine it. Just a small metal bell attached to a strap. Hikers tie single bear bells or clusters of bells to their boots, backpacks or walking sticks. The unnatural sound of the Bear bell jingling will alert the Bears to the nearby presence of Hikers. Since Bears naturally want to avoid people, the sound of Bear bells will keep the bears away. The Bear bell felt like a win to me, a deterrent that acted like a warning signal to the Bears was exactly what I needed. It would mean that Bears would keep away and I would not have to face my fear. I bought it and felt a renewed sense of confidence. No more excuses now it is time to get out there. I started small and planned short three to four-hour hikes on popular paths where multiple hikers traversed. My bear bell jingled loudly and always alerted the other hikers to my whereabouts. I was building up my experience and liked the comfort of having other hikers nearby. After a while I began to feel more adventurous and wanted to plan a longer distance day hike. I planned my next hike at Minnewaska State Park in New York. It was a moderate level trail loop, that would probably take me about seven hours including a dip in lake Awosting. It was a beautiful summer day in July. An early riser, I got there when the park opened to secure the best parking spot at the trailhead. Many other early bird hikers and cyclists were gearing up in the parking lot. I felt a community of spirit with these other adventurous eager to get out there to experience the wild. My tried and trusted Bear bell was on the shoulder strap of my backpack. I loved the melodic jangle and sometimes sang along with it. I walked along at a steady pace and felt the positive vibes of being immersed in nature elevating my spirits. T he conditions were forecasted to be perfect for hiking. Not too hot but plenty of sunshine and blue skies all day. The temperatures were cooler in the forest parts of the trail and I was layered up to feel comfortable. I even brought hiking sandals to change into at the lake. It was so nice to take off the boots and free my feet. The lake stop was about half way into my hike, I was making good time so I decided to take a leisurely dip and picnic. After a refreshing swim in the clear cool waters of the lake and nourishment of my lunch I felt recharged. By then the lake was starting to get busy with other hikers and I decided it was time to get going. I packed up and got back on the trail. When leaving the lake area, I came to a signpost, going left would retrace my steps back to the parking lot and turning right would complete on the loop. I had planned to do the loop but for some reason I hesitated. There was no one around but my intuition was awakened. Going back the same way was familiar but I had already been there. Going forward meant being exposed to new sights and new places. I turned right and with my senses heightened I walked towards the bend on the path. I felt a sense of apprehension even before I turned the corner and saw the Bear. I stopped in my tracks and held my breath. There about twenty steps away was a big brown Bear rambling on all fours out of the bushes. The Bear turned its head towards me and halted. I felt a sense of wonder that it was happening to me. Time paused in that endless moment of looking at such a magnificent creature in its habitat. With a cute face, shiny fur, chubby form, this Bear looked so inviting, I wanted to reach out to it. I was drawn to the playful energy of the Bear. I sensed it was in a good mood from eating summer berries in the bushes. I felt calm yet strangely exhilarated. A rush of appreciation came over me, I understood in that moment that this was a rare occurrence to be in the presence of a Bear without the protection of a cage . Standing there immobilised in a sense of awe, I felt appreciation for the privilege of having this moment in my life. There was a sense of inexplicable connection to a larger life force. Suddenly I felt a snap in my head . I was yanked out of that peaceful trance and alerted to the perceived danger. I stepped into activation mode. I had read up on what to do in case of this situation occurring. My hand sprang to my Bear bell and I jingled it loudly at full force. I pulled it off my shoulder strap and widely waved both my hands in the air. I made my body look larger by standing with my feet wide apart. This was meant to look imposing to the Bear and to discourage it from coming closer. I started to take small backward retreating steps, all the while staying composed and keeping my eyes on the Bear. I sent out heartfelt gratitude to the Bear for allowing me this moment of intrusion in its day. I saw the Bear look behind it and wondered what it was looking at and hoped it was more intriguing that coming in my direction. Maybe there were other Bears in the vicinity, perhaps even cubs? I did not want to be exposed to any more Bears so I sent a silent prayer out to the universe to allow me to exit from this experience without harm. I reached the bend in the path and slowly the Bear vanished out of sight. I continued to walk backwards but quickened my pace. Once I had a safe distance between us, I turned and ran for a few minutes and then stopped to catch my breath. My brain started to process the experience, my heart was beating wildly, I was shaking a little and I felt electrified. I started to come back to down to earth. A group of hikers came along and upon seeing me in that state stopped to ask me if I was ok. I explained about my encounter with the Bear, along with my escape. They congratulated me on both seeing the Bear and leaving it undisturbed. They encouraged me to call the Ranger and give the location of the sighting. I did so and the sighting was recorded in the Rangers book. The Ranger told me that such a sighting was in fact rare as usually hikers are too noisy for Bears to bother with.I felt a sense of elation making that call. I knew in my heart that this was the experience that I needed to empower myself forward in my life. I didn’t finish the loop trail that day, instead I went back the same way I had come from. Even though that way was not a Bear free zone, I knew what the terrain was like. I trusted that it was the more populated route with other hikers getting to the lake. Once I finished the hike I felt on top of the world. The heart rush came back when I sat in my car and relived the moment. I knew this was a turning point in my life story. The encounter with the Bear taught me so many valuable lessons. To pay attention to my inner compass, when there is a crossroads, to trust that whatever way I go will be the one meant for me. To lean into my intuition, I was aware something magnificent was going to step on my path before I even witnessed it. To rely on myself to stay safe while still exposing myself to the wilds of the unknown. I learned that facing your fears unlocks you from your own mental prison. The experience that I had when I faced the Bear was extraordinarily liberating. I did not feel in danger, I felt calm, and free to experience the wonder of the moment. Overall, I felt a sense of immense gratitude for having being fully present in the situation. I was right there on the path looking straight at the Bear and in the absence of panic I felt alive, curious, courageous and connection. I felt the connection to the power of the universe amplifying. I had a knowing that this encounter was orchestrated for me by a higher force. I felt encouraged and my faith in the wonders of life was restored. I felt victorious to have put myself through a test of faith and belief in myself. That feeling of elation has stayed with me since and is accessible in times of need. On another occasion I did go back to the same hike and finish the loop. I passed that same meeting point on the trail and paused for a long time in remembrance. I no longer felt afraid of having another encounter with a Bear and somehow understood that it was unlikely to be repeated. I have taken what I needed from the encounter and empowered myself. I have liberated myself from living in fear and have opened my heart to living courageously. This experience gave me the confidence to purposefully go on other solo adventures. One of which was an intensive, eight-day Vision Quest in Sedona, Arizona, which accelerated my soul healing journey and put me on the path to fulfil my soul purpose. If you have read my you will know that this was where I heard the calling to start my next chapter in becoming the Life and Soul Coach. I promise I will share more of that story in a future post. I often think fondly of that Bear and from my heart I send gratitude for the blessings of living a healthy, wonderful, wild and free life."
Medium.com,Life,5 Must-Visit Historic Places in Mumbai,Travel,https://medium.com/@shaya.learns/5-must-visit-historic-places-in-mumbai-d91cf206a059?source=topic_page---------195------------------1," Today’s post on the must-visit historic places in Mumbai is by my new apprentice Shaeista Misarwala. Mumbai is India’s largest city and the setting of one of my favorite films — Slumdog Millionaire. Plan and visit these 5 famous historic places in Mumbai. See the beautiful architecture of Gateway of India, take a ferry ride to Elephanta Island and marvel at the ancient Caves. Take a walking tour to learn about the history of Chhatrapti Shivaji Terminus. If you need fresh air or want to connect to nature in the bustling city of Mumbai, you can visit the Historic Sanjay Gandhi National Park. If you are in Mumbai, you have to visit the Gateway of India. The Gateway of India is synonymous with the city of Mumbai and is one of the prime tourist attractions and historic places in Mumbai. It is located on the waterfront facing the Arabian Sea, Taj Mahal Palace and the Tower Hotel are opposite the gateway. The Gateway of India was designed in the Indo-Saracenic style. You can also find some traces of Muslim architecture. There are designs of intricate latticework. The 4 turrets are the most prominent feature. The monument was built to commemorate the visit of King George V and Queen Mary when they visited India for the first time, they to proclaim as Emperor and Emperess of India at the Delhi Darbar in December 1911. The foundation stone was laid in March 1913. A cardboard structure was built during the visit of the Emperor and Emperess, as the final gateway was not yet ready. Architect George Wittet’s final design of the gateway was sanctioned in 1914 and the construction was completed in 1924. The monument is made from basalt and indissoluble concrete. It is 85 feet high. The Gateway of India was used as a ceremonial entrance for important British colonial personnel. It was called a symbol of “Conquest and Colonisation” commemorating British colonial legacy. The last British troops left India from the Gateway of India. Opposite the gateway is the statue of Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaja. He was a Maratha warrior who fought against the Mughal Empire in the 17th century. The statue was unveiled on 26th January 1961 on the occasion of Republic Day. It replaced a bronze statue of King George V. The Maharashtra Tourism Development Corporation in 2012 moved the Elephanta Festival of Music and Dance from its original location at Elephanta Caves to the Gateway of India, After 23 years, due to increased capacity offered by the venue. The Gateway of India can host 2,000–2,500 people whereas Elephanta caves can host 700–800 people. How to get there: The Gateway of India is 2.4 km away from Churchgate station, you can hail a cab or get on a bus from there. Entry is free. You can visit at any time of the day. The best time month to visit is between November to March. The weather is fairly pleasant post-monsoon. 10 kilometers East of The Gateway of India is Elephanta Islands, also known as Gharapuri (city of caves). It’s probably the most famous of all of the historic places in Mumbai. This UNESCO World Heritage Site straddles two hills, one to the west and the east. The western ridge rises gradually from the sea and expands towards the east across a gorge and peaks at an elevation of about 173 meters. The landmark cave here is Cave 1 or the Great Cave on the western hill known for its stellar Shaivite depictions and reliefs from Hindu epics and mythology. Adjacent to Cave 1 and in the southeast direction, Cave 2 through cave 5. Cave 6 and 7, however, are on the rim of the eastern hill which is otherwise home to the two Buddhist caves with Stupas and water tanks. There is a walkway connecting the east and the west hill. The local Marathi folks popularised this island as Gharapuri, but Elephanta became common after the Portuguese took over the land from the Gujarat Sultanate in 1534 and named it so after the massive rock-cut elephant statue that stood sentinel over the sea. The colonizers identified the structure as a landmark to dock their boats and to also tell it apart from the other smaller islands on the Arabian Sea. The monolithic elephant statue was damaged in an attempt to move it to England. In 1914, it was reassembled by Cadell and Hewett and placed in the Jijamata Udyaan, a zoo, and garden in Byculla, Mumbai, where it stands today. You need to take a ferry from the Gateway of India jetty. The ferry charges around INR 150 for a return trip. It is an hour-long journey from Mumbai Harbour to Elephanta Islands. From here you can either walk the one-kilometer distance from the harbor to the base of the western hill, home to the Grand Cave or take a toy train to the site. The toy train charges INR 10 per passenger. Further, there is a climb of 120 steps to the entrance of Cave 1. There are two city buses, 111 and 112 that depart from Mumbai CST and Ahilyabai Holkar Chowk respectively and drop you at the Gateway of India. To get to the Elephanta Island, further board the ferry from the Gateway of India jetty. Visiting hours are 9:30 am- 5:30 pm. Entry fees is INR 40 for Indian Tourists and 600 for Foreign Tourists. While Elephanta Caves is a year-round destination, it is best to avoid the monsoon between June and August because torrential rains can derail boat schedules, besides choppy waters, may not be the most ideal to venture into. The best time to visit is between November to March. Moreover, February is the month for the two-day Elephanta festival which experiences an explosion of cultural activities from classical dance performances, musical recitals, theatre renditions, and not to mention, performances by folks from the local Koli fishing community. The Trimurti sculpture in the backdrop, the ambiance in the pillared portico of the Great Cave and the venue for the festival is amazing. Chatrapati Shivaji Terminus (CST) formerly known as Victoria Terminus was built in 1888. It was designed by the British architect F.W. Stevens. It is a very popular station and is a spitting image of the Victorian Gothic style of architecture. There are some remnants of the Mughal styled architecture as well. Mumbai was labeled as ‘Gothic City’ due to the magnificent architecture of Chatrapati Shivaji Terminus. In 2004, UNESCO declared CST as a ‘World Heritage Site’. This monument is a reminder of the British Rule pre-independence. CST is one of the most historical landmarks within the Central Business District (CBD) of Mumbai. The structure represents the heart of the mercantile facet of Mumbai and also symbolizes the British Commonwealth. CST is well connected to other stations in the country. In the past, ‘Bori Bunder’ station located along the eastern parts of Mumbai was the place for commercial exchanges and trading activities. In the 1850’s, the Great Indian Peninsular Railway operated in this area and gave it the name ‘Bori Bandar’, starting its first rail service, covering a total distance of 34 km to Thane. The station was named after Queen Victoria. The construction of the station took 10 years to complete and was inaugurated on the Golden Jubilee of the Queen in 1887. It was the most expensive building in Mumbai costing 260,000 Sterling Pounds. The station was built to handle rail traffic. In 1929, a new station and administrative headquarters were built by the Central Railway. In 1996, the Minister of Railways, Suresh Kalmadi, changed the name of the station to Chatrapati Shivaji Terminus. Complete with turrets, and pointed arches the CST was a novel achievement. To date, the building retains most of the architectural designs with an addition of two or more headquarters. The CST was built in accordance with a C-shaped plan, symmetrical on both, the east and the west axis. It is crowned by a high dome, which is the focal point of the structure. The CST building is adjoined with well-proportioned rows of arched structures, rows, and windows, closely resembling Indian palace architectures. The entrance of the Chhatrapati Shivaji terminus is flanked by figures of a lion and a tiger representing the two countries- Britain and India. The main structure is made of sandstone and limestone, and the interiors of the station are lined with high-quality Italian marble. Apart from the 18 railway lines, the CST also houses the main headquarters, the Star Chamber, grotesques and the North Wing. The Chatrapati Shivaji Terminus is one of the most treasured historical landmarks in Mumbai. If you are visiting Mumbai, make sure CST is on your list. It is easy to reach the CST by rail, as it is very likely that your train might just disembark at this station! However, if you are coming from other central or suburban railway stations, then you can reach CST through local transport. You can even hail a cab or take a bus. Chatrapati Shivaji Maharaj Vastu Sangrahalaya (CSMVS) was formerly known as The Prince of Wales Museum. It is in a very popular and old area of Mumbai, known as Fort. This Historical site in Mumbai was established in the early 20th century. It is one of the most significant museums in India and hence a must-visit. The museum showcases several collections of ancient artworks, sculptures, and artifacts. After the renovation in 2008, many new galleries were opened in the museum. The artwork of Hindu God Krishna, textiles and Indian traditional costumes were added to the new galleries. The Prince of Wales Museum was built to honor and commemorate the visit of King George V to India. This museum was designed by George Wittet and it was ready in 1915. The idea for the museum was initiated in 1904 and the foundation stone was laid by the Prince of Wales in 1905. In 1907, the Mumbai Presidency granted the museum committee a strip of land called the ‘Crescent Site’. Initially, the building was used as a military hospital and a ‘Children’s Welfare Centre’. The museum was inaugurated in 1992. Different forms of art and artifacts from India, Tibet, Nepal, and other far eastern countries are preserved in this museum. The museum also has a collection of 2000 rare miniature paintings from several art schools in India. Ancient Indian art and sculptures are exhibited in the museum’s sculpture gallery. You can also find decorative artworks made from wood, metal, jade, and ivory in the museum collections. There are also rare archeological artifacts that date back to the ‘Indus Valley’ civilization in the 2000 B.C. Remnants from the ‘Maurya’ as well as ‘Gupta’ periods are displayed in the museum. The ‘Natural History’ section of the museum includes a collection of reptiles, mammals, amphibians, birds, and fishes. There is a section that displays Indian arms and armor. It is an array of weapons, swords, shields in addition to other projectiles. The museum also displays European oil paintings. There is a new Children’s Museum alongside the Main Museum. There are many different activities and programs organized for children. Find more information here. You can hail an auto-rickshaw or get on a bus as well to reach the museum. It is 13 mins walk from the Gate of India. Entry Fees is INR 30, and timings are 10:15 am to 6 pm. Last but not least of the historic places in Mumbai is the Sanjay Gandhi National Park, which was formerly known as Borivali National Park. In 1996, the park was renamed to Sanjay Gandhi National Park, the son of former Prime Minister Indira Gandhi. It is one of the major National Parks in the State of Maharashtra. The 2400-year-old Kanheri caves sculpted out of rocky cliffs also lie in this park. The Sanjay Gandhi National Park dates back to the 4th century. In ancient India, Sopara and Kalyan were two ports in the city that traded with civilizations such as Greece and Mesopotamia. The 45 km land route between these two ports was through this forest. The Kanheri Caves in the center of the park was an important Buddhist Learning Center and Pilgrimage site. It was sculpted by Buddhist monks. They were made engraved out of a massive basaltic rock. The park occupies most of the Northern Suburbs of Mumbai. To the West lies Goregaon, Malad, Kandivali, Borivali, and Dahisar. To the East lies Bhandup and Mulund. Aarey Milk Colony and the University Campus of IIt Bombay is to the south of the National Park. These are all part of Mumbai. Sanjay Gandhi National Park is the only park that is a protected forest within the city. The park is hilly. It has two lakes, Vihar Lake and Tulsi Lake, which meet a part of the city’s water requirements. The park is said to be the lungs of the city as it purifies much of the air pollution of the city. There are a lot of things you can see in the historical Sanjay Gandhi National Park. The park is home to a number of endangered species of flora and fauna. The forest area of the park houses over 1,300+ plant species, 274 species of migratory, land and water birds, 50,000 species of insects and 35 species of mammals. In addition, the park also provides shelter to 38 species of reptiles, 9 species of amphibians, 170 species of butterflies and a large variety of fish. There is a toy train ride which lasts for 15 min. It rides along the foothills of the Mahatma Gandhi Memorial at the Pavilion Hill. The train crosses across bridges and tunnels and also passes through the Deer Park. 2 and 4 seater pedaling boats to sail in the small lake are also available in the park. There is a view bridge from where visitors can see people pedaling the boats. The Lion and Tiger Safaris are one of the main attractions of the National Park. The Lion Safari in one of the park’s green buses is a 20 mins ride through fenced forest. The park is home to an estimated 25 Lions and Lionesses, of which only 2 can be safely seen at close range from the caged buses. The remaining have been relocated to fenced areas far away from the roads. During visiting hours, some Lions are let out into the enclosure and can be seen from the bus. There are four tigers which are also in a fenced area, you can see them from the safety of the green buses. It is 0.9km from Borivali East station. You can hail an auto-rickshaw or get on a bus from the station. You can also book a cab from any part of the city to get to the National Park. 7:30 am -6:30 pm. Private cars are allowed inside the historical National park till the Kanheri Caves. All park amenities are closed on Monday. You can book your tickets here.

Some comfortable sandals work well in India as it can be hot so they will let your feet breathe. It can get extremely hot in some parts of India and so sun cream is essential. It’s a good idea to pack conservative clothing for India. Avoid short skirts and low cut tops or spaghetti straps. Comfortable trousers and linen tops are great. Long skirts and Maxi dresses also work really well and are comfortable with the heat. Comfortable loose cotton or linen trousers are perfect.

Medium.com,Life,‘Eat Pray Love’ Ruined Travel Writing,Travel,https://medium.com/swlh/eat-pray-love-ruined-travel-writing-cf444eebd085?source=topic_page---------196------------------1," Dear Elizabeth Gilbert, You’re probably a lovely person but I just wanted to let you know that Eat, Pray, Love ruined everything. I’m glad you found yourself and your handsome Brazilian after what sounds like a painful divorce. I accept that millions of readers have been inspired by your soul searching, even if I was not — so I’ll get straight to the point. Liz, your book is marketed as a travel memoir. In fact, it is marketed as THE travel memoir for women. To be fair, I understand how marketing works and that you may have had nothing to do with this. But you’ve still ruined things for the rest of us. By us, I’m referring to an admittedly small group of women who’ve written our own manuscripts that, whether or not we want them to, publishers slap the label “travel memoir” on to — which means we automatically get compared to your bestseller. And, by extension, to the Julia Roberts movie where it takes her a quarter of the film to even leave America. Liz, we’re compared to you simply because we’re women. I’m not saying your pseudo-spiritual claptrap isn’t well-written and even entertaining in parts, depending on whether a reader is into long-winded descriptions of God and prayer and how the universe manifests what you’re seeking.* *(If you’re a rather privileged white woman from a western country with a passport that allows you to cross borders and enough in your bank account to not work for a year.) Liz, you can probably tell I’m not a great believer in getting things just because you’ve prayed for them. I’ve travelled in far too many poverty-stricken countries to see how that could possibly be true. Oh that’s right, so have you. Liz, I get that you wrote a book set in Italy and India and Indonesia which tells us next to nothing about Italians, Indians or Indonesians. If you wanted to meet Indians you would have set foot outside of the ashram, after all. It wasn’t even that your descriptions of the Americans and Australians and Europeans populating your travels didn’t grab me — it’s just that now publishers seem to think that’s what travel is. FOR WOMEN. Liz, I pitched my manuscript to a publisher the other day and they asked me “What’s your spiritual journey? What did you learn about yourself? Is it the next Eat Pray Love?” She actually apologised for asking the last question, but she asked it anyway. Liz, I wonder whether male travel writers get asked if they found themselves. I had to google Bill Bryson to find out if he was married. And I’ve read plenty of his books. They’re all about travel, you see. Men don’t need to have an epiphany or fall in love while travelling to write a book that people will read. But not us, Liz. Not the women writers. Even though women have been reading about men travelling for centuries, female travel memoirs will apparently only be read by women. And APPARENTLY women readers only want to eat, pray and love. Liz, I would like to rejoice in every female writer’s success, I really would. The problem is, you showed us that women could sell travel books, just as long as those books weren’t really about travel. So thanks Liz. You ruined everything."

Medium.com,Life,30 Practical Ways to Make Hotel More Eco-Friendly,Travel,https://medium.com/@yanamaximova/30-practical-ways-to-make-hotel-more-eco-friendly-e94e5b4ac202?source=topic_page---------199------------------1," If you run an accommodation business, be it a hotel, guesthouse, resort or other types of facilities, making your business more sustainable is a good choice. Nowadays many people are consciously trying to make eco-friendly choices when it comes to their hotel stay. These days, it’s crucial for your hotel to adopt more eco-friendly practices so your business can stay competitive, attract more travelers, save money, and do its part to protect the planet. We have collected some tips and suggestions to make your hotel business greener and more sustainable. 1. Stop changing towels and bed linens every day. There’s absolutely no need to be changing them daily. No one changes them that frequently back home, therefore there’s no real need to do it in the hotels. Many hotels around the world change the towels and bed linens once every 3 days or upon request of a guest. If you do laundry less frequently, you save water, energy, use less detergent and obviously spend less money. Leave clear instructions to your guests what they should do if they want to get clean towels. For example: Don’t overstock the rooms with towels. In most cases, guests will not use all of them, however, the hotel staff will have to change them when preparing a room for new customers. You can leave a note asking guests to request for more towels if they need them. Or have the spare towels in the top of the wardrobe, so if they’re still there folded the same, they stay. 2. Install built-in refillable shampoo and soap dispensers in a bathroom. Instead of providing little individual shampoos every day you can have a refillable dispenser for shampoo, conditioner and other complimentary things. You can get pretty reusable glass bottles, which will also help your bathrooms look more luxury. Just make sure that refillable dispensers are fixed, so no one takes them. This change will not only reduce plastic waste,but it will also help to cut the costs down! Many people often take the little shampoo/conditioner bottles with them even if they’re not used. Also buying products like shampoo/soap/conditioner in bulk will greatly reduce costs in comparison to buying single-use products. Alternatively, you can stop stocking up the rooms with small bottles and instead just put a little sign saying to call down if guests need anything. Many people travel with their own shower essentials, but they still use or take the complimentary bottles just because they are there. As to the little bars of soap, choose the options wrapped in paper or in a cardboard box. Also instead of throwing away the used soap bars, send everything to the charities that melt and sterilize the leftover soap and give it to those in need. 3. Use more eco-friendly cleaning products. Purchase natural cleaning products such as Seventh Generation, Ecover and If You Care. If you run a small hotel or a guesthouse, you can also start making your own natural DYI cleaning products. Equip your cleaning personnel with rags instead of paper towels and reusable (washable) dusters. 4. No paper seat on the toilet. Do you really need to use it to prove that the toilet was cleaned? 5. Provide fewer amenities in rooms. Leave a note asking guests to call down for the toiletries (shampoo, toothbrush, shower cap) instead of putting them in the room. And when you provide toiletries, give the eco-friendly versions. For example, bamboo toothbrush instead of a plastic one. It’s also important, to reduce the amount of plastic wrapping. Go for non-wrapped sewing kits/earbuds/cotton makeup remover pads/shower caps in rooms. Have them available at reception and provided upon request. 6. Add recycling and/or compost bins in every room. Encourage guests to recycle by providing those options in the room. You can offer 3 types of bins in the room: for landfill, recycling, and for food waste (composting) instead of one bin for everything. Colour code them so it’s easy to figure out. Usually, it’s black, blue and green. The content from the compost bins can be used for landscaping on your property. 7. Naked trash bins. Stop using plastic liners in trash cans. Look into recycled paper bags, ones that are pretty thin to use as trash can liners. Or better stop using any liners altogether and just wash the trash cans out. If you can’t refuse the liners yet, then train the housekeeping staff to condense bags of trash rather than just pulling every trash bag out that has a little bit of trash in it. And absolutely do not throw out trash can liners each day with one item in it, but collect all trash in 1 big bag. 8. Real water glasses and ceramic coffee mugs in the room. Honestly, stop using disposable cups. Just think how much waste it generates every day. How much money do you spend on buying disposable Styrofoam or paper cups every month? Invest in good glasses and ceramic mugs once and keep reusing them forever. You may be worried that this will increase the cleaning time. But it will take maximum a couple of minutes to wash the cups, which will not affect the total workload. As from the perspective of a guest, it’s much nicer to use real glasses. It feels more like home when you can have a cup of tea or coffee from a ceramic mug. Plus it makes the room look more expensive. One more important point, don’t wrap clean glasses in plastic. It’s absolutely unnecessary. Just train the cleaning personnel to wash the glasses every day. 9. Say no to plastic water bottles. Single-use plastic water bottles are a really big contributor to plastic pollution. If you want to make your hotel more eco-friendly, you should stop providing water in plastic. What you can do instead: 10. Cloth napkins. It’s time to stop using paper towels and tissues and replace them with cloth napkins in kitchenettes and in the restaurant. After use just wash them together with the towels and linens. 11. NO straws. This is one of the first things you should do in order to make your hotel more eco-friendly. Stop purchasing single-use straws, especially plastic ones. Paper straws are a better alternative, however, they are still disposable and require a lot of paper to be made. So best to stop using straws completely or switch to reusable metal or bamboo options. In any case, you need to have a few reusable straws for people with disabilities. 12. No single-serve, individually wrapped butter/margarine/ketchup/sauce/mayo/honey/jam at breakfast. Stop providing those little plastic pots. 13. Offer real coffee and a coffee press, loose tea and a tea strainer. The amount of packaging involved in instant tea and coffee is prohibitive! Use reusable glass canisters for new coffee grounds and tea in the rooms instead of single-use sachets. 14. Provide real plates, cups and cutlery. While the use of disposables makes cleaning easier, it’s the only advantage of it. First of all, real plates and silverware at breakfast, make it feel homier. Plus, subconsciously, when people see disposable plates they think of poor-quality take away food, which may spoil their whole experience. And of course, you save money when you stop buying plates and cutleries every month. 15. Eco-friendly take-away. For the environment, it’s best not to do takeaways at all. For example, in the restaurant, you can have a sign saying something along the lines: We choose to support the environment and do not provide single-use take away products. Please sit and enjoy your coffee here. This move will clearly state that you care about the environment and will make your branded identity stronger. If a takeaway has to be available, then go for paper cups for coffee and biodegradable food containers made of yam or corn starch. 16. Get rid of disposable slippers. Same as with the complimentary toiletries in small bottles, in many cases, people used them not because they need them but because they are there. Get rid of bathrobe as well, and offer it upon request. This will help to reduce the frequency of washings. 17. Provide a reusable bag for laundry. Return the bag in the room, once the laundry is done. No more plastic bags. 18. Make changes in the mini-bar. Lots of snacks wrapped in plastic can be switched out with fancier treats on a plate or more zero waste friendly options. 19. Do you offer dry cleaning? If so, instead of returning each piece of clothing hung in plastic, you can either fold all in a pretty basket or cluster all clothes into one plastic cover instead of each one having its own. 20. Reusable shopping bag available in a room to borrow. This doesn’t affect the sustainability of your hotel directly. But it helps your guests to make their shopping a bit greener. 21. Reuse key cards. Collect the key cards and reuse them. Have an easy drop jar or slot by the exit of hotel door to drop them into. 22. Email invoices. Send a bill to an email address instead of automatically printing it. Or at least give such option to your guests and let them decide. 23. Switch to eco-friendly fluorescent lights to reduce electricity use. Change all the lights in the hotel to energy-saving bulbs. They have the lowest carbon footprint, as they last 5–20 times longer than conventional bulbs. 24. Keep the heating and air-conditioning turned off when the rooms are unoccupied! Very often hotel personal keeps AC and heating on in all rooms, even when there are no guests. And then it’s either freezing or boiling hot in the room when the guests arrive. Imagine how much energy is wasted. Educate your staff to turn off the lights and heating/airconditioning when the rooms are unoccupied. 25. Put water savers on all taps and showers. This will help to reduce water consumption. You can find special showerheads that use less water but still maintain pressure. The guests will not notice a difference. 26. Install the system that turns off the light in the room automatically. Many hotels use the keycard system as a way to reduce electricity usage. When a guest enters the room he needs to insert the card into a special slot on the wall for the light to be activated. When the guest leaves the room he takes the key out and the lights turn off. This automatically shuts off TV, lights, and appliances. 27. Conduct an audit of your hotel. There are special organizations that conduct waste/energy/cost audit and give recommendations for improvement. The advantage is that they give recommendations specific to your region, taking into account local regulations and available resources. 28. Give coupons for skipping housekeeping. People love getting discounts and freebies. Offer your guests a coupon for free breakfast or purchase at your coffee shop if they skip a day of housekeeping in the room. What some people say about such an initiative in the hotels: A real winner for me was a $5 voucher for the bar/coffee shop each day I skipped housekeeping. Needless to say each day I visited bar/coffeeshop and spent much more than $5. Win-win. 29. Motivate your guests to use green transportation options. Provide walking maps, information about public transportation or rent out bicycles to your guests. Motivate your guests to explore the area in a more ecological way instead of getting taxis everywhere. 30. Sign about a green policy of the hotel. Make sure to place signs in the rooms and/or in the lobby explaining why the hotel chooses to do something different to help the planet. Guests will feel good about the hotel and about themselves for staying in such a place. Also, still many people don’t know anything about eco-living. They may learn something new when reading your signs, and it may get them thinking about changing their own habits and lifestyle. And a special bonus tip for you! Every year WWF organises Earth Hour event with the aim to increase awareness about climate change and loss of nature. Millions of people turn off their lights around the world for 1 hour to show that they care for the Planet. As a business, you have the power to make a great contribution by organising some activity for your guests. Make sure to check our post to learn more about the Earth hour event and how you can participate in it."

Medium.com,Life,The True Magic of Halloween in Salem,Travel,https://medium.com/@kirstenkirby/the-true-magic-of-halloween-in-salem-c76e152846a8?source=topic_page---------202------------------1," Despite its dark history, every year Salem, Massachusetts is full of life and energy as thousands of people come to celebrate Halloween. All of the city streets are closed to cars, meaning people can freely walk, crawl, frolick, strut, or whatever else their costume requires. It is a feast for the eyes and an Instagram paradise, with amazing costumes and make-up that rivals anything seen in the biggest budget movies. While the spectacle is certainly something to experience, Halloween in Salem is so much more than that. It is whatever you need it to be. A cure for invisibility If you feel like just another face in the crowd or that no one ever even notices you, Halloween in Salem is the antidote. You can put on the most extravagant, witty, or scary costume and proudly parade through the streets. You will be stopped by complete strangers asking to take a selfie with you and you will be all over Instagram. It is a unique chance to shine, to stand out, and to be seen. …or a chance to disappear Feeling too exposed lately or that you wish you could dial down your public persona? What better opportunity to do so than to be in a place where disguising yourself is celebrated! In addition to masks of legendary horror movie characters, there are all kinds of beautiful masks to choose from. You could also transform into whatever person or creature you want using make-up. Looking like someone or something else for a night can be very freeing. There may even be a few presidential candidates making a stop in Salem before heading up to New Hampshire or other famous people hiding under masks or make-up. A chance to make memories Getting married in Salem on Halloween night is very popular and it’s common to see actual brides and grooms walking around town with their family, guests, and wedding photographers in tow. In speaking with an employee at City Hall, October is when the highest number of marriage licenses are issued in Salem (often over 90). At least these couples are less likely to forget their anniversary! Whole families also get into the spirit of Halloween in Salem. Many come dressed in themed costumes such as the Addams Family, characters from Star Wars, or a whole group of different characters from other shows or movies. There are also groups of friends who wear costumes such as the Sanderson Sisters from Hocus Pocus, a beloved Halloween classic filmed in and around Salem. Seeing how much fun they are having is infectious. …or a chance to forget Salem’s many bars go all out for Halloween night, featuring all kinds of festive drinks, costume contests, and more. Also, simply walking around town makes you feel like you have been transported to a different world. Given the craziness of our own world these days, there is something special about the opportunity to leave it behind for a night. A chance to experience the expected When you come to Salem for Halloween, you know you are going to see some truly remarkable costumes and it doesn’t disappoint. Be prepared to be blown away by the level of creativity and detail that goes into them. It’s overwhelming at times but also very inspiring. …or the unexpected It didn’t occur to me that there might be Christian protesters in Salem on Halloween night but there are actually a lot. One large group usually sets up right at one end of the pedestrian walkway on Essex Street and features different people preaching through a megaphone. At the other end, people stand holding signs with bible quotes. They are largely left alone to do their thing. This is just one of many examples of what might surprise you. A chance to have fun From seeing witty, creative costumes to watching people jump back and scream when a man dressed up as Frankenstein lunges forward towards them, Halloween in Salem has its share of fun sights and sounds. One of the costumes that cracked me up last year was the pack of murderous Teletubbies. Who knew that after singing those happy songs on their show, they picked up chainsaws and went on a killing spree? If you are looking for a souvenir or are beginning to shop for another holiday coming up, Salem has some truly unique items. I’m not talking about the typical witch kitsch of “My other car is a broom” bumper stickers and “I got stoned in Salem” t-shirts. Looking to make a unique fashion statement? How about some insect jewelry? There are also several places that make custom vampire fangs. Who wants to just buy off the shelf fangs when you can go couture? If getting photos taken is more your style, there are places where you can do a glamor shot session dressed up as a witch or warlock or get your aura photograph taken, along with receiving a report on what your aura colors mean. …or a chance to be serious Salem has become a Halloween destination for a deeply sad, disturbing reason. In 1692, 20 people (16 women and 4 men) were tried and executed for witchcraft and over a hundred more were arrested. Many of these prisoners ended up starving or freezing to death in jails throughout Boston and its suburbs, never living to be tried for their alleged crimes. Their accusers were young girls, some of whom testified that a large number of people in their town were witches. As the hysteria reached its peak, no one felt they could challenge the girls’ accounts for fear of being accused and sentenced to death themselves. It was truly a horrific chapter in American history and stands as a powerful warning of how easy it is for neighbors to turn against each other and for people to be wrongfully convicted and executed. The Salem Witch Trials Memorial is one of the most hauntingly beautiful and heartbreaking places in the city. In a horseshoe-shaped courtyard, 20 slabs protrude out from a stone wall and each bears the name of a victim as well as the date and method of their execution. Visitors leave all kinds of items here, including flowers and messages. One note I saw was written by a descendant of Rebecca Nurse and shared how she wanted her distant relative to know she had been exonerated and that she has not been forgotten. There are also quotes taken from the victims’ court testimony, where they professed their innocence. Nobel Laureate and Holocaust survivor Elie Wiesel spoke at the August 5, 1992 dedication ceremony, sharing a warning: “…what we have seen here today is a lesson not about the past only, but also about the present. That whenever a person or a group of persons come and say that they are superior to another group because of their color, race or religion, they will create upheavals with bloodshed accompanying them. With innocence becoming the first victim. For when people are unjustly accused, when people are unjustly imprisoned, when people, men or women or children — for God’s sake I cannot forget that one of those in prison was four years old, with chains — when children are victimized, humiliated, that means there’s something wrong with our society.” If you are seeking a spot where you can reflect on the injustices of both the past and present, there is no more poignant place to go. True Magic For some people, being in Salem on Halloween has become an annual tradition while for others, it’s a once in a lifetime trip. If you are coming, take a moment to think about what you are hoping to gain from your experience. No matter what your reason is for visiting Salem, may you have a Halloween filled with whatever kind of magic and adventure you need the most."

This 11-day expedition provided stunning scenic wonders. In UNESCO National Parks we saw volcanoes, alps, crystal fjords, canyons, fields of heather, emerald rivers, orchids and glacier pillars thrusting 8,000' high and the famous mountain massifs of Torres del Paine and the great Grey Glacier. At our Calgary Travel Agency, we regularly find and post our flight deals from Calgary to Santiago, Chile! Sensational scenes gave us a consistent Kodak memories all through our journey. It is pre-summer in the district and the climate was helpful with a ton of daylight. This anyway is where the “sudden” is the standard, so we came well-prepared for infrequent breeze and downpour. After a rest at the stunning Hotel Neruda and a city visit in Santiago, we flew south to Punta Arenas. There we traveled 2 hours by mentor to Puerto Natales at the Patagonia steppe. We respected a medium-term at the simple yet comfortable Charles Darwin Hotel and an awesome supper of fresh crab and yummy salmon. The next day we cruised a few hours on the vessel named “21 de Mayo” up the fjord of Ultima Esperanza. We halted for a climb around the astonishing Serano Glacier and a lunch on sheep at a remote cow farm. Later we boarded zodiac vessels for an exciting ride to our cabin situated inside Torres del Paine National Park. Hosteria Pehoe is amazing and classic for a price of $200 (USD) per room yet it lies on the edge of a turquoise chilly lake with an incredibly excellent view. The scenery of the prickly tall rough mountains topped with ice was as clear as a postcard. Our travel agency is blessed to be run and managed by folks who are passionate about travel and sharing their adventures! Our three days were spent visiting the recreation center. We had the option to photograph the untamed life including guanaco’s of the llama family, foxes, flamingo, ocean lions, dark neck swans, condors, cormorants and that’s only the tip of the iceberg. A few in our gathering organized a nighttime climb to see the slippery panther however none were spotted. Extra time was accommodated steed riding and drifting to heavenly Grey Glacier which was a ton of fun and filled with laughs (some nervous!). A few people decided on a challenging 8 hour climb up the popular transcending pinnacles known as The Torres. Next, we flew on to Puerto Montt and looked into the top of the line Hotel Gran Pacifica for four magnificent evenings to investigate Chile’s lake district. It started in Puyehue National Park with the background of two breathtaking and dynamic wells of lava named Osorno and Calbuco. The evening was spent at the natural aquifers region of Aguas Calientes for a dip in the 110º perfectly clear water. Here we took an interest in a discretionary covering link swing experience through the treetops which was more enjoyable than a truckload of good times. Enroute back to our inn, we visited a craftsmanship advertise with great purchases on alpaca sweaters and blue lapis stoned gems. The following day we kayaked the incredible Petrohue River on class 3 and 4 white water rapids. Four individuals dropped out of an upset pontoon yet wet suites gave security from the freezing water and master manages in kayaks had the option to rapidly recover all. This journey for me was the feature of the excursion. On day 8 we were delighted to be in a sailboat voyage along the shores of All Saints Lake likewise named Emerald Lake for it’s lively shading in Peulla. The lavish green timberland here is set in the Andes lower regions and spreads 220,000 sections of land. We shot a progression of delightful and amazing cascades falling over volcanic stones of the ice topped Osorno. Our get-away experience finished back in Santiago with a goodbye gala of fish at a special nearby café. Preceding air terminal flight, we visited the Cavas del Maipo Winery. We appreciated a lunch of phenomenal BBQ steak and soaked up on unending wine, including a few vintages which rank among the countries most regarded fares. Travel agencies around Calgary rarely focus on any other destinations beside the routine all inclusive resorts — Wanderfly Canada, our travel agency in Calgary is an exception. We are able to do these trips because our agency’s focus on getting more people explore the world without breaking the bank! Ten days were adequate here to make memories for a lifetime. I’ve had my fill of salmon and sheep for a lifetime and think about back a voyage very much done. We had a brilliant gathering of 35 members, most who met as outsiders and returned as deep rooted companions. The expense of this excursion was $2229 in addition to charges which included round trip air from Calgary and every single inner flight. Luckily and as usual our travel agency had deals to fly from Calgary to Santiago for $490 return — there’s no beating that! The $100 Chilean passage visa was extra. It was a decent worth and the aides all through were fantastic. I have visited more than 30 nations. What makes this place magical and one of kind is definitely just the remoteness; unblemished and unscarred nature in her best wonder. In Patagonia God made an ideal juxtaposition of New Zealand’s fjords, Switzerland’s Alps and British Columbia’s woodlands and lakes. Chile is a misnomer with no association with peppers. It was the Inca word for “land far away.” I felt far expelled in this restricted land that stretches as far as possible of the world yet had the option to encounter every one of the solaces of home. It positively surpassed my desires and I prescribe it for any brave explorers rundown of must-see goals of a lifetime. At the end of the day, this is another great travel trip that I would highly recommend that you should consider if Chile/Argentina is on your mind. Trust me, you will not regret it — and don’t forget to call out travel agency in Calgary — Wanderfly Canada, to book your flights, accommodations and travel health insurance. There’s an entire world out there to explore — make Patagonia the top of your destination to visit lists. There are many beautiful places on earth, but there are not many as beautiful and untouched as the Patagonia — Chilean and Argentinian. Until next time, wishing you safe and happy travels. — JP

Medium.com,Life,Tunisia,Travel,https://medium.com/homeisbehind/tunisia-2152ac345b99?source=topic_page---------206------------------1," “The police,” he said. “Were shooting us. With gas, bullets, everything, you understand?” He lit another cigarette, and the orange flicker cast a dim glow over the untrimmed stubble reaching down to his collar. Next to me, three cockroaches lay mournfully shrivelled on a ledge, the poor bastards smothered to death by decades of accumulated second-hand smoke. “But me, I was ok.” He shrugged. “So next day I went back, and then again, every day.” It was 2016 and we were sitting in a dingy basement cafe in Tunis, 5 years after a popular revolution swept through the nation’s sun-bleached avenues and led to the rapid crumbling of Ben Ali’s authoritarian dictatorship. Similar revolutions would sweep through the Arab diaspora, turning Libya, Syria, Yemen and Iraq into failed states and sparking a catastrophic refugee crisis that has since left the world fumbling for a solution. My companion was only a year older than me and yet immeasurably better versed in world politics — he schooled me on the likely impact of Trump’s recent election, in addition to patiently explaining the Maghreb’s fledgling democratic transition. Yet despite being a masters student, his circumstance was typical of many others across the nation, one of stagnating economic prospects despite steadily rising education standards. Habib Bourguiba, Tunisia’s founding father, at one point spent a full third of the government’s budget on its schools and universities. But the economy remained stubbornly mired in corruption, patronage and poor law enforcement — as late as 2009, unemployment for university graduates stood at an estimated 45 percent. And like quintessentially every other revolution in the world, Tunisia’s began with economic discontent. The roots of 26-year old Mohamed Bouazizi’s desperate self immolation in the central town of Sidi Bouzid were all too familiar for most of the nation’s working class. The young street vendor was shaken down for bribes by local policemen — unable to pay, his wares were confiscated and with it went his mother’s and siblings’ sole source of income. When the town’s governor refused to see him later that morning, he returned, despondent and angry, this time bearing a can of petrol with which he would douse himself. That Ben Ali, only the second of two strongmen to lead the nation since independence from France in 1956 (a year before Malaya and Singapore achieved the same from Britain), would flee the country four weeks later was unprecedented in a totalitarian political landscape dominated for decades by the hated secret police. But as with every revolution in history, surging optimism soon gave way to the dullness of practical reality: destroying a broken system is easy, but deciding what will take its place is hard. “Last time, we didn’t have the freedom, you know?” He picked at a plate of white fish grilled with red peppers and lemon. “If you said the wrong thing about the government, on Facebook, whatever, they would put you in jail. Now, we have the freedom, but you can’t eat the freedom, we need jobs, we need the economy… it’s not enough to be free.” Tunisia’s relatively young, ten million strong population (slightly larger than Sweden’s) remained afflicted by a stubbornly high unemployment rate of 15%. Tourism accounted for almost one in ten jobs, and the sector was decimated by a spate of recent terrorist attacks. In March 2015, gunmen attacked the capital’s famous Bardo Museum, killing twenty one people. Two months later, another attacker gunned down tourists on a beach near Sousse — thirty eight people died. Strolling the humming streets of Tunis barely a year after the incidents, I could count the number of foreign faces on one hand. The waiter came to take our plates. Cigarettes gave way to beer, an unexpected reminder of Tunisia’s liberal bent. Yet the dichotomy could not be more stark — for a nation that legalised abortion 8 years before Roe v. Wade made headlines in the United States, its citizens also comprised an estimated 7,000 combatants in ISIL’s forces across Syria and Iraq, the single largest contributor of foreign fighters from across the Middle East and North Africa. It is impossible to say exactly how this came to be. Ben Ali’s methods for securing political supremacy were nothing short of heavy handed — it is estimated that he jailed up to 20,000 members of the Ennahda Party, Tunisia’s political Islamist movement, along with countless others from more radical Salafist movements such as Ansar al-Sharia. With Ben Ali’s fall and the collapse of the state’s oppressive security apparatus came the inevitable rise of extremism, particularly from impoverished inland-desert communities. Nonetheless, it was not hard to see which foreign powers really pulled the reins of influence here. Police touted NATO weapons — I saw Austrian-made Steyr AUGs and Belgian FN FALs — a reminder of Bourguiba’s decades-long push towards Europe and away from the Arabic political sphere. Perhaps that was an unsurprising consequence of geography, given from where we sat in Tunis we were already more north than Malaga in Spain and Modica in Sicily. We chatted a bit more about his dreams of leaving Tunisia for Europe or Canada, and I related my own (less dramatic) exodus from Malaysia many years prior. I stepped out into the cool December air for an evening stroll back to my hotel through the medina’s winding streets, pondering our conversation. The only universal rule of change is that it leads to unintended consequences, and I remain hopeful that Tunisia discovers its balance in these tumultuous times. ++++ I have done many silly things in my travels, but few are as Darwinian as my brilliant plan to spend six days alone in the Sahara with two dudes I found on the internet. With three camels to carry out food, water and tents, we would cover about a hundred kilometres on foot over the cascading dunes of the Grand Erg Oriental towards the desert oasis of Ksar Ghilane. If walking from Bumblefuck A to Bumblefuck B sounds to you like a pointless endeavour, then, well, you’d probably be right. Yet there is something strangely liberating and cathartic about spending almost a week without the faintest glimmer of phone signal or any trace of humanity. No buildings, no roads, no footprints, nothing. Life became stripped back to its bare basics — sleep when it’s dark, wake when it’s light, walk when it’s cool and stop when it’s not. Unlike the frenetic pace of a climbing expedition, trying to jam pack as much activity as possible into a dwindling weather window, juggling injuries and rest days and endless repacking of gear, it was refreshing to simply amble along for hours through the featureless sand dunes. Even the mid-afternoon December sun barely scraped the low-twenties, and on more than one night I awoke to find ice in my water bottle. Breakfast was a curious affair. Each morning, Mustafa would knead fresh dough with flour, water and salt, then mould it by hand into a flat disc about a foot across. He would then plonk it across smouldering ash from a campfire, and bury the whole thing in sand. Ten minutes later, voila — bread. Bread surprisingly free of sand too, which we would eat with jam and dates. Lovely. (For the first couple of days I kept trying to help, but after repeatedly fucking up the process with my incompetence, my companions politely told me to check that the camels were awake). The meditative nothing-ness of the desert certainly gets your mind tinkering. I’d always been piqued, for instance, by the dryness of the Sahara. After all, from my tent I was closer to the ocean than I would be sitting under the Eiffel Tower, and yet a year’s rainfall here would barely reach the top of a mug. Adding to the mystery, as late as 2,500 BC — when early Britons were busy putting together Stonehenge — the Sahara was in fact a lush grassland dotted with lakes and even forests. Theories for this dramatic change abound, but most put it down to variations in the Earth’s orbit over time (a phenomena alarmingly misunderstood by many of today’s mouth-breathers, who put it forward as the primary cause of climate change). This slight cosmic wobble was enough to disrupt the planet’s ocean currents, pushing the primary North African rain belt way into the Mediterranean and creating the world’s largest hyperarid zone outside of the magnetic poles. A fine example of how easy it is to disrupt the careful balance in which our ecosystem exists. We lay back on some rugs after dinner one day, full from our usual meal of cous cous and tomato stew, gazing at the endlessly brilliant stars stretching uninterrupted from horizon to horizon. I traced the bright arm of Ursa Major over to Polaris stoically marking the Earth’s celestial north. Like the earlier conversation in Tunis, my desert companions talked a lot about how tourism had all but dried up in recent years, putting pressure on many locals to take up other jobs in industry and agriculture. “Sometimes,” he mused, without taking his eyes off the sky, “when I have problems, I come out here into the desert on my motorbike… listen to some Eminem, Drake… look at the stars and then I remember in the end we are all gone from the Earth, so why worry about small things?” ++++ “Have some wine,” he said, pouring me a glass to the brim before I could profess any kind of reaction. After six days without seeing running water, I was still getting used to the very concept of turning a tap. It was new year’s eve and I had been couriered by jeep to the island of Djerba, marking the end of my sandy escapade. Deciding that my foreign-ness was rather too offensive for the locals, a helpful waiter decided to inflict my company on an unfortunate Libyan family and I found myself having dinner at their table. And what a delightful evening it was (for me, at least). A Libyan man, his Canadian-Italian wife and their three teenage-to-young-adult children, all of whom had grown up in Tripoli and left for Canada during the chaos of Libya’s violent civil war in 2011, only to return several years later to resume his United Nations post. “It’s my home, you know. Someone has to rebuild the country”. I was lucky enough to speak with his children about their pursuit of a normal teenage life amidst the gunfire and disarray, and was blown away by their collective calmness and eloquence. And this from a fifteen year old who caught a stray bullet in his shoulder barely a month after their return from Canada. Their story, one of bravery, adventure and hope surely deserves an article of its own to even remotely do it justice. Chance meetings like these remind me of why I still harbour a child-like wonder and fascination with travel — for after seeing what you have seen, going where you have been, and meeting who you have met, it is impossible to not come back a different and better person."
Medium.com,Life,Lilac-Crowned Parrots of San Pancho,Travel,https://medium.com/nomudnolotus-writer/lilac-crowned-parrots-of-san-pancho-67965cba3f9e?source=topic_page---------207------------------1," The Lilac-Crowned Parrots of San Pancho In 2005, Sam and I flew to Mexico. From Puerto Vallarta, we drove north away from the fleshpots to the sweetly decaying Pacific village, San Blas. I wanted to take a backward glance at this old haunt of mine, where I had hung out with flirty Mexican youths in the 1970s. Along with waves of aimless gringas, I parked my bikini-clad body under palm fronds at the nearby Matanchen Bay, scoping out two-legged creatures — bronzed surfers, domestic and foreign. With typical youthful abandon, we threw back cervezas and Presidente brandy. We roasted freshly caught shark on a beach grill and ate it with our fingers. We watched ingenious Mexicans machete coconut gourds for the milk and meat, then burn the green husks to stave off sand flies. By 1980, most of us had spread our wings for the flyway of life. Driving into town, Sam and I noticed that the 2002 Hurricane Kenna had done a lot of damage, but good old San Blas was ever in a persistent regenerative state. That included the Flamingos on Calle Juarez, my former cheapo weathered lodging. Now called Hacienda Flamingos, it wore its hundred years well, having morphed into an upscale gem with gorgeous décor, marble bathrooms, and an arcaded courtyard. I was content to laze around the aquamarine pool, taking in the wild riot of color that typifies Mexico, here a yellow and lavender stone bench, there a terra cotta wall hung with golden trumpet vine and magenta bougainvillea. But Sam, a de facto naturalist never content to leave a stone unturned or feather un-keyed, found a birding booklet in the hotel lobby with a list of local guides. He called one Armando Santiago Navarette who must have flown over because he arrived in five minutes outlining the next day’s outing. “Bring lunch, bug repellent, and water. See you at 6 a.m. sharp.” At morning’s darkest hour, he arrived cocking his ear, naming the playful hooting sound we barely noticed — a pygmy owl. We drove to the cloud forest above nearby La Palma and as dawn broke, the first bird we saw was the fashion-conscious russet-crowned motmot. It styles a notch in its long tail by pecking away a circle of feathers inches deep in the tail. It made me think of the mullet hairdo on hipsters who clear-cut their hair in a circle around their skulls. Our guide was quick on the draw. Where Sam and I saw only the thick canopy of the forest’s coffee bushes, gumbo limbo, and soft-shell fig trees, he pointed out a rufous-bellied chachalaca, a citreoline trogon, a red-headed tanager, and a golden-cheeked woodpecker. Upon each sighting, he aimed and focused his spotting scope, and as we looked through the lens he flipped open a guide to colorful drawings of the birds, all in a few seconds. “I have never met such cooperative fowl,” I joked with Armando after we had logged species numbers 27 and 28 — a black-throated magpie jay and Sinaloa crow. Armando’s tranquil fishing village sits along a major flyway with those two birds, along with the purplish-backed jay, rusty-crowned ground-sparrow, red warbler, and some 20 species found only in West Mexico. We kept waiting for a lull between sightings. But nothing eluded Armando. His eyes peeled, his ears poised, he would say, “Here that? A happy wren. It’s very speckled. Watch this vine — it’ll tie you up like a rope. . . thrrrr, thrrrr . . . that’s the call of a jay. Ah, here’s a royal lemon tree. Taste the best citrus — no acid.” We squeezed the proffered fruit into our water bottles for a pleasant agua frescaas he pointed to an elongated maroon flower that droops finger-size banana-lings. “The Japanese import them and make banana flower soup,” he said as we plopped on rocks to eat, watching the papery papilloteflit around. Another fritillary, the color of papaya landed on that very fruit, which we were sharing, then flew off. “He found his papaya — now he is looking for his mamaya,” Armando laughed. Sam and I loved Armando’s exuberance even more than the 57 species we ultimately saw. The next day we met at La Tovara (a Nuahat word meaning “where water is”), for an excursion on the Rio San Cristobal in a panga,a motorized boat, through jungle-smothered estuary. As we plied the brown waters past mangrove, dragonflies swarmed the air, red bromeliads burst into view. We heard the tick tickof a Louisiana water thrush. A Mexican treefrog went burp, burp. Within minutes, we spotted these memorable boat-billed herons (they reminded me of Heckle and Jeckle cartoons); ahninga (a waterfowl that hangs its wings out to dry like cormorants); belted kingfish, calandria (a stunning black and yellow bird that builds hanging nests like over-sized beehives); and several other herons — yellow-crowned night, green, black-crowned night. Oh my. At one turn in the lazy river, Armando was uncharacteristically quiet as he keyed a bird, then handed me the binoculars. “You are lucky — it’s a rare Colima warbler.” I didn’t tell him I was not impressed — it was small and brownish. Driving back to town I wasimpressed when we spotted the pink roseate spoonbills offshore on their breeding ground. “They are related to the ibis, said Armando.” Their pink sherbet feathers presented one of the most thrilling sights. Sam and I were headed to San Pancho (or San Francisco) on our way back to Puerto Vallarta. Armando, realizing I was a soft touch for colorful birds, said, “You must see the lilac-crowned parrots. Just turn left as you go out of town, go under the bridge. Take the trail about 300 yards. You’ll see a flock of them. You can’t miss them. It’s easy.” Easyfor Armando. We were eager, they sounded gorgeous. We did as instructed. We saw a calandria and its tenement-size nest. But no parrots. I would dream of spotting those lilac feathers. And, on several occasions, don’t ask me to interpret this, I dreamed of Sam as a beautiful bird with thick silvery feathers and a beak, alternately as a hawk freefalling with me. It took ten years but I returned alone, no Sam, to find those parrots. Right after our trip, our long relationship went into a sudden steep and swift decline. Within months it went south permanently. It is not worth noting so much why, as noting that among the treasured memories, our last perfect travel together was for the birds. This time I stayed in Sayulita right next to San Pancho in a periwinkle-blue stone cottage. My spacious nest of a suite seemed to float among jungle landscape — banana plants with leaves big enough to nap on and pappalillotrees, red and peeling like sunburned gringos."

Medium.com,Life,Exploring the Historic Spot Where Hitchcock Fans Can Learn About Plate Tectonics,Travel,https://medium.com/@mgrass_3399/exploring-the-historic-spot-where-hitchcock-fans-can-learn-about-plate-tectonics-fb1f16f62f7a?source=topic_page---------211------------------1," When many travelers head south out of the Bay Area on Highway 101 beyond the point where the seemingly endless sprawl of San Jose, Morgan Hill and Gilroy becomes more rural, they’re usually going to some scenic destination on the Central Coast, maybe Monterey, Big Sur, or San Simeon. Maybe they’re interested in John Steinbeck and are bound for the Salinas Valley. Maybe they’re going to a winery. Or maybe they’re going all the way to Los Angeles, seeking a scenic alternative that has more places to stop off along the way, compared to the usually faster route via Interstate 5 through the Central Valley. But if you’re ever in this vicinity and want to explore some of California’s lesser-traveled routes between the Bay Area and L.A, I’d recommend leaving Highway 101 at Exit 345 for State Route 156 and head east. This is the way to a small, sleepy historic mission town. San Juan Bautista usually doesn’t rise to the top of must-sees for visitors exploring this part of California but among the tourists who specifically make the diversion are two specific subgroups: Alfred Hitchcock movie nuts and earthquake geeks. And in San Juan Bautista, they’re drawn to the same place — the plaza and historic mission, originally founded in 1797 by the Basque missionary Fermín Francisco de Lasuén. Those who have seen Hitchcock’s 1958 film Vertigo should be familiar with San Juan Bautista’s old mission. Some very important scenes from the classic film happen in the Franciscan mission’s bell tower, which you won’t actually see if you visit because it doesn’t physically exist. The bell tower in the film was superimposed. There once was a tower at the mission that had been built in the 1860s. But due its deteriorated condition and the fact that it wasn’t original to the mission, the tower was removed during restoration work that started in 1949, funded by the Hearst Foundation. The mission’s three-bell campanario was built in 1976. Careful observers will notice other differences between the mission seen in Vertigo and the actual mission. One local resident, Sandy Lydon, recalled his memories of the 1958 film shoot in San Juan Bautista in a 2007 interview with the Hollister Free Lance: “The mission was constructed with a colonnade across the front — and two of the arches in the row are actually larger than the rest and are square, to allow mounted processions to exit and enter the mission courtyard,” Lydon said. “Apparently Hitchcock found those squared openings detracted from the entire scene, so he had them filled in by carpenters and coated with stucco so as to look like the others. The construction was removed after the filming was completed and they are now square, as they always had been.” Hitchcock’s cinematic magic in Vertigo is a good reminder that when you visit one of California’s 21 historic missions, you’re most likely not seeing the structures as they were originally built. Over the years, many have sustained major earthquake damage. A series of quakes that hit Southern California in 1812 damaged or destroyed many of the region’s missions, including San Juan Capistrano (where the ruins are preserved), San Gabriel, and Santa Barbara. The towers of the rebuilt mission in Santa Barbara saw significant damage from a big quake in 1925. And more recently, in 2003, a magnitude 6.5 quake that struck San Luis Obispo County severely damaged the historic mission in San Miguel. But San Juan Bautista sits in a particularly hazardous spot. The San Andreas Fault, California’s most prominent seismological feature, abuts the mission complex. The Great San Francisco Earthquake of 1906, which originated on the San Andreas, did considerable damage to the mission. Exploring town, it’s not hard to identify where the fault is. At the back side of the plaza, there’s a staircase that travels down the steep fault scarp to a rough dirt path that runs behind the mission and its cemetery. This is El Camino Real, the old “Royal Road,” the route that once connected California’s mission settlements when Spain, and then Mexico, controlled what would eventually become the Golden State. And in this spot, it happens to sit on top of the boundary between the Pacific and North American tectonic plates, giving you an opportunity to simultaneously walk on the infamous fault and an original section of El Camino Real. (The modern-day commemorative route, which has its own curious history, mostly follows Highway 101.) If you look at a topographical map of San Juan Bautista, or use terrain view on Google Maps, you can get a better sense for where the fault cuts across the landscape from the northwest to the southeast. The town, which sits on higher ground on the Pacific Plate, overlooks the adjacent agricultural fields on the North American Plate. For earthquake geeks following the route of the San Andreas Fault, San Juan Bautista is an important location for other seismological reasons. This is where it is believed that the 1906 earthquake, which started on the San Andreas Fault well to the north of San Francisco, likely ran out of energy as it ruptured south. That was the last time the San Andreas ruptured in any significant way in Northern California — nearly 300 miles of fault displacement. The magnitude 6.8 Loma Prieta earthquake, which seriously shook the Bay Area 30 years ago this month, was far smaller. According to the U.S. Geological Survey, the 1989 quake ruptured only about 25 miles of the San Andreas near the epicenter, in the mountains between Santa Cruz and San Jose. The last time the San Andreas ruptured in a big way in Southern California was in 1857. That was the Fort Tejon earthquake, which ripped about 225 miles of the fault from Parkfield, a small town about 100 miles southeast of San Juan Bautista, to Wrightwood, near Cajon Pass east of Los Angeles. Seismologists estimate that the 1857 quake had a 7.8 magnitude, similar in size to the 1906 quake in Northern California. The 90-mile long section of the San Andreas Fault Zone between San Juan Bautista and Parkfield, which hasn’t seen a similar type of massive rupture in recorded history, has been something of a curiosity to seismologists. As Rong-Gong Lin II of the Los Angeles Times wrote this week, this section of the San Andreas is “creeping,” meaning that it expends its seismic energy in more frequent but far smaller quakes. One of those smaller quakes, a magnitude 4.7 event south of Hollister, happened on Tuesday. “This is the 10th earthquake larger than magnitude 4 in the last 20 years in this area,” USGS geologist Keith Knudsen told the L.A. Times, describing the quake as a “garden variety San Andreas event” in this particular area. In an article on Tuesday’s quake for Temblor, USGS research geophysicist Ross S. Stein and Temblor co-founder Volkan Sevilgen, dig in a little more about the San Juan Bautista-Parkfield section of the San Andreas. To the south of this location, there is evidence from precariously balanced rocks (rocks that would fall over if strongly shaken) that no large earthquake has struck for the past 10,000 years. In other words, from here for 100 mi to Parkfield lies the safest piece of San Andreas real estate one can find. Even if you aren’t a seismology geek, traveling though this extremely rural and less-traveled part of California is rewarding for its rolling topography, including State Route 25 south of Paicines. And if you want to merge even a marginal interest in the San Andreas Fault and wine, the Cienega Valley AVA, home to some of California’s oldest continually producing vineyards, dating to 1849, is tucked away in a valley created by the San Andreas Fault Zone where it starts to cut across the northern flank of the Gabilan Range. When I explored this topographically fascinating region in March, an especially rainy winter had turned the rolling hills and ridges a brilliant shade of green. I continued south from here to Pinnacles National Park, and followed the San Andreas farther to the Carrizo Plain National Monument, and, eventually, all the way to the Salton Sea where it ends near Bombay Bay. It’s a long, multi-day trek, so going all that way is probably not the kind of casual wanderlust most travelers along Highway 101 would welcome. But even a short diversion off Highway 101 into San Juan Bautista is an easy way to better understand the geophysical forces that continue to shape California’s stunning topography and the cinematic magic Hitchcock used on the silver screen."

Many people assume but they don’t see beneath the surface of what it’s really like to be one. Whenever I post a picture of my travels, I get envious reactions: “Wow! You’re traveling to a different country already?”
“I can’t believe how cheap that dish is.”
“How are you able to afford such a nice place?” All of which usually ends with something along the lines of: “You’re lucky. You’re making bank. I wish I had that kind of lifestyle.” But in truth, the reality is different from people think. As with all things, there’s always another side, a side nobody else sees. “No matter how obvious something may seem, there are two sides to every story.” ~Erin Bowman The photos I post on Instagram and Facebook are merely a glimpse into what my life is like and are often the most memorable moments of my day, because let’s admit it, who wants to see continuous photos of me writing non-stop every single day? Or dirty, cockroach infested Airbnbs that I’ve stayed at like this one? The photos I post are reminders to myself that despite obstacles, despite setbacks, despite not having reached even a tenth of what I want to accomplish, the life I’m living right now follows my passion. It’s a life of my own choosing, at my own terms. The last thing I’d want to do is remind myself, through pictures, of the bad times I’ve had. Being a digital nomad is heavily romanticized by the industry — we’re portrayed as young, successful millennials who live a carefree life wandering from country to country without a schedule or commitment, lounging by a beach or pool with a Mai Tai in hand. That couldn’t be farther than the truth. Most of us can’t afford to live that kind of budget lifestyle; we lack the stable income to do so. The food we eat, the flights we fly, the places we live at are often heavily budgeted in advance, without any backup plans. Most of the day we spend working and what we earn is usually volatile. Some months I’ve made no more than $426 while other months I’ve made over $1,500 — neither of which is enough to live off of back home in San Francisco Bay Area where rent prices are at least double, if not triple that of my earnings. I often find myself overworking, stressing out more than I should be, because of money. The only reason I can keep up with, tolerate, the digital nomad lifestyle is because my passion lies in the exploration of different countries. I live to travel. It’s what keeps me going, keeps me motivated in pursuing my passions in writing, traveling and making videos despite the more apparent than real difficulties that comes with being a full-time traveler/digital nomad. It’s difficult to see how much goes on beneath the surface of someone’s life. It’s not always rainbows and butterflies. It’s not always exotic foods, tropical jungles, hidden caves and breathtaking waterfalls. Most of what we do is just like the average Jane, except instead of working in an office, we’re perpetually working out of coffee shops. There are always tradeoffs to every lifestyle, pros and cons. That’s how it is. The other side of the pasture is always greener. The only thing we can do is aim to focus on doing the things we’re passionate about, rather than to aim for the kind of lifestyle we’d like to have. Doing things we’re passionate about adds substance to our lives; it makes us happy, but doing things for the sake of maintaining a lifestyle? It’ll give us nothing other than to provide a temporary high. Choose your passion and your lifestyle will follow. Or choose your lifestyle, and your passions will suffer. You make the choice."

We’re Just Not Sure It’s Legal",Travel,https://medium.com/@andrewfraieli/europe-on-8-a-day-yes-its-possible-we-re-just-not-sure-it-s-legal-3ec35d2a2c7c?source=topic_page---------213------------------1," How one man spent 65 days in Europe for less than the cost of a Starbucks run Article originally published on Debt.com, Nov. 2017 E
ver heard of the book Europe on 5 Dollars a Day? It was written in 1957 by Arthur Frommer, and it’s become one of the best-known travel books ever written. Obviously, it’s outdated — $5 in 1957 is $44.71 today. Who can do anything in Europe, the art and food capital of the world, on only $45 a day? I did. On $8 a day, for 65 days. I hitchhiked more than 2500 miles, went dumpster-diving for dinner in Copenhagen, slept under a park bush in Budapest, squatted in an abandoned bicycle factory in Ljubljana. (That’s in Slovenia.) And somehow through all that, I gained 15 pounds. I’m not saying you have to do everything the way I did, but I’ll share my best advice. If you’re looking to do the cheapest, most adventurous backpacking trip though Europe since 1957, read on… F
irst things first: If you really want to travel far and wide, you need some wheels. Those usually don’t come cheap, but there are two options I used. One’s a little more ethical than the other, so let’s start there. Hitchhiking has led me to sprawling villages in the mountains of Switzerland and sweet Italian villas deep in the countryside. But it has also caused me to lose feeling in my fingers from freezing rain, and sit at the side of the highway for 16 hours. And to spend five hours in 90 degree heat getting flipped off by Italian drivers. I also met drunk German bicyclists who were biking across Switzerland and I ended up in six more countries than I anticipated. Thumbing is free, but it’s an art. And as an artist, you suffer for your work. The art comes from getting people to pick you up: You have to look them in the eye as they drive by, have a sign, look like a hitchhiker. I also dance a little as I stand there, you need to look kinda interesting of a person. Also: Smile. No one wants to pick up a grouch. Not surprisingly, the people who pick you up will also be some of the most interesting you meet. Most will be hitchhikers and travelers with impressive stories of their own, but the ones I enjoyed the most were the people who’d never picked one up before. They were always a little nervous, didn’t talk much. You’re a curiosity, a risk. By the end of the ride, though, they thanked me. You change attitudes by being a joyful person when they expect you might be an axe murderer. If that sounds either too boring or too dangerous, here’s option №2: illegally cheating public transportation. In my experience, you didn’t pay to get on, but you were expected to be carrying a ticket. So every time I got on a bus, train, tram, anything, I’d analyze every person on the train. Most systems have a conductor disguised as a civilian. He waits for the doors to close, then whips out a badge and demands to see tickets. Every time new people came aboard I had to be on alert again, ready to run or have an excuse if a conductor caught me. In two months and 14 countries of cheating rides, I only ever got caught once, in Budapest. I had five conductors in a semi-circle blocking me and a friend from leaving. But I lucked out, only getting a fine of $50. That’s still a lot for someone with a budget of $8/day, but seeing as these were not conductors to take bullshit, verbal or physical, I had no choice but to pay. This is an even more extreme art than hitchhiking, and in my opinion it’s a bigger risk. Obviously, it’s illegal, and most cities had a fee of about $200 if caught without a ticket. The most common advice I got was to just run. Normally they are not allowed to physically stop you, unless they are cops. Running is a more common practice then you might think. F
or 62 of the 65 days I traveled, I slept only on strangers’ couches, spare mattresses and beds. For the other three days, I slept under a bush in a park once, and spent two nights in two hostels when I had extra money. About half the time I used CouchSurfing.com. If you’ve never heard of it, the site pairs strangers with a couch to sleep on to strangers who are travelling. How do you know who to trust? Reviews, just like of hotels. There are essentially reviews of the person on their profile from people who stayed with them before. I’d message someone asking if I could stay, they’d say yes and give me an address, and in the evening I’d find their place, introduce myself and stay the night. When I was lucky they’d show me around town the next day, other times I’d leave to move to the next city. Most of these people I’m still in contact with, as they are almost all amazing people. When I couldn’t find a place couchsurfing, I’d just talk to random people on the street. I stayed with a guy who gave me a lift in Croatia. A street musician in Vienna got me a place with one of his friends in the city — I stayed with them a week. And a homeless teen in Slovenia brought me to a hippie squat where I stayed with some college kids on a spare mattress. I would have slept outside a whole lot more often if I didn’t find so many strangers willing to give me a place to sleep. T
his became, in retrospect, one of the most worrisome parts of my travels. I became malnourished about 40 days into my trip. My diet consisted of fruit and vegetables, bread, and sometimes nuts. Not because I’m a picky eater, but because I had no way of storing or cooking anything more. About two thirds through my trip I felt constantly tired, slept 12 hours and still felt sleepy and weak after. At one point, I almost fainted with my thumb stuck out for a ride. I kept a box of pasta in my pack to cook at hosts’ houses, but most of the time they’d make me a meal or two. It so happened that this stretch of my trip consisted of little more food than my own. After having four slider burgers forced upon me by a friend, I suddenly felt like I woke up, and noticed how bad my food intake had become. It didn’t happen again. I learned how to dumpster dive to prevent it. It’s an almost unlimited free food source to be found everywhere, but also a bit of a grey area in the law, too. It can be considered trespassing, so I decided it would be better to go late at night. I was hesitant at first of course — because of the sanitation of the dumpster food, not the law. But two college kids I stayed with showed me the ropes: What packages to look for, fruits to save, everything I needed to know. In the end we made a fine dinner. You could say I had so little money I was digging through the trash, or, you could view it as making use of the grandiose waste of modern people and grocery stores. H
itchhiking across Europe is not for the faint of heart or the hopelessly introverted. The single largest savior of my trip was being social. I was fed, transported, given money, entertained, shown secrets of cities, brought to towns far away, and introduced to people I’d never think to find and enjoy, all by talking to strangers. I literally would have slept outside in the street, in the cold, and never gotten out of my first city if it wasn’t for the kindness of strangers. Many gave me food or led me to places to sleep. I could have ignored the homeless teen yelling to me, but instead, I found a community and home for a week. I could have not talked to the couple on the ferry to Denmark with me, but then I would have slept outside in the cold instead of getting a lift all the way to Copenhagen. People are amazing. There are kind people everywhere — and unfortunately, there are jerks everywhere too. There were many times where I had people try to take advantage of my apparent kindness as a traveler by incessantly asking for money. Fortunately, I was more broke than most of them. My budget of €8 a day wasn’t much more than two meals. All these kind people, though, made this little money enough. In the end I met the real people from where I went. I didn’t meet tourists, I met the people who live there, who know the little places and the culture and language. I lived in these places when I went, which you don’t get to do on a big budget whirlwind tour. Many don’t like the idea of relying on strangers, but people loved what I was doing and helped, and I loved every moment. It made me break down crying near the end. It made my stomach shrink, it made my heart break as I left home after home, but at least I wasn’t a tourist. Also, those 15 pounds I gained? It was all muscle from carrying a 50-pound backpack around."

Medium.com,Life,Le Regard — the secret to flirting in French,Travel,https://medium.com/the-reluctant-parisienne/lets-talk-about-le-regard-2abe43ce1100?source=topic_page---------215------------------1," You can’t go to Paris without getting le regard. No, it’s not a disease. It’s the look. Le regard knows no boundaries. You can get it on the metro or you can get it in Montparnasse Cemetery or you can get it in the Franprix when you are trying to figure out if that bottle you’re holding is dishwashing liquid or toilet bowl cleaner. You can get it from a man with a briefcase on Faubourg St. Honore, and you can get it from a lady with a pet dog in Parc Monceau, and you can get it from the gendarme who is carrying a freaking machine gun — which, as much as you absolutely detest guns, makes you feel kind ofspecial, like if something goes down right this minute this dude has your back (although come to think of it maybe you are misreading the situation with the gendarme and you actually look like a menace to society and in this case is is not le regard but something else entirely). You can get it when you look like something the cat dragged in just as surely as you can get it when you’ve really taken the time to put yourself together, which, okay, is not all that often, because: whatever. You can get it from a gentleman in his actual nineties who is using an actual cane, in the actual orthopedist’s office. Over time, the days when you don’t get it at all will feel — not meaningless, exactly (we’re all feminists here) — but lesser. Le regard is when a stranger looks at you like he’s going to eat you for breakfast, lunch, and dinner, and you’re going to enjoy it or else. It’s an unsettling amalgamation of intellectual aggression, that thing Eartha Kitt used to do in the Catwoman costume, and pure desire. The first few times you get le regard, you’ll think you’re about to get mugged, but eventually you’ll learn to give le regard as well as you get it. Actually, it reminds me of how I used to look at a boy named Hunter at Mobile Christian School in Mobile, Alabama, in the eighties. I was 13 and (mostly) clueless. Only after I moved to Paris did I realize I’d been giving Hunter le regard during Bible class. (He looked like it totally creeped him out; le regard definitely has some stalker in it.) What’s the first rule of le regard? Don’t smile. Someone can look at you like you’re a marshmallow on a stick with a side of camembert, but the moment you smile back it’s like you’ve broken the taboo and are unfit for polite society. Parisian women over 40 are very good at le regard, and Parisian women over 50 are experts. When you walk down the street with your square-jawed American husband, be prepared for women to undress him with their eyes and do knowing things with their mouths, as if they are going to teach him a lesson right there in front of God and the Republic. It’s weird but you get used to it. Just try to watch and learn. Be careful whom you regard, and when. During regular working hours, le regard is harmless, because Parisians are serious about their office jobs, but once the lights go down in the city (like that Journey song!) everyone starts regarding left and right. If the workaday le regard is Daniel Craig with a touch of Olivia Wilde, the after-hours le regard is about 7% Mark Ruffalo, 34% Vin Diesel/Charlize Theron on a bad day, and 59% Love Boat, so, you know, proceed with whatever degree of caution you see fit. Le regard is as Parisian as baguettes and Haussmann kitchens. If you still don’t know what it is, google Isabelle Huppert, who could give le regard to a lamppost and make the lamppost nervous. What’s the second rule of le regard? Don’t talk about le regard. Just do it."

Medium.com,Life,Steaming away sadness in Helsinki — Part I,Travel,https://medium.com/humane-traffic/steaming-away-sadness-in-helsinki-part-i-53d385024770?source=topic_page---------217------------------1," In 2019, I found myself in Helsinki twice. It was a quirk of coincidence as I had never considered visiting under my own steam at all, let alone two times in eight months. Nordic countries seemed somehow too adult for me and too expensive to boot. I had filed Helsinki in the same mental bracket as I had Copenhagen and Stockholm: city break destinations for middle-class millennial couples, the type who had matching Daunt Books tote bags, only one overdraft between them, and really did appreciate minimalist furniture. Yet in mid-January, I made my first trip, reporting for a magazine on why Finland had been deemed the happiest country on earth. It was bittersweet; I was almost comically sad at the time. With me I had a tote bag but also £8k of debt, no appreciation of minimalist furniture and, crucially, no boyfriend as we had broken up less than three weeks earlier. Ironically, the final straw had been Helsinki itself. For the first time I’d been offered the opportunity to take a plus-one on the trip, all expenses paid bar the flight. However, when I rang my then-boyfriend to invite him, he sighed heavily before declining. He couldn’t afford the ticket, he said. I offered to cover the cost of a £66 return for him. The answer, he told me, was still no. I knew him though, knew from his awkward pauses that this wasn’t about the money at all and instead was about the fact that a steadily yawning vacuum had been inexorably opening between us and when we were together, I missed him more than when were apart. When we actually called it quits the very next day, I didn’t mention the Helsinki trip once but it loomed heavily in my mind as he laid out his plans for Christmas and New Year. They did not include me. “I don’t feel like I’m a priority in your life,” I said, drunk, clutching my sleeves. “You’re not,” he answered. And that was that. So I went to Helsinki with my mother instead and discovered I’d been wrong about everything, which happens frequently but never comes as any less of a shock. For a start, Helsinki isn’t expensive. It’s not cheap-cheap but unlike other Nordic countries, its central currency is Euros and a single snack won’t set you back £22 (cough, Reykjavik). It’s also exceedingly charming, a small harbour city perched on a peninsula with wide, spotless streets and eclectic architecture that speaks to historic stints as an annex of Russia and Sweden. Most everywhere is within 20 minutes walk and a weekend really is enough to get the general measure of the city. The big draws are the cultural hubs, like the brand new central library Oodi, a striking slice of modern construction that looks like a giant glacier resting in the middle of the city. Or the Amos Rex, Finland’s largest private art museum whose relatively small size belies its international reputation. The Rex houses its modern treasures in subterranean galleries but was closed when I first visited the city so my personal venture into its burrows would have to wait. But basically; Helsinki had a glut of spaces to personally whet my palate, sophisticated understanding of design or not. However, in January, most of these structures were buried under a picturesque — but utterly freezing — blanket of snow. So, after disembarking from the airport bus, my mother and I did as the Finns would and made straight for Löyly, Helsinki’s most famous (for tourists at least) late night sauna. A 15 minute bus ride from the town centre, Löyly — which translates roughly as the cloud of steam that arises when water is thrown on hot stones in a sauna — hunkers on the harbour edge, giving those steaming their hams the option to have an interim dip in a freezing sea pool, which is supposed to enhance the experience. I did not do this. I’d only been to a sauna once before and having access to three at a time for the price of €10 felt more than enough of an experience without submerging in icy water too. Instead I sat back and let the steam cleanse my pores and the ache that squatted in my chest when I thought about my ex-boyfriend who was not sitting beside me. He had really enjoyed saunas, more than anyone I had met before, mentioning their benefits perhaps too regularly in conversation. At the time, I had not understood why marinating in a hot wooden box was so appealing. Emerging from Löyly’s bunkers, feeling far more at peace than when I had entered, it became clear. The rest of the weekend was spent pottering. Thanks to the magazine, we were staying in a beautiful accommodation that I would never be able to afford on my own dime. The Hotel St George, was about seven minutes from Helsinki’s central square and the promenade which led to the seafront, a fairytale stroll when covered with glittering snow. If anything was beyond walking distance or we became too tired to trek, regular trams and buses were on hand to trundle us back to our base. Food was fine, nothing memorable. There was the requisite reindeer, lots of fish, one highly-rated soup that we discovered being dished out by Soppakeittiö, a kitchen squirrelled away in the market hall by the harbour. Instead, it was Helsinki’s atmosphere that stayed with me. The pace was languid and soothing; breakfast was served until late, saunas were open well into the night.
It wasn’t the frenetic 24/7 culture of London however; it was time, the gift of taking things slowly and deliberately without having to rush a decision. I felt extraordinarily grateful to the city for handling me with kid gloves, bruised and sad as I was. In Helsinki, I didn’t have to wallow in my romantic turmoil; rather, I could lose myself for three hours wandering around Ateneum Art Museum, diving into an exhibition dedicated to showcasing the art of Finnish women at the turn of the century. Another day I led my mother to the Uspenski Cathedral, the largest Russian orthodox church in Western Europe. With towers topped by turrets coated in a pale green patina and the bulk of the building the colour of gingerbread, Uspenski stands out against the Helsinki skyline. As a cathedral connoisseur, despite being neither belonging to a religion or believing in any deity, Uspenski was a must. However, when we arrived, after a trudge up treacherously icy slopes, it was closed. Sunday. But for once, it didn’t matter. The walk, in refreshingly bracing sea air, late afternoon sun reflecting brightly on the powdered snow, was enough. On the final day, we spent the morning in the Allas Sea Pool, located right on the harbour next to a curiously placed Big Wheel. There was a woman-only sauna there. Sat inside, I tentatively peeled off my top, then my bottoms, until I was naked. I realised how free it felt, how I could finally let out the breath I hadn’t even been aware I was holding in. For the last four months I’d been vibrating at the highest frequency of stress, trying to be perfect, to be the most engaging, pretty and witty and bright version of myself just so I wouldn’t lose a man who had bailed out anyway. I had ignored how ill this was making me, how thin I had become and the frantic barrages of texts my friends had received during this time, oscillating between ecstatic highs at how good it felt it be young and infatuated vs defeated, nihilistic screeds on broken men and the women who fix them. In Helsinki, I took a step back and breathed out. For the first time since August 2018, I felt calm. I took this feeling back to the UK, along with two new tote bags. It was only fitting. The next time I went to Helsinki though, it was the height of summer. And there was a man with me. Part II of the Helsinki series is coming soon…"
Medium.com,Life,Letting go in Greece,Travel,https://medium.com/humane-traffic/letting-go-in-greece-d259a4846741?source=topic_page---------218------------------1," I went to Athens because I had been talking about it for so long, I feared it was going to soon join my pantheon of impossible dreams, former burning desires downgraded in status as they get superseded by something more immediately achievable. Athens, I thought, was a concept that deserved more than only being wheeled out to impress a wired stranger at 3am in someone else’s kitchen. Unlike my book on Jeffrey Dahmer or idea for an app that maps local off licences, Athens was within reach with a bit of disposable income and a ‘I’ll sort it as it comes’ attitude. For a brief period in May, I was in possession of both. So I booked a Ryanair flight, sourced an Airbnb and was on my way. Prior to arriving, I’d done almost no recon on the city. Beyond a required traipse around ‘the old bits’, I hadn’t set any firm itinerary either. This lackadaisical approach could have gone horribly wrong but it didn’t, mostly thanks to the fact that using your mobile data while abroad doesn’t cost anything extra anymore. I could plan on the fly, soar by the seat of my pants as the mood took me. I was in Athens, I realised, to potter about, to do fuck all, to float around a city without any particular destination in mind. It was the antidote to a solid half-a-year of work, during which all I’d done was to barrel furiously towards a set goal that I didn’t even want. This trip would be one of leisurely discovery, a gentle rejoinder to the pressure of purpose. Thankfully, Athens lends itself to this sort of approach; it almost begs to be explored by foot. Its three-million inhabitants are spread across 30+ districts in total but visitors to the city are likely to spend the majority of their time pootling around the seven neighbourhoods that make up central Athens. My base — a sunlit, fourth-floor apartment, complete with balcony — was located on the border of Exarchia, perhaps the district with the most instant international name recognition. Shorthand labels it the ‘anarchist area’. It’s famed as the home of left-wing radical politics and resistance in Athens and the graffiti that plasters the weathered buildings lining its streets is testimony to this. Pro-communist, pro-socialist and anti-Airbnb sentiment abounds. Beware left-wing travellers; winding my way up Exarchia’s hills every morning quickly reminded me of my hypocrisies. Evenings are when Exarchia comes to life. A small square in the centre of the district is the designated gathering point for those living in the blocks that surround it. Tourists stick out like sore thumbs but hostile glances don’t translate to anything more — it’s in the Omonia section of the city where you need to watch your back(pack). The rule of navigating Exarchia is the same as anywhere else: respect the residents and don’t be a dick. Also, wear shoes with grip, it’s extremely hilly. A scattering of bars and restaurants litter the streets around Exarchia’s main square, including Rozalia, a taverna where I ate a cheap but cheerful meal of lamb and herby potatoes, learning that if you want vegetables in Athens, you must order them on the side. Around the corner was also Salerno, a wine bar where I had my most memorable bite to eat; a beautifully seasoned sea bass, that drew me into a war of attrition with a street cat determined to sample it too. I won but it came at the price of a scratched calf. For those looking for the livelier nightlife spots however, Psyri and Gazi, just off Omonia (take a cab or public transport if it’s after dark) are where the major glut of trendy bars and clubs sit. One evening I got roundly pissed in one of them with my cousin, who’d arrived on a surprise vacation, before ending my night drunkenly eating mince pastries and ice cream from one of the takeaway shops bookending Psyri. Gourmet darling… you simply cannot say no! For day activities though, I went further afield. Ticking off the Acropolis on day one meant trekking through Monastiraki, stuffed with flea markets and bric-a-brac stores, and Plaka, the most tourist-heavy area thanks to its location at the bottom of the slopes that the ancient citadel perches on. The trend for ‘authentic experiences’ mean it’s profoundly uncool to admit you’ve been suckered in by exactly what you’re supposed to. But I adored Plaka: the narrow lanes, the sun-bleached houses, the soundtrack of buskers, plucking out traditional Greek songs in the hopes of prising a few-euros from tight-fisted tourists. It was a deeply charming place; turning a corner early on during my walk to the Acropolis revealed a 10th Century Byzantine Greek Orthodox Church aka a religious building that was both ancient and extra, two of my personal culture kinks. Plaka’s streets also housed Da Vinci Gelato, a gelato parlour producing Instagram-friendly desserts so decadently delicious, I went back on my last day for another. The gelato was almost more memorable than the Acropolis. Which, despite my friend James’ assertion that it was open to the public at no charge, cost 18 euros to enter. Worth it for a first trip but if you happen to find yourself in Athens save your visit for a Sunday, when it’s free to go poking around the ancient stones. On par with the gelato though was my expedition to the National Garden. A first attempt to visit was scuppered as it quickly transpired it was 1 May — International Workers Day. A heavy police presence in Syntagma, mid-point of Athens, meant the gates remained firmly closed as parades of lustily singing communists walked by. But on my final day I was able to spend two-hours wandering through wisteria-wrapped tunnels and paths lined with palm trees. As a city, Athens is already wonderfully green — every street is lush and leafy thanks to some savvy urban planner who planted a surfeit of trees. The garden was pure paradise though: laden orange trees, water features and flowerbeds bursting with colour. Even the sad petting zoo at the centre, featuring disgruntled and jail-busting goats, was not enough to dampen the joy it brought me. I also spent a day at one of the nearby beaches that make up the so-called ‘Athens Riviera’ — the stretch of coastal spots that Athens residents flock to every weekend. These are sorted into ‘organised’ and ‘unorganised’; ‘organised’ ones are privately maintained and visitors must pay to enter. As I was low maintenance, skint and simply in search of somewhere to soak up some much-needed Vitamin D, I opted to go to Glyfada, around 30 minutes outside of the city if travelling by cab and one-hour or so if taking the tram (extremely easy to navigate, like all of Athens’ public transport). You can’t really quibble with a beach if it’s clean, the sea’s a nice turquoise colour and the sun is beating down. The stretch I’d chosen turned out to have no toilets but… there was the Aegean. I stayed there reading my book and rotating every hour so I was equally singed both front and back, until the sun waned enough that I even I had to admit defeat. Riding the tram back, drunk on sunshine, I listened to Arthur Russell and stared out the window as the the city I’d dreamed so much of visiting, yet had such a vague conception of, passed by. I did not want to leave, even though all the bakeries put mayonnaise in sandwiches as standard. My escape had been wholly successful. I vowed to return, if I only for a third round of gelato."
Medium.com,Life,Rebelle Part of the Story,Travel,https://medium.com/swlh/rebelle-part-of-the-story-a97bfec14bd6?source=topic_page---------219------------------1," Before him, I like to imagine myself as fearless. Give me a challenge and I would take it on — convinced that I was always the right person for the job, even if the reality was I was 18 years old and full of hubris. That gall took me to Uganda, it led me to a major I would struggle to succeed in, to a wild group of kids just bold enough to believe that living in a van for 6 months showing movies could bring down a war lord. There’s a side effect of trauma though, or maybe of age, where an imposter syndrome creeps in. What once felt like I could jump first and fear later, was now a task too daunting. If I took it on, at what point would they realize I was incapable? When would they learn that I couldn’t just figure it out along the way and succeed? And when they did, how much would it ruin me to learn I was found out? Whether it was studying for the LSAT, taking on jobs outside my normal scope, leap frogging careers, or even, marriage, this nagging uncertainty and voice of doubt always filled my mind. And when your partner sees the truth but denies it — when he sees you taking on challenges and succeeded despite the odds, notices you getting raises, taking on responsibility, building a friend group — he makes sure any voice of confidence is stifled. It was small things — honestly, I didn’t notice them until long after he left, but he’d been giving voice to my doubts and asking me to negotiate my worth for years. From questioning my story when I reported sexual harassment by my CEO at my first real job, being embarrassed when the Washington Post wanted to do a profile on me and my PTSD therapy, or the one that made me finally take notice — refusing to celebrate my promotion and raise that finally brought my salary above his. He brought my confidence to a point that the Brynne who I am today wants to find the Brynne I was then and carry giant red flags and place them on every moment — a glaring siren flashing “Stop, Don’t listen. This is utter bullshit.” And what’s odd is that, sometimes actions just spoke so much louder than words. It was the lack of acknowledgement, not the direct attacks, that tore me down the most. Because when I needed it most, my partner wasn’t there to quiet the imposter voice in my head, to hold up a mirror and show me reality. ` I fought that voice for months after he left. The feeling of being lost and a failure sometimes so strong, it was all I could do to get up and go to work and keep fighting and looking for some sign of me growing stronger. In the midst of my deepest doubts, I was given an opportunity. A strange, not-remotely-close-to-my-comfort-zone challenge. I was asked to compete in an 8-day, 2,000 kilometers, off-road rally — with no GPS, no phones, just paper maps and a compass to find my way with one partner from Tahoe to the Mexicali border. A year prior, my company sponsored this race called The Rebelle Rally. To be honest, it felt like an odd fit given that we were an all digital company supporting an analog race. But, my job was to support it — handling the daily social updates following the race, the blog, and emails. I was entrenched it in for over a week, and was slowly enraptured by what I was seeing. For eight days I cheered as I saw women from all walks of life voluntarily locking up their technology, leaving their “sensible sedans” and “grocery getters” at home, to hop behind the wheels of Jeeps, Toyota Tacoma’s, and a stunning sky blue vintage Ford Bronco to try their hand at this competition — testing not only their driving skills and ability to navigate with just a map and compass, but also challenging the very image of what I’d come to understand as grit, endurance, and strength. When the Rally came to a close, my CEO, Eric, pinged me on Slack, having fallen in just as much awe of this race as I had, and told me, “You’re doing this next year.” I really, really hoped he was kidding. These women were awe-inspiring to me, and I felt like the polar opposite. I was the wife with the sensible sedan, and I used my GPS on every trip I took, even though I’d lived in DC for almost five years and it is less than 10 miles square. Anytime I had the option, I felt much more comfortable in the passenger seat. Most of me hoped he would forget, but a small part of me wanted to know if I could prove even myself wrong and cross that finish line one day. When I brought the idea up to R, he crushed even the ember of the fire I had to give it a try. He laughed at the very notion, and suggested that I start training right then and there if I had any hope. So a few months after we separated and the founder of the Rebelle came to speak at a company event, I was surprised at my reaction. I found my self dying to try my hand at the wheel after hearing her talk. During her presentation, my soul quieted the doubting voice for just a moment, and I went from “I hope they forget they asked me” to “There’s no way I’m letting Eric forget.” What I didn’t realize then, is that the Rebelle would become a beacon for me — something that if I could just cross that finish line I’d prove to myself that I was stronger than I thought. My first challenge came just a week before our first training. My partner dropped out, and I needed to find someone else to join me. I sent Slack messages and reached out to friends at work I knew, but few people wanted or could fit it on their schedule. When my manager suggested Karen, I knew little more about her then a photo on our website — and I was about to ask her to spend eight, 12+ hour days in a car with me, without a cell phone or music to escape. After a walk around the block, where she asked the most intentional questions about how I handled stress, what our communication styles were, and any similar experiences we had Karen agreed. We trained twice before the Rebelle, one weekend in August where we honed our off-roading and navigation skills, and one in September where we learned how to drive in the dunes. We did our best to fit in mapping and plotting practice and compass skills into our schedules when we came back, but if I’m honest I crammed as much as I could the two weeks before the Rebelle."

They don’t want to make the mistakes I have and have to deal with the consequences. After Bangkok, I don’t blame them at all. I continue to travel without much prior planning and research because I love the thrill and surprise of it. However, this is a problem with this when it affects other people. As much as we can try to practice responsible tourism, we never know what we may unknowingly be contributing to. In this case, I’m still not sure, but I know what I feel. And something didn’t feel quite right."

He was counting on the cormorants, their wings spread wide, and waiting for the mating beavers, swooping under the surface, staying underwater longer than you’d think they could possibly hold their breath. They trapped the nutria past the dam over there, he said, pulling his camera aside with one hand, pointing across the ponds with the other. They’re trapped between the two ridges of trees. There’s a male beaver with two females. His nicotine-stained mustache didn’t move when he talked. All I had said was hello, as strangers to do in public spaces when proximity obliges politeness. He didn’t say hello back, responded instead like he was continuing a conversation in medias res. In just a few sentences he revealed more to me than just his observations. That he comes to these ponds often enough to know that the cormorants are here, exactly where they are. He comes often enough to watch the neighborhood of this little ecosystem change with the seasons. He knows these wetlands, they seem to be a reprieve for him too. He seems lonely, not just a nature-lover. That’s an emerald ash borer, he says, not exactly smiling, but getting more animated. It’s an exquisitely iridescent beetle, a deeper green gem-toned emerald than an actual emerald — not surprisingly a type of jewel beetle. Some larvae take up to two years to emerge as adults from the bark of the ash trees. He tells me the city is monitoring the trees for the Asian jewel beetle — an invasive and ravenously destructive insect outside its native habitat. I wondered how they got here, how any of us get anywhere, and I assumed he could probably tell me if I asked but I didn’t want to stay in this moment much longer. He was kind enough, talkative without being overbearing. And I thought maybe he was one of the lucky loners who preferred being alone. Maybe he even had a loving companion waiting for him at home, someone who would lovingly pour over his photography with curiosity and admiration. While he was talking about the two female beavers, each of which had had two pups this season, I appreciated this man’s appreciation for nature, the patience to wait for the perfect moment, the sun setting behind the cattails and a woodpecker resting. Though I suspected he was lonely I wanted to keep walking. I wanted to see the turtles lined up on logs like they do before the sunset. But I also suspected our brief chat about bugs and birds might be his only interaction today. Or this week. I had no way of knowing but I remembered the unexpected moments that pulled me out of my darkest places. Though not miraculous, maybe a moment, like seeing the iridescent green of a beetle’s wing is enough beauty, even in its brevity, to create a connection. A flash of color not between us but between synapses. A spark of joy, a small whoosh of warmth that tells him to keep going, to keep waiting for the beavers, to get the perfect picture of the cormorants in their Christ-like perches drying their wings for flight. I knew I couldn’t take away the invasive loneliness of a stranger, especially if it’s lying dormant beneath the bark. But maybe I could distract him from it for that moment like a bird alighting on a branch, catching his photographer’s eye. I remembered that even a little bit of conversation can feel like companionship. And at the very least we could pause from our own lives to acknowledge the parallel lives of the animals not abstractly analyzing each other’s."

18th-century surveyors Mason and Dixon had extended their line east of the Pennsylvania border with Maryland, it would cut through southern New Jersey, sequestering much of the sandy Pine Barrens region in The South. That’s not the only thing that makes the Pine Barrens region of the Garden State just a little different from the rest of the Northeast: It’s the area’s unique history, legends, landscape, and way of life. And it’s a great destination for a fall or winter road trip or a photo safari. It’s a great destination for a fall or winter road trip, or photo safari. The Pine Barrens are the heavily wooded slice of New Jersey (approximately 22 percent of the state) included in the 1.1 million-acre Pinelands National Reserve. They’re marked by thin pine and cedar trees and sandy soil. Because of their proximity to Philadelphia and unique landscape, many small towns grew around industries that have since declined, such as iron ore and wood pulp. A drive through this often desolate area can turn up ghost towns, dirt roads with no posted speed limit, fallen factories, and towns named after one settler or family who are long deceased. A drive through the area can turn up ghost towns, dirt roads with no posted speed limit, fallen factories, and towns named after one settler or family who are long deceased. But this is not to say that the Pine Barrens are without pride, or industry. Cranberry farming is going strong, the Garden State’s sixth most valuable crop, bringing in $21.9 million a year. And each October, Chatsworth — a tiny town centered by a general store and once called the “Capital of the Pine Barrens” in Natonal Geographic — hosts a two-day Cranberry Festival that draws thousands. The Pine Barrens are famous nowadays for a few things — the legend of the Jersey Devil, the acres of open space that are unusual in this busy part of the country, and the eponymous third-season episode of “The Sopranos” in which Paulie and Christopher dump a gangster there and end up lost themselves. But decades ago, many came there to seek relics from the past. A book by legendary New Yorker writer John McPhee, The Pine Barrens, includes his observations of the people and towns there. However, I’m more inspired each autumn to read a series of books by late historian Henry Charlton Beck, published in the 1930s, especially Forgotten Towns of Southern New Jersey. In each book, he and a travel companion or two picked town names from an old state map, went to the sites, and often encountered one remaining house or one person there to tell a story. “The way to Ong’s Hat winds from the Pemberton road, back across a carpet of fallen leaves, through patches of white sand and down through deep, inky ruts,” he writes. “A hundred or so years ago, we were told, the place was a center of life among the pineys. There were frequent dances and couples came for miles in buggies, carryalls and on foot, to step to the music of country fiddlers. There was no Prohibition and it was more than soda pop that enlivened the crowd. There were brawls and fisticuffs, some of them bloody enough.” Speedwell, N.J. Once called Speedwell Furnace. Image by the author. And here is a passage about the bog-filled town of Speedwell: “South of Chatsworth and Jones Mill and beyond the blackened acres that were pines before the fire of several years ago, is Speedwell, or as it was originally known, Speedwell Furnace. The road to Speedwell is a dreary one. It winds and twists through charred stumps and stunted trees. On the road to Speedwell there is a corner known as Tom’s Grave…Nobody knows who Tom was. He was found stiff and staring one morning in the middle of the road…At length somebody conceived the idea of naming the dead man ‘Tom’ and burying him on the spot. “The day we were there we stopped to talk with one Piney not far down the road. Noting the desolation and wondering, as everyone must do, how people live in the backwoods, we said, ‘You must have a rough time of it here, getting along.’ ‘No,’ he answered us. ‘You see, I don’t own no land. I just live here.’ ” Apparently, to own property is to be poor, at Speedwell. See for yourself If you’d like to take a road trip there, I’d advise traveling along Route 563, a county road that takes one past the Chatsworth General Store and through the bogs of Speedwell and other towns. You can see the tiny cranberries bobbing on the flat surfaces. When I visited a few years ago — taking a day off work to feed my soul with a little sightseeing — I found unusual sites such as a roadside stand advertising rabbit meat, and a grave for a woman who wanted to be buried in the Pine Barrens. There are also numerous state parks with guided hikes and cranberry bog tours. Sometimes it’s good to take a break, learn a little about history, and see what’s just around the corner. This story includes photos from two of my drives through the Pine Barrens. What’s your favorite road trip destination? Let me know below."
Medium.com,Life,"Eat, Pray, Love, Repeat",Travel,https://medium.com/swlh/eat-pray-love-repeat-41efd17638b2?source=topic_page---------223------------------1," My sister called last week and said I had to reread Eat, Pray, Love. Really, I mean it. There is so much there. It means something different every time you experience the story. So I did. She was so right. The pages of the book transported me back to when I first read the book 12 years ago. I fell in love with the story. Always searching for new adventures, I read Gilbert’s words and dreamed of her world travels. At the time, my own life felt like it was closing in around me. I was a new mother to a beautiful baby boy, which comes with its own challenges. And my father had just died in an accident. When I lost him, I lost my north star. He was that one person I could have a deep conversation with, say anything and he never judged. He never compared his problems to mine but always had a compatible experience to share. I never felt less than in his presence. And he was just gone. Vanished from my life. I was trying so hard to tell myself he had a great life. We had the opportunity to share more than most people will ever get. I was such a lucky girl. But somehow, the loss kept creeping back in. I gave up my career to be a stay-at-home mom, something I never thought I would do. My life was becoming unrecognizable to me and I was spiraling down, trying to grab onto anything to stop my fall. Liz was 31, trying to decide if she should stay on the path with her husband and have a baby. Her sister told her, having a baby is like getting a tattoo on your face. You really need to be certain it’s what you want before you commit. I was 31 too and had already decided. And yes, it is exactly like getting a tattoo on your face. It might be more of a commitment than even that. The love you feel just holding your baby is so extreme, your impulse to care for and protect this life is complete you cannot fathom anything ever being more important. The huge surge of love you feel makes you crazy. Crazy overprotective, crazy controlling, and it is all crazy exhausting. So, I let my imagination run wild while following the words on those pages, desperate for inspiration. Watching Liz fall apart somehow gave me the strength to keep it together. Her journey across the world mirrored her journey inside. As she found her way, so did I. Eat, care for your body. I had gained nearly 100 pounds when I was pregnant with a ten pound baby. I felt physically drained. I had never been overweight a day in my life and I had no idea how to handle my changing body. She got to do it for four months in Italy. I had to do it with a baby on my lap in New Jersey, but ok. So I ate. I worked out. I made myself physically stronger and felt my body return. As my son grew bigger, I grew smaller. I learned to care for myself in any moment I had available. Feeling nourished and healthy fuels the mind in a way nothing else can. Pray, care for your soul. Liz struggled through an ashram in India. Desparate to find peace, she found a way to quiet her mind and dedicate her prayers to a local girl who really needed the blessing. I read about manifesting the life you want and learned to meditate. I kept a gratitude journal. I wrote every single thing I felt even the slightest gratitude for. I went back to church, not for the message but just for the solitary repetition that mass provided. I repeated daily mantras and positive affirmations and I started to breathe again. Love, care for others. I took my time and gave it back to my family. I took money I had inherited and gave it away. I brought people the perfect gift, just because. I got out of the house to volunteer locally. I lived by the rule that giving was more important than receiving. I felt joy when I gave joy. Her romance in Bali was incredible. As a new mom there was a lack of heat in my daily grind. I felt like a mom, first and foremost. While that is a beautiful thing, you lose yourself in the role very easily. Reading about Liz’s romance with Felipe, the Spanish guy in the jeep exploring Bali with his mix tapes and his swagger was really hot. Their romance, their deep understanding and love for each other was precious to behold. It was not smooth sailing from day one as they both left behind the pain of their divorces to come together. But they loved. Deeply and it was inspiring."
Medium.com,Life,I Had to Leave the UK to Finally Understand Patriotism,Travel,https://medium.com/swlh/i-had-to-leave-the-uk-to-finally-understand-patriotism-5e4e58cbbb26?source=topic_page---------224------------------1," Brexit Britain helped me find a national pride that actually means something I’m from Northern Ireland, so I’ve always had a complicated relationship with flags. When I was growing up in the late ‘80s and ‘90s near Derry, everything was segregated, divided into two sects of the same religion. From churches and schools to entire towns, everywhere carefully demarcated: Catholic or Protestant. It got to the point where my eight-year-old mind even began to assign inanimate objects a religion — that car’s Loyalist, that house looks Republican. I’d subconsciously slot everything into neat little boxes. Even as a kid I had an inkling of the absurdity of it all, how small-minded it was. Like many ‘Norn Irish’ people, my family treated it like a bad joke, something we all laughed at, like when my dad mimicked the puff-chested swagger of the Orangemen. But that didn’t stop me crawling into my parents’ bed in the dark, after nightmares of men in masks slipping bombs under cars. The segregation was deeply ingrained; it seeped into my consciousness despite my parents’ best efforts. My mum’s Catholic, while my dad was raised Protestant. They sent us to one of the few mixed religion schools in Northern Ireland, so I was surrounded by kids of both denominations (more than two decades later, still only a small proportion of children go to integrated schools). Yet before I was old enough to know what any of this division really meant, I instinctively knew that the colours plastered over every curb were territorial, like a cat pissing on its land. Whether it was the Irish tricolour or the British Union Jack, I knew the cracked paint and threatening murals had something to do with mass, marching, and bonfires. They had nothing to do with genuine community, pride or unity. The kind of cheerful patriotism that people in other countries associate with their flags was alien to me. I never felt straight-forward, clean-cut national pride. Expressing an affiliation to either Ireland or Britain would have been fraught with complications. The year I turned 11, I found myself standing in a foreign classroom under the stars and stripes, mumbling the American Pledge of Allegiance and silently hoping I wouldn’t get the words wrong. My family had relocated to Houston, Texas — so it’s safe to say that my relationship with flags continued to be fraught. Culture shock doesn’t begin to cover it. I began to associate the American flag with giant SUVs, 100-degree heat and the very particular politics of a middle school cafeteria. America meant Denny’s and McDonald's and Papa Johns and malls so big people did their exercise there. It meant pizza and tater tots for lunch every day. It meant kids who didn’t understand my accent, and occasionally asked me if I’d met any leprechauns. But living in the US at that impressionable age was also the first time I sensed a national pride that was different from Northern Ireland. Texans flew the stars and stripes and the lone star state flag outside their homes and stuck little paper flags in BBQ burgers. While I felt uncomfortable gazing up at their flag, hand on heart, uttering 100-year-old words, I also recognised that for my classmates, it was something positive. They didn’t have to think about who marched where or who believed what. They probably didn’t mentally assign their houses to one of two religious factions. I returned to the UK for uni a decade later, and lived in Manchester for 12 years. The English obviously have a different relationship to the Union Jack than we have in Northern Ireland, but that didn’t do much to improve its standing in my eyes. At best, the UK flag came to represent a quaint symbol of the Queen, bunting and an antiquated ‘keep calm and carry on’ attitude. Meanwhile the St George’s Cross was co-opted by the far-right EDL: for many it’s inextricably linked to racism and aggression. Then in 2016, the Brexit referendum happened. I was shocked by the prejudice and anger it revealed. More than that, I was disappointed that many English didn’t seem to care about the threat that leaving the EU posed to our fragile peace in Northern Ireland. At best, we are an afterthought; at worst, a pawn used by callous politicians (just last week this charmer called us a burden on the rest of the UK). Brexit gave me the push I needed to leave the UK, and on New Year’s Day 2017 I boarded a one-way flight to Mexico — for a year of travelling and working around the world. But to my surprise, it was leaving Britain that finally helped me understand patriotism. I began to find a national pride that actually means something to me. Thousands of miles from home, I gradually discovered what makes me proud to be British. It was seeing kids dance to Bowie and The Smiths in a Mexican dive bar. It was reading about the unsung everyday heroes who prop up our NHS. It was being moved to tears by acts of compassion in the aftermath of the horrific Manchester bombing — and seeing people queue for hours to get bee tattoos in solidarity. It was seeing Ireland repeal the 8th and slowly but joyfully emerging from the rule of the Catholic Church. It was being soothed by watching the eccentrics on The Great British Bakeoff. To me, national pride is the nothing-left-to-lose hedonism of muddy Glastonbury revellers. It’s Derry Girls and Fleabag and Wagatha Christie. It’s listening to the reassuring sounds of BBC 6 Music no matter where I am in the world. The last few years have been an absolute shitshow for Britain. But from my vantage point thousands of miles away, what I’ve seen emerging is a resilience and defiance that — to my shock — is turning me into a bit of a patriot. The hateful politicians we’ve elected to sort out this mess have bastardised the idea of national pride, they’ve poisoned it. The UK is weird, wonderful, resistant, eccentric, witty, and inclusive. Whatever happens over the next few weeks, months and years, let’s try to remember that."
Medium.com,Life,Ukraine — A Brief Guide To Travelling In The Country,Travel,https://medium.com/@stanisland/ukraine-a-brief-guide-to-travelling-in-the-country-c09e0cf03a4a?source=topic_page---------225------------------1," Before entering Ukraine, I was apprehensive about what I might expect. The country was at war and the news was rampant with stories of racism and far-right controversy. A friend of mine who visited said he witnessed foreigners being hassled and shouted at in the airport, which nerved me, making me contemplate what I might do to repel such attacks. Considering Ukraine and eastern Europe had been painted as land with few to no people of colour at all the stories didn’t surprise me. My initial instinct was to shave and deliver them a visitor that would look as white as possible to avoid unnecessary confrontation. Off I went, sporting a clean-shaven face, one which, shocked and surprised my family. They had largely known me to have a face landscaped with the bushiest of beards, and on the morning I was due to leave for Kharkiv via Kyiv, I made an event of the unveiling of my jaw skin. The night before, everyone was in bed, so I decided to use this time to prepare for the trip, wash and of course shave as I had an early flight the next morning. Looking at myself in the mirror, I took a deep breath, gulping several times before biting the bullet to mow my face lawn. Getting into bed, I slapped the sides of my chops and said to my wife ‘hey, check out the new man’, she woke briefly from a deep slumber to smile below her still closed eyes, before her head abruptly fell back asleep slamming the pillow with great intent. In the morning she awoke to shock and incomprehension — her husband had left her and, in his place, this new man stood. She looked surprised, betrayed and amused simultaneously. She allowed herself to compute the changes I had adapted before smiling and laughing at me. In the next room, my then 8-year-old daughter slept. I quickly scooped her up in my arms, sheep still jumping the fence and all, taking her downstairs where she could assess the changes. Still rubbing her eyes like a cartoon character awoken from sleep, she gently stepped forward in amazement. “Daddy? Is that you?” Yes, I replied. “Daddy…” she said laughing “…when will you be normal again?” In my opinion, the best season to travel is in winter, but that’s just me, I enjoy freezing cold weather. If you do happen to travel in the wintertime, be prepared to meet -20 Celcius temperatures. So be sure to pack thick gloves, sweaters, fleeces, woolly hats and thick trousers. Protect your chest area most. In the summertime, the weather is beautiful at 35 Celcius depending on where you are. I am told Odessa is a great place to visit, but you can enjoy the summertime anywhere. Oh, and expect the most vicious mosquitoes ever. This is coming from someone who has travelled to Pakistan and Somalia. There aren’t any known health risks in the country, but ticks can carry encephalitis, so speak to your pharmacist before travelling. Especailly if you plan to go to forested areas. Having ferried from the airport in Kyiv to a plane bound for Kharkiv I walked through a brief moment of the temperatures that were due to be unleashed upon me in a Ukrainian August. Upon landing, the inland heat smacked me dead in the face as I sweated without warning or permission. Kyiv is a very well organised airport and the staff are highly professional. Whereas, Kharkiv is a different story. Kharkiv’s airport was like a ghost town. There were very few people, and although I landed at night, I expected there to be a larger number of arrivals. Like all airports across the world, taximen stood like American football players in formation, waiting to find a person that would accept verbal contracts to go anywhere they wanted at above average Ukrainian prices. Kharkiv’s airport is small and it is impossible to get lost. You might find mannerisms a little different to central Ukraine. Don’t take it personally. It’s just the way things work there. My contact and soon to be great friend Artem was waiting for me dressed in a camouflaged army uniform, smoking a cigarette next to his now famous Renault Kangoo minivan. He smiled and greeted me with a warm hug. We discussed the politics of the country, the fact my grandfather was from L’viv and our family situations before he dropped me off at my hotel. The country is decorated with Ukrainian flags on every lamppost, car and billboard as far as the eye could see. Potholes in the roads were an obvious eye-sore, a symptom of contrasting seasonal temperatures and corruption. Food is incredibly cheap in Ukraine, but sometimes unaffordable to Ukrainians. At present, the exchange rate usually hovers around 35UAH to a pound. To put this in perspective, dining at the nationally recognised sushi restaurant of Sushi-ya cost me approximately £5. In the UK, to eat sushi you need to quadruple that amount. Breakfast (where I stayed) at the Iris Art hotel comprised of a mixed variety of foods including oatmeal with apple, fruits or chicken, yoghurt granola, a traditional English breakfast, traditional Ukrainian rye bread and of course — coffee. For lunch and dinner, they offer pescatarian friendly options, although vegans should beware this country will not be a friendly place unless you’re in the capital. In the city of Kharkiv, when staying at an Airbnb I made it my mission to walk to and from my apartment to a favourite restaurant of mine called 16/54 café. Also known as Gorodsky café. Here they serve pretty much everything you can think of for a health-conscious person, including, strawberry/mango yoghurt granola and oatmeal made with buckwheat, oats or chia seeds. Not only this, but you can tuck into poached eggs on sourdough bread, custard and cream doughnuts and more. My favourite traditional rye bread is also on the menu. If visiting the countryside, expect to be invited into homes that are self-sustaining. Locals have a knack for cooking, baking and cultivating. Many of the foods you encounter will be traditional Ukrainian dishes like borscht (beetroot soup) and vareniki, which are dumplings filled with different ingredients including potatoes, chicken, beef, cottage cheese and vegetables. One man I visited prepared a glorious feast, including cream cakes, coleslaw (which I mistook for cake), chai and a huge assortment of canapés. He later loaded me with honey he farmed to take back to the UK. Finding a hotel will be of little concern. The majority of establishments are well-kept operating within the boundaries of European Union standards. The only difficulty I can imagine a person to go through is the limited choices in food options at mealtimes. Otherwise, there should be no difficulties in finding a satisfactory place to stay. Airbnb hosts generally replicate the western aesthetic using the Ukrainian home model. Which means, you will often find a breakfast dining area complete with table, cooking area etc in very closed spaces. In Kharkiv, the best hotel I have stayed at is the Iris Art Hotel. Otherwise, staying close to Cafe 16/54 in Constitution square is a good location. The metro connects easily with major lines and you can walk straight to Freedom square passing Shevchenko park, the Opera house (on top of it there is a nice Mexican restaurant run by American immigrants) including many other monuments and points of interest. Kyiv is a little more complicated. Every district is pleasant but options for food and entertainment, including sight-seeing can be scattered. If I were to pick for everyone, finding a place on Kreschatyk street is best as it is surrounded by restaurants, shopping districts and if you’re working chances are it will be around there. Meeting people is easy, as it is a spot everyone knows. Getting around is simple due to left-over metro systems updated since Soviet times in most major cities combined with ride-hailing companies, tram systems and buses. Ukraine is equipped with more than enough. I prefer to walk everywhere in order to find new and undiscovered places which generally offer better and cheaper foods fit for locals. If you enjoy sight-seeing, walking is a better way to get around, and as previously stated you will usually find undiscovered places only locals know about including milk bars and traditional Ukrainian restaurants. Churches, monuments and boutique museums can be found in or near the central business districts and memorials are usually located nearby residential quarters. Not only that but convenience stores serving freshly cut vegetables and delicatessens are best outside of cities/town centres. Even better in residential areas. Of course, you can use Google and Google maps to find places of interest, but you will find much of the best and quirky places are often unlisted. At the end of the day, Ukraine is a fascinating place, changing many times between Soviet and independent rule. The language, the people are all shaped by values and history retained from the Soviet era including an embrace of multicultural communities and togetherness. I had no reason to shave my beard off, and my fears were bought from a bite of media bait. Racism, although existent anywhere is only noticeable in Ukraine if media outlets use a magnifying glass. Generally, people in Ukraine who hear my stories of Islamophobia are often shocked, questioning why this discrimination happens. Much of this because Ukraine has always been a place of community. And it aspires to be a member of the European Union, sharing many of the EU’s values. Ukraine is my secret place. I go there when I need to, when I want to and usually to feel better and happier. There is something about it that helps me form clarity and makes me feel at home and at peace."
Medium.com,Life,Rice and Water,Travel,https://medium.com/@shionaikawa/rice-and-water-848129e1fbe3?source=topic_page---------226------------------1," A Trek Through Sapa, Vietnam @shionaikawa ‘The Vietnamese call us cats,’ Mai explains while sitting on a faded red, low plastic chair in a hillside farmhouse after a morning of trekking through a high mountain pass — a parting of trees amidst a shallow valley that may have once been a waterway long ago. The clearings were special to the Hmong people where there once were wild hogs to hunt between the dense spear-like trees. Earth was compact, trapped as if the dirt had been trampled by stampedes of men and hog for generations, hiding the history of centuries-long war. The Pig Hunt Valley can be seen from the bottom of the main Muong Hoa Valley, where it looks as though a hard part was run through by a barber with an unoiled clipper. There was fog in reach, yet they wistfully swirl around and fade distantly into the fold of terraces. As they leave, they sound like exhales of a person in thwarted thought. ‘They call us cats because we do not wash, and we are dirty,’. Her puffed cheeks change little as she explains that the Hmong people and the Vietnamese dress, talk, and philosophize differently and that her people, the Hmong tribe, are the ethnic minority in this area of land that nearly borders China to Vietnam. Mai is our guide, hired on by Sapa Sisters — one of the few travel companies that had started out by the Hmong community. It is in the last ten years that homestays, rest stops, and trekking guides by the locals started to form, from the sheer necessity to own some control of the local economy that is relentless in its growth. She does not mind being called a cat, in fact, her mother operates a batik and indigo shop called ‘Indigo Cat’ in the small village Kim and I home-stayed. Conversely, Mai feels prideful that she is a part of the economic resistance that the Hmong in Sapa continues to wage. The Lao Cai province has experienced a water shortage this year and it has hit Sapa Town, a high city on the ridge that overlooks the picturesque terraced rice fields, more than other parts of the country. The shortage comes from less rain this summer season, but also caused by an explosion of development in hotels and resorts that fill Sapa town with tourists from the globe. More demand to travel to Sapa has come with the consequence of keeping the supply of water in check. Two water sources had dried up. In fact, the Sapa town currently is at the mercy of just one water source — Suoi Ho 2, a source that had traditionally been used for agricultural purposes, a water source controlled by the locals, Mai’s people. There had been threats to Sapa Town from the locals to embargo water, slowing the flow of tourism. At times booked rooms had to be vacated due to the hotel’s inability to prepare water stores. It was only since May that there was an agreement of Suoi Ho 2’s use; though one hotel worker tells us that it’s a constant fear that the villagers will cut their water supply. Its happened before. Predominately, there has been an increase in wealthier Vietnamese that come to enjoy the cooler and crisper air, a respite from their humid and dense and constricting city life. Air is green and grey in Hanoi, thick with smells of steaming gasoline and chalky construction debris. It’s not a hard thought to want to vacation in a place with blue sky and green fields. You can’t throw a rock in Hanoi without it bouncing off of a travel ad about Sapa. The world looks at Sapa in pictures, point at it, and makes it on the list of must-do places to visit in a Vietnam vacation. That will not change, due to its instagrammably striking beauty of its terraced rice fields, the high mountains, and its intriguing colors of cultural variety. We came to Sapa town by an overnight train into Lao Cai city. A shuttle took us deeper into the mountains, circumnavigating the deep cut alpine hills that for a time had aided in resisting Sapa from foreign investment. Roads have been built recently to seam Noi Bai — Lao Cai to Sapa. A wide highway gave way to a two-lane road, and suddenly the road started winding following the curvature of green terraces. A glimmer of excitement formed when the air slowly turned blue and pops in our ears signaled that we were nearly thereafter almost ten hours of constant travel from the ferociousness of Hanoi. A morning in Sapa City looked like a smaller hot springs town you’d find in Japan, except that you realize that everyone is wanting a piece of it. Upon setting foot, there were motorbikes, buses, and street hustlers questioning our choice to be there for the desire to be in a secluded place. Sapa City stood tall, nearly 4900ft in elevation, moated by the Muong Hoa Valley (1600ft) and protected on the northern side by the highest peak in the Indochinese Peninsula, Fansipan (10K ft). It was hard to tell that Sapa Town was full of such dramatic elevation changes. Streets felt cavernously narrow with ten storied hotels, multistory shopping strips, and narrowing and winding streets with their own story of hard use. It was hard to tell if the buildings were built fifty years ago, or hurriedly in the past ten — as it was eroding at a similar rate. Most of the downward climb to the edge of town was watching your footing for dips, trash, and potholes on the street. At one point on our way out of the town, we jumped over a meter wide gash in the street that exposed galvanized wastewater pipes, with some pipes damaged enough to witness the rushing flow inside. Looking up meant seeing balls and webs of power cables whipping across buildings. It was only when we stepped towards the edge of town, that the valley shyly showed, and a trail of cable cars guided our view to Fansipan. Mai lead us down the valley opposite of Cat Cat village, through a raw construction site entrance paved in loose gravel, into a muddied narrow path that edged two rice fields. We trudged down ledges of burnt orange soil that easily collapsed and liquidated into twenty-foot falls. We crossed rapidly moving streams, sometimes with footing made by accumulated plastic waste. Some crossings were aided by bamboo, though upon inspection there were many remains of past failed attempts stuck downriver. The trail was so narrow at times, the tall grass wrapped us at our knees, only to be released by uncontrolled kicks. I managed to only fall once. The small time I had looking up out into the landscape had me aquiver to experiencing the vastness of the valley. It became apparent that the dense trees and brush had hidden the valley to those who use this path, and only toward the midpoint that we noticed a change in the angle of scenery. After a bend marked by a growth of bamboo, the path became wider and drier. There were rest stops where one see women selling bottled beverages, and kids run at you to sell colorfully weaved friendship bracelets. Taking a seat at a rest stop, Kim and I gaze from the ledge as if it was our first time in our lives to looking level from the ground. It was a couple of months before the rice harvest and a day after heavy rain. The sky had an emerald color that stained with a gradient of grey. The clouds were ever continuous and shaped by the wind to resemble fuzzy versions of steamed rice rolls sold on a busy side street. Rice stalks were at upright attention, full of green with its point in celadon. Indigo grew a foot tall from the earth, leaves felt bloated with stores of juice. Green was everywhere, and the terraces traced layers of the valley like a cross-section of a mille crepe that had been hand-torn apart. The mountain ranges in the farthest points disappear upwards into texture of verdigris. Water in the river, the rice paddy, and small streams and ponds where water buffalo would bathe were colored by the soil. The buffalo would be glazed in copper brown, the tint of the soil and water refracting from the sun. We identified waterfalls cutting through the forest and dips in mountain ranges where water could accumulate and flow down into the river. You can spend an eternity trying to make sense of this view. Mai took us through irrigation trenches and through borders of rice plots — and after passing three houses, we ducked under a gate that read “Hmong Family Homestay”. ‘Here we will stay’, ‘At my house’. Hmong Family Homestay is Mai’s family project. She had two bungalows built a year ago. Like other quick buildouts in the area, the bungalows were framed of brick and cement, touched with thatched roofing and bamboo cladded walls. The interior walls were cladded in weaving bamboo, with cement floor, and a window yet unsealed of its gaps. A wooden balcony overlooked the river and the other side of the valley. The one-room bungalow was simple, with a single power connection, overhead lightbulb, and a mosquito net. Most importantly, it had nearby access to showers and toilets -with no limit to the use of water. Dinner was at seven. As we showered, hung our wet clothes and picked dirt off our boots, Mai’s mother was scurrying in a facility adjacent to the main house — a detached kitchen. A few clucking chickens and two dogs flowed freely in and out of the kitchen as a single wok burner fired and emptied dishes one after another. A roaring of moistened grains, charred earth, and sweating root vegetables wafted into the courtyard where a wooden table was set up with seven mismatched plastic stools. As the sun lowered, darkness slowly crept without direction, dressing the yellow table in an ultramarine hue. Buzzing and clicking of insects intensified and things like the bleating of oxen from afar felt closer. We sat under a hanging light, warmed by the closeness of Mai’s family and steam coming out from plates of fried spring rolls, wok-kissed morning glory, beef, cabbage, and peppers. Produce, mainly hearty vegetables like cabbage, squash, and brassicas are the main component of nourishment here in Sapa. Eggs and meats are for special occasions, rarely does a meal require those distractions. So when Mai’s mother cracked open a dozen eggs to fry after the first few rounds, although full, we felt compelled to finish it off. Stick to vegetables here. Mai’s mother served the main component, rice — a family grown harvest. I noticed it distinct from rice that I know, where this rice had resembled a miniature version of puffy Cheetos in white cheddar flavor. They were large grains, oblong in shape with rounded edges, less tack- meaning less starch, with less adhesive qualities. Though the rice was slightly over-cooked and over hydrated, the texture of the chew was pleasant, which meant the interior integrity of the rice was solid signifying a more direct cooking method than an electric rice cooker. More protein than fat. The semisweet and hay-like aroma hint that there were remnants of rice husks still present from the milling practice. It may be possible that the Hmong people store their rice without de-husking first. The water that was used to cook the rice was hard, evidenced by the smell of slight mineral and shine of surface stripped of luster and texture overall. It was rice, simple, and unadulterated of the valley. The table was vibrant with the clangs of utensils and rips and chews and slurps of several mouths. Everyone was silent until we were liberated from our instinct to devour. Around my third helping of rice and fifth crispy spring roll, Mai’s father pulled out a scuffed up Dasani water bottle and poured the clear liquid into several one-ounce cups. It is a tradition of the community here to drink ‘happy water’ for every meal, especially when guests are around. ‘Happy water’ behaved like a single distillate from a rice ferment. They didn’t tell me exactly how they processed it, but the taste and smell and perceived alcohol content points to the method very similar to shochu. Tasting rice shochu in the past and comparing it against ‘happy water’, I nostalgically acknowledged it as identical in category. After my third or sixth happy waters, Mai continues to explain that she is currently building two more bungalows, all with the help of her friends and neighbors. She tells us that her goal is to make a website, market her Homestay and be her own boss. For a woman of just twenty-three years old, with no reading or writing ability, and two children, Mai’s ambition and goals trump a lot of those who have much more means to do so. She overcame a lack of school to master speaking English by talking to tourists resulting in an amalgamation of British, Australian, American, and Euro-English inflection. Her face lit up, reflecting her speckled dots of the sun and eyes were widened fully revealing colors of deep carmine while describing exactly how she will get to building her business. We spend two nights here exploring the crevices of the ecosystem. Mornings were greeted with rice noodles and maybe if you have a western counterpart, pancakes! (more like crepes because they were thin and flat and flexible) On three days of hard trekking, its great hearing coffee and instant in the same breath. Every morning started out with a map and devising a plan for the day after breakfast. Since Sapa Sisters were locals, they were extremely flexible and granted our wants of varying levels of difficulty in hiking by adding nuanced information about particular hikes to prepare for the day. The taxi picked us up back to Sapa town after a three-hour trek upwards into a bamboo forest and following a waterfall path down into a small adjacent village. We were dropped off at the Sapa Sisters headquarters and quickly had to say our goodbyes to Mai. The bus was a full sprint uphill. If coming to Sapa, do a homestay with a Hmong person- there’s water, happy water with every meal, best produce in the region, access to places normal people don’t think it to be acceptably accessible. You’ll make friends with neighbors and families. Know that when you inevitably have to sleep, staying with a local there contributes to their success in ever-growing and globalizing surroundings."
Medium.com,Life,An Exploration of Seven European Alcoholic Drinks,Travel,https://medium.com/@allisonvantilborgh/an-exploration-of-seven-european-alcoholic-drinks-f266c9ac2e81?source=topic_page---------227------------------1," I remember sitting on a beach, freshly 14 years old, and staring at Tom Standage’s A History of the World in 6 Glasses. I didn’t realize it back then, but this summer assignment would fundamentally change the way I interacted with the world and instill in me a love for food and beverage history. When I talk about food and beverage history, I’m talking about the ways food has shaped the human experience over time economically, culturally, and spiritually. Over the years I’ve read books devoted to Salt, Coffee, Olive Oil, amongst many others, and listened to countless podcasts, seminars, and teachings on the subject. I’ve undergone experiments: going dairy free, kosher, and vegan. In fact, I’m still dairy free and kosher today. My favorite part of food and beverage history is what it’s able to teach us about those specific peoples who exist(ed) and live(d) in specific cultures abiding by specific beliefs and bound my specific circumstance. Of all the research I’ve done, there is no area more telling of this as alcohol is. Throughout this informal study, I sought to find answers to two questions: 1. What selection of alcoholic beverages is typical to the location I’m visiting? 2. What do these beverages mean to the people of the region? What kind of economic, cultural, and religious connotations does this beverage carry? This summer, I’ve gotten the privilege to visit Europe for another installment of seven months, staying in seven nations over four corners of Europe. In anticipating such a trip, I thought it would be an insightful playground to explore the significance of alcoholic beverages in each of these locations. Without further ado, let’s begin with my homeland: The Netherlands. It’s not uncommon that when one thinks of Dutch food and drink, an image flashes in their mind of the signature green Heineken beer bottle, adorned with the phrase “Brewed in Holland.” It’s fairly typical of Northwest Europe to specialize in beer production as opposed to wine or spirits (with some exceptions such as the Rheingau region in Germany). The main exception to this rule, I found was with Dutch Jenever. If you sound it out with an English ‘j,’ you’ll hear the word Gen or Gin at the front end which speaks to Gin’s Dutch origins (in Dutch, though, ‘j’ is pronounced like an English ‘y’). Jenever had its start in the Netherlands as a distilled malt wine, but due to its unpalatable taste, herbs such a Juniper (jeneverbes, hence the name) were added to mask the original flavors. I ordered a Jenever and Tonic at Scheveningen Beach with my Kip Saté. Holland has had waves of a sort of jenever-craze over the years, and at various times had been claimed to even cure the plague. It was the choice gift-alcohol of William of Orange, who officially brought the beverage to England in the 17th century. Dutch and English sailors alike depended on this Dutch Courage to brave the North Sea and become fearless in battle. Williams of Orange was also pretty big on taxing any alcohol that came from official Catholic states. This tax did not apply to any of the ‘Protestant’ alcoholic beverages, however, including Jenever. To Dutch people, Jenever represented something that was truly Dutch and Protestant in origin. It represented courage and masculinity, but it also represented an increasing national superiority. Other popular Dutch beverages include advocaat (which my dad not-so-lovingly called Dutch eggnog) and oranjebitter, a liqueur made from distilled colonial curacao peel, oranges, and plenty of sugar. As I mentioned above, the Northwest regions of Europe are known for their beers. This made me curious as to the differences in production moving 1250 kilometers east, to Gdańsk, Poland. My initial hunch was that although beer would play a large cultural role, so would spirits such as Wodka aka Vodka (considering it’s proximity to former Soviet states). Vodka, as you may know, is made from distilled potatoes. If you’re familiar with distillation, this should be no surprise. If you’re my dad, though, you’d be wildly surprised by such a fact, so I figured I’d mention it here. The top five Vodka’s in Poland, according to one source are as follows: I had the privilege of trying Zubrowka at a restaurant on Gdańsk’s Long Street. I quickly got the impression that Wodka was more than just alcohol to the Poles. It was grit. It was resilience. It was all the things we characterize Northeastern Europe for. If you ever find yourself in this coastal town, I suggest you do the same and drink as the Poles do. No longer in Northern Europe, I was unsure what kind of alcoholic beverages I would encounter in Zagreb, Croatia. Considering its location near Italy, I considered the possibility of the region growing grapes and producing wine in a similar fashion as Italy, but I had my doubts. Zagreb, Croatia is roughly the same distance from Gdańsk, as Gdańsk is from Holland. In my research I was told that I would most likely encounter sljivovica (plum brandy), travarica (herbal brandy), kruskovac (pear brandy), orahovac (walnut brandy) or lozovaca (grape brandy). The big surprise for me was a liquor called grappa. As the name implies, grappa is derived from grapes. A key difference, of course, is that grappa is distilled not fermented like a wine. The alcohol content can be dramatically different depending on the specific grappa you are consuming (30–60%). My first grappa was at my hotel in downtown Zagreb. It was a neat little bar on the first floor. There were hotel guests, and locals alike hanging out and enjoyed each other’s company. I was stunned how many varieties of grappa they had on one menu. I ended up opting for a plum flavored one. Grappa reminds me a lot of brandy, probably because it technically is. Grappa, apparently, is also apparently extremely Italian which didn’t phase me. Italy was right next door. Croatia has an interesting identity-crisis embedded within itself (and its drinks). Walking around the streets of Zagreb at night, one cannot help but wonder where they are. In Central Europe? Austria, perhaps? The architecture feels anything but Southern. This is credited to the Habsburg influences that dominated this city. Once an extremely powerful capital, Zagreb definitely still appears in recovery from the events of the past century. All of these factors feel evident in their most popular national drink: grappa. It’s not distinctly one, it belongs to many. It’s multicultural. The plum grappa was pretty good too. In American depictions of Greek culture (My Big Fat Greek Wedding comes to mind), there is almost always a ridiculous number of shots taken by various estranged family members, beckoning outsiders to join them in the ritual. When it came to pinpointing what drink they were actually consuming, however, I drew a blank. Although I’ve been interested in the topic of alcoholic beverages in this cultural sense, I guess I had never really considered what variety they had in Greece. Turns out, the shots they were taking are called Ouzo (or Oyzo). Ouzo, as I learned is a dry anise-flavoured aperitif. The first time I tasted it, I was eating a mediterranean dinner atop a roof in the Plaka district of Athens, Greece. The sun was beginning to set in the opposite direction of the Acropolis, which towered directly in front of us. There was probably no better way to experience Ouzo for the first time. The cloudy drink was strong, but not too strong. It came in a skinny, iced glass. I was expecting something similar to Vodka by the outward appearance of it. Boy was I wrong. As I took a sip, all I could think to say was, “Licorice.” I had grown up on large doses of the stuff (licorice, not Ouzo) so I was very familiar with the taste. It was odd tasting it in an alcoholic beverage. An interesting fact about Ouzo is that only two countries in the world are able to produce it: Greece and Cyprus. This is because Greece applied to have Ouzo on the European Union’s list of Protected Designation of Origin. In 2005, when the legislation was passed, Europe formally acknowledged this product as distinctly Greek, meaning that no other country in Europe can produce a similar product and also name it Ouzo. Of course, I could talk about wine. Wine is also a big deal in Greece. Think Dionysus. But many great nations produce good wine (including the next country I visited). In addition to wine, the Greeks are also known for tsipouro spirits, retsina, and tsikoudia/raki (of which I know little about). In other words, I’m leaving a lot out. Ouzo is about something uniquely Greek (that Cyrus shares, I suppose). It’s heritage. It’s nationalism, period. Not going to lie, though, I’m not a huge fan of Ouzo. Arriving in Florence, I had no doubt in my mind that my exploration in Italy would mostly be influenced by Tuscan wine. I explored the Chianti region while I was there, where they produce Chianti Classico “Rooster Label” wine. What might surprise you is that Tuscan wine accounts for only 6% of Italian wine. What’s more, Italy is not the world’s largest producer of wine. That honor goes to France. When in Florence, I was able to try a great variety of wines at various vineyards: red, white, sweet, dry. In all the hours of tasting wines, I was actually kind of bummed out by the end of it. I’m a dry red girl myself, but I wasn’t finding much that suited my palate. Nothing I tasted was life-changing. What did change in my life was the way I read wine labels and understand wine’s modern history in general. The Chianti region is pretty famous, in case you haven’t heard. The Chianti Classico label began when Grand Duke Cosimo III de’Medici (yeah, that Medici) designated the very first ‘zone’ for wine, in Northern Italy. From that point on, special wines were produced in this region, and with them came certain folklore as well. A Chianti Classico wine is not the same is just a Chianti wine. Chianti Classico wines are required to be comprised of at least 80% Sangiovese grapes, a local grape. The rest of the body can be a blend, but this is what makes it distinct to the region. In talking to people who work on these vineyards, they seemed to be extremely proud of the long tradition of using the same grapes on the same soil as their ancestors did. The history in Chianti goes deep. Each bottle of Chianti Classico wine, bears a distinctive black rooster (gallo nero), usually on the neck of a bottle. If it’s surrounded by red, it’s a traditional Chianti Classico. If it’s surrounded by gold, then it’s a higher grade. Legend has it that this scrawny black rooster helped define property lines in Medival Europe, a preventor of war between Florence and Sienna. You can learn more about the fascinating myth here. In 1967, Chianti Classico got officially recognized on the Protected Designation of Origin list, just like Ouzo did some forty years later. From that point on, vineyards in France could not produce a Chianti wine just by virtue of the blend of grapes. Chianti wines had to be made on Chianti soil. Italian wine has an Italian soul. It was great hearing all the personal stories of various winemakers talk about all the generations that had produced wine of the very same soils that they do today. In a globalized, high-pace world, there’s something extremely special about this kind of tradition. Now whenever I look at bottles of wine at stores or in restaurants, I keep an eye out for the black rooster label. Before we embarked on our seven-week trip, I sat under covers in the living room with my mom watching Rick Steves explore Lisbon, Portugal in anticipation for our trip. This Episode 1002: Lisbon partially inspired me to write this piece, as it explored two distinct beverages traditional to Portugal: Ginginha, a sweet cherry liqueur, and of course, Port, a dessert wine. Although these two share the commonalities of being alcoholic drinks fermented via fruits, the fact that one was a liqueur and one was a wine with high drinkability seemed against my initial intuition. My first experience with Port was actually on the flight from Florence. We road TAP Airlines. One of the drink options was Port, and I was, of course, curious for academic purposes. Port is much, much sweeter than any alcohol I had tasted before. It tasted and felt like syrup on my tongue. Not at all what I was expecting (but what’s new). As I mentioned before, I’m generally a dry red gal, so I was surprised how much I enjoyed my first experience with Port. Turns out there are many varieties of Port. The variety I had on the plane was a Tawny Port, which meant it had more spicy notes than, say, a Rosé. Not long after I tried my first class of Port, I have Ginginha on a rooftop bar overlooking Lisbon. This, by contrast, was exactly what I was expecting. Ginginha is sweet but comes in small quantities. It’s bursting with deep cherry flavor. It actually feels and tastes like syrup and I honestly couldn’t imagine having more than one glass. And yes, I know, Ginginha is kind of a bonus here since I said I would only talk about seven drinks in this article. Unlike the other cultures I visited on my trip, Lisbon was upfront and excited to show me just how sweet and fruity it’s alcoholic beverages were. Unlike the tough exterior of Poland or macho-complex of The Netherlands, Lisbon was perfectly at peace being sweet and easy to consume. I feel there is also an allegorical significance to this: Portugal was able to stay out of much European conflict in the past century. They had a small role and didn’t suffer much destruction even in the face of World Wars. Lisbon is the heart of a long history of riches that changed the landscape of Earth forever. It’s a symbol of both luxury but also extreme devastation in other parts of the world. My final location of exploration this trip was Madrid, Spain. Over the years I’ve read a lot about the increasing worldwide respect for Spanish olive oil and wine, which made me curious as to the variety of alcoholic beverages Madrid boasts. The days with very long, and by this point in the trip, my family was pretty much done with packing our days full of activities. We would sleep in, eat some food, get in a work block, and head out into the city for dinner, which in Madrid was starting at around 8:30 PM. Each night was accompanied by a pitcher of Sangria or Spanish White Wine. Spain, as you may recall by the diagram provided under the Italian section, is the world’s third-largest producer of wine. Spain has a really unique terrain that supports all sorts of agriculture, particularly famous for the wine and olive oil I wrote about just a moment ago. In doing more research, I found that Sangria is a relatively new invention. It’s history can only be traced back to the 18th century, which compared to Dutch beer, makes it a baby of a tradition. A more historical drink may be its predecessor of a similar name (Sangaree) which became very popular in the Spanish colonies in the New World. At one point, Sangaree was a staple American alcoholic drink before it fell out of favor in the early 20th century. Who would have known. The Sangrias I tried were remarkably simple. They weren’t trying too hard to impress or could only be created through incredibly scientifically stringent ways. It was just wine and fruit. Sangria was such a relief in the hot, 100 Degree F weather of Spain in the Summer. I can’t think of a better way to close out this exploration of alcoholic histories in Europe."

It felt like the plane was see-sawing back and forth, as if a pair of sumo wrestlers were jumping up and down on each wing. “Seriously, you don’t feel anything?” “Babe. No. It’s fine. You’re fine.” I was not fine. Our plane taxied and took off. As the plane rose higher and higher, so did my heart rate. I watched Mount Hood out the window as we continued to ascend. All I could think about was how a German pilot had deliberately flown a commercial flight into the side of the French Alps a few years earlier and had convinced myself the same thing was about to happen to us. Our ascent was taking too long, and the only logical explanation was that the pilot was about to dive bomb us into the side of the mountain. In hindsight, this is an absolutely insane and unreasonable thing to think. But in the moment, it was a stone-cold fact. You couldn’t tell me otherwise. Brains are weird. Lauren, sensing my panic, scooted to the vacated middle seat and held my hand. It was useless. In my head, we were moments from becoming debris on the mountainside. “Flight 1070 to Kansas City” would be trending on Twitter before we knew it. As I stared at the mountain out the window a very embarrassing thing happened that pains me to write so badly that I’m drawing this very needlessly long sentence out as long as I can by using more and more pointless words before having to actually say it and oh my God here it goes. I cried. A single hot tear containing every ounce of my dignity, ran down my cheek. It was at this moment that the captain came on the intercom and confirmed my suspicion: our ascent had been slower than usual. It was so we could enjoy the view of the mountain. “My God,” I thought, “how did I become such a little bitch?”"
Medium.com,Life,Being a Digital Nomad Ruined Travel for Me,Travel,https://medium.com/swlh/being-a-digital-nomad-ruined-travel-for-me-f84971a0035c?source=topic_page---------229------------------1," At the age of 18, I had my first true love… Travel. Nothing could have prepared me on what to expect when I booked that first plane ticket to Australia but it changed me forever. I went on a journey with no real plans to return to the normality of everyday life and no plans at all really. This journey saw me travelling for a period of 3–4 years while living in multiple countries across the world. I made friends everywhere and loved the social aspects that came with travel. At this point, I was not working remotely but was picking up jobs in bars/hotels/farms or whatever I could on the way to sustain my travelling habits. The thing that I loved the most was having the freedom to do what I wanted without the worry of a serious job commitment or at least having the free time when not working to enjoy cities/parties/tours and whatever I wanted. This period of my life ended and I went back to the UK to start working towards a career as I thought that I had rid the travel bug from my system. I was wrong. Being back home only made me want to travel more and realise all the stuff I had missed out on. Fast-forward to the age of 28, I set off on my travels again only this time I was a “digital nomad”. I was so excited to get back into travelling and relive my past experiences of fun, excitement, and culture. I had always heard of people working from their computers and never believed it was possible, part through logistics and part through jealousy. But there I was, standing tall as a new fully-fledged member of the digital nomad society (I am not sure if that’s a real society if so, I don’t actually belong). My first three months of travel were spent in Ireland and 1 year later I am here in Australia (there were more countries in between). I have since come to the realisation that being a digital nomad has ruined my travelling experiences. I understand that people dream to live this lifestyle, as did I, but the grass isn’t always greener on the other side. When you start working on your own schedule, many things change, all of which are dependant on the type of job and your personality. For some reason, being in charge of my own income transformed me into this money-hungry work machine that never wanted to stop. I had one job at the start which I could work whenever and however but had to do 8 hours across 5 days. I didn’t feel like this was enough money though, so I constantly scoured the web applying for multiple jobs on every platform imaginable. It’s worth noting, my first job was a secure, steady income which was perfect for travelling the world (why did I want more?). A month into my digital nomad lifestyle, I had 4 jobs, none of which were high-paying. I would wake up at 4:30 am to start my first job so that I had time to do all the other jobs until 10:30 pm. In between this I still looked for more jobs. I even had jobs to keep me busy over the weekends. When I first travelled and worked, I actually didn’t mind working because I had friends at the job which made the experience much better. Now working at hotels/airbnbs, I don’t see any forms of life. Maybe this is part of the reason that I hate what I have become now. It didn’t stop there, I am now starting 4 business, running blogs, writing for multiple companies, still have a full 40-hour job, writing an e-book and I am in full-time university. Will it ever stop? Being a digital nomad has made me hungry for success for multiple reasons: 1: I want more money to sustain my future 2: I want to make a name for myself 3: I never want to go back to working for a company physically 4: I never want to lose the unlimited holidays that I have I guess I can look at it in a positive way and be thankful I have the chance to travel and I am creating opportunities for success. It was only last week (after 1 year of this lifestyle) that I came to the realisation that being a digital nomad ruined my travels around the world. My expectations were to travel like I did the first time, enjoying parties, going out to beautiful parks every day, surfing, and eating out 5 times a week. My reality was I have travelled to over 15 countries and spent 12–16 hours a day working whilst only taking 1–2 hours out to rush and see landmarks/sites etc. My travels have now heightened my anxiety for work. If I go out to see a national park, my first thought is to rush around to get back as quick as possible and work. I can no longer relax and enjoy the beauty of travelling and seeing new places, work has taken over for me. I am not sure if this happens to other people or if it is just me and I can certainly say that I am grateful for the opportunity that I have to travel the world and work."
Medium.com,Life,How bad is flying?,Travel,https://medium.com/@kimbarrett92/how-bad-is-flying-b2343b345cb8?source=topic_page---------230------------------1," In my lifetime, I have taken two long-haul flights. One was a trip to New York, USA and the other was a holiday in Bali, Indonesia. These flights have increased my personal carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions by 11 tonnes. The IPCC has calculated the total amount of greenhouse gases that humanity can contribute to the atmosphere and still probably prevent more than 2°C warming. To avoid overshooting this, a steep rate of reduction is required. In the next 12 years, we must reduce our global emissions by 25%. By 2070, humans need to have completely stopped contributing CO2 and other greenhouse gases to the atmosphere. Once this deadline is reached, humanity must offset all of its CO2 emissions using carbon capture techniques, like regularly planting large forests. However, it isn’t possible to offset greenhouse gases at the rate we are currently emitting them. Reducing global emissions is a burden we must share as a species. Following the IPCC’s recommended rate of reduction, a person born in 2017 would only be able to emit 123 tonnes of CO2 over their lifetime. Under this budget, the two long haul flights I have taken in my life have used up my entire annual carbon budget for over 7.5 years."

A couple of friends and I have been driving around for nearly 6 months. In that time we have seen a lot of places, had a few unfortunate moments and been to plenty of new countries. The other day we got a ferry from Sweden to Finland. As we drove off the ferry and towards our destination, I realised that Finland was the 40th country I have visited. While it was nice to reach this number, it was not my goal. Apart from a few select countries, I have not seen a lot of those 40 countries. A few of them I have entered and left again within an hour! It’s a stretch to say I have even visited them, so brief was the time I spent in those places. This got me thinking about why we are suddenly so obsessed with tracking how many countries we have visited and the desire to “tick them off.” Travelling has never been about this for me. This is not Pokemon, where the aim is to catch them all, it should be an exercise in expanding your horizons, experiencing different cultures, stepping out of your comfort zone and seeing how life is led around the world. In my eyes, to lower it to an exercise in ticking boxes is to devalue what makes travelling so fun in the first place."
Medium.com,Life,Travel Tips for Remote Workers,Travel,https://medium.com/swlh/travel-tips-for-remote-workers-7013a763a745?source=topic_page---------232------------------1," At Kuvio we work remotely and that has given several of our employees the opportunity to take some longer trips around the world. For example, in a few months I will be leaving my home in Boston to live in Latin America for four months. Travel is one of the most exciting parts of our remote structure and our team loves to talk about it, so we have shared our experiences with and compiled a list of tips for anyone who is considering heading out on a remote work travel journey. Pack Smart Speaking from personal experience, when heading out on a trip, especially a long one, you may feel the urge to pack a lot of stuff (like maybe three suitcases full). But, in reality they likely sell everything you may need at your destination so if you forget something it is not the end of the world. Avoid the hassle of lugging around too much and the crazy airline baggage fees, by editing down your belongings. Pull out everything you would like to bring and then see what you can remove. This is one of my favorite packing lists to reference for long trips. Another suggestion is to allow yourself to bring one “silly” item and to not feel bad about it. Maybe it’s your seashell collection or an impractical pair of shoes. Let this be something that brings you comfort if you begin to miss home. Finally, think about what you are packing your belongings into. A friends suitcase recently ripped open only hours before her flight and she ended up shuffling all of her items with her in trash bags until she could buy a new one at the airport. If your luggage has been through a lot, you may want to upgrade. When doing so, consider the weight, size, and any special features you may want, like a built in battery pack. Invest in the tech you are bringing Before you leave, you want to ensure that your technology is in good working order. When you are at home, it might be easy to interact with tech support or pop down to the Apple store when your laptop stops working. However, while on the road this is sometimes a bit more tricky. Before you leave, do an audit of all of your technology and make any necessary repairs. Depending on where you are headed, you may also want to invest in some new tech like, for example, a personal hotspot. Find friends If you are heading out on a solo trip there are many ways to connect with people in the places you travel. There are online communities to connect digital nomads who want to meet up around the world. Additionally, joining a co-working space in your new city can help you make connections with locals. If you are nervous about traveling alone, there are also travel programs, like Remote Year, where you travel with a cohort of other remote workers. This type of experience may cost more than doing it on your own, but the networking opportunities and new friends you make could make the journey worth it. Set a budget When you are traveling it is natural to want to take in all the food, drinks, sites, and shops of your new home. However, if you aren’t careful this could add up to monthly spending that is much higher than what you are used to back home. Setting a budget before you leave can help you keep unforeseen purchases in check. When setting your budget, consider where you will be located, for example prices in Latin America will be lower than in Europe. You may also want to breakdown the budget into categories for things like food, fun, housing, and side trips so you can remain focused on how much you allocate to each. Consider time zones When planning your itinerary, consider what time zones your coworkers are in and how often you will need to meet with them. If your whole team is in EST and you plan a trip to Asia know that you may need to be a bit more flexible with your working hours than if you travelled to the U.K. Depending on the company, this may or may not be a major factor for you, but it is something to think about. When you arrive in a new time zone, it is helpful to let your coworkers know. Slack has a tool that allows you to set your current time zone so that members of your workspace can see it. Do your research There is nothing better than the spontaneity that traveling can bring. However since you will be working during your trip, you will want to do some research on your destinations to ensure you are able to maintain a healthy work-life balance. Plan where and how you will connect to wifi and decide where you plan to do the majority of your work. You may also want to create a “bucket list” for each destination so you can prioritize your free time in each location. Protect yourself Whether you are traveling or not, sometimes life throws unexpected challenges your way and you want to be prepared for this. Travelers’ insurance is a good way to protect you and your belongings. While you may be traveling on a budget, this is a fantastic investment considering how quickly bills can add up in a medical emergency or other unforeseen circumstance. Do some research into different companies and types of plans and choose the one that matches your needs depending on the length of your trip and the level of protection you prefer. See a doctor It is recommended that you see a doctor before you depart. In addition to a regular physical, they can consult with you about any vaccines that may be recommended for your trip. Plan to have this visit at least 6–8 weeks before you leave so that you have time to get any follow-up dosages you may need. Before you leave, you should also have a plan for how you will obtain your prescription medications while traveling. Similarly, if you wear contact lenses don’t forget to bring enough to last the journey or create a plan for how you will get your preferred brand on the road. Get things done Full disclosure, living in an amazing new place can make it very tempting to let your work slide so you can spend more time exploring. Creating a schedule of when you plan to work, and sticking to it, can help ensure that you are dedicating enough time to your career.

Medium.com,Life,The Vacation I Became a Parent to My Father,Travel,https://psiloveyou.xyz/the-vacation-i-became-a-parent-to-my-father-4423482d8f3d?source=topic_page---------233------------------1," Some of my fondest childhood memories involve trips I went on with my parents. Every winter we went to the mountains where we tobogganed, ice-skated and drank hot chocolate around the fireplace inside our cozy cabin. In the summer we went to a resort where we swam in a large pool, ate in a dining room, and engaged in “family fun” activities. Looking back, it was bit like Dirty Dancing, although no one called me Baby and I never found my Patrick Swayze. The vacations which occupy most of my memory (what little I have these days) are the ones we took to New York and Hawaii. In Hawaii, I walked around in white pedal pushers, carrying a large, white straw purse, (even larger than my mom’s) thinking that all the boys would surely notice me. Well, if they did it wasn’t as anything but a flat-chested twelve- year-old carrying a purse way too big for her and smiling like a complete dork. In New York, I was a bit more sophisticated. Sort of. I actually fell in love and had my heart broken all in one night. This incident caused my father to go into a rage and want to go kill whoever had made his baby girl cry so horribly. (The closest I got to a Baby moment.) When he found out I was sobbing hysterically because I would never see that boy again, he wanted to kill me! But no matter what age I was when we traveled, I knew my father would get us to our destination safely. He would take care of everything (hotels, car rentals, food, souvenirs, fun) while we were on our vacation. And see to it that we arrived home in one piece."

oday is a perfect day for hanging laundry. And the beach! You must go to the beach today.” Héctor, the manager at the newspaper office we are working at this summer, pops in to notify us, wagging his finger good-naturedly at Maya and I. Why? How do you know? I ask him. “Because, the winds,” he says simply, shrugging his shoulders. Ah yes, the winds, I think. Of course. Nearly every morning we receive a weather report from Héctor, a native Sevillano who lives and breathes his Andalucian culture. And he is never wrong. The clear skies, lukewarm waters, and flying sheets dotting the laundry lines of most Sabinillas terraces that day indicated that he just might know what he’s talking about. After researching these mystical “winds” that seemed to inform his daily decisions, I learned that there are, in fact, three kinds of gales here on the Costa del Sol. The first is levante, a soggy easterly wind originating in the central Mediterranean that is associated with overcast skies and occasional rain (in other words, not a good day for hanging your whites). The second is sirocco, an aggressive, suffocating wind whose Saharan origin is notorious for caking cars and homes with a thick layer of red desert dust. Finally, there is poniente, a welcome wind that serves as the western counterpart to levante and brings warm, dry weather with it — the kind of weather that, as was pointed out, makes for a great beach outing. It is said that if you can see Morocco’s craggy outcroppings in the distance, you know a poniente is blowing through. Who knew so much could be learned from a simple breeze? What, to me, looked to be random bouts of good and bad weather, to Héctor and other native Andalucians was a predictable pattern they could read every day the same way they read their newspapers over morning coffee. It’s a cultural difference I’ve noticed time and time again. As a Mexican citizen who has lived several years in Mexico, Europe, and the U.S., I can’t help but notice how disconnected I feel from my surroundings when I’m in the latter region as compared to the two former. The idea of focusing on myself — my to-do’s, my success, my well-being, my time — often feels like it should be prioritized over pausing and considering the world around me. But what is it about American culture that has shaped its famously “individualistic” nature? And has it made us more distant from our environment?"
Medium.com,Life,Lost Illusions,Travel,https://medium.com/paris-mode-demploi/lost-illusions-1445ff5b4982?source=topic_page---------236------------------1," On being, and becoming…Parisian My name is Elliot Durand. Though American by birth, I am conservative by instinct. Thus my decision, ten years ago, to radically upset my life by moving to Paris with no real plan continues to surprise even me. In my less inspired moments, I explain this choice by plotting a concrete sequence of causes and effects. 2009 was an unhappy year. I needed a change. A close friend living in Paris suggested that I join him for a few months that summer, and I accepted. This set in motion a chain of events — some prosaic, others less so — that have kept me here all this time. It’s actually quite easy to find reasons to keep doing what one is doing. In the physical world this is called inertia. When applied to rational choice, sociologists use the term path dependence. That summer — it was the night that Michael Jackson died — I was out walking when the sky exploded in a terrible thunderstorm. I sought refuge under the awning of a café on the Rue Dante. There I met Alexia. She had green eyes and impossibly luxurious black curls. I asked her if she’d heard about Michael Jackson. “Why do you think I’m drinking?” she answered. Her English was good, though not great. She told me I was “pretty,” and asked if these were my real eyes. We kissed under the awning, and in the rain all the way back to her little apartment behind the Pantheon. By the time we got there her curls were drenched. She fed her cat Ninette, and we made love for hours, in French, before falling asleep in one another’s arms. The next morning we agreed to meet again as soon as possible. I gave her my number and promised that I would love her forever. She smiled and answered “Me too.” We kissed, and she got on the bus to go to work. Then she disappeared. At first, I stayed in Paris because I hoped to find her again. Those hopes were soon reduced to ashes, but I still wanted more of Paris. By now I had a job, which gave me the status of a temporary resident. I hated my work and my petty tyrant of a boss. Every day I was tempted to quit. At various moments I even considered returning to America. However, reason told me that if I stuck things out for a period of time I could apply for French citizenship. I didn’t care about money. I only wanted to be free of the dreadful necessity of working in that horrid factory of discontent. Once I became French I could go back to America. Or to Italy, or Cyprus, or Lithuania, or any other European country my heart desired. I persevered for six years. During that time I had the idea for a novel. I poured hundreds of hours into it, ignoring my friends to spend evenings alone in front of a screen, waking up at six in the morning to write, scribbling notes during my rides in the metro, stealing five minutes whenever I could during the day to compose a few sentences. At the end of those six years I became a French citizen. By then I had a Russian girlfriend who visited me to celebrate. A few days later, she broke into my computer and deleted all of my work. Not a trace remained. She disappeared as well, leaving a nasty letter as my only souvenir of the experience. Staying and rewriting my book became a matter of principle. Of revenge. I consider myself reasonably perceptive, occasionally even in my own affairs. And I’m certain that by the time I’ve resurrected my lost book, I’ll have another reason to stay. It’s not simply cause and effect that have kept me here all this time. It’s Paris. I fell in love with the city from the moment I arrived, on a school trip in 2003. During the bus ride to catch my return flight, I wept as I watched the dome of the Sacré-Cœur fade into obscurity like a dream upon waking. In that moment I promised myself that I would come back and never leave. Like Emma Bovary, for months after my return to my provincial American town, I’d regularly say to myself, ‘x days ago, I was there.’ The people attracted me even more than the setting. At the time, I believe I was their opposite. They were refined, elegant, clever, and ‘put together’ in a way I’d never imagined possible, while I was an inexperienced, poorly dressed midwesterner with vague pretensions to sophistication. My first encounters with Parisians helped me to see just how far I was from my ideal. They embodied the type of person I aspired to become. I grew to believe that this would only be possible in Paris. It was why I kept coming back, and why I eventually stayed. I didn’t dare to say it then, even to myself, but I wanted to be a Parisian. The adjective “Parisian” can mean a variety of things, depending on the person using it. For native Parisians themselves, its connotation is invariably positive, even when seemingly used pejoratively. It opposes the energy, refinement, and vast culture of the capital to the sleepy backwardness of the provinces. No matter where he is, with the possible exceptions of London and New York, the Parisian is always somewhat anxious to return to Paris. Oftentimes he never leaves in the first place. A Parisian who appears to mock himself by saying “I’m a typically insular Parisian: I’ve never been to Nantes,” is actually deprecating Nantes, and not his own insularity. Because the island is everywhere that isn’t Paris. In Nantes, however, and in the rest of ‘provincial’ France, ‘Parisian’ is usually a synonym for arrogant, insufferable, overpriced, or overrated. For foreigners, ‘Parisian’ is almost always complimentary. That’s not to say that everyone loves Paris. Bad opinions of Paris are common among British or American travelers, and it has become almost fashionable to make observations along the lines of Paris isn’t what it used to be, Paris is dying, or Paris is overrated. But these criticisms only serve to exalt the adjective ‘Parisian,’ the ideal to which the real, earthly Paris fails to rise. In this conception, the Parisian (whether or not such a thing exists in nature) is someone who has attained a maximal degree of sophistication in the art of living. A Parisian knows how to shop for clothes, how to wear a foulard, how to seduce, how to make love, how to decorate with taste, how to eat a soupe à l’oignon with elegance, how to choose a wine, how to charm, how to cite Rimbaud or Bergson or Foucault, how to be the master of every situation, how to raise children who don’t shout or spit out their food. I am a member of the most existential of all generations, the millennial. Certain of our elders argued that existence precedes essence; we can’t conceive of a universe in which this is not the case. I decided to become a Parisian, never questioning whether the first twenty-seven years of my lived experience might render that task difficult or impossible. I wanted to become French, to speak the language like a native, to dress and to act the part. I learned the right clothes to buy, took a phonetics course to get rid of my American accent, studied the habits of the people, and even began wearing a summer scarf. Incidentally, this approach lies behind most of the books — even the good ones — written about Paris in recent years. They treat the city and its inhabitants as riddles to be solved. One becomes Parisian by hacking a code, by beating a game, by learning ‘secrets’: Parisian women’s secrets for staying thin while consuming a diet filled with animal fat and alcohol, Parisian men’s secrets of seduction, the secrets of Parisian charm, Parisian chic, Parisian savoir être. In the end, I grew tired of the whole exercise, which was really nothing more than a great game of dress-up. My cultural references were all American. My accent was ineradicable. For a time I avoided speaking so as not to ruin the illusion, but even with my mouth shut I gave myself the lie: the clothes never looked as good on me as they did on the models. So I stopped trying. Out of the past ten years, I’ve spent eight not caring about becoming a Parisian. And somewhere along the way, I became a Parisian. I realized that people found my horrid American accent charming. It attracted far more women than the techniques of French seduction I’d tried to ape. Some even told me it was impossibly sexy. My friends cared more about the content of my thoughts than the way they were expressed, and admired the fact that I could communicate them in a language that wasn’t my own. I learned to express myself naturally, without worrying whether my Rs and Us sounded perfect. I found work. I became more deeply integrated into the society of the city and the country. I became a French citizen. I’ve taken the metro to work everyday, complained about the rotten weather, about how dirty, chaotic, and inefficient the city is. I’ve stepped in dog poo many, many times. I’ve dealt with the Parisians’ famously bad attitudes, with their haughty snorts and Gallic shrugs. I’ve been rude, impatient, and generally awful myself when the occasion demanded it. Ten years of experience and travel have taught me that this is neither the best nor the worst city in the world. But in the end, it’s a fine and beautiful place to do all the things that make up a life. I’ve spent a week in the Georges V. I’ve slept on random doorsteps. I’ve been treated to dinner by a homeless alcoholic from Austria (who claims to receive a monthly check from Bob Dylan — and I believe him). I’ve bought dinner for one of the heirs to the Laughing Cow fortune. I’ve been engaged to a former billionaire (the furious Russian girlfriend, who’s now only a millionaire). I’ve known true love — the kind that leaves no doubt (it was neither Alexia nor the former billionaire). And I’ve been called a Parisien de merde in Marseille (a sure sign that my old dream has become a reality). This project is a loose chronicle of that process of becoming, thinly disguised as a guide to appreciating Paris in all its beautiful, ancient, charming, frustrating, modern, and ugly singularity. In any event, some things deserve to be written down and read by others. Time will tell if the anecdotes and observations included here count as such things. The fact that they miraculously escaped annihilation at the hands of the furious Russian ex-billionaire already lends them an air of destiny.. To those who do me the courtesy of reading these pages, I make a solemn promise: I will never dispense advice about arbitrary social codes whose non-observance might make you stand out as a foreigner. Fortunately, France is less absurd in this regard than some other European countries, notably Italy. There, if you order a cappuccino after 11 am someone in your entourage (often an American expat) will make a face and inform you that, “it’s just not done!” I now tell such people that to my knowledge, we have not yet extended personhood to beverages; therefore I have an absolute right to use or abuse the ones I purchase in any way I see fit. Anyone who tells you how you ought to enjoy yourself with your own resources cannot be considered a serious person. The best approach is to humour him and quickly to move on. I will not be that person."

The concern our families and friends express is valid. In spite of these fears and dangers, Black women will (and should) continue to show up and seek the world we are worthy of exploring, but not without eyes wide open. We’re living in a time when some people believe history, particularly the history of enslaved Africans in America, has no bearing on the present day. However, historical context is significant in understanding the origins of insidious stereotypes that accompany racism and how we see them play out every day. In 1962, Malcolm X said: “The most disrespected person in America is the Black woman. The most unprotected person in America is the Black woman. The most neglected person in America is the Black woman.” I would go further and say: The most unprotected, neglected, and disrespected person in the world is the Black woman."

his past September, I had the privilege of spending 5 days in NOLA, a city that boasts a resilient people, mouthwatering cuisine, and the best live jazz music anywhere around. Also home to Xavier University, a prominent Historically Black College and University (HBCU). I’m a Brooklynite, but I first had the pleasure of visiting New Orleans as a 13-year-old, in spring 2006. I was there on a tour of the Lower Ninth Ward to witness firsthand the damage that was caused by two failures — the failure of the levies during Hurricane Katrina, and the failure of our government’s response (or lack thereof) to it’s Black residents. During Katrina, people of the Lower Ninth Ward, predominantly of African descent, were stranded for days — left on rooftops as people watched their neighbors’ bodies float through rivers that were once streets. Around the country, we watched Black bodies desperate for food and water be labeled as “looters,” while White bodies were applauded for their noble efforts in “finding” food. We saw tens of thousands of Black bodies packed into the Mercedes-Benz Superdome in subhuman conditions as part of “relief” efforts. And even now, 14 years post-Katrina, the inequities in the recovery needs of the Lower Ninth Ward, versus more affluent areas of the city, are striking. Nevertheless, American Africans (yes, American Africans) in New Orleans have, like their ancestors before them, persevered and continued to shift and shape the culture of society against all odds. There is no shortage of activities in Black-owned NOLA — a vast hub for the culture."
Medium.com,Life,"Love, Leaving, and New York City",Travel,https://medium.com/@shounakbagchi/love-leaving-and-new-york-city-bd495ad0cfd6?source=topic_page---------239------------------1," As I departed New York after a two year stint, people asked me what I initially desired most out of my time in America’s largest metropolis. I told everyone I simply wanted to fall in love with New York. But even more than that, I wanted New York to fall in love with me. Before I wax on about my time in the Big Apple, let me address the elephant in the room. Leaving New York pieces are now a cultural commodity, a dime a dozen affair. 277 people are leaving New York everyday. As a result, the number of essays chronicling the departure from this city has shot up 400 percent in the past couple of years. Admittedly, these pieces can be an exercise in self-absorbed naivete. Believing that unparalleled transcendent struggle and discovery are confined to a place with high rents and high rises is absent of reality and undoubtedly elitist. I jot these thoughts down noting NYC was not a profoundly transformative period where I feel my soul was reincarnated. Instead, I feel I’ve acquired a valuable Master’s degree in resiliency and determination. The truth is, I never had any desire to be a New Yorker or live the New York City life. The West suited me. I had always envisioned spending my entire life in San Francisco. Early on, the tech douchery wasn’t daunting and the cooler summers were refreshing. My chill squad, fresh produce, low key evenings, and the fill of nature filled my jar of jam. The late nights, lavish lifestyles, concrete jungle, and bone crushing winters offered by SF’s older, more sophisticated East coast sibling never seemed appealing. But like so many New York migrants, life’s unexpected twists and turns placed me in the city that never sleeps. My NYC story began because I rolled the dice and ventured into a new career at 30. Within a New York minute, I was enamored by all of it: the endless supply of international eateries putting all foodcourts to shame, its distinct neighborhood vibes — the soul in Harlem, the remaining grunge in the West Village, the global aura of Queens, the stupid University of Michigan hipsters ruining Brooklyn, and bourgeois of the Upper East Side. I was hooked by the intellectual prowess of so many of its dwellers, its numerous creative outlets, and the fire and spunk encapsulated by a typical native. This was the avenue to dig into my passion for writing, and do so on the biggest stage. There was also the unrivaled potential of spontaneity — during my first Halloween I came home to 5,000 kids trick-or-treating on my block while Juilliard students busted out the instrumental version of the Night Before Christmas soundtrack. An hour later, I met Tony Danza. I wanted the DNA that runs through this city to run through me. The toughness that it takes to tackle the seasons, the thrill of finding your crew that never leaves your hood, and the joy of understanding late night host jokes about the crumbling subway. I didn’t want to be swept away by the magic of the town, I wanted to create and contribute to it. But any shot of infatuation follows with a chaser of reality. Within two weeks of moving, I lost my job and health insurance. Job prospects looked bleak and with no deep network, securing one was an arduous task. As a writer, I submitted over 50 applications for fellowships and programs only to be rejected by 49 (thanks Indian Atheist magazine for your early support). Job offers were extended and then withdrawn. Winters months were spent sporadically shutting down heat; Meals were avoided to save cash. “New York City was a place where you could be frozen to death in the midst of a busy street and nobody would notice.” The hyper hustle and bustle of the city (coupled with other factors) made forming a posse difficult. In a town of nearly 10 million people, I spent my first year feeling isolated and immensely lonely. The original self-perceived vibrant landscape that was filled with an array of experiences and opportunities felt like a distant fictional concept. In Sari Botton, Melissa Febos, Mira Ptacin, and Cheryl Strayed’s collective book Goodbye to All of That: Why Writers Love New York City (and Then Leave It) the group of writers struggle with the question: why do so many risk so much to make it in this city while enduring such an arduous life? (Bob Dylan once said, “New York City was a place where you could be frozen to death in the midst of a busy street and nobody would notice.”) In Ms. Febos’ opinion, many stay because, “New York is an iconic place, and of the symptoms of iconography is that we graft our identities onto that image, while borrowing the certainty of its familiar dimensions.” Others point to the belief that New York can provide an unrivaled ecstasy of positive emotions, infinite titillating conversations, and nirvana-reaching salvation in work and/or love. And the ability to envelope insecurity into one’s ambition. To me, all of that is true. Throngs of good-spirited humans land in NYC with thought out intentions and rational expectations. Many whose ambitions benefit us all. But what attracts so many to trek to this illustrious urban playground is an occupation, an obsession and the ability to firmly latch onto others, and conflate that with love. And what keeps many here is not realizing that none of those capture the true spirit of that feeling. I make no judgements. I was guilty of such thoughts. Believing that finally obtaining my dream job for my dream company, working constantly at my new career path, making a growing number of friends, and more freelance writing opportunities would fill my eternal cup of joy. I was falling into the masochistic trap of trying to personify the epochal stature of the city that birthed Truman Capote, Sinatra, Jon Stewart, and Jay-Z and seen in classic films such as The Apartment, When Harry met Sally, and Breakfast at Tiffany’s. The Godmother of leaving New York essays is Joan Didion. Her 1967 piece titled, Goodbye to All That highlights the literists’ growing and eventually waning love for New York. As she departs it’s clear her time in New York is drained of any meaning. In it Didion muses, “It is easy to see the beginnings of things, and harder to see the ends.” For me, it was the opposite. It was crystal clear it was time to turn a new leaf. It came with the eventual realization that bliss is procured internally, not externally. No loftier resume of accomplishments obtained in New York was going to give me that peace. In my second year, I began to find pleasure in connecting with native New Yorkers who took me in as if I was family, starting mentoring those who wanted to advance their careers, and nights of staying at the office until 2am became less regular. Alone time became a gift. Having the ability to walk through Central Park and take pictures for tourists will always be the best part of my NYC experience. Strolling through one neighborhood to another left me in awe in how quickly America’s biggest city can flip over into a new vibe with a new tribe. How the complexity of such an enormous urban jungle can still feel personal. During this time by myself strutting through the city, I came to the realization that it was time to walk away from all of it. My meaning tank was not emptied, but had been filled to the brim. So, I leave New York with an abundance of love. A discovered deep love and affection for another human being, a greater appreciation and love for those who supported me through thick and thin. And above all, love for all of myself — the warts, the works in progress, and cornerstone components of who I am. None of that would be possible without residing in the cultural Capital of the World. I will always love New York for that."

Medium.com,Life,Adjusting to Your Home Country is no Different than a New Country,Travel,https://medium.com/the-expat-chronicles/adjusting-to-your-home-country-is-no-different-than-a-new-country-5ca4326b9c0f?source=topic_page---------241------------------1," I’ve been home from China for nearly three weeks now. While it hasn’t hit me that I’m not going back to China any time soon yet, there’s one thing that both countries have in common. Adjusting to each place can be difficult. There’s a twelve-hour difference between Michigan and China. No matter which country I go to, I have at least two weeks to adjust to time zones. For both countries, this means I’m in bed insanely early and waking up earlier. If I’m not careful, I look like a zombie for about a week while I adjust. This means I’ve got to be careful about sitting down anywhere cause at any time, I could fall asleep. The only time I’m okay to be sitting down is when I’m eating. I’ve never been so tired that I’ve fallen asleep while eating. Not yet. It makes me want to be lazy in my first week I’m in any country. It’s hard to want to do anything when you never know when you’re going to crash. Two countries. Two appetites. Two food cultures. Everything from adjusting to table manners to different kinds of food, I have to re-adjust when I go to both countries. In America, a lot of the food feels heavy after I eat it, I tend to have a lot of stomachaches after a meal. I’m not sure if it’s what’s being put in the food or the fact there’s way more dairy in the diet than what’s in China. I can taste the sugar with almost every piece of food or drink I consume. The portions are a lot bigger in America than they are in China. I’ve bought a bottle of Coke in America that’s twice the size of one in China. I’ve mostly stopped drinking Coke or any sort of pop since I’ve been back in America. It’s a lot cheaper to buy food in the States than it is in China, so it’s guaranteed that we’re going to be cooking when we have dinner back in the States. I’m usually coming back a bit rusty. When we eat with people in America, table manners are different. You don’t hear people chewing on their food or slurping their soups. We wait until we’ve swallowed our bites of food before we talk. Eating is a mostly quiet affair in the States unless we have a lot to say that day. In China, it’s a different story. The food doesn’t make me feel as gassy as it does in the States. It’s a lot lighter, but I find myself using the bathroom way more. The whole time I was in China, I cooked a few times. It was more convenient to order food from a restaurant. I’m not sure if it was cheaper or not. That’s up for debate. I did end up with a lot of plastic containers, though. The portions are smaller, but there’s also room to eat more food. So there’s more of a variety of food when you’re having a meal in China. I could walk into a restaurant and order two or three dishes. The restaurant people wouldn’t think anything of it. But they would warn me if a meal was bigger than when I thought it was. The table manners are a complete 180 to what I’m used to in the States. Open-mouthed chewing is standard, as well as talking with your mouth full of food. I’ve been told by locals many times how weird it was I ate so quietly. The cost of living in both places is different. I’m currently living in a small town in Northern Michigan, and I feel like a lot of things have a similar cost to Beijing. The cost of food is more expensive in America than in China, but the shampoo and some phone brands are cheaper in America than in China. However, bills in America are more expensive than in China. I paid my electric bill once every spring, and that was it. I didn’t spend more than five dollars on running water either. My phone bill was cheaper in China than in America, too. If I were living in an American city, I’d feel the difference when it came to the cost of living. In China, I was able to live comfortably on one job. I was able to afford to travel whenever I wanted and go out whenever I wanted. Living in Beijing was more convenient than living in Northern Michigan. Maybe the convenience of Beijing made it cheaper than Northern Michigan. It doesn’t matter if you’re moving to a new home or going on vacation, adjusting in any place is hard. It’s a process, but it’s the same in any country you go to. Give yourself at least a week, and anyone can adapt to a new place."

After spending years on the road, I’ve perfected my pack! Gone are the days I hit up the local pharmacy for tiny bottles of what-not that end up in the trashcan after 3 uses. My Zero Waste Travel Kit has all that I previously needed. I’d previously settle for low-grade shampoos and conditioners- things I didn’t regularly use, and would end up in a landfill somewhere in the world after they finished their use in a week or so. We just can’t do that to our planet anymore! So much waste- What are we doing to Mother Gaia? Here’s my secret: 1.) I Sustainable Toothbrush ( I buy mine from Brush with Bamboo) 2.) A bulk-unpackaged Organic Shampoo bar that I use everyday (no need to buy a new one-I use the one that I have in my shower) — I also use this as body soap when I travel 3.) Bulk Conditioner in a small jar. I reuse jars and bottles that I have laying around, and run to a bulk store to fill up. It usually costs ~$2 to do this! The same price as those wasteful pharmacy bottles 4.) Homemade Body and Face Cream (Shea butter for the win!) 5.) Homemade Deodorant (i’ll be posting my recipe soon!) 6.) Reusable Razor — I purchased mine for $4 in Singapore, but you can find them all over the place. 7.) Tiffin containers for leftover food, or to bring your food on the go! I also keep a reusable sandwich bag on hand to fill with trail mix or other snacks 8.) Metal or Bamboo straw and cutlery, usually wrapped in a hanker-chief. I like to bring at least 2 with me, so I always have a clean option. 9.) Cotton Grocery Bag. (Or 2) Shhh….don’t tell anyone- but if i lose my extra bags, I often cut off the sleeves on old teeshirts and sew the hem together. Boom! An instant bag out of a holy teeshirt! I like to carry one or two with me, and sometimes use these as hanker-chiefs if the one that covers my cutlery is dirty. I prefer to keep a few of these handy for purchases throughout the day, or even to carry my dirty laundry in when I’m backpacking. You can’t have too many bags. 10.) Water Bottle and Coffee Cup. I’m addicted to my Hydroflask. I feel a bit like a “VSCO girl” because of how covered in stickers it is, but that thing sure comes in handy! I bring a 24oz bottle with me everywhere, and pair it with a wide-mouth Yeti coffee cup that’s lasted me many trips. Sometimes I even fill my bottle with hot water in the morning so I can have hot tea throughout the day. Along with my essentials list, I also refill small glass bottles with the following: (pro-tip! I use bits of ripped fabric, like the extra sleeves of the teeshirts I use to make grocery bags, to wrap around and keep the bottles from clicking together or breaking in my bag) I put all of these items in the same toiletries case that I’ve used for years.. There is absolutely no need to buy any type of travel case! Whatever you have, try to find something that works, even an older makeup bag works well for me in the past. You might also be able to find a reusable bag at your local thrift store. I guarantee that if you make a sustainable travel kit with even half of these essentials, you’ll easily be able to reduce waste on vacation. Plus, your travels will be just a little (or a lot) less sticky! Happy Travels! Article reposted from https://awaywestray.com/zero-waste-travel-kit/"

Medium.com,Life,No Fixed Abode: Quitting Home Ownership,Travel,https://medium.com/@nikki_almond/no-fixed-abode-quitting-home-ownership-7ceb63fd92a2?source=topic_page---------248------------------1," A little over a year ago, I quit my job, sold my home and gave away 99% of my possessions so that I could travel the world. It was the most exciting thing I’ve ever done. To me, quitting a great job was very scary (No more income! A large gap in my employment history! Burning bridges right, left & centre! Throwing away a fabulous career!) but I’ve come to realise that for most people, that isn’t the scary part. The thing that everyone asks about — the part that they can’t quite get their heads around — is that I don’t have anywhere to live. In New Zealand (as in many other countries) we are brought up with the idea that owning your own home is one of the key benchmarks for success in life. For reasons I can’t entirely recall, I was fixated on the idea of buying my first house before I turned 30. So, that’s what I did — in 2010 I became the proud owner of a four-bedroom home, mortgaged up to the eyeballs and being slowly driven insane by the banana-yellow walls in every single room (this is how we managed to afford a four-bedroom house on a modest income. Some idiot had painted the entire house in a shade of yellow so violent it induced headaches in most people within minutes). It was nice. We repainted the house until it was actually quite pleasant. We planted things in the gardens (most of which died). We bought nice things to put in our nice house. We made friends with the neighbours and joined the library and complained about how the council was spending our rates money. We were proper home owners, just like we’d wanted. It was nice. Later, we moved to Auckland (one of the world’s least affordable cities for housing) and took out a scarily enormous mortgage so that we could be the proud owners of a very small, slightly shabby 1960s bungalow in the suburbs. It was damp. It was mouldy in places. It smelled a bit like a rest home. It cost a ridiculous amount of money. But we owned property in a city where most people find it very, very difficult to get into the housing market. We had a foot on the bottom of a very tall ladder, if you will. It was still nice. But the thing is, a house is just a house. It’s nice to have a home to keep your things in (I do love a good bookcase) and to have the security of owning your own little piece of the world, but was it really worth it? Most of my paycheque went to the bank every week, just to cover the interest payments on our mortgage. The rates bill was another big chunk of change every few months, as well as insurance and water bills and power bills and general maintenance — when your home is older than you are, parts of it tend to break from time to time.
Yes, it was nice to own a home but it meant that there was no money or time left for the things that make life wonderful — travelling; eating and drinking with friends; reading and writing and creating art; just doing the things that you love to do. After we separated, my ex-husband moved into his own place and the mortgage payments became an even bigger chunk of my income. All of a sudden, it just didn’t seem worth it any more. So we sold the house and split the proceeds and when it came time to sink my share into another house, I just didn’t want to do it any more.
Instead I resigned my job, gave away all of my stuff and bought some plane tickets for the overseas trip I’d always dreamt of. I read recently that the two most important things in life are experiences and relationships. I firmly believe that when most of us come to the end of our lives, these are the two things we’ll wish we’d spent more time and money on: Home ownership was nice, but it never brought meaning to my life in the way that travelling does. Still, I expected to feel a little panicky once the house was sold. The funny thing is that selling the house felt nothing but great. It was like I hadn’t noticed that I’d been carrying a weight around with me and once it was gone, everything looked brighter. People worry when I say this. I think they may have some concerns for my mental health (not necessarily unwarranted). It’s so hard-wired into us that we need somewhere to live that it seems a little strange not to have somewhere you can call home. But honestly, hand on heart, I don’t miss it for a second. It has to be said that I’m without a home by choice. I am not for a second suggesting that the homeless people of the world are in some way better off — when you lose a home that you love or when you can’t put a roof over the head of your loved ones or you’re forced to live in your car because you have nowhere else, that is a very different scenario. I’m just saying that for many of us, we put so much of our time and energy (and money) into owning something that ultimately makes us feel worse. While travelling, I’ve camped out in tents and in my car (it was a large 4WD with a bed in the back, so not exactly roughing it), I’ve slept next to campfires under the stars. I’ve stayed in beautiful homes while housesitting. I’ve stayed in hostels ranging from the surprisingly comfortable to absolute hovels. I’ve stayed in staff accommodation while volunteering and in Airbnb rooms and in hotels. I’ve even spent a few nights in airports.
What I’ve learned is that sleep is probably the least interesting thing you can do in a day. Ultimately, it doesn’t really matter where you sleep as long as you’re warm and moderately comfortable, and for me, missing out on the comforts of home is well & truly outweighed by the excitement of going somewhere new and doing something different every day. I do not miss owning a home. I have no plans to go back to it any time soon. But there are a few things that make this lifestyle a little challenging. It’s not for everyone. While I might come across as a somewhat maniacal preacher telling people to give up all of their possessions, that’s not really my intention. Own your own home? That’s fantastic. Renting a home that you love? That’s great too. Feeling trapped by your commitments to an enormous mortgage and a house you don’t really value? Maybe then you could think about making a change. For now, I’m going to continue travelling with no fixed abode for as long as I possibly can, enjoying every second of it."
Medium.com,Life,An 8000-Year-Old Harvest,Travel,https://medium.com/@xquintana94/an-8000-year-old-harvest-f0b0baa2623e?source=topic_page---------249------------------1," The country of Georgia has been popping up in headlines quite often these days. Whether it is articles from various publications hailing the small country nestled in the Caucasus as the latest ‘undiscovered’ travel destination, or the June 21st protests that made waves in international coverage as the country thumbed its nose at Putin’s imperialism earlier this year, Georgia has been garnering more attention than in years past. A lot of the attraction from the traveling community is well-deserved: all things considered, it’s an all-around great travel destination. Whether it’s the unique, hospitable culture, delicious food and wine, or the numerous opportunities for outdoor activities within the towering Caucasus, Georgia is a great place for any kind of traveler to spend their holiday. Typically, one of the first things mentioned when discussing the country’s culture is wine. Archaeologists have discovered evidence of wine production extending back eight thousand years at a dig site just twenty miles south of Tbilisi, Georgia’s increasingly-bustling capital. This means that the Georgians have been honing their craft for a long, long time. Although places like France and Sonoma still have the big-name recognition in terms of wine production, it is Georgia where one can go to get a real sense of just how much wine is an intrinsic part of the culture. While Georgia was indeed the major wine-producing region of the Soviet Union, this should be considered just a minor footnote in Georgia’s overall winemaking history. Emphasis on mass-production saw traditional winemaking methods fall to the wayside as many of Georgia’s 526 grape varieties were eschewed in favor of just a handful of high-yielding, hardier species of grapes. It’s straightforward enough to get a taste of this tradition at many of Tbilisi’s restaurants and wine bars, but to really get a feel for what wine in Georgia is all about, it is better to head straight to the source. There’s a lot of options, to say the least. Georgia has numerous wine regions including Imereti and Racha in the western part of the country. However, Kakheti, the largest region of the wine-producing regions, tends to be the most well-known and possesses sixty percent of Georgia’s vineyards. Bigger doesn’t necessarily mean better in this case, there are some fantastic things happening anywhere Georgian wine is being produced. However, it was Kakheti where I found myself heading to participate in the last days of the grape harvest with a local family. To earn the requisite traveler street-cred, I originally wanted to stretch the truth a bit and claim that this all happened spontaneously. However, that isn’t exactly true. I’ve been living in Georgia since May, and ever since I arrived, I have been harassing nearly every local that I’ve come across who was unwise enough to try to befriend me if they knew anyone who’s family happened to produce wine and how I could join them in the act once harvest time came around. Despite all of my searching, nothing materialized and I was left with little choice besides hitching the two-hour ride from Tbilisi to Kakheti and knocking on village front doors until someone felt brave enough to risk the quality of their wines by letting an unskilled foreigner fumble around with their grapes. Months passed, and I still hadn’t had much luck. Fall began to wander its way into the country, gently ushering away a mild summer. I was beginning to panic. I still hadn’t found anything, and I knew indirectly that the two-ton Soviet-era Kamaz trucks were already firing up to make their runs to and from vineyard to wine factory. However, through a random stroke of luck, I received a message on Instagram from a friend of a friend who had heard secondhand information about my plight. Her family was originally from a village in Kakheti, and there was going to be a gathering for the last day of the harvest. I didn’t hesitate for a second, and soon I was stuffed in a full car, speeding on my way out of the city towards the city of Sighnaghi. Although Georgia is a fairly small country that can be crossed in as little as five or six hours depending on the gumption of your particular driver, there is still an impressive amount of regional diversity. Despite the fact that there’s little to indicate when you’ve crossed the border from one region to the next, it is often, visually at least, apparent enough. Heading east from Tbilisi, one can assume they have passed into Kakheti based on the presence of increasingly dense vineyards. Pork is a big part of Kakhetian cuisine, and this is reflected by the butchers seen displaying their wares on the sides of the main highway. Side note: if you find yourself taking this road yourself. I recommend making a stop-off at the roadside town of Sagarejo. There are numerous bread and cheese vendors alongside the main drag, and based on the number of stopped cars alongside the road (all Georgian, I might add) it can be assumed that this is, in fact, some good stuff. Maybe its something in the water. I’m certainly no expert, but I single-handedly completely devoured a toddler-sized loaf of piping-hot Georgian bread and half a wheel of salty cheese before our hour and a half commute had finished Pick up some local cheese and tonis puri yourself and see what you think. You won’t be disappointed, and you certainly won’t have to worry about traveling on an empty stomach. After picking up a half a bakery’s worth of bread, a few more wheels of aforementioned-cheese, and a couple of kilos of ax-chopped-to-order pork ribs, it seemed like we had loaded up on all the necessities required to make up our contribution towards the evening’s feast. We arrived in the village of Vakiri, nestled under the shadow of the scenic red-tiled town of Sighnaghi. There are some similarities with harvest season no matter which part of the world you’re in, and our hosts in Vakiri were certainly no exception. Orderly chaos prevailed throughout the house, with barrels of new homemade wine taking up more than their fair share of space on the patio and cellar, jars of pelamushi, condensed grape juiced, arranged in an orderly yet tiptoe-inducing pattern taking up most of the space in the atrium, and various garden products, most of them grapes, waiting to be processed into forms more conducive for winter storage. After a short coffee break, we all piled into the car again and made our way to the family vineyard. Only a select few vineyards seem to be located directly off of the main road. What seems to be the usual case is a surprising amount of off-roading being required to get to your particular vineyard of choice. This is usually accomplished by a vehicle that was not manufactured with the intent of ever leaving a paved road, and the drive is often enhanced by the constant curses being muttered by whoever pulled the short straw and has to make the drive in their car. After doing some probably irreparable damage to the bottom of the car, we parked the car and quickly got to work. The usual system, at least from what I’ve seen, is a fairly egalitarian working party consisting of whoever happens to be available for work in the villages proximal to the vineyard. You have your designated pickers, armed with a pair of pliers and two buckets each, and a team of runners, usually younger boys. One the pickers have filled their buckets, they holler down the vine to one of the boys, who collects the full bucket and empties it into any number of possible vessels at a predetermined pickup point. In my relatively short harvest tenure, I saw everything from large plastic bags, to tarps, to more ‘sophisticated’ harvest boxes being utilized. However, since we were just the cleanup crew, we did all of the picking and bucket-running ourselves. There’s a lot of tough field jobs out there, but in comparison, grape harvesting is relatively relaxing. The vines are (usually) waist-to-chest height, meaning there’s little need for reaching or stooping. Additionally, the working parties of Kakhetians make it hardly seem like work at all. They bring energy and boisterousness to their work, hooting and hollering and cracking jokes at each other’s expense. Time passes quickly in the vineyard, and before you know it, you’ve collected more grapes than it seems possible to drive back home. Next, the grapes need to be transported back to where they are going to be processed. Our smaller-scale operations only necessitate a shuddering forty-year-old Lada with a dinky wagon attached to the rear. Larger operations typically make use of the aforementioned Kamaz trucks, which can carry up to four tons of grapes a time. For other wineries, anything in between is fair game as long as it gets the grapes from Point A to Point B. We arrive back at the house and take another short break before the next phase of work begins. The juice must be separated from the grapes that contain them. There’s a number of ways to accomplish this. Even those most philistine to the world of wine (read: me before coming to Georgia) generally can conjure up an image of people stomping grapes for hours at a time in order to displace liquid from solid. For ages, this was the technique used in Georgia, called satsnakheli, done by men in a hollowed-out half of a log. It is assumed that some form related to the human foot, does an efficient job of pressing the juice outwards without getting too much leftover grape particulate matter in the end product. Now, as far as actual wineries are concerned, the work is usually handled by surprisingly well-functioning Italian destemming machines, which keep juice, skins, seeds, and pulp all together, which is a crucial element for producing Georgian-style wine. Some traditionalists might wag their finger at this, but honestly, I prefer less farm-worker foot-funk in my wines. Of course, you’re more than welcome to have your own opinion on this. Our smaller family operation utilizes an ancient-looking hand-cranked pulverizing machine. I tried to get the name for it, but I was just told the same general word for pressing grapes (Satsnakheli). Either way, this thing was damn heavy and had probably been seeing action for the duration of several Soviet premierships. The grapes are lifted into a basket, and the rusty handle is cranked as the grapes are pulverized and sent to the plastic drum which will be their home for the next few months. I take a few attempts at cranking the handle of myself, but I’m unable to figure out the intricacies of the gear-system, and I’m soon gently ushered back to heaving bags of grapes from the trailer. After doing this in a few different settings, this seems to be the most difficult part of the process, as you’re already pretty worn out from picking grapes in the heat all day, only to have to turn around and proceed to lift and dump every gram of the surprisingly heavy boxes of grapes that you’ve picked thus far into your processing contraption of choice. Also, it should be noted that while we were using plastic drums to ferment our wine, the traditional Georgian method utilizes qvevri, which are clay amphora of various sizes, some of which can sometimes be up to two meters tall and contain up to 15,000 liters of wine. Finally, the day’s work is finished and it is time to celebrate the end of the harvest. While the pulverizing team has been busy, the rest of the household set to work assembling a table spread worthy of a lord. An important dish to mention is what happened to the aforementioned pork. The Kakhetian tradition requires them to be grilled over dried grape twigs and stems, which are first burned to size in a comically huge fire before they are reduced to coals and suitable for grilling the meat. The result is exactly as delicious as it seems. I’m all for using as much seasoning as possible no matter which cut of meat is being utilized or which animal it happens to come from, but the fresh pork here is flavorful enough to stand almost completely on its own, aside from a small dash of salt that’s applied prior to grilling, and the pomegranate seeds and juice that are added as a garnish directly before serving. The sizzling meat is pried off of the skewers with a handy piece of bread, it seems like the rest of the work in the kitchen has finished up, and now the only thing left to do is eat. In accordance with yet another Georgian tradition of supra, or feast, we start the meal with the first of many toasts. Allegedly, there’s a specific order to how these toasts ought to be made, but each time that I’ve been told this, the order never seems to be the same. The usual candidates tend to be to family, to the guests, to Georgia, to women, to God, and so on, followed by an exclamation of “Gaurmarjos!”, and draining your glass of wine to the bottom. Eventually, the homemade wine that I’ve been nursing ever since we returned from the fields begins to take its toll. Despite my stubborn insistence to not be the first one to turn in for the night, I simply can’t keep up with the heroic alcohol tolerance of the Georgians. Counting my losses, I figure it better to admit defeat relatively early on rather than potentially humiliate myself from trying to maintain the same pace as those I find myself sharing a table with. I slip away from the festivities, leaving the revelers to continue their festivities until the wee hours of the morning."

The accent was almost perfect, the delivery immediate and flawless. It was only five words, five words in the course of a day that was supposed to span nearly half the globe, one that included two delayed flights out of Barcelona, two missing pieces of luggage, and an impossible connection time in Paris. It was five words and in less than two hours, I would lose that little person speaking French in Charles de Gaulle International Airport: my 11-year-old son. Sprinting back and forth along Terminal 2E, I yelled his name over and over as the heads of nervous and concerned travelers followed me from their moving sidewalks. “Oliver!” I yelled at the top of my lungs, “OLIVER!!!” hoping my voice would carry into every nook and cranny of this huge terminal. But there was no Oliver to be seen, no Oliver in the corridors that we’d just raced through moments earlier, no Oliver on the moving sidewalks he loves to race up and down whenever he has the chance. There was no Oliver anywhere. He was lost. We were both lost. Change takes place in the little moments, when camera phones are the last thing on our mind."
Medium.com,Life,The Untapped Potential of Tourism in Pakistan Should Remain Untapped.,Travel,https://medium.com/@hatim.mustafa91/the-untapped-potential-of-tourism-in-pakistan-should-remain-untapped-16b939445bd3?source=topic_page---------251------------------1," Call me a cynic for I was glad when water sports were banned along the coastlines of Pakistan indefinitely, albeit due to security risks. Call me a cynic for I do not want the north to be easily accessible by the masses. Call me a cynic for I do not want us to have our vacations at the expense of Mother Nature. Call me a cynic, for I want the untapped potential of tourism in Pakistan to remain untapped. Pakistan, perhaps is the only country to be blessed with countless tourism opportunities compared to its land mass. From the corals of the Arabian sea, to the precipitous peaks of Karakohram. From the deserts of Cholistan to the serene valleys of Kashmir. From the pristine beaches of Gwadar, to the highest alpine plains of Deosai. From the salt mines of Khewra, to the gem mines of Baltistan. Pakistan has been bestowed with everything that Mother Nature had to offer. And if the natural beauty does not satiate your touristic drive, Pakistan is one of the most culturally diverse country in the world, each with its own history, language, tradition, food and customs. Our history spans from the Indus valley civilization, trespasses through the era of Alexander, goes through the introduction of Islam to the subcontinent, the rule of the Mughals — which gave us some of the most aesthetically appealing Islam architecture in modern history, the colonial rule and then the great struggle for independence in the early 20th century. We Pakistanis do not need to start exploring the world till we explore our own country. Pakistan is a world in its own. By no means do I want to demote the tourism industry of Pakistan. Tourism is a source of revenue for our economy, tourism serves as an ambassador of our country’s image, tourism employs millions across Pakistan, tourism promotes trade — in fact many of the touristic attractions lie across the old silk route which was formed on the basis of trade across the sub-continent and in-land China. However, over the last one decade, I have personally witnessed the deterioration of these sites. The aquatic life is not the same as it was a decade ago. The forests have thinned down as the deforestation rate has gone up due to an increase in demand for construction and fire wood in the northern areas. Snow line has receded due to global warming, glaciers are melting due to increasing temperatures. While these are all causalities of global disturbances; population increase, global warming, increased carbon dioxide concentration in our oceans, we have not been very sustainable about our tourism industry either. Which is why I would want the untapped potential of tourism in Pakistan to remain untapped. I still remember the days of Adventure Foundation Pakistan. The first tour company that ran on purely non-profit basis, organised private tours and treks, it was all sustainable. We were given briefings on the itinerary, travel etiquette, respect for local customs, respect for the group, and most importantly respect for the environment and wildlife. Adventure Foundation Pakistan was truly promoting sustainable tourism in Pakistan. But it all got out of control when social media gave rise to countless tourism companies that takes hoards of people, without any regulation, without any briefing, without any sensitization towards the local community. The disappointing aspect, most tour operators themselves do not have the appreciation of sustainable tourism, for them this is a profitable business, little do they know, they are burning their own business future for short-term goals. This has led to a domino effect, every year, more people travel up north increasing the demand for accommodation and food. The increase in demand for accommodation has led to an increase in demand for construction wood. An increase in demand for construction wood has led to uncontrolled deforestation. It is not just the trees that we are killing rampantly. We are not too kind with the animal kind either. While trophy hunting may be good for the animal species in the longer run, if you allow the practice of hunting, there will be areas where regulations will not reach. Coming over to what we leave behind. No, we just do not leave footprints and take pictures. We leave more than just our footprints. What baffles me, if you can carry the packaged snacks all the way up, why can not people make the little effort of bringing back the empty wrapper. It does not require much effort. Plastic pollution is not just limited to up-north, it is prevalent all across the country. The Karachi Clifton beach made headlines when used syringes and medical waste , that should ideally be incinerated, was dumped on the beach. Which is not only a threat to the environment but also the people who may get in contact with this waste."
Medium.com,Life,Ladakh Monasteries,Travel,https://medium.com/@amytrumpeter/ladakh-monasteries-b551c00f0da9?source=topic_page---------252------------------1," Located in the Northernmost part of India (Jammu and Kashmir) and bordering with China, Ladakh is the perfect spot for two main things — landscapes and monasteries (called gompa in Ladakh). It’s an ex-Buddhist Kingdom that is home to picturesque Tibetan monasteries set in Himalayan backdrops. Contrary to media hype, it’s generally safe to travel to Ladakh. The best way to get there is by plane flying into Kushok Bakula Rimpochee Airport located in Leh. You can take an internal flight from Delhi and it takes around an hour and a half. The road trip from Delhi is long — approximately 24 hours straight with many roads inaccessible (it’s only reallypossible by road between June and September), so is not really advisable as flights are cheap (often less than $50!) Mid May to July is the best time to go to Ladakh, because the snow has melted (this starts in April) and the weather is milder. Roads are easier to travel and beautiful landscapes are revealed. Temperatures in tourist season are generally around 16 degrees. In high season, there can be a lot of tourists in Ladakh, and so visit the main monasteries in the late afternoon or early evening to avoid the crowds. Built during the rule of the King Singge Namgyal, Hemis is one of the largest and most popular monasteries in Ladakh. It is also one of the richest Buddhist monasteries in Tibet and Leh and shares its origin with an Indian Buddhist who attained enlightenment here named Naropa. A huge attraction of Hemis Monastery is the 12m long Thanka- which is largest in Ladakh and the Hemis Festival (celebrated during June-July). The festival is best known for masked dance performances, dedicated to Lord Padmasambhava. Thiksey is one of the beautiful Buddhist monasteries in Ladakh, resembling the Potala Palace in Lhasa, Tibet. At an altitude of over 11,000 feet, it is looked after by the people of Gelugpa sect. It comprises a 12-storey building complex and houses more than 500 monks. Thiksey monastery has a precious and large collection of Buddhist journals, books, statues, scripts, Thangka paintings and swords. It also has a 49 ft statue of Maitreya Buddha which is the largest in entire Ladakh. There are a massive amount Ladakh monasteries to stopover at and this is one of the best. Situated in the beautiful Nubra Valley, Diskit is up there as one of the most picturesque and oldest Buddhist monasteries in Ladakh, as it was founded in the 14th century by Changzem Tsera Zangpo. It belongs to the Gelugpa sect of Tibetan Buddhism and possesses multiple Buddha statues, pictures of guardian Gods, and a massive drum. Due to the spectacular setting, this one of the well-known monasteries in Ladakh and it offers inner peace and solemn serenity. The Festival of Scapegoat is held here, along with the Jampa Buddha statue. Likir Monastery, popular as Likir Gompa was founded by Lama Duwang Chosje in the 14th century. It is situated 53 km west of Leh in the Indus Valley in Likir village. Buddhist mythology states that this is the first construction made by Tibetan monks and the museum found inside the monastery showcases a large array of Tibetan relics and artefacts. The Likir Dosmoche Festival takes place on the 12th month of Tibetan Calendar, along with the preaching of Pratimoksha disciplines. Spituk Monastery was founded by Od-Ide in the 11th century. Today it is home to a hundred monks. Spituk has three-chapels namely Stok, Sankar and Saboo and consists of ancient memorials, idols, frescoes, statues and religious scriptures. 11 km from the main town of Leh and 3.4 km from Leh Airport, it is located in Spituk village. A temple dedicated to Vajrabhairava Deity is in this Monastery, which accessible to visitors only during Gustor Festival and sacred idol of Amitayus. Locally known as Tiger’s Nose, Stakna is a serene yet small monastery, established during the reign of King Jamyang Namgyal in the 16 thcentury. Found perched on a hill on the left bank of Indus River, the monastery in has jaw-dropping and astounding views of the valley. By the banks of Indus River, 25 km from Leh, Stakna can be visited by boarding a local bus. It is a Buddhist monastery which houses idols, Buddhist scriptures and numerous paintings and has many equivalent monasteries like in Stakrimo, Sani and Zanskar-Bardan. In the monastery, there is the Statue of Arya Avaloketesvara, Dukhang Assembly Hall with paintings of Sakyamuni, Tsephakmad, and Amchi, silver gilded chorten with Buddha picture and paintings of Bodhisattva, Tshong-san-Gompa, and Padma Sambhava. Alchi Choskor Monastery is a branch of Likir raised by Lotsawa Rinchen Zangpo. It is one of the most reputed and biggest monasteries of Ladakh. Its complex comprises of three sections- Dukhang, Sum-tsek, and the temple of Manjushri. Unlike others, Alchi is located on a plain land and boasts of ancient sculptures, books, paintings, and figurines. To reach this age-old monastery, travel towards the banks of Indus River off Srinagar road for 70 km. Key attractions consist of Sum-tsek- three-story temple, four-armed huge Bodhisattva statue, white Avalokiteshvara statue, an idol of Maitreya Buddha, and Jampe Lhakhang Temple. Phyang Gompa belongs to the red hat sect of Buddhism and is perhaps the most impressive monastery in Leh Ladakh. As it is found on a hilltop, it provides incredible views of the surrounding. This white coloured structure is a must-visit monastery in Ladakh and is an major hub of teachings of Digung. At Phyang Gompa, the wall paintings portray Buddhist heritage and culture. There is a 900-year old museum depicting thangkas, different idols, Mongolian, Tibetan and Chinese weaponry and guns, Gang-Sngon Tsedup Festival, and the Sacred Dance Festivals. Found in Ladakh’s Sakti Village, this is the only monastery of the tradition of Nyingmapa. It houses close to 55 lamas and it is one of the most famous monasteries in Ladakh. It retains an astounding architectural style with central courtyard, rocky roofs and walls, assembly hall, murals, beautiful frescos and the holy throne of Dalai Lama. The 108 volumes of Kandshur teachings of Buddha are preserved here. Key attractions of Takthok Monastery is the meditation cave of Padmasambhava and Statues of Future Buddha, Dorje and Takposal. The reasons why you should visit this monastery are plenty. The monastery presently houses the biggest statue of Buddha made of gold, around the height of three floors of a building. There is also a wax bowl in front of the statue that is lit for a year before it is swapped with the new one. The beautiful murals and paintings adorn the walls of the monastery. And, remember the Rancho School that became famous after the movie 3 idiots? Well, it is near the monastery. The best attractions of Shey Monastery include the large golden Buddha statue, Rancho School, Buddhas carved out of rock. Do cover up or dress conservatively when visiting Ladakh Monasteries. Long sleeved T-shirts are better than vest tops and cotton walking trousers are better than shorts — the weather in Ladakh will not be that warm anyway (around 16 degrees). Pack a sarong like scarf which can be used for many purposes including covering up for monasteries and shielding your head from the sun in India. Essential items for visiting the Ladakh Monasteries include decent walking boots (make sure that they fit properly and break them in before your trip) and a good quality water/windproof jacket. Lip Balm should be packed as lips can get chapped on mountain treks. Packing biking gloves if you intend do do any biking — Ladakh is a popular region for this.

Medium.com,Life,The First Bed and Breakfast,Travel,https://medium.com/@dianablackkennedy/the-first-bed-and-breakfast-9cdfe964a1f9?source=topic_page---------255------------------1," So, my eldest sister Annie had been doing all these web searches about places to stay in Rome during our upcoming trip and sending me little helpful hints like, “Oh, this one looks great, although there are only two more rooms left,” and, “Gosh, this one used to be cheaper, but it is still a good bargain.” Meanwhile, I was so distracted with everything else going on in my life, I could barely remember we were going on a trip. When I came up for a breath and checked the calendar, I was shocked to see that we were going to be in Rome — and in need of a place to stay — in exactly two weeks. Pressure set in, and I moved “book a room” to the top of my endless to-do list. I checked out a few of the links Annie had sent me, and they looked charming, but more expensive than I had hoped for. I discovered that you can sort the search for rooms on the Lonely Planet website by price, and after rejecting the idea of camping (only after imagining how hard Annie would try to seem excited by the idea), I started searching B & B’s. I sifted through all sorts of places that looked too far away or too small before I found one “500 feet from the Rome Termini train station,” with lovely, high windows and “a quiet courtyard,” for less than a hundred dollars a night. Done and done. Delighted to have somewhere to stay for at least the first week of travel, I went to bed, relieved and imagining taking coffee and reading a guidebook in a lovely Italian courtyard. Cut to two weeks later. Annie and I finally figure out where to get the train from the airport to the Termini station, only mildly disturbed by the smell of urine wafting up from the stairs as we wait, and undaunted by the two super-human sized steps that we have to wrestle our bags up to board the train (ok, we are a little daunted, but we get the bags up anyway).

Jet-lagged and exhausted, I check the map on the iPhone as we drink our first caffé freddos at the Termini. I am thrilled to realize that we are, in fact, within a block or two of our B & B, and, despite Annie’s reluctance to struggle more with the bags, I decide we are close enough to walk.

We start to drag our bags down the cobblestone sidewalk (more charming than practical, especially with rolling suitcases). I see that the graffiti surrounding the station ends just one long block away, and guess that ours, n 199, is the first building up there. We drag our bags over the stones, Annie’s purple duffle sliding off its perch on her rollie bag, causing it to spin around and slap the back of her knee every five steps, and both of us dripping sweat. I keep looking at the street numbers to cheer us on. And then.

This. Cannot. Be the place. I look towards the part of the street that gets better, that has no graffiti and where the loitering crowds thin. I look back up to the door with our number on it. Covered in graffiti. Right next door to a liquor store. Surrounded by about fifteen men sharing a big bottle of what looks to be the Italian equivalent of a Michelob. There is one moment when I know this is the place but Annie doesn’t yet. I look back at her struggling to catch up and try to think fast. She catches up and follows my gaze. I get out the iPhone and check the address again. “Maybe the n means north, and there’s a different block in the other direction?” I hazard. Annie answers with a skeptical look. “So. Um. What should we do?” “I don’t think we should stay here,” says my sensible older sister. I am still holding out hope. “It does say ‘quiet courtyard.’ Maybe the B&B is towards the back where the courtyard is?” Another skeptical look. I try calling, but no answer. “Well, should we at least look, in case?” Annie assents. She must really love me. To get there, we must cross three lanes of traffic in front of a right turn lane without a light. The closest crosswalk is a long block away and we are dragging that damn luggage. We search for an opening in the traffic through our jetlag fog. “We can’t cross here. We’ll die.” A brusque, middle-aged man in a suit strides up, past us and into the street, barely pausing to motion and call, “Corso” or some such word I take to mean “Cross,” or, more accurately, “Cross with me, you frightened, hesitant tourists who are clearly lost in Roman traffic and will be stuck on the wrong side of the rode forever if I do not save you like a mother duck must save her hatchlings.” Annie and I put our heads down and try to keep up with him, ignoring our almost certain death by vespa and smart car zooming around the corner. Once across, our temporary savior gone, we drag our luggage up the outside flight of stairs. Towards the top, we weave around the patrons of the liquor store, who stare at us, not in a threatening way, just in a confused, “Um, what are you two white female tourists doing on our steps?” kind of way. We ring the bell and are told to come up to the third floor. There is a small lift in the center of the winding stairs, but it doesn’t seem to work. I go up to reconnoiter and Annie stays downstairs with the bags, mopping sweat from her face. I walk into the pantry-sized lobby. No one is there. I wander out and an older Asian woman smiles and points out to the corridor, whence a young Asian man, maybe a teenager, enters. He looks up my reservation. “I hate to be…I mean…I have to ask. Is this place safe?” I falter. “You mean inside here or outside?” I smile for a beat and realize he is serious. He adds, “This is in the middle of downtown.” Oh. I ask if we can take the lift to the room because of our bags, and he says, “Do you want me to move the mop water, ’cause I could, if you want.” I push my bag in front of me and wedge in as close as I can so that Annie and her bag can fit. Once in, I cannot turn around, so Annie reaches around my waist and pushes the button. Pause. Lurch. Up we go. We grab for balance when the lift comes to an abrupt stop, but get out safe to see the room. Annie collapses onto a dirty chair and asks if we can turn on the air conditioner. Our host flips a switch. “Does it crank up any higher than that?” asks Annie. He assures us that soon it will be cool. This time, we both look skeptical. When he leaves us alone to discuss the room, I realize I do recognize the windows. They just hadn’t looked so close to the door in the picture. I sit down harder than I mean to on one of the twin beds because it is about half as high as I expect it to be. Plywood. “I guess that little area parallel to the lift storing all the corrugated roofing must be the ‘quiet courtyard,’” I say, picturing the grey sky light above the odd, narrow, multi-floor empty space. “At first, it looked like a place for squatters or something.” We catch our breath and look around. I never realized you could call an unfinished interior space a courtyard. “Hey,” my sister rouses herself to ask, “I saw 888 scrawled on the door. Is that some gang thing or something?” “Maybe. But it’s also a good omen in Chinese.” “I guess someone needed all the luck they could muster around here…Kind of a call for help, really.” “So. What should we do?” I ask after a while, still hoping to salvage something about the reservation. Maybe just a first night? “If we stay here, we won’t be able to go out to dinner, because we can’t walk through that mess of men after dark.” A fair point. We go to the desk where our young host is waiting. He tries to convince us that we must at least pay for a first night, whether we stay or not, because that is the policy. “And lots of people wanted the room and we turned them down because you had the reservation.” More skepticism. “But the pictures on the web didn’t show graffiti.” “We never took pictures of the outside.” “How about this. You have our deposit. I won’t write a scathing review and let’s call it even.” “We don’t get your deposit. The web site does. We don’t even have your credit card number. They do.” “Oh.” We are out of there as fast as the decrepit little lift can take us. We go back to the Termini, have another caffé freddo (and receive a firm warning from the cafe owner about pickpockets and showing your money) and call the first place Annie’s travel book described as, “charming” and “highly recommended.” I don’t even ask about the price. By now, it will be worth it."
Medium.com,Life,Walking 500 Miles Across Spain,Travel,https://medium.com/@lensofjen/walking-500-miles-across-spain-2010e2635522?source=topic_page---------256------------------1," And stumbling on life goals When I quit my job and packed my first suitcase in June of 2018, I assured my family, my friends, and myself, that after a four-month trip to Europe, I would return to the world of responsible adulting. Back then, I was engulfed in grief after my partner died, and I was unable to envision a future for myself. All of my dreams for a family, a dog, a porch with a view, seemed ripped right out of my hands. In my worst moments, I wondered whether it was wise to even plan for a future, given that my fiancé was just 40 years old when esophageal cancer abruptly ended all of his hopes and dreams. As I wandered in my grief fog through Chicago’s O’Hare Airport, I had no idea that I was wheeling my suitcase into a nomadic lifestyle. Or that four months would turn into 15 months, 21 countries and 66,353 miles traveled by way of 39 trains, 37 flights, nine buses, five ferries, four cars — and one very long walk. It was that very long walk that inspired me to plan for a future again. During the hazy, wine-soaked grieving period when I first started traveling, the idea of walking 500 miles seemed crazy. Especially since the Camino de Santiago is traditionally a Christian pilgrimage that involves walking over an actual mountain range from France all the way to Santiago de Compostela in northwestern Spain. I am not religious and, at the time I decided to set out on this adventure, it had been double-digit years since I had camped, just as long since I had slept in a room with bunk beds (except for that one time in Bratislava, but that’s a whole other story), and I hadn’t hiked more than 10 miles in…ever. But walking the Camino is one of those bucket-list things that nomads talk about while listening to live music in a Scottish pub or checking into a Thai monastery for three-days of silent meditation. As I met more and more people who had walked the Camino, all who without fail called the experience “life-changing,” I started to feel drawn to the idea. People say that the Camino calls you when the time is right. With that in mind, I kept the walk in the back of my mind as I bounced around Europe, Asia, and the United States, knowing that it was an adventure that I probably wouldn’t embark upon. Then I picked up one of the 400 books that my partner left behind on his bookshelf, a Paulo Coelho book called “The Pilgrimage,” and as I thumbed through those pages about walking the Camino, I knew that I was going to strap on a backpack and walk those 500 miles. I guess I just felt called. It’s amazing how simple life becomes when you have everything that you need on your back. I mean, the first 10 days were a bit more complicated. My body screamed at me with every step and, though I saved money by staying in the bunk beds of Alburgues — very affordable accommodations set up along the route for pilgrim hospitality — I practically maxed out my credit card at the farmacias of northern Spain buying any blister relief I could get my hands on. But soon my body settled into the reality of walking 10 to 22 miles every day, the physical pain eased, and suddenly life’s hard questions seemed to have simple answers. Another saying on the Camino is that the first third of the walk is about the body, the second third is about the mind, and the last third is about the soul. I couldn’t agree more. Once my body ended its constant ache, I had just my mind to contend with. Especially since the forest paths, cow pastures, and jaw-dropping coastline views soon blended into the background. Even extreme beauty becomes monotonous. The mind doesn’t even have to worry about getting lost, because the Camino de Santiago is waymarked with yellow arrows that are painted onto fences, trees and the sides of buildings — all pointing the way to Santiago. When the pain and the views fail to distract and there is only the sound of muted walking sticks on the leaf-carpeted path, that’s the moment when a long walk becomes meditative. And that’s when the Camino starts to change lives. Or at least that’s when it changed mine. I was somewhere around day 25 and somewhere in the Spanish region of Galicia when I knew that it was time to come home. Not only did I realize that I wanted to be close to my friends and to my family, I realized that I wanted to be a better friend and a better daughter. That those connections are more important to me right now than seeing a new country. I also realized that I wanted to be a good partner again. That even though love can end in disappointment, building a life with someone is worth the risk. So, while I don’t know what twists and turns life will bring, I do know that walking 500 miles across Spain brought me home."

Medium.com,Life,You Can’t Make This Stuff Up,Travel,https://medium.com/writerontherun/you-cant-make-this-stuff-up-4d104bec6210?source=topic_page---------258------------------1," The riders who had just come in by powerful Mongolian pony had dismounted and we were off to watch a pre-Eagle Hunt demo by a young huntress. The October day was warm- blessedly- and we gathered as a group to see how she called her eagle to swoop down the mountainside and grasp either her arm or the fox skin that the eaglehad been trained to attack. These eagles are obtained as fledglings from their rooks, trained and used for hunting for a few years and then released back into the wild. These days, due largely the popularity of the large Eagle Festival in Ulgii each year, there are some 200 of these festivals all over Mongolia. That’s good in some ways because it keeps this ancient and fascinating sport alive, and it is also good because tourist money flows into this very poor country. We are justifiably fascinated by this sport. As so many of us do, I got a chance to lift the heavy bird, hooded, and have it perch on my arm. It was the third time I’d done it, so I had the trick of lifting my right arm aloft, and gently moving up and down to get her to extend her wings. People oohed and aahed (okay, okay, showoff) and I got some damned nice photos. The locals allowed us to dress in the proper gear, so that we looked the part. We were all of us missing the diamond- sharp cheekbones that define people in this part of the world, touched by the pink blush that all sport on their cheeks right from birth. I was at this point about six days from the end of my custom individual trip, which was nearly five weeks along. I’d just spent a few days at the homestay of a huntress, whose family erected a traditional ger just for me in an open field right next to their farmhouse. You cannot make this up. When I arrived, the young father (an Eagle hunter in his own right and who had been training his young wife to hunt and compete as well) was installing beautiful homemade kites into the circular wood spokes that line the ger’s ceiling. The entire inside walls were decorated with embroidered cloth, made by his mother. It would be hard to express just how much effort had gone into erecting the ger for me, from start to finish. This is how Mongolians treat guests. It boggles the mind. The women were busy making me dinner, and in a few minutes the ger was warm and cozy from the fire. Then he sat down, took out his two-stringed instrument and sang me a welcome song. Translated, it meant that he was welcoming me into his family, his home, and that I was to make myself at home, and to become part of his family. A few days later he performed a concert in midday, dressed up in different traditional costumes. It was such an honor I was in tears. You can’t make this stuff up. Here these good people had gone to an enormous amount of work to erect a ger for me on the fragrant grasses of their field, a place where I could sleep in peace for a few days on their property. And, of course, be expected to help out around the place in exchange. That, for me as a farm girl, was the easy part. Schlepping water from the stream, washing floors, helping cook, moving animals in for milking were all part of a normal part of a farm day, the endless list of chores from dawn to sunset, marked by laughter and excitement because of animals or kids or news about family, or a herd of rare antelopes nearby spotted by the father while herding. Work. Joining in. That’s the best part. The farm had scads of goats and sheep, plenty of horses and yaks and cows which had to be milked. I have arthritis in my thumbs and can’t deal with the icy cold of early morning because of my Reynaud’s Syndrome, so I was off the hook for that. However, I got to make up for it because the day’s chores never end. You just get up the next day and do them all over, varied only by hand-washing laundry, or making bread. Each day I went out in the early morning to help bring in the far-flung yak herd and cows so that the grandmother and Serka, the young huntress, could milk them. The young kids, Serka’s babies, always came along to help, which usually meant getting into mischief. Each day began early, with milking a top priority. Out the back of the house sat a precarious outhouse, surrounded by massive piles of cow shit, the source of fuel for the winter. That outhouse, which afforded one minimal privacy, had plenty of places where the whistling wind would also remind you to hurry the hell up and get your business taken care of. The door would regularly sag off, and my business would be made public, or I would crack my noggin on the low bar. The house doors are also low, which made for a series of bumps on my forehead before I got into the habit of ducking. As for the toilet, it’s a whole other experience early in the very cold morning when the wind is up. Nobody is going to go in there to squat down with the Sunday New York Times. The home itself has a large central stove which is rarely down to the last coals. The piles of dung are forever drying out out to make them effective for fuel (they have no smell, but boy can they smoke you out). The morning after I arrived, having been left my own big bag of cow shit to manage my personal stove, I got up early (about 4 am) and to start a fire. I found a source of fuel in dry wood about a mile away; each day I would walk out and get an armload, which, combined with cardboard or toilet paper made up my kindling. I managed to get a fire going, then decided to do what I saw everyone else do: I opened the stove top and poured in a healthy supply of cow shit. The fire was promptly nearly distinguished, but hot enough to make the dung smoke. Copiously. In seconds, the entire ger was so full of eye-stinging smoke I had to stand outside and open and close the ger door to clear it. Smoke was pouring out, my eyes were watering, and I was laughing. Every ger has an opening at the top which is managed by ropes, but early on I hadn’t sorted out which ropes did what, so I couldn’t give the smoke a place to escape. This, of course, is how you learn. Nana was up early, and I went to solicit her help. She spoke no English, but the smoke pouring out of the door was enough. She took off across the rocky field like a Kenyan sprinter, terrified I had set the damn place on fire, while I was running after her trying to explain that it was just shit smoke. I’ve never seen a fifty+ woman move that fast, but then these people can’t afford to lose a ger, nor did she (or I) want to see her beautiful embroidery go up in flames. As it was, the smoke did no damage. All that happened was that everything inside the ger now reeked, and the sweet sage smell that scented the place was long gone. That story brought huge laughter to the whole family. Especially because I managed to repeat that performance three more times before I left. The farm had its full share of creatures, well beyond what you might imagine. There was an older white dog who disliked me intensely at the beginning, but after two days he was sleeping outside my ger and protecting my safety. He responded with great enthusiasm to loving touch, hurling his body into the air in circles with enormous energy, happy beyond happy to have someone scrub his ears and slip him bits of cheese. His eyes went from watchful and protective to soft and loving every time I sat down next to him and brushed his head. There was a brand new puppy, a bundle of black energy, who would attack my legs (and anyone else’s) as we walked. On more than one occasion that habit sent me sprawling face-first into the dung piles that are everywhere. When he found out I would rub his belly he went crazy. The only problem was that one day, on my way to the toilet we had a near-disaster. The eagle was tethered, or so we thought, in a small area that we passed en route to the long drop. This day, it had managed to come loose, and it wasn’t hooded. The eagle made a sudden rush to attack my left foot, entangling its considerable claws in my boot laces. Claws tangled tightly and beak free, the eagle was now attached to me. I had no gloves on to protect my hands. I stood shock-still and yelled for help. Nobody heard me, and I considered my options. Then, without warning, the puppy came scampering over. Seeing prey, the eagle immediately launched into the air and seized the puppy with its sharp claws. The puppy screamed in terror. So did I. I leapt into action, screaming NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO. I lifted the bird from behind by its wings before it could eviscerate the howling puppy. I immediately set the eagle down, and scooped the terrified puppy up, running into the house where breakfast was well under way. The family grabbed two coats to put around the bird, who was hungry and free and likely to take off in search of breakfast, having been denied her treat. Such is farm life, at any given moment there’s the possibility that something like this could happen. The eagle was secured again, and thereafter I took the detour around the back of his shed, since the puppy had insisted on following me everywhere. There was as much danger of the puppy’s landing in the long drop toilet as anything else, but at least from there he could be rescued. Not if his soft underbelly had been opened up by a hungry predator. But this is even better. The family had adopted a baby camel that had been orphaned, and Gogo had the run of the place. Once she realized that I came bearing treats, she decided I was worth following around to beg (and nearly came inside my ger as a result). I got to ride her, as the family was breaking her in slowly to accept riders. She tried to buck me off, but when I got off I gave her raisins. She would put my entire hand in her mouth and gently remove the raisins with her tongue, doing no damage whatsoever to my fingers. Camels can do serious harm with their teeth and feet, but Gogo was an absolute sweetheart. She and the dogs and the other animals were among the highlights of my day, including watching her wobble her way up to the kitchen windows in search of handouts. She would drag bags of drying cheese off their wood struts, and nose around the dog bowl. She and the puppy would negotiate over the scraps, with the tiny puppy nearly always forcing Gogo to step back. She also found out, to her delight, that I massage large animals. That led to many sessions where I would scrub the curve in her neck where rocks and dirt had accumulated and itched. I got plenty of camel kisses for those efforts. Each time I came into the yard I was enthusiastically greeted by dog, puppy and camel, which is a hard trio to ignore. On my last night I had brought a watermelon as a treat, which was big deal. In a matter of seconds we had chewed all the pieces down to rind. Then we looked up to see a ghostly Gogo ogling us through the kitchen window. We opened the high window and in came her head, whereupon we fed her the rinds. When we ran out, Gogo continued to eyeball us through the closed window, hoping to stick her nose in again in search of the next goody. Again, you just can’t make this stuff up. On my last night, White Boy the senior dog haunted my door in search of bits of cheese and biscuits, and as he did every single night, stood guard in case of intruders. When I woke up the next morning, I promptly smoked myself out yet again, while he watched nearby, white tail waving in anticipation of play, affection and treats. Gogo, who shared the fenced field at night, wandered over to see if any goodies were in the offing, and Serka came out to help get the fire under control so I could pack up without suffocating. As a Baby Boomer, I am one of a diminishing generation of those who grew up on a family farm, used to the dirt and the dung and the physical labors of love that accompany farm work. As such, a trip like this allows me to dip a spoon deeply into my past, although a baby camel for a Florida farm girl was a bit out of the way. Still, the joy of taking part in familiar chores, the pleasure of watching labor pay off in delicious fried bread or a clean-for-now kitchen floor are indescribable. In this part of Mongolia, the residents strongly relate to their share Kazakh heritage, which is where the eagle hunting comes in. To be treated to being allowed to touch, play with and learn from these amazing animals is beyond priceless. This was a first-time custom trip organized by Zavkhan Trekkin- involving multiple homestays for me to get a real taste of Mongolian life. It would be difficult to express how delighted I was, cold nights or not. To give you an example of what cold nights mean, let’s put it this way. One morning, as October began to evolve into the winter that is promised this time of year, I woke up to discover that my dentures were suspended in a solid block of ice. Not wanting to scare the poo out of the kids (there’s no Halloween here but without my choppers, I sure look like the ad for Bitter Beer) I had to put that frozen cup next to my warm belly until it melted and I could make myself presentable. Had I showed up sans teeth, it simply would have made yet another funny story, to be told repeatedly around the warm, lively and very loving table, with Gogo begging treats from the window, and kids on laps asking for more cheese. You can’t make this up. But you sure can live it."

Deep burgundy. Matte. I’m not going to lie, I didn’t buy it for this purpose, but user experience has shown me that it definitely draws the gaze; the first morning I wore it (to a different coffee shop) I already discovered as much. Young men gave shy, sideways glances. Older men gave full-on, contemplative, flustered stares. But the nice thing is, in Berlin, everyone’s gaze is just as disinterested as it is not; people might notice certain details of each other’s self-presentation, might study each other with curiosity… but ultimately no one’s passing judgment. I can’t say the same about my coal-mining Pennsylvania hometown. Or anywhere else I’ve ever lived. This is why I paused in front of the mirror yesterday with my doe-foot applicator in hand and smiled; I was overcome with gratitude for the fact that I live in a town where burgundy lips on a quiet Friday morning are genuinely no big deal. Where I come from? People would be apt to make whorephobic judgments about such a look at the breakfast hour… or any hour. In Berlin? No one cares."

Last year it received 529,000 tourists, up by 11% from the year before. It is also a short season (May-September) because the infrastructure isn’t in place yet for tourists to travel safely outside of Ulaanbaatar during the harsh Winter months. We travelled to Mongolia on the Trans-Siberian rail route from Russia, catching a train that took us from far eastern Siberia into Mongolia’s capital Ulaanbaatar. Our two and a half weeks there was all sleeping in ger camps, riding Bactrian camels on the steppe, sharing a bowl of fermented mare’s milk with a nomadic family, hearing Mongolian Buddhist prayer chants at temples in the middle of the Gobi desert, climbing huge sand dunes, throat singing, wolves howling and star gazing. The Mongolian steppe completely captivated our sense of adventure and the simpler way of living was a stark reminder about what is truly important outside of the material."
Medium.com,Life,Between the Misty Mountains,Travel,https://medium.com/@Robin_CG/between-the-misty-mountains-c9cbf21cc675?source=topic_page---------275------------------1," As I begin this account, I sit in a tastefully lit coach car of the Amtrak Cascades, departing in 13 minutes on the three-and-a-half-hour journey from Portland, Oregon to Seattle, Washington. This activity alone makes me unusual, in an American context. Seattle King Street station — the fifth-busiest in the country — carries as many passengers yearly as embark or arrive at Chorley, Lancashire. As a consequence, train travel in America is an altogether more leisurely experience, both in the pace of the trains (none outside the North East exceed 80 miles per hour) and the comfort of the journey — there is, sadly, no dining car on the Pacer from Doncaster to Sheffield. But while Americans prefer to drive or fly between their major cities, today’s rail journeys have illustrated the main conclusion I’ve drawn from the last two weeks in the Pacific Northwest: this is a huge country. When I spoke to Americans about my decision to stay in their country’s often-forgotten top-left corner, they universally adopted a look of well-meaning confusion, as though they thought I had made some sort of mistake. This set off my British instinct to explain my way out of social awkwardness and got me flailing around for a reason why I chose Seattle for my first major holiday in six years. I’d like to pretend it was a noble mission of self-discovery, spurred on by a desire to walk among pine forests and the steely Scandinavian serenity of the Puget Sound. I could have claimed it was spurred on by a curiosity about the region’s counterculture, from the civil rights activism of Portland to the Seattle Underground and the grunge scene. Could it also be the fascinating cultural history of the Pacific Northwest as a haven for outcast Asian communities, from Chinese and Japanese labourers in Oregon, to Seattle’s Little Saigon, to Vancouver’s huge Hong Kong population who fled the handover of the territory from Britain to China in the 1990s? It could. But the problem is that that would be a lie. Mainly, it was the weather, and the fact that I watched and enjoyed Frasier. While Seattle’s most famous cultural export is not exactly representative of the city (the view from Frasier’s apartment in Queen Anne is impossible, and precisely one episode of the series was filmed there) it’s certainly an effective marketing tool. A desire to get the show’s title shot of the skyline spurred on my ill-advised decision to hike up to Kerry Park, miles from my hotel, while severely jet-lagged. Fiction, and specifically video games, had up until my arrival been the closest I had come to the Pacific Northwest. What Remains of Edith Finch is set on the picturesque San Juan Islands near the Canadian border. Gone Home and Life is Strange are both set in Oregon, and Oxenfree built an AR game around a hidden item on Bainbridge Island. Part of this is the region’s impressive tech industry, but part of it must lie in the slightly mysterious air brought on by its climate, the other justification for my choice of destination. Wedged between the Cascade and Olympic mountains, Seattle has a statistically justified reputation for rain, although in the 11 days I’ve spent here so far, we’ve had just one rainy day. Instead, a kind of misty pall descends over the city at regular intervals, washing out the colour and lending the autumnal, and omnipresent, trees an eye-catching quality. Even in the cities, it’s green here. Rumbling through rural Washington on this morning’s train, I believe I managed to see all the pine trees in the world. It’s no wonder Bigfoot sightings are most common in this state — anything could be out there. The surprise my new pals expressed at my showing up as a tourist in their city isn’t unjustified, I suppose. I’d be a little nonplussed if an American travelled 4,800 miles to spend a fortnight in Sheffield. It’s the fact they expressed it that got me — I’m predisposed to expect a certain patriotic self-belief out of Americans, even those of the progressive sort. Perhaps that sprinkling of self-doubt was why I felt at home here. Even so, travelers who have yet to spend much time in the USA should not underestimate what a different country it is. You will start noticing little things as you arrive at the airport, with the mysterious two-foot gap at the bottom of their toilet cubicles, which I can only imagine arose out of some health and safety rule mandating an escape route for those who manage to lock themselves in the throne room. I should point out for the sake of fairness that this peculiarity seems also to apply in Canada, but it’s certainly an uncomfortable shock for those of us used to the modest three to four inches provided by our Great British Toilets. This is not, in general, a gloat at oafish Yanks finding themselves entombed while in a compromised position. Believe me, I’ve been British long enough to know plenty of morons — it’s just that all of them still managed to work out how to unlock a door, and I have confidence that our transatlantic cousins could manage the same. The excretory strangeness does not end at the cubicles, of which there are in any case a curious shortage. You will find perhaps two per (men’s) bathroom, when even the relatively urinal-happy Brits find room for three or four. Finding the cubicle occupied, you may proceed to the urinal, which you will be perturbed to find is handily placed at floor level, giving you ample opportunities to moisten your shoes. Where these differences arise is always a curious question — some architect decades ago, despairing at the decisions which led his dreams of skyscrapers and cathedrals down a blind, urine-soaked alley, making an arbitrary decision on the placement of porcelain which continued down through the ages, no doubt. But they all add to the bigger differences that tell you that you are in a strange land. As you leave the airport and cross the road to catch a bus, you might be mowed down by a truck and killed, cutting your holiday unexpectedly short. This would be because while you are aware that they drive on the other (wrong) side of the road here, training your neck’s muscle memory to look left instead of right before you cross is a bigger task than you would assume. Provided that you survive the journey to your hotel, you may choose to celebrate with a drink in a local bar. This works effectively the same way as in Britain, you will be pleased to learn, until it comes to the process of paying, at which point you will not be asked for money, but handed your tab, a small folder containing receipts which you can pay off at the end of the night. While this might be intended as a convenience for the heavy drinker, in Britain we manage to get sufficiently smashed while paying for drinks at the point of delivery. The drink, you will notice, is as eye-wateringly expensive as everything else here. This is partly a result of our woeful exchange rate (thank you, Brexit), but even accounting for the high cost of AmericaBuxx in the current climate, paying $4.50 plus tip for a latte is not a prospect I particularly relish. Then you must account for the 10% Washington Sales Tax, which while not excessive by the standards of our 20% VAT, is not baked into prices as ours is, so still feels like an unpleasant surprise. When I spent a day in Vancouver, Canada, one of the many delights of that country was how comparatively affordable everything was. I bought an all-day travel card for their futuristic SkyTrain light rail system for the equivalent of £6.05, a filling dinner for £7, and then even let me use my British student card to get into their wonderful Aquarium $8 cheaper than usual. In Seattle those prices would be greeted with laughter, if not suspicion. Mind you, Seattle’s public transport isn’t bad, as America goes. The country realised some time between the Iraq War and the financial crisis that building their transport network entirely around petrochemicals was perhaps not the winner it once seemed, and cities across America have been feverishly building metros, light rails and streetcars ever since. The result is that a lot of these systems are both cheap and with shiny new rolling stock, but with the trade off that most of them are still quite limited. The Link, Seattle’s metro system somewhere between the Manchester Metrolink and the Tyne and Wear Metro, operates only a single line, running between SeaTac airport and the University of Washington. Happily, I’m staying just a few minutes’ walk from a Link station and have made ready use of it at an affordable $2.50 per journey during my time in the city, but that option is not available to most of the city. SoundTransit, the regional transport authority, has embarked on an ambitious plan to scale up the Link, expand the Sounder commuter rail network, and generally improve public transport across the region with a world-class integrated network up and running by 2042 — but that seems a long way distant from this end of the 2020s. To cite Seattle’s population as its official 750,000 (with a metropolitan area a smidge under three million) does not do justice to the scale of the place. A city of three quarters of a million in America is not remotely the same as a place of similar size in the UK (say, Manchester or Glasgow). The lying perspective of Google Maps had led me to believe that I would be within a moderate walk of downtown, but I’ve not yet summoned the strength to try it. The hills here are steep and plentiful — not an easy overstatement for me as a resident of Sheffield to make. My reading of the city’s history prior to arrival told me that when the suburbs were built in the early 20th century, the city flattened off the hills using fire hoses, a uniquely American solution in its bluntness. Clearly, however, they also took on the American tradition of doing a half-assed job of it. Even within the quiet, pleasant suburb of Capitol Hill — one of America’s oldest LGBT+ neighbourhoods and home to a selection of fun independent shops, Seattle chains like Dick’s Drive-In and Pagliacci Pizza, as well as a seriously excellent Mexican restaurant (La Cocina Santiago) — you will find houses amazingly spaced out, street numbers that go up by fours and sixes rather than twos, and amazing distances between destinations that look almost adjacent on a map. Once you reach downtown, don’t look up if you don’t want to feel dizzy from the sheer height of the skyscrapers, which I’m told are not even exceptional by American standards. Certainly Vancouver’s were bigger and more plentiful, but the steep slope that is Seattle’s waterfront will leave you feeling seriously loomed over by the time you reach the Aquarium and the ferry port. Simply being in Downtown is an exhausting experience. Between the frequent sidewalk closures, the steep slopes, the distances between destinations, and the sheer number and volume of people, I found I couldn’t spend more than a couple of hours there at a stretch without needing a long time in a quiet room. Happily, the Seattle Central Library was more than happy to oblige. One of the pleasant surprises I was not prepared for, given the general paucity of American public services, was the quality of their libraries. Used to the British tradition of limited opening hours, their facilities being first in front of the axe when local government cuts come through, I expected the American offering to be even worse, but I was completely wrong. Even the small branch library in Capitol Hill was open seven days a week, with decent hours even on a Sunday. It offered a great selection of books, including new releases, bookable meeting rooms, spaces with plugs and free WiFi for people working on laptops (like me) and was clean, well lit and comfortable. The Central Library was a 10 foot cuboid of grandeur, with a quirky neon colour scheme and a slightly ominous floor painted entirely in bright red like something from a David Lynch film (sadly, it was filled only with meeting rooms). An immediate observation you make on arriving is that the libraries are very popular with the city’s homeless population, which in common with other big US cities is depressingly large. America is not a country generous with its public spaces, and it’s noticeable just how many businesses even in this most progressive of cities are uncompromising in advertising their lack of public bathrooms, and often restrict access behind coded locks (a practice, sadly, which I’ve found making its way into some café chains in the UK). Homelessness in the USA is one of those social evils which seems to go unmentioned due to its prevalence. It’s hard not to see them, on most major streets, not just (as in our cities) in the centre, though there they proliferate in seemingly innumerable tent cities. Homeless people do seem, as a rule, to make it easier not to notice them here. They are quiet in a way that homeless people in Britain are not. In two weeks I was not once asked for change even by those sitting in shop doorways, where in Sheffield I am regularly stopped in the street while walking. This might be a result of more aggressive law enforcement, a less obliging public, or simply greater resignation to their situation. It might be that, the threshold for becoming homeless being lower in the USA due to their higher cost of living and comparative lack of public safety net, those who are homeless here are proportionately less given to intense mental illness or substance abuse that can make the British homeless more visible. But I wouldn’t know, because after a couple of days I also became acclimatised to it, just as the thousands of Americans around me did. Perhaps I can explain it by reference to the city’s climate. When the rain comes down, you can do something about it, put up an umbrella or duck into a building — but if you’re thrown into the Puget Sound, suddenly the wet is dense, and omnipresent, and the problem seems too big for one person to fix. I feel guilty for it — it is, after all, my country too — but like so many others, I haven’t translated that guilt into action, beyond voting for the Democrats and hoping that someone, some time, can do something. When America does anything, it does it big time. Its inequality is no exception. Part of the responsibility for resolving the homelessness crisis lies with the local authorities, and working in political communications meant I was delighted to arrive in Seattle during their local election campaigns. These are not the quaint affairs we know in Britain, where retirees point at potholes and attend street markets for a few weeks before a couple of thousand voters in their tiny ward cast their votes for the party they always vote for. For one thing, elections are officially nonpartisan — this helps provide some level of competitiveness between candidates, as the city is furiously Democratic in Presidential and Federal elections. Some ballot boxes in Capitol Hill reported returns of 100% for Hillary Clinton in 2016, so it perhaps wouldn’t be fair to the city’s few Libertarians and Republicans if they had to fight under their traditional colours. For another, the city council consists of just seven members (rather than the several dozen standard in British council elections). This means each ward, boringly numbered rather than given a geographic name, contains over 100,000 residents — more than a UK parliamentary constituency, which combined with the geographic size of the city makes campaigning a serious undertaking. As such, the main medium of campaigning seems to be the yard sign, culturally equivalent to the British garden stake, only mounted at ground level on flimsy wire rather than at head height on a mighty two-by-four. The nonpartisan campaigns mean that each candidate must develop their own brand identity rather than relying on party colours, helping along a sense of vibrant pageantry we simply don’t find amidst the Labour posters and Lib Dem diamonds of Sheffield local elections. They don’t just elect councillors in America, you see — on a frankly ill-advised 23 kilometre walk from the university to the zoo and back via the gloriously strange neighbourhood of Fremont (which proudly displays a Lenin statue rescued from a Czech scrapyard) I counted yard signs for the city council, for the King County Director of Elections, and for the local school board. On a bus through Bellingham, Washington, in the far north of the state, I saw immense poster boards for local sheriff, though Seattle is sensible enough to have a proper police force. The Democratic Primary is getting underway too, and posters and badges are starting to make themselves felt. In Capitol Hill, Mayor Pete Buttigieg has a few posters visible, understandable given the resonance with that community of America electing its first openly gay President (there have long been rumours about James Buchanan, though as he was partly responsible for the descent into civil war, I can see why there is no clamour to claim him). Elizabeth Warren also has badges on display, while some mysterious Bitcoin-mining Zorro has been flyposting Andrew Yang posters on local lampposts. Except for one contrarian old man at the airport, I have seen no MAGA hats on display, and have generally tried to avoid bringing up the White House’s current occupant with those I’ve met. As I’ve mostly been lurking in America’s most liberal corners, it seems unlikely I would be overheard by a gun-toting fanboy, but I felt it better not to risk it. Unavoidably, though, there have been things which have made me uncomfortable. A Mexican family travelling on my bus back from Vancouver were held up for half an hour at the US-Canada border — though they were eventually allowed through. A Chinese student was interrogated at the same border post just ahead of me. I have a British accent and have never lived in the USA, but I have the correct passport, so I easily sail through. It’s not hard to wonder if the questioning at Blaine, Washington would be different if I was a different colour. I wonder if part of this discomfort is the real visibility of social distinction in the USA. Transgender people and older gay couples are visible here in a way I haven’t seen anywhere in the UK, which speaks more to our cultural conservatism and general sense of reserve than being any sort of criticism of the Americans. Indeed, between this and the election pageantry, it’s a rather wonderful American trait to be able to stand straight-backed, fearlessly proclaiming one’s immovable convictions where a Brit might quietly withdraw. Unfortunately, this loudness does extend to other areas of American life, regardless of social setting. As I write, two women sharing my Amtrak car are repeatedly playing the same evidently hilarious Vine clip again and again, without speakers, such is their desire to share their joy with the whole carriage. I have shared British trains with less disruptive hen parties. Similarly, my trip to Target, a store without comparison in the UK which I can only describe as like John Lewis if it were operated by Poundland, saw me browsing the electronics section for a replacement pair of headphones while being regaled with a man’s weekend plans from the next aisle over at about four times the appropriate volume. I must confess that this is one of the biggest things which has turned me off moving to this country, wonderful though it is in so many ways. It is mostly the fault of my autistic brain and only-child upbringing that I deal badly with excessive noise, but it is a fact I cannot change, and a large American city is perhaps not the best place for quiet reflection. Some of my favourite days out were wandering undisturbed through the spacious parks of Vancouver, passing some hours on the sleepy Bainbridge island, or pottering around the incongruously large Beatles exhibition at, of all places, the Oregon Historical Society. By contrast, a trip to the city centre had me back in my concrete-walled hotel room at 3pm with the lights off, willing the world to shut up for five minutes. Alas, the steely British silence is one trait I do not ever expect the Americans to adopt. This is a big country. In volume, in scale, in intensity. Visit for a week and it becomes immediately obvious just why their culture was able to take over half the world in the space of a few decades. It is an addictive, energetic, constantly surprising country. The Pacific Northwest is one of the world’s most beautiful environments, and in its rainy, mountainous terrain the Americans and Canadians have carved out gleaming cities, endlessly vibrant communities, a thriving economy, while preserving so much natural beauty, humble local history and a variety virtually unheard of back home. Within the space of an eight hour train journey, you can travel through the gleaming futuristic metropolis of Vancouver, through the bustling, thrilling hugeness of Seattle, to the almost European clanging of trams, sidewalk cafes, art deco architecture and sense of charming post-industrial grime that accompanies hip, rebellious Portland. This is the land they call Cascadia, and it’s wonderful. I’m almost 4,000 words deep, and we’re pulling into Seattle, so I’d better stop. But I can’t do it justice — come see it for yourself."

It’s an important day around the world. For the LGBTQIA community, it’s a day to come out. For me, it’s not about that at all. It’s about celebrating my dad’s birthday. This past Friday was the first time in about five years. While it wasn’t much, it made me realize how much I missed him when I was away. As I’ve mentioned in previous articles, I’d spent the past five, six years in Beijing, China. Whenever I came home for vacation, it was summer. Michigan can get cold in the fall. One never knows when it’s going to snow. Beijing gets disgustingly hot in the summer, so July is the best time to be back in Michigan. On his birthday month, I traveled. Ticket prices were lower after the October holiday, so I went somewhere all the time. Every week in China, I made a point to make sure I called him on Skype to catch up on each other’s lives. We never stayed on the phone long. We aren’t the type of people to talk for long on the phone. When I came home, I’d spend a day with him at the bar. We’d bag food and do any random chores around the bar that needed doing. Sometimes, I’d help him cook if he had a customer. For me, it was a lovely afternoon with my dad. In the fall of 2017, I went to Paris for a college friend’s wedding. I called my dad not long after buying the plane ticket and telling him about it. Out of nowhere, he starts laughing. “Do you listen to yourself?” he asked, mid-laughter. “You talk about going to weddings in Paris and other stuff. How cool is that? How many people talk like that?” I’d be surprised if he remembered that conversation. I know I will. My dad’s not the type to come out and say when he’s proud. It’s the subtle things he says and does that show me how proud he is. My fiance, his kids, and I went to his house. I had a Home Depot gift card for him. We talked in his house for a while before we walked to the bar. We ate pizza, and we caught up. I occasionally helped my brother out when it looked like he needed it. It wasn’t much, but it was the first time in a long time I spent time with my dad on his actual birthday. We didn’t do much. We never do much when we’re hanging out with each other. I still missed it all the same. It’s always time with my dad."

Medium.com,Life,I Don’t Need Privacy — I Need Indifference,Travel,https://psiloveyou.xyz/i-dont-need-privacy-i-need-indifference-741112169656?source=topic_page---------283------------------1," My Airbnb host pointed up the twisting staircase. “First door at the top,” he said. It was completely dark up there as far as I could see, so I had to take his word for it. The house seemed neat and clean, but it reeked of curry and aggressively seasoned meats. I thought maybe they were in the middle of cooking dinner, but the aroma never went away. After 2am calls of nature, I’d rush back to my room and try to close the door against the invasion of pepper and spice. A certain level of weirdness goes along with any Airbnb stay — that’s a given — but the curry-scented towels weren’t my main complaint. The biggest problem was The Hovering Hosts, who appeared like magic if I made tea in the kitchen, turned on the shower, or tried to slip out the front door. “Is everything all right?” It would be, if you’d leave me alone. “Do you need anything?” To be ignored. That’d be great, thanks. “Did you eat? You didn’t eat! You didn’t go out at all yesterday!” Seriously … do I look like I skip meals? Listen, I’ve had my share of airbnb adventures. The tiny flat where my bedroom shared a wall with the 30-something hosts, who felt the need to narrate — exuberantly — their bedtime activities. The charming guest house where my ground floor window faced the front yard on a busy street, and the beautiful, leafy trees gave cover to late night drug exchanges. The gorgeous riverside manor where I had a spacious attic studio to myself, including a mini-fridge, microwave, TV, radio, snacks and tea kettle. If only there were a bed! I asked the host about the airbed on the floor — where’s the lovely king sized bed in the photos? Apparently the last guest had brought along her bedwetting 4-year-old. Which was why the listing now said: no children allowed. I did get a partial refund, but boy, did my back pay the price. All the hosts deliver some version of discretion, but what I long for is plain, pure indifference. With a side order of just don’t GAF. Indifference is a far cry from privacy. Privacy is I’m not commenting or judging you or touching your stuff even though I am watching you and I’m thinking things I’m not going to say. Because I respect your privacy. Indifference is an authentic lack of interest or attachment to outcome. The front desk clerk at the Holiday Inn, for example, sincerely does not care if I ever leave my room. She doesn’t come beating on the bathroom door while I’m using my battery-powered toothbrush, demanding to know if I’ve got an unauthorized electric shaver in there. If I want to sit around in my jammies all day and order in chicken wings and write wildly inappropriate stories, shouldn’t I be able to do that without people knocking on my door asking me when I’m coming out, and what’s that smell? Even when I’m given “privacy” I’m still keenly aware of others’ eyes and ears, I still fight the urge to comply with unspoken desires and wants, I still cling to social expectations. I put my headphones on to binge watch Friends; I sneak those empty beer bottles out in my backpack; I turn off my battery-powered toothbrush, because now that they mentioned it, it does sound sort of … unauthorized. I have the same problem in my relationships. People are always willing to promise me privacy, when I really need them to just not give a damn. Privacy: I forgot my (unlocked, un-password-protected) phone on the kitchen table, and my boyfriend resists the urge to scroll through my messages or check my emails. Because he respects my privacy. Indifference: My boyfriend forgot his phone on the kitchen table, and I don’t notice because I just spilled whisky on the table (priorities, people), and I’m trying to write down a story idea before I forget it, and I have no urge to read someone else’s texts. I can barely work up enough energy to read my own, which is probably why I forgot my phone in the first place. I know what you’re thinking: maybe the problem is ME. Maybe I just need to get over myself, and accept other people’s gestures of kindness and friendship at face value. Maybe I should turn up the volume on Friends, unashamed! Or loudly denounce curry in all its forms! Or open that bathroom door and show them my battery-powered toothbrush! Huzzah! All I know is that the concierge at the Hyatt barely looked up when I dragged my muddy backpack across the shiny, fake-marble floor, and three empty cans of Diet Coke came tumbling out. So if you need me — or if you’re delivering pizza — I’ll be in room 419."

Before that, I lived in Turkey for two and China for half a year. When I landed in Beijing, the first time being truly abroad on my own, I became incredibly home-sick. I was surprised. I was privileged enough to have traveled a lot with my family as a child, so being in a foreign country wasn’t such a big deal. But I missed everyone. So much. I missed the normal things too, like familiar bathrooms and grocery stores where I could read the labels.

Medium.com,Life,Crown Sydney Casino in Barangaroo: The Cultural and Economic impact.,Travel,https://medium.com/@ornilla_shamon/crown-sydney-casino-in-barangaroo-the-cultural-and-economic-impact-86626b2c8bb7?source=topic_page---------285------------------1," I would like to recognise and acknowledge the Gadigal people of the Eora nation. The First People and Traditional Custodians of the land upon which the Barangaroo area is built upon. I offer and pay respects to the Elders both past and present. B
arangaroo is an inner city suburb of Sydney, New South Wales. It is situated on the western side of Sydney’s Central District. It is a place known for their beautiful parklands, enticing harbour views and innovative designs. Barangaroo was the home for the Indigenous Gardigal people. Dr Andrea Connor from Western Sydney University conveys how home is much more meaningful than just a “physical spare”. It’s something that society invests “meaning, memory, cultural value and social significance”. The name of Barangaroo is extremely meaningful as it was named after an Indigenous Cammeraygal woman. Her husband was Bennelong, a Wangal man, influential and very well known. Barangaroo lived around the North Harbour and Manly. NSW Infrastructure describe her to be “independent” and “strong”. She also dealt with the early settlers through her own ways. Associate Professor of History and Philosophy at UNSW suggests that “Barangaroo’s power came from her role as a hunter and provider”. Therefore, this land has historical and cultural importance, as it was once the home for the ‘First Peoples’. However, the memory of Barangaroo as a fertile, natural and cultural landscape is fading. The land was paramount to Aboriginal life as it provided the community with a sense of meaning. Barangaroo was important for both fishing and hunting, which is considered central to Aboriginal culture and personal/communal needs. Currently, the place of Barangaroo has now transformed into something else. It has become a rich financial district. As Chris Johnson conveys, it has become “a global centre of financial trading and in moving the city into the next generation of its built form”. At the root of this topic is the Crown Sydney Casino being constructed in Barangaroo, which is estimated to cost $2.2 billion and is expected to open in 2021. The real question here is whether the memory of Barangaroo regarding its rich Indigenous heritage is being properly commemorated? And whether economic benefits and private interests should be favoured over the public interests? According to Professor Walter Benjamin, “memory is the scene of the past as well as the medium of what has been experienced the way the earthen realm is the medium in which dead cities lie buried”. The area of Barangaroo illuminates historical memory, due its rich indigenous heritage. The Indigenous history is a fundamental element that provides the city with character and liveliness. It is a memory that is ongoing. Thus, many residents and public icons argue that a Crown Sydney in Barangaroo is a clash of values and beliefs since in no form, does it acknowledge any historical or cultural context. The Lord Mayor Clover Moore states, “It’s outrageous that the precious public land along the foreshore of the global city has been sacrificed so private interests can profit from selling apartments to millionaires. Both NSW Government and Opposition supported the proposal to build this tower, cannibalising our planned parkland and continuous harbour foreshore. This remains an outrageous betrayal of the community’s trust, an abuse of power that places private profit ahead of the public interest.” On another occasion, The Lord Mayor Clover Moore also recently stated in May, “Profit and private interests are clearly being put ahead of public good. Barangaroo is public land owned by us all, but the Liberal/National Government is bending over backwards to install a casino, multi-million dollar apartments and parking that will only benefit developers”. In 2018, BLAK BOX was premiered at Barangaroo Reserve in Sydney. The program allowed individuals to experience “The First Peoples concept of Deep Listening in a surrounded, art and listening space”. It conveys the oral histories of Barangaroo before 1788. Curator of BLAK BOX, Daniel Browning recently told Western Sydney University (School of Communications) that, “Barangaroo has become a beautiful theme park that has just been planted on the western foreshore of Sydney harbour”. He also sates, “it has become a pleasure ground for the rich”. Moreover, Mr Browning conveys that “even with all of the rehabilitation and revegetation of the site, it still has become a made creation. It is difficult to pretend that the site has not been scarred or damaged or just invented”. In a sense, Barangaroo has lost its natural character. Mr Browning states how one of his first guests who attended the BLAK BOX program conveyed that, “Barangaroo itself was a wound, it was empty and hollow. It is a hollow space underneath the cutaway”. Moreover, Mr Browning also discusses how many Aboriginal people will not visit Barangaroo as it is considered to be a curse. Another question to ask is how the name of Barangaroo is living on? Dr Heidi Norman from the University of Technology answers this thoroughly. She states, “the naming of that site opens up a whole new conversation about women, Aboriginal women. So often women are left out of these early colonial stories because the colonisers, they assumed a kind of patriarchal society. On one occasion the Europeans, thinking that they could offer gifts, they hauled in something like 4,000 Australian salmon and gave that as a gift to the Eora men. Barangaroo was really angry about that. She was wanting to maintain and reinforce the position of women in their clan group as powerful providers for their mob”. In addition, as inferred by the mayor, the construction of Crown Casino is favouring private interests in order to gain economic benefits. Dr Ann Holmes states, “Australia will look to maintain and build upon the trading partnership it has had with China in recent years”. Subsequently, Australia’s partnership with China will also be pivotal in promoting tourism in Australia, since studies shows it has been declining. The Allen Consulting Group have conducted a Crown Sydney Proposal: An Economic Benefit Assessment which has been prepared by Crown Melbourne. This report highlights that “annual tourism balance of trade has been in deficit for 7 years and now stands at a record low of over $7.2 billion”. The Allen Consulting Group has also noted that China has “the fastest growth with regard to expenditure on international tourism, multiplying expenditure four times”. Additionally, it will also aid in helping combat Australia’s lack of hotel accommodation in Sydney. Moreover, “the Tourism Association of Australia found Sydney needs 150 to 550 new hotel rooms every year or 5,000 rooms by 2020 to meet the demands of the tourism sector”. Furthermore, other pivotal economic benefits include a boost in business investment of over $200 million and the creation of an additional 1400 jobs per year. This report also articulates that once Crown Casino is open in Sydney, the gross state product is estimated to increase by $300-$440 million per year. This includes, “the spending of visitors to the complex, especially overseas visitors, and the consequent flow-on effects to other industries in the state”. Although, it is creating a boost in business, the Crown Casino in Barangaroo is receiving criticism for its height. The Sydney Observatory has stated their concern that views of the city will be obscured by the building. According to the National Trust Submission, “True landmarks … achieve this status through their excellence in design … Height per se is not the yardstick”. The Crown will be the tallest tower in Sydney, which is specified by Crown to be 275 metres. Architect Philip Thalis, recently told the Guardian that, “Barangaroo is a demonstration of everything that is wrong in contemporary Australian city-making”. Tourist John Simon from the United States of America states how the massive cost of this building could have been spent elsewhere. “Hospitals, schools, parks… this is where the money should have been spent. Or they should invest into solving important issues such as combating homelessness”. Infrastructure NSW was contacted numerous times, regarding the community’s interests. Questions were asked regarding their powers or roles within this development and what they can do to ensure that the community will have developments that support them. Their spokesperson responded stating, “On July 1st 2019, the Barangaroo Delivery Authority was abolished with its functions transferring to Infrastructure NSW. Infrastructure NSW is now the NSW Government agency responsible for the development of Barangaroo and management of its public spaces. Upon completion, more than half of Barangaroo will be dedicated public space. This will include a continuous Sydney Harbour promenade, expansive parklands, plazas and coves”. Infrastructure NSW was also questioned regarding how Barangaroo’s Indigenous heritage is being commemorated. There spokesperson responded stating, “Barangaroo has a rich and diverse history. Today, Aboriginal contemporary culture is celebrated at Barangaroo through artworks, events and commemorations. In addition, visitors to Barangaroo can connect with Aboriginal culture and the site’s rich cultural history through educational tours through the Reserve. Work on the development of Barangaroo is continuing. Key projects underway include remediation of the old Millers Point Gasworks, completion of the southern precinct, development of Central Barangaroo, upgrade of Hickson Road and a new Metro station”. As stated by NSW Infrastructure, there is currently Aboriginal Cultural Tours presented by environmental educator, Clarence Slockee. These tours allows individuals to experience cultural ambience through learning Australia’s heritage. The duration is 90 minutes, allowing individuals to witness 75,000 different native Australian trees and shrubs. The ticket costs $36.30 for adults and $16.50 for children. Click here to purchase tickets or learn more about educational tours. Further, it is also important to discuss the potential for crime in NSW as a result of Crown Sydney Casino in Barangaroo. The Victoria Gaming Regulatory Body and Crown Casino has had constant unfavourable media representation due to constant scandals involving money laundering, Chinese organised crime, fast tracked visas for Chinese gamblers, sex trafficking, and crime syndicates. Nick McKenzie, Grace Tobin and Nick Toscano recently highlighted in an Age article stating,“police and security agencies are now asking questions about the movement in and out of Australia of Chinese high rollers with links to the Chinese Communist Party or organised crime syndicates”. There has also been leaked documents which proves that Crown has conducted business with Tom Zhou. He is described by The Age as, “an international fugitive, alleged crime boss and the subject of an Interpol red notice, according to multiple security officials with knowledge of the matter”. Further, Bill Birtles conveys in his ABC article that nineteen Crown workers, three Australians included, have pleaded guilty to gambling crimes. Further, other than Crown Sydney’s impact culturally and economically, it is essential to consider important concepts such as collective memory and palimpsest. Professor and author Karen Till in her book ‘The New Berlin: Memory, Politics and Place, highlights, “places of memory are created by individuals and social groups to give a shape to felt absences, fears, and desires that haunt contemporary society. Traditionally national places of memory were created and understood as glorifying the pasts of a people”. According to Bridie Jabour, “Rock engravings have been found in the area which date back 6,000 years and the wider area was occupied for at least 14,000 years before European colonisation”. Therefore, this place of memory glorifies the past of the Gardigal people. Moreover, Motti Neiger defines collective memory as “relations between the individual and the community to which she belongs and enables the community to bestow meaning upon its existence”. Barangaroo’s contemporary culture is acknowledged in the community through their artworks, educational tours and events. Therefore, continuing the relationships between Barangaroo and today’s community. Thus, showing and presenting meaning, and the existence of culture in today’s society. Further, another important concept to consider is palimpsest. According to Dr Connor “the term palimpsest expresses the idea that places have multiple pasts”. For example, layers of histories, cultural mapping and heritage sites. Barangaroo has various layers of histories, culture and heritage. However, now Barangaroo is forming a different layer, it will now be contemporary and dynamic. NSW Premier Gladys Berejiklian has recently stated that opening Crown in Barangaroo is “consistent with the governments vision for the future”. Su-Lin Tan conveys that with Australia’s growing population, more developments and opportunities are needed for Pyrmont in the future."
Medium.com,Life,Moon rabbits and autumn in Japan,Travel,https://medium.com/@otajoyotafuku/moon-rabbits-and-autumn-in-japan-9806c0ff2509?source=topic_page---------286------------------1," Fall is the time of year known for changing leaves, cooling temperatures, and, in the west, the start of the holiday season. Folks bundle up, bake special holiday treats and tell each other autumnal folktales and spooky ghost stories. In Japan, there are many celebrations and stories that go along with the fall season as well. Read on to see how Japan celebrates the fall season. Tsukimi, or Otsukimi, is a moon-viewing festival celebrated on two different occasions every year. The full moon is usually viewed on the 15th day of the 8th month, according to the Japanese lunar calendar, and the waxing moon is viewed on the 13th day of the ninth month. These dates correlate to different days of the Gregorian calendar, depending on the year. The festival began during Japan’s Heian period and ancient observers would often recite poetry while viewing the moon at its biggest and brightest. An important part of the festival is the tale of the Old Man of the Moon and the Rabbit. According to legend, the Old Man of the Moon looked down on the earth and watched the world sleeping night after night. He became especially curious about a monkey, a fox and a rabbit that all lived together as friends. One night, the Old Man came down to earth one day disguised as a beggar to test the animal friends’ kindness. He approached them as they warmed themselves around a bonfire and asked them if they would give him some food. The monkey provided the Old Man with many fruits and berries, while the fox used its cunning to catch the Old Man a fish. But the rabbit, who had nothing but himself to offer, prepared to jump into the fire so that the Old Man might eat him. Before he could do so, the Old Man took off his disguise and revealed his true self. To repay the rabbit for his generosity, he took the rabbit back with him to live on the moon. Around Tsukimi, you’ll see a lot of rabbit-themed decorations to go along with the story. There are also special foods served around this time, such as tsukimi dango, noodles topped with egg and mooncakes. Seasonal foods such as kabocha (pumpkin) and taro (a type of potato) are also served around this time. People often visit shrines (which hold parades and plays), decorate their roofs with pampas grass, and go chestnut picking. Tsukimi is a fun and busy celebration in Japan. Much like the cherry blossom viewing celebrations in the spring, a popular autumn activity in Japan is viewing the changing colors of the leaves. Japan is famous for its four seasons and you can find some of the most radiant autumn views in the world here. Places like Furano, Ibaraki, Lake Kawaguchi and Kiyomizudera Temple are all popular spots to view the vibrant colors of the leaves. Jidai Matsuri is a festival that dates back all the way to 1895. The “Festival of Ages” was created to celebrate the founding of Kyoto, the ancient capital of Japan before it was moved to Tokyo. The festival takes place on October 22 and features a two-hour long parade of people dressed in historical costume, particularly from the Heian period (794–1185 AD). The parade starts at the Imperial Palace and culminates at the Heian Shrine. Both the shrine and the Jidai Matsuri were created in the same year as a way to celebrate the culture and significance of Kyoto. November 3 is Japan’s day to celebrate Japanese achievements in the arts, sciences and culture. Parades and art exhibitions are a large part of the day’s celebration, as are visits to museums and science centers. Students and professionals also debut new projects and discoveries on November 3 as well. One of the most important events of Culture Day is the presentation of the Order of Culture award by the Imperial Family of Japan. This prestigious award ceremony is attended by many members of the academic and professional community and each year one member or group is inducted into the Order of Culture for their contributions to the fields of science, arts or culture. The day is also celebrated throughout Japan by individual cities and regions which hold parades and festivals celebrating their unique historical cultures and contributions to Japan. Tori No Ichi takes place in November on days associated with the rooster in the Chinese zodiac. On these auspicious days, vendors sell ornately decorated bamboo rakes to be displayed during New Year’s celebrations a few months later. Tori No Ichi is sometimes called the Rooster Rake Festival in English. Vendors not only sell rakes but also festival foods as well, and the event has a fun, festive atmosphere. Rake vendors and purchasers will engage in spirited negotiations over the price of rakes, and when an agreement is reached, they will clap their hands in a traditional rhythm called tejime to celebrate the closing of the sale. The rakes are thought to be symbols of good luck, and are covered in almost every Japanese symbol of fortune imaginable, including maneki neko and, of course, Otafuku masks.

Medium.com,Life,East Coast Trek — Part VI:,Travel,https://medium.com/the-northern-point/east-coast-trek-part-vi-653aa39018d0?source=topic_page---------287------------------1," In the very first part of this travel series — called Accessible USA — I praised the virtues of the US when it comes to accessibility. And the physical accessibility is good — in most places and for the most part. But travelling with a wheelchair can be a challenge even in the US. Two stories from our trip will demonstrate, that accessibility is not always the standard. The first is a story with a happy ending because thoughtful and professional people found a solution to the problem. The second is a cautionary tale of how not to run your business if you want to keep your customers, if you want to live up to the standards of American legislation or if you just want to be a professional and decent human being. Arriving in Philadelphia — a bit tired from a long day on the road — we checked into our pre-booked hotel looking forward to settling in, going out for dinner and then relaxing for the rest of the evening. We checked in without incident and embarked on the quite long walk to our room. But to our surprise — despite our best efforts on booking the stay — the room was in no way accessible. My wife couldn’t even get her wheelchair through the door. Struggling with a large luggage cart we decided that she would go back down to the front desk and clear up the matter. A few minutes later she showed up again and we went up a couple of floors to a new room — now the best accessible room the hotel had to offer — or so we were told. And this time the wheelchair could get through the door. That was, however, all that was possible. Any kind of passage within the room — including access to the bathroom — was quite impossible. Another trip to the front desk took a little longer. In the end the solution was to move to another hotel — also in downtown Philadelphia. The move also meant a step up in standard of the hotel and we were now just a block from the historic Independence National Park. That part you can read about in the previous part of this series. The second story is an altogether more depressing tale. Two days later we arrived in Washington DC. We had a four-day conference and a stay in downtown DC ahead of us. On this day however we had booked a treat for ourselves. The accessible presidential suite with a balcony and view of the National Mall. We were planning to just stay in, enjoy the view and dinner on the balcony. But this was unfortunately not what was in store for us. When we checked in the lady at the front desk informed us, that the accessible presidential suite was closed for maintenance. A fact they had neglected to inform us about even though we had booked the suite at least month in advance. Nothing else in that class and accessible were available. After some discussion back and forth we saw no other option but to take the room she had found for us. Anything would have been a disappointment but the room we were given was beyond disappointment. A small, dark, worn room with a magnificent view of the parking lot and inner courtyard! The carpets were worn and stained and every piece of furniture in the place was nicked as the room was not really all that accessible. The bright side of the story is that we had an additional discount on the room apart from the — considerable — price difference between the two rooms. We put this to good use by going to dinner at The Watergate Hotel, which was magnificent. The two stories are both exceptional in as much as we didn’t have any other problems with accessibility in the hotels, we stayed in during the almost three weeks we spent in the US. They also demonstrate two different approaches to customer service and sense of responsibility towards guests with disabilities. In the first we got more than expected and perhaps more than would have been reasonable. In the second no amount of water bottles and cookies could make up for the inconsiderate and discriminatory attitude we experienced. Not out of malice but out of sheer indifference.

Medium.com,Life,The Strawberry Shake,Travel,https://medium.com/crows-feet/the-strawberry-shake-132713dd84b3?source=topic_page---------290------------------1," The last time I had a milkshake, a real one, I might have been perhaps twelve. That was fifty-four years ago, and MickeyD’s was a brand new enterprise. Burgers were barely ten cents, and the bragging rights were still only a few hundred thousand sold. Milkshakes, in my Central Florida home town, were summer. I remember going to the local drug store, which back then was a Rexall in the NorthGate Shopping Center ( a big deal for us back then) and sliding onto the cool-from-air conditioning seats. Our bare skin stuck to the vinyl, sweaty from the summer humidity, but we quickly cooled off. The shakes we ordered back in the early sixties were tall dense affairs, full of creamy milk and three or four scoops of ice cream. They were a meal unto themselves. I have one just like that, albeit a touch smaller, sitting on my table right here in Ulaan Bataar. It’s strawberry. I feel like a little kid. At 66, I have tended to eschew milkshakes for years, for various reasons. Yesterday my guide drove us to a small shop where I bought a stick ice cream, thinking I was getting vanilla. Let’s just say that the Mongolian’s version of vanilla doesn’t track with my taste buds. I got part of a piece in my mouth before blowing the rest of it out in a spray, and tossing the whole affair into the closest trash can. It was frozen yogurt, but frozen Mongolian yogurt, which trust me, is not what the tongue expected. Each to his own. In so many ways this insane city, a huge tumble of construction, aging infrastructure, bad pipes, glaring and garish consumerism, is a complete mash up. In the desperate rush to leave the past behind, I have to wonder if this country isn’t also throwing its precious culture out the door as well. Herds of horses now have to maneuver across highways full of drivers who seem to have no compunction about nearly running over pedestrians, much less livestock. I would imagine, given the proliferation of car dealerships in a city that can’t handle the traffic it has now, it’s going to get a lot worse. They are in such a hurry to get somewhere that I genuinely wonder if they have any idea what that “where” is supposed to look like. Same thing happened to my small home town, where the citrus groves we rode through from town to town have given way to condos and housing developments. The Rexalls and drug store counters of my youth, along with the cherry cokes (dense sugar syrup in a coke with a float) are long, long gone. I’m just passing through, on my way out west in the Altai where folks still hunt with eagles, even if that is heavily touristy these days. As it was. The strawberry shake was a pleasant surprise in a city full of surprises. The dense, sweet, cold ice cream and rich Mongolian cream were a blast from my Southern country past, where friends and I would ride to the next town (in this case, Auburndale, Florida in the Sixties), tie our horses up and sit down at the drug store counter for a treat. In some interesting ways, my youth is reflected in the horse cultures of Mongolia. In Western Mongoliga, kids still ride their horses to school. There is something wonderful in seeing this, because it is fast disappearing, just as all the herders want to replace their terrific horses with motorcyles. Forgive me but the vision of a lone Mongolian herder, sitting tall and straight on his powerful little pony against the lonely, dusty backdrops of hills colored wheat by the cold weather, is considerably more appealing than the angry buzz of motorcylces belching fuel into that sage-scented air. A strawberry shake isn’t just a shake. A really good one has a way of whipping me back to my long-distant past, a time when ice cream really was rich, an adventure was a few kids riding bareback on a hot summer’s day in search of a cold treat, and life was a series of simpler pleasures. They are still available, if you’re willing to travel, explore and go places where what’s really important hasn’t been replaced by the headlong rush into a questionable future. For my part, it’s worth it. My strawberry shake, which I had for lunch, was followed by yet another at dinner. At my age, I can, by god, have as many as I like, especially since such a perfect treat brings back such perfect memories. Here’s to the tastes of summer: the blush of lovely berries, and the ice cream headaches of a treat that carries a lot more than just pleasurable taste, but also the rush of memories of long ago, summers of my youth, and all the joys of being a Florida kid. My thanks to Zavkhan Travel for organizing a custom trip to Mongolia this past fall."

Medium.com,Life,Near the Border of Russia,Travel,https://medium.com/writerontherun/near-the-border-of-russia-2efe8bb8a84c?source=topic_page---------292------------------1," The morning sky was slightly clouded over, the much- desired view of an unpolluted sky streaked with stars out of reach. For now. It was warm, unseasonably so, for this close to October, this high up, this deeply embedded in the Sambygaryp Mountains. The sun peeks over the far hills and paints the west as the cashmere goats and sheep lie quietly, chewing their cud. Kushkillim, the family dog, arrived two days ago battered, beaten, bitten and bruised, largely by people he’d approached for food on his long journey from the family’s small mud brick house in town way out here to find his master. He had a terrible bite behind his right ear, was lame in his left front leg and his hip caused him to whine when I stroked his fur. However, he’s getting better fast. I sneak him treats from my food supply and am constantly cuddling him. It’s paying off, as this morning, after lying on the grass under the thorn bushes for two days, he was up and bounding ( mostly) to accompany me to the family toilet. Toilets here are rough. Ours is a hole in the ground behind the bushes. The three small children go everywhere, as evidenced by the small pats of white paper and little piles. When I travel to Third World countries where one goes outside at will, I am reminded regularly when I come back to the States of how damned inconvenient it is when you can’t just find a bush somewhere and drop trou. While that can make walking around at night awkward you wouldn’t want to do that here anyway. Wolves. Yes, I prefer porcelain flush toilets, of course I do, but this way of life makes taking care of business a lot easier. Shit is a way of life here. With livestock constantly on the move and sleeping at the ger, the “yard,” such as it is, is a carpet of goat and sheep pellets and cow patties. And, of course, horse apples. Which is handy. There are almost no trees, just endless dense thorn bushes, the thorns reaching as long as two inches. These bushes cover the landscape, and their dying branches are our firewood. Dried cow dung and horse apples are the “coals,” which I gather each day by the huge bagful to dump in a sunny spot for final drying. You go through a lot of fuel here. First, we’re constantly making tea, we are always washing dishes, we have to boil milk and cheese for the huge variety of dairy products which grace the table every day. Fuel means food, warmth, a clean face, and if you’re very VERY fortunate, a clean body once a week. At the moment, I am sitting on the floor of the main ger while my host, Seku, his mother and one of the nephews are eating breakfast. Seku’s mother, a lively, apple-cheeked woman of 72, is going to show me traditional handcrafts this morning. The ger is covered with her colorful work, the result of years of painstaking hand labor for forty years. Each piece uses traditional symbols to depict life, from marriage to love to the importance of family. Seku grew up in the ger with these brilliantly-colored patterns right over his head, handed down through the centuries. Seku’s mother has poor eyesight. I gave her an extra pair of my 3.0 readers. which caused her work to swim into focus. Those readers, perhaps all of $6.00 at my local Costco (I buy them in bulk because I break and lose them in bulk) were a huge improvement to her lifestyle. Such small things, such a big difference. She was utterly delighted that such a gift could help her see better. After lunch (and after I get more firewood and dung for her stove) I will head out by Mongolian horse to mind the goat and sheep herd as they move steadily clockwise through one field of brush and thorn bushes after another. The above is our washroom, where we splash water on our faces and brush our teeth. The green tub is for laundry, which we dry by curling the edges of our clothing under the tight ropes that snug the circumference of the ger. Barring rain, everything is dry in a New York minute. Herding is a great deal like trying to control a large drop of liquid mercury on an uneven and moving surface. There are always three baby goats at the rear getting lost or left behind, or as happened yesterday, the herd spread out far and wide horizontally, making keeping a perimeter very challenging. My only concern is that as the herd moves, I know where they are, and nobody’s left behind. A typical problem is that other animals, typically marked with a colored ear clip or different paint will wander in and join our herd. I simply could not be happier, being on a horse, managing a quietly grazing herd, or waking up to a chilly morning to a rising pink sun over the far mountains. This is what it’s like to do a traditional home stay. I frankly couldn’t be happier. Once I found a place to put my tent far enough away from the main ger so that I could sleep, I was in heaven. I grew up on a small family farm, so tending to the herds on horseback is as natural to me as breathing. The people here are a little surprised that a tourist can ride their horses, or herd, or be able to swiftly adapt to what they call “countryside life.” Once you do, however, your willingness to throw in to help out, schlep water, gather wood, make food, wash dishes or do any other of the endless chores that make up Mongolian ger life makes you a very welcome guest. That gives them time to breathe, rest, play with the kids, and enjoy the gorgeous countryside that stretches in all directions. The above is a site a good bit away from the main ger, not out of dog barking range, but protected from the winds. Sometimes goats will nibble at the tent just to test it out for taste. Happily my tent was largely left alone. Just watch your step right outside the vestibule and whatever you do, don’t grab the branches. Oh yeah. And watch where you squat. Because out here, sand and thorns Get. Into. Everything. I can’t speak for anyone else but it’s a fine thing to sit a horse, surrounded by mountains, the wind and sun in your face, looking forward to a bowl of steaming green tea sweetened with premier Kazakh honey. For anyone interested in something similar, please go to Zavkhan Trekking for more information. Mine was a custom-built trip including several homestays. I cannot recommend Zavkhan more highly, nor could I emphasize the extraordinary opportunity to live and learn from ger life in Mongolia. This is one of the world’s last great horse cultures. They are disappearing fast, but they are beyond happy to share their way of life with outsiders. You will come away part of a much larger family, richer for the experience, and for being reminded of how the simplest things mean the most. All photos courtesy Julia Hubbel"

Medium.com,Life,What Are The Hardest Adjustments To Make When Visiting Cameroon?,Travel,https://medium.com/@tchassakamga/what-are-the-hardest-adjustments-to-make-when-visiting-cameroon-a90fd7a5cfa6?source=topic_page---------294------------------1," I’ve been thinking about this for some time now. I moved to the US last year, and whenever I get on the phone to talk with my parents and siblings, I have this lingering thought that it would be amazing to go back and hang out. One thing I can say for sure in my case is that of all the things I miss about Cameroon, it’s the people I miss most. I wish I could say the food, the culture, or something more exotic, but living in America exposed me to who I was and what really mattered. I’ve also had the chance this past year to see the way Americans live, and compare not just the cultures, but the physical space and even the stark financial differences of both countries. If you’re just visiting Cameroon, there are things you have to keep in mind to make your stay worthwhile. In fact, if you don’t know these things, you might go through a really, really hard time. Not because Cameroon is bad, but because it’s a place that has unwritten rules as well as written ones. I’ll breakdown the adjuments into two parts: stark (written) adjustments and subtle (unwritten) adjustments. Because they are many, I’ll only point out 4 that should allow you to enjoy your stay and still come out completely awed at the most beautiful and (some) unnerving experiences. One adjustment which doesn’t fall in any of these classes is the assumption by many people visiting Cameroon that everyone they meet is “Cameroonian”. Technically, yes. However, there are over 230 different tribes that form this bilingual nation. Each tribe has a language and culture that can be so different from the next in a way that two people, who look like each other, may never see eye to eye or even understand each other. Most people think Cameroon is French-speaking because a majority of the country was previously under French rule, but that is not the case. The official languages are English and French. Cameroon’s history is a rap sheet of political rigmarole, confusion, blood baths and a teetering democracy that has left its population with no hope for anything that involves a vote. The result has found its way into the culture and even the larger mindset of how to be Cameroonian. But that’s not why you’re here today. Today, we talk about adjustments. Oui? Let’s do this! 1. Weather, Climate, and Geography
Depending on when you visit Cameroon, you may either meet the rainy or dry season. You may be surprised to find out that different regions of the country have different times during which these seasons start and end, and varying amounts of both sunlight and rain. This, of course, affects the crops grown in each area because of the soil type. Up north, for example, is much drier and arid, down South flourishes almost all year round. Where the West is known for food crops, the Southwest has the oil refinery. Cameroon’s climate can be pretty confusing if you’re moving from one region to the other. Without understanding the geography of a place, you might be surprised to believe you’re in the same country. This is then important to know to plan, not just your attire, but where to visit as some places might be locked from circulation if you don’t plan right. Find out about where you’re visiting. There’s a lot of content online about Cameroon. My friend Emma who runs a listicle based YouTube channel made a video about the top 10 touristic sites to visit in Cameroon. It’s a good place to start your search and then maybe read about the weather[1] and plan better. 2. Transportation
I wanted to start with this one but I thought you’d be better off knowing where you’re going before you think about how to get there. The roads in Cameroon are mostly bad. I am not trying to be angry here. When I compare to what I see in the US ( which I know is totally inconsiderate), I can’t help but wonder why it’s not just the width of the roads, but the state that bothers me. And this is not just a Cameroonian thing, it seems. I haven’t been to other African countries, but I have Nigerian friends who equally complain about the strange inability for local and national governments to use taxes citizens pay to repair roads. What this means is that a lot of your trips will be bumpy. Even if you can afford to hire a vehicle, get ready for long rides, jostling trips, and sleepless journeys. If you’re from a place where you could easily board a plane to get anywhere, this may even shock you more: the main airport in the country may look more like an oversized bus top strapped with a green screen where pictures of airplanes rotate. However, there’s something about the strange travel aura in Cameroon that builds a certain kind of resilience for the uncomfortable. I don’t know if it’s just that Cameroonian ability to look at the bright side of nearly every terrible thing — especially since with the government we have, there’s little brightness left -but some something about traveling within Cameroon will leave you more grateful when you get back to where you come from. And that’s if you can go back. Which leads to the next group of adjustments, the subtle ones."
Medium.com,Life,Anywhere Can Be a Destination,Travel,https://medium.com/one-table-one-world/anywhere-can-be-a-destination-5068db473914?source=topic_page---------295------------------1," Queretaro is a city in Mexico, whose biggest tourist attraction is its aqueduct. For days before we arrived I’d been searching the internet, hoping to find something that would turn Queretaro into a wildly exciting place. I came up empty. It was just a good city to live with a nice atmosphere and plenty of students. In other words, it was the perfect city for my sister to study abroad in but not so much the perfect city to visit for touristic purposes. In the guides I checked, it was recommended as a day trip, a destination perfect for taking walks through its old town and just taking in the atmosphere for a short while. What was I going to do for three weeks? I had promised my sister I was going to be there for her, to make the beginning of her experience easier by sharing it with someone from home. I would hold her hand through the hard parts and do some touristing while she was at school. Determined to discover Queretaro, we covered all five main sights in a day. That left me with three smaller ones for the remaining weeks. I’d brought along some work to do to keep me busy, but three sights still seemed a little thin. What I discovered was really slow tourism. The kind where you have absolutely no agenda, not because you’re taking it slow but because there is nothing to put on the agenda. What makes Queretaro special are its people and the way they interact with each other and watching them became part of my routine. I’d settle into a spot in a café, get a drink and just watch. The little boy chasing his dad, who couldn’t stifle a huge smile as he picked him up. The mother lecturing her daughter and then winking at me and petting her daughter’s hair because she didn’t want her getting too upset. Two teenagers who were holding hands, the boy wondering how he could sneak in a kiss while she was wondering why he couldn’t stop staring at her face as she told him about her day. The grandpa sitting in the middle of his family and just smirking as his toddler grandsons topple and five older children run to pick them up. In Mexico, it seemed, family life was a lot more public than I was used to. Everyone was out in the square, enjoying the last rays of sunshine on their faces in the late afternoon and joining in on the music in the evening. In Germany we have events and when they are over, everyone goes home. In Mexico it seemed that the public areas served as the extension of the home. After all, how can you call a day successful if you haven’t had a chat with your neighbours? Queretaro didn’t have any secret highlights that I’d overlooked, but it did turn out to be a destination worth visiting. It turns out that it’s not your destination that matters as much as your attitude. It’s easy to come to a place with a bunch of expectations. To want the ocean-view room and incredibly natural experiences. But what do you do when there is none of that? You turn the place you’re at into a destination. Find what makes it special and appreciate those parts of it. Instead of going in expecting that the attractions will find you, go out and find the attractions. Why do people choose to live here? What would someone from this town tell you about it? Talk to the people and make your own discoveries. Most of the places I went to were places I’d found on my morning run. The further I ran, the more I’d notice that Queretaro was filled with unique cafés. They were so hipster that I could easily have imagined them existing in Berlin. I’d make a list of places to check out and suddenly I was busy picking where to have my next tea and do my best people watching. Queretaro was not the destination I would have put on any of my bucket lists, but it was the place I was in and it turned out that it could be a destination too. You might not have the means or the days off to travel as far as you’d like or to reach your dream destinations but that’s okay. If you go with an open heart and mind, anywhere can turn out to be a really interesting destination. Travel doesn’t have to be about the perfect Instagram shot or the over the top once in a lifetime experiences. If you think about it, being in a new place, surrounded by people that are completely foreign to you is already pretty spectacular. Travel should be about seeing something new, about understanding someone else better and realising how much there is still left to see. If you embrace travel as an opportunity rather than a sleek package, anywhere can be a destination and everywhere has something to offer. You just have to open your eyes and be ready to go looking for the opportunities around you."

Medium.com,Life,10 Survival Tips for the Business Traveler,Travel,https://medium.com/@karlwiegers/10-survival-tips-for-the-traveling-consultant-e9a4c66ab968?source=topic_page---------298------------------1," A
central aspect of being a consultant, trainer, or speaker is that you usually have to go where the work is. People in many other businesses often need to travel frequently as well, of course. When I began consulting more than 20 years ago, I started to adopt some policies regarding how I would approach my business travel. These policies have made my career as a road warrior much easier. Perhaps they’ll help you as well. Early in my career as a software development consultant and trainer, I had no idea how much work I was going to get, so I gratefully accepted every opportunity that came along. I was fortunate to get traction with the business quickly. As a consequence, I was doing a lot of traveling. My busiest travel year involved 137 flight segments and 131 nights in hotels. It didn’t take me long to decide that I: Don’t travel during more than three weeks of each month. This doesn’t mean that I was gone three-quarters of the time, just that I might travel one or more days during three out of every four weeks. It’s important to set time aside at home to get caught up, maintain relationships with family and friends, develop new training material and other content, write articles and books, and even relax and enjoy yourself (or so I’ve heard). This policy also has helped keep me healthy. Two consultant friends became ill and couldn’t fully recover for several months because their back-to-back travel commitments were so exhausting. The only thing worse than traveling a lot is traveling — and working — while you’re sick. Leave time in your schedule to treat yourself well. Along that same line, I find it very tiring to teach a class more than two days in a row. It’s hard to be witty and charming — both on your feet and on your toes — all day long, day after day. Therefore, if a client asks me to teach two sessions of a two-day class, I will: Take Wednesday off between a pair of two-day training sessions. I might do some sightseeing, visit friends in the area, or take in a movie. My vocal cords, feet, and disposition all benefit from the break. Of course, I don’t charge the client for my expenses or time on the day off. Anyone who travels a lot has had the experience of being stranded overnight, or longer, at an airport or hotel. It happens, whether due to bad weather, mechanical problems, missed connections, or terrorist acts. I don’t worry much about such delays on my way home, but it can be disastrous on your journey to a gig. Therefore, I decided long ago that I would: Never take the last flight of the day to a client site. I’d rather arrive several hours early than miss the engagement because I’m stuck in an airport hotel a thousand miles away. It’s unnerving to have to search for your destination early in the morning on the first day of a gig in an unfamiliar city. Traffic can be heavier or more confusing than you expected, and you might encounter construction delays. The meeting location could be cleverly hidden somewhere in a vast corporate campus, or parking might be problematic. Maybe even all of the above. To avoid beginning the workday with excessive stress, I like to: Practice the drive from the hotel to the event location the prior evening. I’ve only arrived late for an event once in my consulting career, heading into Jersey City from a hotel near Newark one morning. Who knew the highway to the Holland Tunnel into Manhattan would be so popular during rush hour? Everyone except me, apparently. I never again groped my way to an unfamiliar location without a dry run beforehand. I’ve done some work outside North America, going to Europe a couple of times and taking several trips to Australia and New Zealand. I decided I will: Only fly across an ocean in business class or better. Yes, it’s expensive, and no, you don’t get there any faster. But it certainly is a lot more pleasant. I arrive at my distant destination better rested and ready to work. I build the fees for business class airfare into the price quotes I provide to my overseas clients. If they’re unwilling to pay the cost, that’s no problem — I thank them for their inquiry and stay home. Unless, that is, I really want to go anyway, in which case I’ll pay the additional airfare myself or upgrade with frequent-flier miles. I have a consultant friend who thrives on international travel. He and his wife are adventurous people who love to explore exotic locations. I haven’t adopted this policy myself, but Ken likes to: Spend one extra day sightseeing for each time zone change. So if Ken goes to some faraway place like China or India, he takes his wife along and they spend several extra days touring, hiking, or camping. This isn’t a bad way to see the world if you can afford the time and cost. You know all those little bars of soap that hotels give you? I don’t let the extras go to waste. Instead, I: Collect unused hotel soaps and shampoo bottles, and donate them to a homeless shelter. Some people think it’s unethical to steal soap you didn’t use. I view the soap as part of what I’m paying for in the hotel room, so it bothers me not one whit to take the leftovers home. Over the past thirty years I’ve given hundreds of little bars of soap and shampoo bottles to people who needed them more than I did. This policy might gradually go by the wayside as more hotels shift away from all the plastic trash associated with those little bottles. Some years ago I figured out an interesting traveling trick. I learned how to: Leverage airline frequent-flier programs against each other. At the time I concocted this scheme, I held second-tier premium frequent-flier status on United Airlines. I wrote to American Airlines, which flew on some of the same routes, and invited them to match my premium status on United. They didn’t bump me up two frequent-flier levels from basic, but they did bump me up one. “Hmm,” I said to myself, “that was easy.” The next year I tried it again, and it worked again. Then I mailed a copy of my United card and my new American premium-level card to Delta and made them the same offer. Again, they said yes. I pulled off this scheme for several years, parlaying premium status on one airline into others and enjoying the ensuing benefits. It cost me only a few postage stamps. There was nothing underhanded about this — I was simply presenting each airline with a business offer. One year, I held premium status on four airlines without having earned any of them! I recently figured out a way to save money on travel. These days the prices for hotels, flights, and rental cars change frequently. Now I will: Check the prices for hotel rooms and rental cars I’ve already reserved before I leave home. If I find a lower price online, I simply call the hotel or rental car company and they readily change my reservation to the lower rate. I can find better rates this way roughly half the time. Recently I performed this check for five hotels and a rental car I had reserved for a vacation coming up soon. With fifteen minutes of mousing around online, I saved more than sixty dollars off three of my original reservations. I checked again the day before I left and saved another thirty dollars. It’s worth the few minutes it takes to look (unless your client is reimbursing all of your expenses). I’m a planning kind of guy. Having encountered my share of unpleasant surprises when traveling, I now: Adopt small contingency plans to help make each trip run smoothly. For instance, I wear clip-on sunglasses over my regular glasses. Those are quite fragile and hard to find in stores, so now I carry two pairs of sunglasses along in case one breaks (as has happened to me). I place a printed copy of my boarding pass inside any checked baggage in case the suitcase handle with my ID tag breaks off and I need to prove the bag is mine (as has happened to me). I also carry a printed boarding pass in case my phone dies (hasn’t happened yet, fortunately). For overseas trips, I upload scanned images of my passport and other key travel documents to a secure cloud location as backups in case I lose anything important. I’ve read horror stories about drivers who were billed for damage to a rental car that already was present when they picked it up. Consequently, I now take photos all the way around a rental car before I drive it away from the lot and again when I drop it off. So far I haven’t needed that data to prove the car was already dinged when I got it, but I’m ready — just in case. I also carry printouts of some key maps for navigation when I’m driving in the event my electronic navigation device dies (as has happened to me). I view these little precautions as risk management. Bad things like these don’t occur very often and might never happen to you at all. I just feel more confident being prepared. But even the most thorough risk management and contingency planning won’t anticipate an oddity like the toilet in your hotel room overflowing when you flush it first thing in the morning, barely awake — as also has happened to me. (Is it just me?) Sometimes you just have to roll with reality when it slaps you in the face. =========== This article is adapted from Successful Business Analysis Consulting by Karl Wiegers.

Medium.com,Life,The Animal Cafes of Asia,Travel,https://medium.com/@jjtoale/the-animal-cafes-of-asia-2761c3ab9dd9?source=topic_page---------299------------------1," In 2014, Lady Dinah’s Cat Emporium made headlines by becoming the first ‘cat cafe’ in London. It’s popularity grew further after a Channel 4 report on ‘hipster cafes’ in East London, where reporter Symeon Brown took down the owners of the then new Cereal Killers Cafe. But the idea of animal cafes has long been popular across Asia. Tokyo itself has around 60 cat cafes, and across Japan you can find cafes dedicated to rabbits, hedgehogs, penguins and goats. In Bangkok, the Little Zoo Cafe is one of the few where you can find meerkats. Cambodia and Vietnam both have reptile cafes. And not to be left in the dust, South Korea has made a name for itself with its racoon cafes and — wait for it — a cafe where you can hang out with free-roaming sheep in Seoul’s trendy Hongdae district. So where did this idea originally come from and why has it failed to take off in Europe?"
Medium.com,Life,Rim to Rim: The Grand Canyon,Travel,https://medium.com/@tori.styner/rim-to-rim-the-grand-canyon-619d16dbe207?source=topic_page---------300------------------1," “Canyoneering is different than mountaineering” — the first sentence of any grand canyon advice article The journey from the North to South Rim of the Grand Canyon began over 6 months before taking the first descending step down the North Kaibab trail. The urge to hike into the canyon’s depths originated when I stood on the North Rim for the first time as a teenager. I remember looking down, my mind struggling to scope the enormity of the view that lay before me. My 16 year old brain didn’t seriously consider such a hike at the time, but 10 years later found me shivering in Philadelphia’s winter, fathoming how to hike from one side to the other. Below is the eventual itinerary we applied for and successfully completed. Helpful resources are posted at the end of this article for those wishing to plan a similar hike. The rest of this article will explain how we formed this itinerary, the permit application process, and an account of the actual hike itself. We completed this hike during the hottest week of the year, as our first canyon backcountry experience, unaccustomed to the arid, extreme, conditions of the desert in July. The research, planning, and training was as much of an adventure and an act of self discovery as the actual hike was. I ended up changing my habits, my hobbies, and eventually my perspectives on the American landscape while preparing for this extreme endeavor. Only the magnitude of research, training, and planning made this trip successful and enjoyable. Attempting such a hike without this preparation will almost certainly place you in a miserable, potentially fatal situation. Overall, I was radically impressed by how drastically the land in which you live can shape the way in which you live your life in order to survive. Anyway… It was January when the idea of hiking Rim to Rim began inching towards a reality. The winter of that year (2019) was particularly brutal in Philadelphia, not too much snow, but quite a lot of ice and windchill, which I spent a considerable amount of time in. I was commuting to and from my job as a Software Engineer in New York City by riding my bicycle down the Schuylkill River Trail to 30th Street Station in Philadelphia around 6:45am, then taking the Amtrak to Penn Station in New York, then walking to my office near Bryant Park. I was dreaming of heat everyday, and the furnace of the Canyon in the summer must have seemed like heaven to me. Once I got the idea, I had no idea where to begin. Could you just go? How long would it take? Where would you sleep? What would I have to bring? I had the notion that it was not something you could simply ‘wing’ so I began to do what every software engineer does in times of doubt: frantic, relentless Googling until I had a semblance of an idea what to do. Every resources I found said the same thing: The National Park Service DOES NOT RECOMMEND hiking from the rim to the river and back in one day. A multi-day hike it would be. More googling into multi-day hiking trips into the canyon mentioned backcountry permits and campgrounds, but figuring out how to obtain that permit and ‘book’ the campground was the most confusing part to me. A life-long camper and day hiker, I was used to using recreation.gov or calling camp offices to book and pay for campsites. I wasn’t sure at first if you had to book the campsite and apply for the permit separately, and what the actual camping accommodations were like. Hopefully I can shed some light on what turned out to be a relatively simple process. Anyone hoping to safely see the Colorado needs one The demand to spend the night below the rim of the Grand Canyon is so great that the permit application process is essentially a lottery. For the best odds, you must fill out the permit below with a detailed itinerary of your planned route and desired sleeping locations (more on that in a sec). The permit can be mailed or faxed in on the 1st of the month that is 4 months prior to your desired dates. Applications with flexible dates, flexible itineraries, and smaller group sizes are more likely to be approved. I recommend completing this step before booking any unchangeable flights or lodging accommodations. Choosing a realistic and appropriate itinerary is essential to safely enjoying a Canyon hike. Choose one that fits your physical and mental capabilities. Know the skill level of the route you are attempting. Know how much water and food to bring. Once below the rim, you and your group will be isolated. Evacuation is always dangerous, always costly, and sometimes impossible. To be approved for the backcountry permit, you need to figure out: You can propose more than one itinerary per application to increase the chance of your permit being approved. The backcountry permit is the booking process for the campgrounds below the rim (for the campground above the rim, call or book online). Before my training and research of the Rim to Rim hike, I was accustomed to day hikes through much of the North East coast. Think Maine, New Hampshire, Vermont, New York, New Jersey, Virginia, and lots and lots of Pennsylvania. I had never done a multi-day backcountry hike, and had never hiked in anything like the desert. Used to finding day hikes by word of mouth or section hikes along the well-documented Appalachian Trail, I didn’t know how find to a route through the second largest Canyon in the world. Being new to the desert, backpacking, and canyoneering, I was searching for a well-maintained, well-marked route with plenty of water sources that had a couple ranger stations along the way. A family member had gifted us A Falcon Guide: Hiking Grand Canyon National Park. This book was an invaluable resource when I was researching possible trails and forming my route. It outlines the most popular hikes in the Canyon, with recommendations for beginners. All trails have clear descriptions of mileage, elevation gains, access to water, trailheads, trail conditions, ranger stations, and camping options. Using this book, the NPS resources listed at the end of this article, and YouTube videos from people like darwinonthetrail I formed the itinerary posted above. Originally, I ambitiously applied for the following two-day hike: Day one hike down the N. Kaibab to Bright Angel Campground, camp, then hike out the Bright Angel Trail to the South Rim the next day. After a couple weeks Ranger Wunner wisely replied: Experience has shown that hiking from the North Rim to any destination beyond Cottonwood Campground in one day is excessively difficult for most people and all too often result in off-itinerary camping, injury, and occasionally even death. Your proposed hike from the North Rim to Bright Angel Campground is considered to be a very strenuous hike and is not recommended by our office. That day of your trip would involve hiking 14 miles in one day with 6,000 feet of elevation change. We rate this as excessive and encourage you to revisit your plans. I gladly took his advice, re-applied with the added night at Cottonwood Campground and the permit was approved a few weeks later. After some reflection, it was obvious that one night in the canyon was too little. After all, the point of the hike was not to race through the canyon but to be fully immersed in it, to take my time and really connect with the landscape. During and after the hike, I reflected happily on the decision to add the extra night. Altogether, the hike went too fast, and I was glad to have spent more than one night there. So the itinerary was formed and the permit was approved, but the work had only begun. My entire basement was filled with camping equipment, but absolutely nothing I had was appropriate for a backcountry hiking trip in the desert. Typically, 3 days worth of camping filled up an entire car with gear. For a backcountry hike down and up the elevations in the Canyon, we needed to pack ultra-light. So we saved up some money and went on a shopping spree at REI. I highly recommend this store for purchasing backpacking equipment. They have a knowledgable arsenal of staff that are not salesmen but resources. They will ask you the right questions about your trip, provide you with advice on gear, and are generally people who do this type of activity themselves. Also, the company is a co-op, so you can receive money back at the end of the year for anything you buy. The full list of essential gear we ended up with was: Once the gear was purchased, we needed to give it a test run. As a native Pennsylvanian there seemed only one clear choice: The Pennsylvania Grand Canyon, located in Wellsboro, PA. A close friend of mine had grown up there, so we planned a 3 day backpacking trip to test out our new gear. We our whole setup on this trip: the water filter, the cook system, the sleeping pads, the tent. We wanted to be confident in our gear, we didn’t want to familiarize ourselves with it for the first time miles into the canyon. We completed many hikes with our gear prior to the real hike and were glad we did because a few items had to be added or replaced. Both of us were in relatively good shape but wanted to be in peak fitness for the hike. We added more cardio in the form of running and biking into our weekly routines and completed many weekend hiking trips. This conditioned our heart, lungs, and legs for the elevation and altitude changes we would experience in the canyon. It was easy to improve my stamina and fitness because every run I focused on how much harder the hike would be. I literally envisioned hiking the canyon on my runs and ran harder. After spending a couple days in Vegas getting accustomed to the desert heat and enjoying Lake Meade, the Hoover Dam, and the Las Vegas Strip, we headed out from Vegas in a rented Jeep Wrangler. Black, shiny, new; a 2019 Sahara edition with only 6 grand on the odometer and automatic controls for raising and lowering the soft top. On the way, we took a slight detour through the sandstone canyons of Zion National Park, Utah, which I highly recommend if you are driving from Vegas. In fact, I would add an overnight in Zion so you can explore some of the amazing trails they have there. The drive from Zion to the N. Rim is about 4hrs through absolute Arizona desert. The emptiness of it, the total vastness of the alien desert landscape, made us glad to be traveling in a group. The thought of breaking down, being stranded in the lonely heat, was intimidating and present. The four of us are truly North Eastern, used to lush green landscapes of rolling hills, shallow rivers, deep lakes, and rain. We all work and live in East Coast cities of New York and Philadelphia. The crush of people is constant, cell phone service and gas stations are in abundance. A Wawa, Starbucks, Dunkin’ Donuts or McDonalds is nearly always in view. The desert made us uncomfortable by it’s wild vastness. The desert is far from empty, but it is filled with foreign objects to our East Coast eyes, and it’s remoteness overwhelmed us. But it is truly, stunningly gorgeous. The evening settled in as we barreled down straight roads cutting through Arizona, passing shells of towns and other oddities. The darkness was almost complete by the time we reached the N. Kaibab plateau and forest, with me at the wheel for the first time in 8 years. The N. Kaibab Plateau is a dense, protected forest teeming with wildlife that serves as the entrance to Grand Canyon National Park, North Rim. One of the first encounters we had was passing two wild cows having sex on the side of the road. The absurdity of seeing a huge black cow in the wild for the first time frantically plowing another cow, was almost too much to process. The dense wood was pitch black around us, the road curvy, the ascent up the plateau slight. I drove cautiously, wary of colliding into copulating cows in the night, but excited to strain out images in the darkness, around each bend. We arrived at the N. Rim 15 minutes shy of our dinner reservation at the Lodge and sat down to a meal of locally sourced elk, beef, and bass, washed down with beer brewed in Flagstaff. After dinner, we signed up at the front desk for the 5:00 shuttle to the N. Kaibab trailhead, about 2 miles along the rim from the Lodge. The blackness of the late hour of our arrival prevented us from overlooking the canyon and the night was too overcast for stargazing, so we headed into our rented cabin for some rest before the challenge that would come with the morning. The sky was softly illuminated, with a pale but deep light as we boarded the shuttle in front of the lodge at 5:00 a.m. The driver was friendly, his shift was comprised of loading hikers gear into the back of his van and driving them to trailheads. Our descent began at the N. Kaibab trailhead. The N. Kaibab trailhead has a seasonal water spicket and a posting of the weather conditions below the rim at Phantom Ranch (one of the lowest and hottest points of our route). It was late July and Monsoon season was in full swing. The forecast printed on trailhead showed temperatures exceeding 110 degrees and a few chances of thunderstorms. A list of functional taps confirmed our water-restocking plan at Cottonwood and Phantom Ranch. At the top of the rim, the weather was quite chilly, set only to break the 80’s by the height of the day, it was bizarre to experience firsthand the increase in heat as you lose elevation. Our goal was to make it to Cottonwood Campground before 11 a.m. and hide in the shade through the heat of the day. The air was crisp with pine, the trail underfoot rocky and steep as it switch-backed down the canyon. The decline is rapid, you are dropping down a crevasse in the Canyon quickly. Our total mileage for the day would be 6.8 miles, dropping around 4,000 ft. Near the rim of the canyon, the forest is dense around the trail, with greenery similar to what I was accustomed to seeing in the Northeast. Gaps in the coniferous growth showed us dramatic panoramas of the cliffs below, but once below the rim the canyon starts to present itself in pieces. The sweeping views were soon confined by the cliffs rising around us. The rock was dressed in shades of cool blue and deep green in the rising morning light. The dirt of the trail was a dusty red, we could taste it in the air as we beat down the path. The forest shrubbery quickly began to shrink in height, to grow closer to cliff edges, and cactus sprawled everywhere. The sun climbed into the sky as we descended and the air quickly lost it’s chill. Piles of mule droppings here and there were the only unpleasant aspect to the trail, and some extra legwork and attention was needed to avoid stepping in one of these piles. The first “landmark” on the N. Kaibab is Supai Tunnel (~1,200 ft below the rim, ~1.7 miles along the trail). It makes for a great day hike for those hiking from the North Lodge, with water available when the tap is functioning. Our goal was further on to Cottonwood Campground, we had a near full supply of water and planned to restock further down. The route itself is easy to navigate. A clear, wide, trail leads you down from the tunnel continuing on the N. Kaibab. A lot of green still covered the now red cliffs and all was quiet except for the occasional buzz of the insect and the rustlings of squirrel in the shrubs. As we continued our way down, we passed Roaring Springs Canyon, where we saw water shooting off the edge of a cliff into Bright Angel Creek. Beyond that is a Ranger Pump House Station with an emergency phone, and Manzanita Rest Area. Roaring Springs and Manzanita both have water pumps seasonally, but we trekked through them on towards Cottonwood. We reached Cottonwood around 10:30 a.m. and temperatures were already pushing 100. We were glad to have arrived early enough to pick from the shadiest sites. Cottonwood is more of a sleeping area off the trail than a North Easterners’ concept of a campground. It lays right along the N. Kaibab trail and offers around 20 cleared sites, most fringed with short Cottonwoods to provide shade, and all containing a lock box for your food and pack poles to hang your pack. We chose Site 10 based on it’s shade and privacy to pitch our tent, hang our packs, and stow our food. A wooden box with a window provides a place to display your permit to passing rangers, although we saw none that day. A nearby pit toilet and water pump provided us with the basic necessities. The sites are relatively private, due to the Cottonwoods, but we were able to lounge and watch other campers arrived or continue down the trail towards Phantom Ranch. Camp set, we had the entire day to enjoy the beauty of the landscape, explore, and rest. Connor, my hiking partner and partner of 8 years, found a trail behind our site that led to Bright Angel Creek, flowing behind the campground about 300 ft back. The water was cold and clear, with all the colors of the Canyon lining the bottom. Red, grey, white, green, blue, black, all with clear and cold rushing over. A couple large boulders in the center of the stream provided a place to stretch out and rest from the heat of the day, which was well over 100 at that point. We spent most of our time at this creek, cooling off in the painfully cold water, hiding in the shade. Connor was so comfortable on his boulder that he fell asleep on the rock, as I perched on one a few feet away and read a book. The heat started to let up a bit around 4 p.m. so we took a rest in the tent with every intention of rising for a night walk and dinner. Unfortunately, we fell asleep so deeply we didn’t wake up until the next morning, sleeping a full 12–13 hours to repay our exhaustion from our Vegas adventures prior in the week, and the morning hike. Waking around 4a.m., we packed camp and were en route by 4:30 a.m. following the N. Kaibab trail towards Phantom Ranch. It was our first test of “packing out” and we did reasonably well. The mats are inflatable; it takes practice to get all the air out quickly. The sleeping bags could have stayed rolled for all we used them in the heat of the night, the heat hardly lessened to upwards of 85 all night. The sunrise was only an hour off when we started to pack but the sky had brightened enough to begin hiking without our headlamps. We rose this early to safely make it through an area known as “the box” near the bottom of the canyon before 11 a.m. This narrow path follows the Bright Angel Creek through massive walls of the Vishnu Complex, which trap heat to the tune of 120 degrees in the shade. The Box would make up the last 3 miles of our 7 mile hike, so we got an early start not only to safely pass through it, but to enjoy the experience in lower temperatures. The N. Kaibab between Cottonwood and Phantom Ranch is near the bottom of the canyon, we were not far from the elevation of the Colorado River. The entire stretch of trail, around 7 miles, was a wide, flat, lush length with a shallow descent. Huge carpets of Prickly Pear cactus, with deep purple fruits lay in blankets along the trail edge. We spotted the stalks of Yucca plants reaching up out of their spiky bases, and likened them to giant asparagus spears. There were scrubby shrubs among the cactuses, giant boulders of red rock, and lizards running off the sandy path before us as we walked. We spotted a ton of Spiny lizards, Desert Iguanas, Whip Tails, and a handful of Collard lizards. Here and there among the lizards, yucca, cactus pear, and shrubbery, we caught more rare sightings of blooming pink flowers and shorter pricklier, barrel-like cactus. We were alone on the trail each day, and were grateful for our isolation; it was what we sought. The sun had not risen to the point where it’s rays touched the path in front of us, so the temperature was under 90 and made for setting a good pace. The Canyon here was utter silence, broken by the stabbing of our trek poles in the dusty, rocky, path and the crunching of our steps. There was a particular insect that seemed to favor the shrub-like trees that would buzz threateningly as we passed and the occasional swooping of the jays and finches. The trail was exposed here, an expanse of scrubby, shrubby meadow filled with chunks of geology millions of years old. The trickling rush of Bright Angel Creek faded in and out, as the path meandered alongside it, the air smelled like stone and dust and water. We caught glimpses of the South Rim far off in the distance. Soon though, this open Canyon narrowed, the walls of red grew taller and closed in as we continued South. The box is defined by Bright Angel Creek, sheer cliffs of the Vishnu Complex rose on either side, exposing rocks that were over a billion years old. There were 4 bridges total spanning the creek, and the trail was easily the most maintained here in the box. Wide and flat, it was easy hiking and we marveled at the shock of geology around each bend. At no point did we see much of the trail in front of us, it curved and wound in a way that left us gasping at each new reveal. The Canyon gradually began to open up after about 3 miles, and views of the S. Rim reappeared. Plant life and lizard quantity was in abundance as we approached Phantom Ranch. Phantom lay before Bright Angel Campground, where we would be spending the night. Eager to score a campsite in the shade, we hiked right past Phantom, planning to settled into our site and return with our day-packs later. Only another 5–10 minutes up the trail, we reached it in no time and selected a site right alongside Bright Angel Creek. A man already camped for the past night was nice enough to direct us to a different campsite with better shade, so we ended up at site 21 which wasn’t directly on the creek, but provided better shade coverage for the whole day, which is essential in July. We set up camp, leaving the sleeping bags rolled after the wasted effort of unpacking and repacking them the night before. It was only around 11 a.m. at this point, but the heat was definitely already over 100. We were famished from skipping a larger meal the night before, so we got our simple propane burner boiling water for our dehydrated feast of Pad Thai. The Colorado River is a short hike from Bright Angel Campground and we were eager to see it, knowing that we would cross it in the darkness the following morning. One word for the Colorado River is “muddy”. We hiked down to “Boat Beach”, were a lot of the river tours dock for a visit to Phantom Ranch. I had read enough accounts of the strength of the river and it’s victims to attempt more than dipping my feet in. As we lounged by the river, we watched a couple raft outfits come shooting around the bend of the river and successfully dock at or pass the beach. The S. Kaibab trail crosses the river via the Silver Bridge, which was built by Native Americans and the CCC. We walked up the S. Kaibab a bit to view some ruins left by the native peoples of the canyon quite a long time ago, then walked over the Silver Bridge. The heat was so great at that point that all we wanted to do was return to the campsite and lay in the creek, but it was a very worthy excursion from Bright Angel, since we would be taking a different trail (The Bright Angel) out the next morning in the dark, crossing the Black Bridge. Phantom Ranch deserves it’s own section, it was truly one of the most unique places that I have ever had the honor of visiting. Bright Angel Campground, another 5 minutes up the trail, houses most of the hikers while Phantom Ranch hosts those lucky enough to have won the lottery in tiny air-conditioned cabins, many of who arrived by mule down the Bright Angel Trail from the South Rim. There is a corral for these beautiful, sure-footed animals, ranger residences, staff dorms, and a canteen for rangers, campers, hikers, lodgers alike. Much to our pleasure, the rumors of the canteen serving cold beer are very much true and to our astonishment, patrons can use a card to pay. We were able to enjoy a few beers (Phantom Ranch Red and the Bright Angel IPA) by Lumberyard Brewing (Flagstaff) in the air conditioned blessing of the canteen. We also enthusiastically wrote post cards to our families that were to be carried out by mule. Unfortunately these were never sent as we neglected to address them, being millennials that have a lack of understanding about how the postal system works and due to the severe buzz acquired by two beers each and a day of hiking in the desert. Around 4pm, we were treated to an excellent ranger program about the Pink Rattlesnake, a species unique to the Grand Canyon, delivered by Ranger Kate. We were totally fascinated by the staff’s commute to and from Phantom Ranch, and their work during their 8 day shift at the bottom of the canyon (spaced by 6 days off out of the canyon). After the ranger program, we hiked back to our campsite and lounged in Bright Angel Creek. The evening program was cancelled due to a badly timed lightening storm, but it was exciting to see monsoon season in action anyway. Later that night, we took a brief night-exploration of Phantom Ranch and did some star-gazing, but retired early for our 3a.m. pack out to beat the heat on our hike out of the Canyon. We arose as planned at 3 a.m. for our hike out. In addition to being our last, it would be our longest and most strenuous hike yet, in the most intense heat. Seasoned veterans now, we packed camp quickly and efficiently, drank some freshly brewed coffee, and began hiking by 3:30 a.m. while the darkness was still complete. Headlamps were a must, we crossed the Colorado via the Black Bridge and began a shallow ascent up the Bright Angel Trail in utter blackness. The air was wet and humid for the first time, being so close to the Colorado, and the temperature had only cooled to the high 80s overnight. We kept a strong pace, occasionally spotting the distant headlamps of earlier risers a mile or so above on the switchbacks. The trail was rocky and hugged the cliffs dropping to the Colorado below, only heard, not seen. We were extra careful in our footing, guided by the red light of our headlamps, drinking plenty of water in anticipation of the rising sun and sheer ascent ahead of us. As the sky lightened, the walk became easier, the trail wide and flat, still a shallow incline but soon enough it became steeper. The cacti and plant-life, so large and dense on the Canyon floor below began shrinking in size, and the lizards were not as underfoot as before, although still in abundance. The views of the lower South Rim became prominent, although we would be unable to see the actual for hours and hours yet. Indian Garden would be our next stop, halfway along the mileage (but not elevation) for the day. Great walls of black rock shelved the trail on either side, and the hiking was still easy. After the extreme heat and barrenness of the canyon below, the trail leading up to Indian Garden seemed like a wetland oasis. Tall, lush trees clustered in dense patches providing glorious shade and there were deer everywhere. We sat on benches in the shade and brewed some more coffee and ate some salty snacks and prepared ourselves for the main ascent out. We would be gaining 3,000 ft in under 5 miles of trail, hoping to reach the rim before the full heat of the sun. The two miles from Indian Garden to 3 Mile Resthouse passed easily, where we stopped to resupply on water and snack. The trail from 3 Mile Resthouse to Mile and a Half Resthouse began to gain elevation quickly. While we still couldn’t see the rim, we began to see day hikers. It was a strange feeling after being so isolated on the trail for days, to see people wearing stylish clothing without huge lumbering packs. By the time we reached Mile and a Half Resthouse, the air was noticeably thinner, the sun was hitting the trail, and the heat was rising. The last mile and a half was easily the most challenging hike I have ever completed. The trail was a vertical wall of steep switchbacks with almost no shade coverage. The number of people on the trail increased dramatically, languages of every origin floated by, people from all places, of all ages, were descending for day hikes. The rim and the trailhead finally appeared, with a last burst of energy we picked up the pace and hand in hand Connor and I crossed stepped up onto the South Rim, to the Bright Angel Trailhead. Temperatures at the South Rim when we reached it around 10:30 / 11:00 a.m. were close to 100 degrees. We had spanned the Colorado in the darkness of the night. We had hiked 8 hours through the rise of the day to climb well over 4,000 ft along 8 miles of trail. Finally, we stood happily next to the Birght Angel trailhead and looked back out over the great distance we had just crossed. We tried to locate North Rim lodge, the start of our journey, and couldn’t. We were emotional. I have never felt more proud of an accomplishment in my life than in that moment. I have never felt so isolated, so dwarfed in awe of such an alien landscape that was brutally harsh and beautiful at the same time. We stood on the South Rim and silently reflected on all the planning, willpower, endurance, cooperation and patience that had brought us here. We felt such gratitude for the experience, for the untamed wildness of the canyon, for the fortune in our lives that had allowed us the privilege of such a journey. Our packs were heavy on our shoulders. We were elated from our exertions but exhausted and in need of a shower, a beer, and a fancy meal. The South Rim bears the most traffic from tourists to the Grand Canyon each year. Grand Canyon Village is located right off the Bright Angel Trailhead and offers amenities that the North Rim lacks. There are plenty of rim trails to explore, and the Rest houses down the Bright Angel trail serve as excellent day hike destinations.There are lodges that double as restaurants, some gift shops, museums, and a cafe. A free shuttle offers passage to further lookout points along the rim, camping areas, and to more shopping. Anticipating our desire to rest and explore our destination, I had booked a room overnight at El Tovar and passage the following day on the 3p.m. trans-canyon shuttle. The shuttle would ferry us back to the North Rim to retrieve the Jeep and spend one last night at the North Lodge. El Tovar is easily the best place to stay on the South Rim. The lodge itself is old and beautiful, the rooms cozy (if a little outdated), and the dining room excellent. We made a reservation for dinner that night at check in, and enjoyed some locally brewed beer on the porch while we waited for our room to be ready. After taking one of the best showers of my life and a changing into newly purchased socks and shirt from the El Tovar gift shop, Connor and I set out to explore. A paved walkway borders the rim, the views are unobstructed and spectacular. But, after the steep, sandy, wild route in and out of the canyon, it seemed too groomed. We spent the day lounging and learning about the history of tourism in the Canyon and appreciated all the educational material along the rim trail. After an excellent dinner at the lodge we retired to an amazing nights sleep in an air conditioned room. The shuttle back to the North Rim is run by some extremely friendly folk. The drive is breathtakingly scenic, it circumvents the deepest parts of the canyon to cross at the little Colorado junction. Our driver made certain to stop for gas breaks at the more interesting locally-owned gift shops along the way. It was a long ride but we didn’t mind the chance to rest and watch the scenery roll by. We arrived back on the North Rim later in the evening in time to hike one of the North Rim trails to watch the sunset. As night fell, the sky was clear enough for stargazing so we took a couple beers out to the porch and experimented with some star photography. It was our last night on the Canyon, we were loathe to go to bed. We simply did not want it to end. But all adventures must end and we were knew we were lucky for the honor of our experience. So with glad hearts we went to bed. The next morning, we drove out of the N. Kaibab forest in the light, laughing about rutting cows in the night. We were lucky enough to spot some buffalo lounging far off in a field instead. We left the North Kaibab plateau and headed to California, where we would explore Joshua Tree National Park and finish the trip off lounging in Santa Monica. Thanks for allowing me to relive my experience in writing this. I hope in sharing it you will be inspired and fortunate enough to complete a journey of your own :) A Falcon Guide: Hiking Grand Canyon National Park Over the Edge: Death in the Grand Canyon"

Medium.com,Life,"The Devil’s Wind: A Legendary Wind Blows Through Florence, Italy",Travel,https://medium.com/@margolestz/the-devils-wind-a-legendary-wind-blows-through-florence-italy-a8f42eb63dc3?source=topic_page---------304------------------1," I was walking through Piazza del Duomo in Florence admiring the beautiful cathedral and trying not to be trampled by tourists. It was lunch time, so I was also keeping my eye out for somewhere to eat. I saw Kaleo Art Caffè, which looked very inviting, so I went inside. It was a beautiful little place with art deco styling and a nice menu. But along with the tasty edible offerings listed on their menu, they had also printed a little legend pertaining to their location — Piazza del Duomo and Via dello Studio. Well, I can’t pass up a good legend, so I read it first — before even looking at the food. It went like this… In the Duomo square, close to Via dello Studio street, you can usually feel a light breeze. But sometimes that little breeze will suddenly pick up and turn into a whirlwind. The Florentines have named this phenomenon the Rifrullo del Diavolo — that is the Devil’s Sigh or the Devil’s Wind. It seems that in days gone by, the Devil used to wander the streets of Florence at night searching for souls he could take back to Hell with him. One dark and dreary night, he set his eye on a priest. The priest wasn’t keen on giving up his soul and started to run. But after a long chase, the Devil nabbed him. It was just in front of the cathedral, and the priest begged the Devil to let him have just one last prayer before he lost his soul. The Devil was in an agreeable mood that night, so he let the priest go inside the cathedral to pray. He waited outside — because, as everyone knows, the Devil does not like churches. But the clever priest had a plan: instead of getting down on his knees and praying, he ran out through a side door and escaped. The Devil had no idea the priest had tricked him. He was still waiting outside. After a while, he became bored and let out a sigh which made a light breeze blow through the piazza. After a bit more time had passed, he realized that he had been tricked. He huffed and puffed, and his angry breath created a strong gust of wind that swirled all around the piazza. Ever since that night, the Rifrullo del Diavolo has never stopped blowing. The Devil is still sighing, and sometimes huffing and puffing, as he waits in vain for his chosen soul to come out of the cathedral… I smiled. I had enjoyed the story in my menu, but I hadn’t noticed any wind when I was outside. Maybe it was a slightly exaggerated legend. My delicious Kaleo salad came and I had a nice leisurely lunch then got ready to leave. And just as I walked out the door, a big gust of wind slapped me in the face and blew my hat off! That Devil was still mad… But boy was I glad he only wanted my hat and not my soul."
Medium.com,Life,Don’t be the Ugly American,Travel,https://medium.com/@shefaliohara/dont-be-the-ugly-american-c1f99fbc76b9?source=topic_page---------305------------------1," I recently returned from a vacation to Europe. I traveled to places I’d never been before — Hungary, Austria and the Czech Republic. I had an amazing time and didn’t want to come home. However, it was not all a bed of roses. There were times I was inconvenienced. This is part of reality when you travel in other countries. There are times you will be annoyed. You might be tired, you might be lost, you might be homesick, and you just don’t want to deal with one more irritation. Maybe you’re dirty and you don’t want to have to learn how to use their weird shower, you just want to get clean so you can go to bed. When this type of thing happens, I remember something I learned from my mother, “Not all fingers on the hand are the same.” She says this in Gujurati, her native language. It means that not all people are the same. When I travel, Mom’s wisdom keeps me from turning into the Ugly American. After all, I remind myself, this is why I travel. To experience new cultures and new perspectives and to discover unique beauty. Nothing inspires me so much. Yet nothing in life is perfect — neither the good things or the bad. In the midst of tragedy, there will still be hope. And in the midst of something amazing, there will be annoyance. When I went to Greece, I experienced the breathtaking sunset on the caldera in Santorini. But to get there, I had to deal with the annoyance of Greek plumbing. I had to stick used toilet paper in a container near the toilet. It was disgusting. I could have complained, or focused instead on the beauty I experienced. It was my choice. I chose not to be the Ugly American. Similarly, when I talk about the awe that filled me at St. Stephen’s Cathedral in Vienna, or the wonder of a morning walk along the rim of the Grand Canyon, or the delight of climbing an ancient Mayan pyramid — these experiences were not hassle-free. This is part of traveling. We get to experience something we could never have at home, but it comes with experiencing other, less pleasurable things we’d never have at home. Like getting sick from the water. Or making a dinner of stale nuts because the shops are all closed. Or climbing countless flights of narrow, steep stairs because a 500 year old structure does not have an elevator. It helps to remind ourselves that each country and culture is different, that people have different ways of doing things, and we are here to experience it all. And, of course, it’s not just Americans who can be ugly… I still remember a guy from Sweden I met a few years ago. “Where are you going?” I asked him. “Out West to see the National Parks,” he replied. “Oh, you’ll love it,” I enthused. I used to live in Colorado, so I told him about some of the sights he might enjoy that might not be in a tour guide. We chatted comfortably for a bit, but then he started to complain. American cars were too big! And there wasn’t enough public transport. And the food — he couldn’t stand American food. Why did they always put ice in the water? After listening to his tirade for a few minutes, I had had enough. I said, as gently as I could, “You know, you didn’t have to come here. If you dislike it so much, you could have stayed home.” He glared at me, but had no comeback. He and I both knew that, in that moment, he was being the “Ugly American”. Don’t be like him. When you travel, be gracious. Be open to new experience and new ways of doing things. If you don’t like something, remember — not all fingers on the hand are the same. Thanks for reading!

Medium.com,Life,The Mystery of Venice: Where Are the Everyday People?,Travel,https://medium.com/this-must-be-the-place/the-mystery-of-venice-where-are-the-everyday-people-f4b54b69c098?source=topic_page---------308------------------1," Being surrounded by all the Venetian beauty reminded me: I had some explaining to do. How was it possible that I was on my fourth trip to Italy, and I was only just then getting around to visiting Venice for the first time?

Blame my romantic heart, which was raised on radio and on Hollywood. I’d put off Venice for decades because I didn’t want to feel as alone there as Katharine Hepburn did at the beginning of the 1955 film Summertime (for which she received the sixth of her 12 Oscar nominations for Best Actress). Who wants to be solitary and self-conscious in Italy’s city of love? Although I love to travel solo, prefer it even, I always thought Venice should be different (probably as a direct result of seeing Summertime). I wanted my first time to be special. I was waiting for the right person with whom I could make it a truly memorable pilgrimage-for-two. So I went to Rome, Florence, Milan, Genoa, and Bologna first. I met Italian men as handsome and as charming as Hepburn’s Summertime co-star Rossano Brazzi. I fell in lust and in love — sometimes in one night — and I continued to delay the inevitable. Then, 14 years after my first trip to Italy and at least two unforgettable flings that didn’t make it to Venice (Paolo and Massimiliano, thanks for the memories anyway), I decided to take the plunge on my own. Stepping onto the Venetian islands for the first time after the short bus ride from Mestre on the mainland, which is where my hotel was located, I immediately backburnered thoughts of romance. It was neither the time nor, apparently, the place. Maybe Venice had changed as much as fashion had since the 1950s. In the August 2013 version, there were no elegant, wealthy-looking tourists, no sartorial eloquence (to quote an old Elton John song), no Rossano Brazzi doppelganger to make that day the most memorable and romantic of all the days I’d previously spent in Italy. There were traces of old-Hollywood glamor in the city’s postcard views, but her sparkle was matte, dulled and weathered by the decades. Still, she looked a lot nicer than I did, with my running shorts, gray V-neck Topman t-shirt, and black Havaianas sandals, snapping away with my Samsung digital camera. Maybe I was part of contemporary Venice’s problem. (I’d left my Samsung smart phone in the hotel safe because Venice deserved to be captured the old-fashioned way — irony intended.) Most of the gondolas were docked. The few traversing the waterways carried tourists who were too busy trying to capture every moment on film to actually take it all in. Though it was not as sophisticated as the 1950s Hollywood version, Venice was just as beautiful. On one building, over a sign that read “SOTOPORTEGO DE CORTE VECHIA,” I could see the water from the canal being reflected on the building at high noon. But Venice’s endless photo ops eventually began to blend together. It was like looking through a supermodel’s portfolio and seeing him/her strike gorgeous pose after gorgeous pose. Eventually, well, you wonder: But do you have anything else going for you?

With a city, that’s the difference between a one-day stand and a longer-term relationship. Think about it: Does anyone, even people who absolutely love it, visit Venice twice, the way they do Rome, Florence, and even Milan? My first impression, confirmed after hours spent getting lost, literally and figuratively, in its maze of nooks and crannies, was that something was missing. Oh, yes, people who don’t fall into one of two categories: tourists and those who cater to them. It’s not that I hadn’t been warned. During the month of August, several people told me, many Italians flee the hot major cities and head to the cooler lakes and coastal areas. So Venice was seasonably quiet and deserted, not at all the crowded, flooded, smelly madhouse I was told it sometimes can be. For an occasional borderline misanthrope like me, the underpopulated streets were actually something of a blessing.

Surely, though, some locals must have stuck around to sweat out the dog days of August. Perhaps, I thought, they preferred to remain behind closed doors than come out and face what had become of their city, if Venice, in fact, ever was the Venice presented by old Hollywood. The further I ventured from Piazzale Roma and Piazza San Marco, where Katharine met Rossano in Summertime, its whir of activity and throngs of arriving and departing tourists, and wandered down the skinny lanes and alleys so pivotal to the city’s charms, the more I saw clues to the locals’ existence. On the outerskirts, I passed several well-dressed Italians carrying groceries. When one of them cheerfully apologized to two middle-aged British women for not being able to speak English after giving them directions, one of the tourists insisted, “But you’re speaking English now.” The muffled sounds of televisions and radios blasting inside apartments, the open but empty Oasis Gym in one part of town, and, most auspiciously, clotheslines connecting buildings on opposite sides of the street from above, added to the city-specific character. Welcome to the real Venice.

Normally, I don’t like the idea of people publicly airing their dirty laundry, even if it’s been cleaned and is merely being hung out to dry. In Bangkok’s five-star hotels, displaying it on your balcony could get you a hefty fine. But in Venice, in a strange, subversive way, it almost added to the visual appeal of the city. It proved that despite all of its tourist trappings, everyday people, real Venetians, lived and breathed there, too."

Medium.com,Life,The Wedding Road Less Traveled,Travel,https://psiloveyou.xyz/the-wedding-road-less-traveled-4fa822c743c7?source=topic_page---------310------------------1," October 1st, 2005 was an auspicious day. At least according to the Buddhist monk that officiated our wedding. The journey from first date in October 1998 to our wedding on October 1st, 2005 was a long one in many ways. We met in Washington State on Sept 21st, 1998 at my friend’s wedding (Auspicious? Maybe.) Four great years of dating and living together during college led to me decide to come to Japan to marry Chieko and become an English teacher in 2002. Life isn’t always a romantic comedy though and there were a few very big hurdles to overcome before we could tie the knot. Before I could move to Japan I had to find a job. Tourist visas are only good for three months. A working visa was the best option for me if I wanted to stay in Japan longer. Chieko returned toher home in Nagoya, Japan in July 2002 after her student visa expired. I moved back to the Seattle area from our college town up north in Bellingham and took a job at a bank. In my free time I applied for teaching positions in Japan. The school season in Japan though is from April to March, so I was applying at the wrong time. Most English schools in Japan don’t get serious about hiring for teaching positions until December. So I spent July-December sending out resumes with very little interest. Then in late January 2003, a small English school in Sendai, Japan offered me a job. Even though it was about five hours from Nagoya by Shinkansen (Bullet Train) and about nine hours by bus, the cheapest way to get there, I jumped at the chance. Sendai was fantastic in many ways, but I was pretty lonely being that far away from Chieko. At the time she was attending college again to get a teaching certification. I continued to teach, fail miserably at learning Japanese, and explore Sendai. After one year in Sendai I was able to find a new teaching position in Gifu, Japan, only one hour by train from Sendai. Being able to see Chieko a lot more often made life in Japan for me much better for me. I finally felt like we were making some progress towards our goal of getting married and living together in Japan. I spent a cold winter and hot summer , but a good year overall, in Gifu teaching at another small school where I made a lot of really good friends. Finally, in 2005 I was living and working in Nagoya. Chieko had finished her degree and we made plans to get married. Our original plan was to have a beach wedding in Hawaii. To us it made perfect sense. Hawaii was in between Japan and the West Coast of the US where most of my family and friends lived. But for some reason my son to be father in law wouldn’t have it. He insisted that we get married in Japan. This unfortunately meant we would have to also do something in the US as well since most of my family wouldn’t be able to make it to Japan for our wedding. So, we had a small pre-wedding dinner for my family in August in Seattle which also doubled as our pre-honey moon. When we returned to Japan though we faced another dilemma. Weddings in Japan come in three flavors for the most part, Shinto weddings, Shinto/quasi-Christian weddings, and the extremely rare Buddhist weddings usually reserved for Buddhist monks (yep, monks in Japan can marry). Shinto weddings are pretty conservative and performed at Shinto Shrines. Neither Cheiko or myself were conservative, so that wasn’t going to work. Shinto/quasi-Christian weddings are not so conservative, but they are pretty tacky and horribly expensive. I say quasi-Christian because they have all the trappings of a Catholic wedding, but in a wedding hall (fake church) and conducted by an always foreign and almost always fake priest. (Nothing against the fake priests by the way, plenty of my friends make a good living doing it). At that time I wasn’t an atheist, far from it actually, but I definitely wasn’t a Christian, even a quasi one, either. And neither of us wanted to make the three costume changes required for one of these things. You start out in your traditional wedding garb like in the picture at the top of the article, then switch into a western style wedding garb for the “Catholic” part, and then do one more costume change at the end into your after wedding party costumes. I was convinced I’d end up getting confused and walk out into the wedding crowd in my underwear at some point. So, that one got scratched real quick as well. That left us with Buddhism. My wife had grown up Shinto/Buddhist of course and I was at that time extremely interested in Tibetan Buddhism. My wife did some research and found out that you don’t have to be a monk or even a Buddhist to have a Buddhist wedding in Japan. Furthermore, she learned that her family’s temple, Higashibetsuin Temple could perform the wedding ceremony for us. This made her father very happy and to our surprise Buddhist weddings, possibly because they are uncommon, are unbelievably affordable compared with our other options (about $2000 at that time compared with $10,000 minimum for a Shinto/quasi-Christian one). It was half the price of even a beach wedding in Hawaii if you included the plane tickets. And with that, after going through a few things a month or so earlier including the monks deciding on an “auspicious” weekend for our wedding, on October 1st, 2005 we were married! If you are interested here are some of the details about having a Buddhist wedding in Japan. One last piece of advice in case you have read this and said to yourself, “Too cool dude! Me and my fiance are there!” I would recommend a Fall wedding if possible. Summers in most of Japan other than maybe Hokkaido or way up in the mountains somewhere are going to be horribly hot and humid. Spring is awesome, but also the most popular time for weddings, so it might be hard to book one. Winter, again depending on where, is probably going to be pretty cold and also potentially hard to book if it is around the end of December or into January since that is when the New Year’s holiday takes place in Japan. Weather-wise late September through late October is usually pretty good (ruling out typhoons that is), things aren’t too busy in terms of holidays and tourists, and if you time it right the falling leaves in Japan can be spectacular. So there you have, Buddhist weddings in Japan 101!"
Medium.com,Life,How you can help to combat overtourism in Norway (and beyond),Travel,https://medium.com/@dannymaiorca/how-you-can-help-to-combat-overtourism-in-norway-and-beyond-670e28deac7c?source=topic_page---------311------------------1," You have the power to change more than you think. Perhaps you’ve experienced this before. You’re away in the mountains, on your own, at peace with your surroundings. Then, you approach the end of the hiking trail and… bam. Beautiful scenery stands before you, but it’s obstructed by hordes of tourists. At that moment in time, you might be wishing that there was something you could do about this seeming invasion of selfie sticks. Well, there is. We’re going to discuss ways that you can help to change things for the better today. For the sake of context, we’ll look at tackling this issue from the angle of Norway. These tips, however, can be applied to wherever you go in the world. According to Innovation Norway, tourism numbers here grew by over one million between 2011 and 2017. In 2017 — the year in which the most recent statistics are available — more than 18.3 million people visited Scandinavia’s easternmost country. And while Norway is large in terms of size, we have to remember that its population is lower than 5.5 million. It’s worth noting that many of these visitors come during the summer months, when the temperature is warm and the days are long. In cities such as Bergen and Ålesund especially, July and August are popular for travel. That doesn’t just equate to busier hiking trails and cruises — accommodation also becomes pricier. For people with flexibility, this actually offers a tempting opportunity. Norway’s hiking season normally lasts until September, so if you’d still like to see the popular spots then you might discover that this is a much better (and cheaper) time to travel. Alternatively, head over during the winter months and give skiing a try instead. You can even do this in Oslo! That feeds into Visit Norway’s new marketing initiatives, which have sought to promote the country as a year-round destination. You can also help to combat mass tourism by taking inspiration for another Nordic country — Iceland. On this island in the North Atlantic, authorities have sought to promote its lesser-visited spots to ease the burden on well-trodden paths such as the Golden Circle. And tying back to Norway, almost everywhere is beautiful. You don’t even need to leave the capital region to find dramatic scenery. Consider shifting your outdoor adventure from Trolltunga to Oslomarka for a more authentic Norwegian experience. Another way that you can leave a smaller footprint is by choosing more eco-friendly accommodation. Sustainable holidays are growing in popularity, and hotels are starting to adapt to this. One example is Svart Hotel, which is “the world’s first energy-positive hotel”. It’s scheduled to open in 2021 and will be located in the Arctic Circle. Compared to similar hotels, 85% less energy will be emitted on an annual basis. Sustainable places to stay can be found in other popular outdoors destinations, too, such as Switzerland and Kenya. Doing research prior to travel helps — look out for places that recycle more and only wash your towels when necessary too. It might seem as though one person alone is helpless in stopping the effects of mass tourism, but that’s far from being the reality. Off-season adventures are more rewarding, while you should also reach out to locals and discover their favourite spots away from the popular tourist trails. Opting to stay in accommodation which cares about the environment will also minimise the impact you have, as will leaving every place in the same state it was in when you arrived."
Medium.com,Life,I Traveled To Japan But What I Found Was A Disappointment,Travel,https://medium.com/@Doody.Richards/i-travelled-to-japan-but-what-i-found-was-a-disappointment-9549dbba99ae?source=topic_page---------312------------------1," I was fascinated by YouTubers claiming their best places to go in Japan on their travel channels. I browsed travel photos from the famous lonely planet and found myself mesmerised by tranquil, majestic Arashiyama bamboo grove, and even the dawn at Senso-Ji temple, only from looking at their photos. I wanted to be there right away if I could. Those photos are enticingly captivating. I succumb to Japanese tradition, culture, and modernism as the professional travel advisors describe in their guide books read by millions of people worldwide. So I decided to travel solo to Japan six months ago but what I found was a disappointment. Japan tourism is booming. According to the United Nations, the World Tourism Organisation from 1995 to 2012 tourists visiting Japan increased from 3.3 million to 8.4 million. 6% of growth rate is undoubtedly an achievement. In 2017, there could be 28.7 million tourists visiting the rising-sun nation. The number will continue to grow following the Tokyo Olympics games 2020 followed by Paralympics in the same year. The ANA staff from the check-in desk at Sydney airport even hung a little note on my luggage, wishing me a safe and pleasant holiday to Japan. When I arrived in Haneda airport Tokyo, as soon as I walked out of the customs-exit, I was already impressed with Japanese punctuality, attention-to-details and efficiency. I was the only passenger at the last stop at the Hilton hotel in Shinjuku — I stayed at the hotel nearby. The bus driver bowed as he wished me a pleasant trip and to look after myself. I didn’t walk out of the airport with a flower garland on my neck, but Omotenashi, Japanese hospitality, gave me a natural, warm welcome. Kyoto is probably the city with the most hospitable customer service of all the three cities I visited — Tokyo, Kyoto and Hiroshima. The shop assistant carried my shopping bag and escorted me to the shop front at one of Kyoto’s shopping centre. This kind of customer services, while the west sees it as unnecessary; on the other hand, I feel privileged — the type of treatment and privilege I don’t have back in my home country, Australia. I was even amazed by their convenient stores, such as seven eleven and Lawson. Attractive packages of lunch boxes, snacks, and even a banana beautifully wrapped in beautiful packaging. They are freshly prepared and quite affordable for a budget traveller like me. There’s nothing like it. But no one told me I need to queue for almost everything. I started my day earlier than usual because, on that day, I travelled to Arashiyama bamboo grove then followed by Kinkakuji temple and Nanzen-Ji temple. It was 6:30 am, but people have made a long queue to get a seat at Honshu coffee at Kyoto station although it opens at 07:00 am. On Miyajima Island, I was looking for the end of the queue only to get on the ferry back to the main island. The lines started from the ferry terminal down to Itsukushima shrine main entrance — about 5.6 kilometres long. There are ridiculous long queues for almost everything; temples, museums, restaurants, cable cars, train station exits, markets and even bamboo grove. Not to mention the time when I got in the wrong queue after fifteen minutes of waiting because I didn’t understand what the staff said to dozen visitors of Mori Art Museum in Roppongi and had to start all over again on the next queue. Japan drove me mad. Though most restaurants and cafes welcome foreign tourists by putting on the sign ‘English Menu Available’, there was one time in Hiroshima, the restaurant denied my entry. The female staff showed me the cardboard sign in English. It says ‘We are fully booked. Sorry, we can’t serve you’. I looked around, and the restaurant had many seats available. Though I explained, I was alone, and it would be a quick one, the staff escorted me to the front giving me no-means-no head shake. I can only assume the English sign is the gate to reject non-speaking Japanese visitors. As a first-time solo traveller to Japan, I needed a professional travel advisor to guide me and a few travel tips. Relying on youtube channels, travel website to Japan, blogs and social media travel influencers seem like an easy way, but the problem is, they are ubiquitous. All of them claim the ultimate experience of the best places to go in Japan. It takes time to research here and there, and I didn’t have much time left. I made a brief stop at Kinokuniya bookshop, and I found Lonely Planet Japan. I browsed through pages of the book. The Arashiyama bamboo grove photo on the welcome page captured me. I couldn’t stop looking at it, admiring the scenery with two elderly were seen walking on the brown, dirt footpath. On the other page, there was a photo of Senso-ji temple at dawn. The golden sunrise looked stunning. It was how I imagined Japan would be for the rest of my trip: tranquil bamboo grove, beautiful morning at a temple, and Cherry blossoms raining on me as I walked along a quiet river. Unfortunately, when I was there, those photos didn’t do Japan justice. There was no tranquil bamboo grove and spectacular sunrise at Senso-Ji temple. Arashiyama bamboo grove is nothing more than a tourist circus; tourists, with selfie sticks taking their snapshots as many as they could here and there, rude tourists approached you only to make you a camera self-timer plus tripod and walked away, man-powered rickshaws shooed people away, blocked pathways reserved only for those who sight-see the grove on a rickshaw. Tourists jammed Senso-Ji temple that you could barely walk. Visiting a temple is nothing more than a sight-seeing of endless souvenir shops. Don’t get me wrong. Japan is a beautiful country with endless possibilities of discovery, but my disappointment is with professional travel photos and travel guide books. Some travel advice only seems to fit for other expert travellers who are paid to wake up early in the morning to skip the crowds. A professional travel photographer to capture the best snapshot when no one is around then editing it by laying many filters and colour adjustment to make it more appealing. I will revisit Japan for sure, but only this time, it’s time to put down my travel guide book and let myself explore Japan as the way it fits me. Like this story? Find more here"

he small gated community of Fuggerei is a charming German village that traces its origins back to 1520 and is a unique tourist experience that is well worth a visit despite the price of admission. No, I haven’t lost my mind, and no, the headline isn’t a typo. It really will cost you more than four times the annual rent paid by the village’s 150 residents to visit the village. But don’t worry as the rent hasn’t increased here in almost 500 years. You see, that’s what makes this place special; the cost to live in one of the 67 homes or 147 apartments in the village is just 88 euro cents , or about one single U.S. dollar. So don’t stress, as a tourist, your entry fee will only set back €4 per person. Built by a wealthy German banker, Jakob Fugger, in 1520 as a social housing complex open to poor and needy residents of Augsburg, Fugger’s mission continues to help needy residents to this day. Funded largely through the charitable trust Fugger set up to bankroll Fuggerei there has never been a need to raise the rent. People on low incomes can live in Fuggerei for an annual base rent of 88 euro cents and three daily prayers. T
here are a few rules though — some of which have applied for almost 500 years. For starters, only needy Catholic Augsburgers need apply. Ancestry, age and family status are not deciding factors. Alongside the prayer requirements, the residents are also required to perform small services for the common good of the community, such as serving as a night watchman, sexton or gardener. The village gates are open until 10 pm daily. After which, residents wishing to enter must pay the night watchman a sum of 50 euro cents, a fee that doubles to €1 if they arrive after midnight. For a village of its age, Fuggerei’s infrastructure was before its time, and its linear layout of buildings, paths and public spaces make for an enjoyable stroll that even today gives visitors to the village a sense of a well-ordered and idyllic atmosphere. Set on 15,000 sqm, Fuggerei occupies a sizable plot of land near Augsburg’s city centre and contains 67 houses, each with two residences. Construction on the housing development began in 1516, and over time, St. Markus Church, two museums and an administrative building were added to the village. For visitors, taking a stroll through the streets is akin to walking into an architectural history book. From ivy-covered houses with timber-framed windows to the intricate detail of the gargoyles peering out from behind the greenery and the village’s well-maintained gardens, visitors could be forgiven for thinking that they’d passed through a portal in time at the village gates. If you ever find yourself in Augsburg, I recommend taking an hour or two out of your day to visit this masterpiece of social housing history as it’s well worth the time and the price of entry. From Munich airport, take the S-Bahn S1 or S8 to the Hauptbahnhof (main train station), and once there change onto a German Rail (Deutsche Bahn) train for the 45 minute trip to Augsburg. Adults €4 per person
Children (8–18 years old) €2 per person
Concession (groups of 10 or more adults, seniors, students, disabled individuals) €3 per person
Family ticket (2 adults, up to 4 children under 18) €8
School classes up to 30 students (with two teachers) €15"

Amid all the inconveniences of business travel, there’s a mind-altering agent at ground zero in the transit hub. If you pay it the right kind of attention, it can realign priorities, expand horizons, even change your identity, at a glance. As Alain de Botton tells us, departure boards are portals, offering infinite and immediate possibility: they suggested the ease with which we might impulsively approach a ticket desk and, within a few hours, embark for a country . . . where we understood nothing of the language and where no one knew our identities.
— A Week at the Airport: A Heathrow Diary These signposts are tangible evidence of how our universe might shift, given sufficient impulse and credit-card float. In more poetic terms, they put us at Robert Frost’s storied intersection: Two roads diverged in a yellow wood, And sorry I could not travel both And be one traveler, long I stood And looked down one as far as I could To where it bent in the undergrowth . . . Yet these air and rail destinations, stacked, differ in kind from Frost’s fork in the road. They are neither binary nor untrodden. Allusions and associations shimmer. The names beckon like exotic, untasted goods. Considering their various merits, we map ourselves onto them. Or climb out of our moorings entirely. The imagination quickens, longing stirs. We’re already off leash. Why not make a run for Athens or Miami or Boston or Sydney? It’s all right there. The truth about the world, he said, is that anything is possible. — Cormac McCarthy, Blood Meridian Possibility, however remote, is a gift, an open door. In a few old world travel hubs, the totemic quality of a departure indicator is amplified. An unfamiliar sound, and attention flicks up. The display is an old-style Solari board. A train departs, the flaps seethe and whir and re-form, destinations shuttling ever upward. The slats sound like they’re applauding their own conjuring act. We watch spellbound as termini move up and out. These boards are so irresistible to the ears and imagination that there’s public outcry when they’re replaced by more efficient digital displays. Commuters beg that one or two remain, holdovers of a more romantic era. Departure boards bring pleasure for other reasons (at least when there are no delays). They’re communal, a gathering place (“let’s meet under the big board”). And they speak to the part of us that craves signals — in this case a track or gate number — that commit us to action. If, as responsible people, we turn away from possibility and carry on to our ticketed destination, we may feel one last surge of good vibes. We’re reliable, in touch with but not deranged by our dreams. A crazy impulse has been overruled; we’ve done the right thing. Like any great temptation, pushed away, a departure board centers us, after a few giddy moments of utter freedom. It’s a trip within a trip. Given the indignities of time spent in transit, an extra minute in thrall to the departure board is well worth it. For these moments, mentally at least, we are weightless, bestriding the globe."
Medium.com,Life,Travel Writing — How to Keep Calm and Carry On,Travel,https://medium.com/the-ascent/travel-writing-how-to-keep-calm-and-carry-on-a8c502f88f75?source=topic_page---------317------------------1," Being a Travel Writer is the perfect job. You are paid to stay in amazing hotels, eat in the best restaurants and often get behind-the-scenes experiences that you wouldn’t have as a regular visitor. Companies have realised that the Internet is a powerful tool so, whilst they want you to experience these places, they also want articles that will inspire others to visit. A travel writing trip is action-packed and the writer is expected to absorb the atmosphere, as well as be able to convey all the practical information that will help others have the same experiences. I’m currently living in Japan and I recently managed to get a freelance writing job which took me to some of the lesser-explored parts of Kumamoto prefecture. It was three days, paid for by the local tourist association, where I would tour the region in a rental car, stay in two, very different hotels, eat some of the most amazing food I’ve ever tasted and take hundreds of photos. I then had to write six articles which would be published on their website. It was my first time doing this kind of thing and, amongst the excitement, I felt a lot of pressure to get it right. It’s one thing writing for yourself and another writing for someone else. I was looking forward to taking my writing to the next level though and hoping to inspire others to follow in my footsteps. Waiting for my flight early in the morning at Haneda airport, these feelings cascaded through my head. ‘Everything will be fine’, I told myself. The company made everything really easy. The detailed itinerary was correct down to the last Yen. It included a map with all the places I would visit handily plotted out. All I had to do was put in the phone number of where I was going (Japanese car navigation systems use phone numbers) and click 'GO’. I realised that I was lost when I passed the same golf course three times and learnt the first lesson of my trip: the sat nav doesn’t recognise all roads. Luckily, I flagged down an elderly Japanese woman and asked her for directions, in extremely basic Japanese. She went a step further and insisted on guiding me to my destination, walking in front of the car along narrow mountain roads. I was extremely touched by this kind of gesture and, as we parted company, we exchanged a series of ceremonial bows of gratitude before she disappeared into the woodland. The best thing about having a rental car is being able to stop at smaller places along the way and I found a nice cafe for lunch. Old, wooden tables were arranged in a courtyard that overlooked rice fields. It attracted a young crowd with several couples and young families excitedly talking about their adventures. As I slurped my iced coffee, I browsed the photos I had taken on my laptop before taking myself off to the bar to order. I’ve lived in Japan long enough to realise that my belongings would be perfectly safe. A few minutes later, I was weaving my way through the tables, clutching a wooden sign with my order number. I noticed a group of young kids chatting at the side of the table with my laptop sitting there, patiently waiting for my return. Suddenly one of the kids lent on the side of the table, making it wobble. The motion was enough to make my iced coffee rock from side to side and my heart sink. It suddenly toppled over, sending a surge of ice cubes and coffee on to my laptop. The kids looked at each other before casually walking out of the restaurant. I frantically rushed over and grabbed my soaked laptop. I looked around at other tables in desperation but no one wanted to help the foreigner who had been so careless with his expensive laptop. I hailed a waiter who instinctively brought over some paper towels but they were no use. My laptop was unresponsive. That evening, with my device laying on the bed like a sick child, I searched the Internet on my phone, looking for answers and trying to ignore recommendations to put it in a large tub of rice. Where would I find a large tub, let alone that amount of rice? But, with two days left, I had to carry on with the trip and I would need to sort it out when I got back to Tokyo. Thankfully the rest of the trip was uneventful and I even began to accept the loss of my laptop. I reassured myself that it was relatively old (it wasn’t but it made me feel better) and I would save up for a brand new one that would be faster and have better graphics. Surely, nothing else could go wrong. When you’re heading to the airport, I think you fall into three types of people: Type 1 — you are so afraid of being late or, worse still, missing your flight, that you arrive very, VERY early. Type 2 — you don’t want to spend longer than necessary at the airport and pride yourself with having never missed a flight yet. You would rather have an extra coffee in the centre than pay airport prices anyway. Type 3 — you have missed flights in the past and your travel plans are generally chaotic. You are normally late to the airport and take your chances on there being a long queue at departures. I was having such a good time in Kumamoto that I didn’t think to check how long it takes to get back to the airport. Nor did I think about traffic or torrential rain. The skies opened on the way back and suddenly the roads were a series of lakes, with cars swerving to avoid each other like dancing swans. I tried to stay calm all as I watched the time on the dashboard clock tick by. I also realised that I needed to return the car full of fuel so I frantically typed in petrol station and hit go. I arrived at the petrol station a few minutes later and began ploughing thousand Yen bills into the automated machine, struggling to stay calm. I had about 45 minutes until take off and still needed to return the car. Luckily I made the flight by the skin of my teeth but it was certainly a stressful experience. Maybe I need to re-evaluation which category I fit into… In just three days, I had been lost on mountainous roads, ruined my £1400 laptop and almost missed the flight (and possibly crashed the rental car trying to get to the airport). Sure, mistakes happen but I couldn’t help thinking that they could have been avoided with a little forward planning. I could have printed my route out instead of relying on the sat nav. I could have been more careful with my laptop and not left it unattended. I could have allowed more time to get to the airport (and perhaps checked the weather forecast). However, without these experiences, I would have nothing to improve upon so I learned from them. I remained (mostly) calm and focused on getting the job done. When I sit reading over my finished articles, it will all be worth it and, if nothing else, I learned to keep calm and carry on."
Medium.com,Life,East Coast Trek — Part V:,Travel,https://medium.com/the-northern-point/east-coast-trek-part-v-8ff1efbfbfa9?source=topic_page---------318------------------1," And so, we were. And it was a treat. In 1776 in another hot summer the second Continental Congress came together. 56 representatives of the 13 British colonies who would later be the 13 American colonies or states. For most of 1776 two factions in the congress debated whether or not to secede from the Kingdom of Great Britain. In the end King George made the decision for them as he took away all their rights as British subjects and ignored their demand of representation but upheld taxation. Despite accessibility problems — more on this in a later installment of this series — we had finally been installed in a beautiful hotel right smack in the center of historic Philadelphia about 50 meters from Independence Hall. The Independence National Park is different from most other National Parks in the US as it is situated in the center of a major city but since it is a national park the staff consists of Park Rangers as you meet them in places like The Shenandoah National Park or Yosemite. The good thing about that, I guess, is the focus on preservation just like in the nature park. Although I suppose the chances of running into a bear in the greater Philadelphia area are rather slim. So, your picnic basket should be relatively safe. We started our visit — as recommended — in the Visitor’s Center. In our case it was mostly because we had bought tickets for the tour of Independence hall at 2.30 and had to pick them up. The Visitor’s center was essentially a long indoor walkway with a couple of movie theaters and a book shop of to one side and the public restrooms to the other. We used the center to get a drink of water in the shade on an increasingly hot day and get our bearings in the area — essentially a whole city quarter. We launched our tour of the park from the Visitor’s center and went across the street to the Presidents House. In the 1790s it became the residence of the first two presidents. Both George Washington and John Adams spent their one term of presidency in this building. As the website very symbolically states: “The President’s house in the 1790s was a mirror of the young republic, reflecting both the ideals and contradictions of the new nation. The house stood in the shadow of Independence Hall, where the words “All men are created equal” and “We the People” were adopted, but they did not apply to all who lived in the new United States of America.” The house itself no longer stands in its full three-story-glory. Washington called it “the best house in the city”. But some of the walls have been rebuilt and today it exists primarily to emphasize the dilemma build into the new republic from the very beginning: the problem of enslavement. On the walls were pictures and stories describing the enslaved people in American society. Right next door to the Presidents’ house were another modern building housing perhaps the most potent symbol of America independence — the Liberty Bell. The bell — highly symbolically — cracked sometime in the 1840s after almost 90 years of being in use. This was the sound that called the members of the Continental congress to their meetings, so it was often used. In 1846 in time for the George Washington birthday holiday on February 23rd. The deep crack that is seen in the bell today is the result of the repair, that incidentally was unsuccessful and when further fissures in the bell appeared shortly after the bell was decommissioned forever. Normally as both the Presidents’ house and the Liberty Bell Center lies “in the shadow of Independence hall” most people probably just go straight on to the Liberty Hall tour. But our tickets weren’t valid until in the afternoon, so we decided instead to pay a visit to the Franklin Court and the Benjamin Franklin museum. The Franklins build what by all accounts was a beautiful brick house in the yard behind their properties in Market Street. Franklin lived her during his service on the Continental Congress. Twenty years after Franklins death the property had increased so much in value, that Franklins heirs decided to tear down the house and in stead build rental row houses. We entered the courtyard through the arched carriageway Franklin build from Market Street. Today the court has been cleared and a steel frame based on the dimensions in Franklin’s property insurance has was erected in 1976. No definite picture of the property existed. So, we were met by the white metal structure in the form a stylistic house. The Benjamin Franklin museum is located underground. In true spirit of Franklin, a highly interactive exhibition exploring Franklin’s live, legacy and thoughts through artifacts and interactive videos. After renovations in the 1980s the whole area is accessible to people with mobility impairments as well. From a bold and innovative representation of the past we went on to Independence Hall. Originally the seat of the Pennsylvania’s three branches of colonial government as the Pennsylvania State House — including the supreme court for the colony. What became the meeting hall of the second Continental Congress and later the Constitutional Convention 11 years later was on loan from the Pennsylvania legislature. The room became a shrine to the founding of the USA and the legislature had to move elsewhere. Originally the Assembly Room held the Liberty Bell and portraits of the Founding Fathers. As well as a statue of George Washington. The portraits and the statue is today on display in the portrait gallery in The Second Bank of America. The complete restauration of both courtroom and assembly hall stirs a sense of history and the Ranger who guided our group skillfully painted a picture of the actions of the Continental Congress in the summer of 1776 culminating in the signing of the Declaration of Independence and later on the Constitution of The United States. Just like both the Declaration of Independence and the Constitution are documents very much alive even today the historic settings of Independence Hall puts you in the very center of the birth of the American Republic.

Medium.com,Life,Zero Degrees of Separation,Travel,https://medium.com/@carollennox/zero-degrees-of-separation-c15e50c98139?source=topic_page---------319------------------1," Wherever you go, there you are. No one is sure where the saying “Wherever you go, there you are,” came from; maybe Confucius, maybe some obscure zen master. It almost has the ring of a Yogi Berra malapropism in its simplicity. He of the “It ain’t over till it’s over,” fame. And “I didn’t really say everything I said,” which has been tried by every shady character ever. To be clear, the former manager of the Yankees was not shady. He just had the hilarious gift of making zen-like statements without meaning to. Maybe I’m mixing my own metaphors, but zero degrees of separation, and wherever I go, there I am, seem closely aligned to me. Have you ever tried being truly incognito? Or running away from yourself? It just isn’t possible today. I ran away to Italy recently. Sort of. I did let people close to me know I was going. But I went alone, and unlike the other times I’ve traveled alone, or with my son when he was young, this time I didn’t know anybody at my destinations. The traveling writer/blogger. The psychotherapist on vacation. The mysterious older woman on her own. Or all of the above, and more. Or none of these. I chose all of the above, and more. But mostly, I didn’t ask what other tourists did back home, or volunteer any of my descriptives. How better to play with, mutate, or rediscover your own identity than somewhere no one knows you? One of my best exchanges was with a fellow airline passenger who spoke Chinese and a smattering of Italian. I spoke no Chinese and not enough Italian to count. She didn’t speak English. We struggled with charades until she got on google translate. You would have thought it was the scene in Helen Keller movies where she first associates the symbols her teacher is forming in her hand with actual objects. We both lit up and began typing like crazy. I dont know what she thought my profession was before we went to google translate, but I suspect she thought I was a teacher of the deaf. Ironically, she may have gotten this impression from my miming of listening to my clients. I’ve never been good at charades. She was an acupuncturist, but I knew that because she showed me pics of her work. It’s hard to find pictures of psychotherapy, what with confidentiality and all. What does this have to do with no degrees of separation? Only that she and I eliminated separation through technology and desire to communicate. And we intend to stay in touch. In the Mediterranean village of Monterosso, I met a couple from London at my first dinner there. They were at the next table in that outdoor restaurant overlooking the sea, and Sharon blithely asked me a question. Bless her heart, as we say here in Texas. As in, I’m not sure she knew what she was getting into, making friends with me. She now expects a visit from me to her home in London. That’s how I roll. So we became friends, and even more so when we met for lunch at the same restaurant the day they were leaving. She, being the master connector she is, clarified where I live and what I do for a living, because she had met a young, brand-new married couple, the night before, and they were from Austin! Plus, the bride worked in a hospital as a physical therapist. Obviously, according to Sharon, we had to meet. She gave me their names and showed me a picture. Normally, I would have let it go. Austin is a big place. Too damned big, many of us think. Please don’t move here. The next day, I was sitting across from my hotel eating breakfast, and noticed a beautiful young woman sitting alone at a close by table. She looked familiar, but not enough for me to know who she was. An extremely good looking guy joined her who also looked familiar. What the hell? Monterosso is the largest of the very small villages on the Mediterranean, making up Cinque de Terre. I had only just learned of them, and had made last minute reservations at my hotel, then traveled there by train, the only way to access the villages. Maybe you could drive, but even if you could, why would you want to brave those tiny, twisting roads? After staring for awhile at the couple, I asked, “Are you Bethany and Joshua?” Indeed they are, but until I mention Sharon, they look at me suspiciously. They were the couple from Austin Sharon had met. We became instant Facebook friends. Will we become actual friends? Who knows. But in that instant, in a country across the ocean from our own, with an age difference, we connected. With travel becoming more accessible, and the internet making other people, countries, and languages a click away, there really are no more degrees of separation. Which, to my mind, means no excuses for not studying, understanding and having empathy for others. A lack of interest. Arrogance. Complacency. I watch tourists, and see so many people who travel in groups and therefore don’t have to mingle much with the local citizenry. They traverse a place with an almost rabid focus on seeing everything they can possible see in one day, and then collapsing in their hotel. I presume the hotel part, but saw the focus up close and personal. In Florence, where parts were as crowded and bustling as Disneyland or Manhattan during rush hour, a woman bumped into me with one of her very large breasts. Without glancing at me, she kept moving. Pedestrians wandered aimlessly and obliviously in front of cars and scooters, who had to screech to a halt. With that many tourists overcrowding the inhabitants, the locals sometimes closed off from us behind the language. I’ve discovered that knowing enough of a language to laugh at something funny they say to one another is a sure fire way into being treated like I exist for more than just my spending. They drop their mask, and acknowledge me in an entirely different way than before. It’s a palpable difference. I’ve become a person to them, not just a tourist. That’s one reason I don’t do seven cities in seven days, or whatever. I stay in one place long enough to visit a restaurant, coffee shop, or bar several times, so I get to know them and they get to know me. I feel safer that way of course, traveling alone, but more than that, I get glimpses into what their lives are really like. It’s also why I don’t always tell what I do at home. I want to see behind their personas as business owners and servers, and I want them to see me for who I am without the descriptives. With fellow travelers I meet in random restaurants, I want us to be relaxed enough away from our real life to see each other as people, not as titles. Our jobs and titles can be used to hide behind, just as language “barriers” can be used to pretend there is a vast distance between us and them. We do take our confirmation biases and unacknowledged prejudices with us into the world, along with all our better qualities, so wherever we go, there we are. We can learn enough of the language to say please, thank you, and even to pick up on humor, the great equalizer. I sometimes joke about “tourists,” which takes people off guard. We can offer help and safety to strangers. We can open our hearts and minds to the experiences of others. We can treat refugees selling in the street like the humans they are. We can stop acting like people’s actual homes are nothing more than a tourist attraction for us. We can do our part to create zero degrees of separation."
Medium.com,Life,The Time My GPS Almost Got Me Arrested,Travel,https://medium.com/@mschoenholtz/the-time-my-gps-almost-got-me-arrested-5a4948208d62?source=topic_page---------320------------------1," Lessons learned from an accidental off-road adventure in the early days of GPS Most of us take GPS technology for granted, but it was once in its infancy and I was an early adopter. I had a little device that went on top of my dashboard. It couldn’t route me anywhere and it had no voice. There were no Starbucks or gas stations. I could only see my position as a fat arrow on a crude green and black pixelated map, along with my speed and direction. One September afternoon I found myself in northern New Mexico. After eyeballing what looked like a reasonably approximate route, I decided to take the back roads from Santa Fe to Los Alamos. Who cared if I didn’t know the precise directions? I was guided by satellite power! I would never again suffer the humiliation of stopping and asking for directions. I left the main highway, and drove northwest through the sagebrush-dotted hills. After about half an hour, the asphalt turned to dirt, but I was exhilarated as I drove with impunity and no paper maps. I would never again suffer the humiliation of stopping and asking for directions. But soon large rocks and deep ruts began to fill the the road, which got steadily more rugged until I saw tree stumps growing right in front of my car’s mostly plastic grill. I was still in denial when it dawned on me that perhaps my pixelated GPS map wasn’t quite ready for prime time, and maybe I wasn’t even on a road, but was actually in a quickly narrowing dry creek bed. It sure looked like a road on the little green screen. As if on cue, I came around a corner and found myself facing the upper Rio Grande river, which definitely couldn’t be forded with a Chevy whatever-I-rented. OK fine, I can take a hint. I’ll just turn around, I thought, and try to find out where I went wrong. I must have missed something back there. Some time later, I found what looked like the original road I had wandered from, turned left, and resumed heading in the general direction of Los Alamos. Finally, after what felt like three hours in the S.S. Minnow, I was only a couple of miles from my destination. Just as I was about to turn west onto NM 502, a padlocked chain link fence appeared across my path. I was mere inches away from the state highway, but it might as well have been 100 miles, because I didn’t have enough gas to turn around and go back to the beginning. I got out of the car and stared at the padlock in disbelief, wondering how I was going to get around it. To my relief, a patrol car pulled up on the highway side of the fence, and the sheriff sauntered over to me to ask, “What are you doing here?” I explained what had happened; that I’d taken a GPS adventure and gotten lost, and could he please let me out. “Well you’re on sacred Indian land, and I’m supposed to arrest you for trespassing.” I was incredulous and rambled, “OK maybe I missed a turn when I ended up in the dry creek, but I swear I didn’t see signs of any kind. I’m really sorry. I would never have gone this way if I’d realized I was trespassing. And my GPS didn’t say ‘Sacred Indian Land’ or ‘Reservation’ or anything like that.” “It’s clearly marked. You can’t miss it. Wait here.” Like I might go someplace else. He walked back to his car, and got onto the radio. As I tried to decipher the muffled conversation, I began to ponder the phone call I was about to make from jail. I hoped my wife would be at home back in Connecticut, although this might possibly be the last time she would ever let me wander off without adult supervision. A few minutes later, the sheriff returned and unlocked the gate. “I just spoke with the tribal police, and apparently someone shot out the signs a few days ago, so they told me I can let you go.”"

His eyes moved rapidly from the small white crumpled bag that was being proffered at his shoulder to those of his mother who sat behind me. She must have nodded her assent as he promptly dug into the bag, bringing out his prize. “Don’t forget your sister,” Mum reminded him as the bag stayed in place by his side. He found something suitable for his 2-year-old sibling and then remembered to say thank you. Sock Lady withdrew the bag and the children settled to chewing. I had joined the 10.17 number 100 bus service at Westgate for the short journey up the valley to Killhope and its well-regarded mining museum. The locally run Weardale Travel mini coach makes the journey from Crook to Alston three times on a Sunday and it was clearly busy when I took my seat. Four lasses on the back seat were discussing a running route in the beautifully accented sing song dancing tones of the north east and a gentleman at the front chatted intermittently with the driver, usually as the next bus stop came into view with prospective passengers. All were commented on; either through recognition of a regular client or, as with Jelly baby family, the challenge of fitting four and a pushchair into a small vehicle. We all squashed in together, people adjusting bags and conversation to accommodate new members of our pop-up travelling community. The driver turned off the A689 and took us across the ford into the car park of the Mining Museum. It was just after opening time, so I decided to start my walk with coffee and teacake in the café. It gave me a few minutes to go through the route on the map and I was intrigued by an unfamiliar label — what was a hush? The Visitor Centre receptionist explained that it was where the lead had been mined. Water would be collected uphill in dams and then was released to run over an area where the force would remove the topsoil and unveil the lead beneath. It was effectively a method of pressure washing that allowed for a primitive method of open cast mining. As I reviewed the map, I could see the linked dams and hushes and made a mental note to look for them on my route. Killhope Museum sits near the top of Weardale in the north of England and it is a wild and exposed spot, with remote farms dotting the moorland and a huge sense of sky. It fills the view and the day. This morning I had a delightful cerulean blue backdrop with a sun already at Mediterranean temperatures and a very pleasant breeze. Suncream lashed on, hat and sunglasses in place, I set off up the forest track that starts the Weardale Way. The route is designed to introduce walkers to the varying landscape and history of the Wear Valley from source to sea and it isn’t fully faithful to the river as a result; it rather prefers to tell the wider story of the region that the river serves. The paths near the birthplace of the Wear wander through its remoter parts but they are not far from the A689, the valley’s backbone. Its transport value and associated economic impact is important to the communities that line these upper reaches; indeed my bus cuts its regular daily groove along the tarmac. Therefore, stepping out into a wild moorland landscape where there is little more than sheep and grouse is not shrouded in silence. There is a background rumble and hum of traffic. It is a popular biker route and the spoiled child wail of sports bikes, deep throated throb of Harleys and middle toned tourers brought an operatic edge to the varying homogeneity of the car, van and truck chorus. The traffic became a muffled distant white noise as my path led me up behind a large stance of conifers and I found the first of the old dams. The water level was high enough for the trailing branches of the damside trees to sit on the surface and the water mirrored each perfectly. The stillness and serenity offered an unexpected balm after the busyness of journeying and I stopped to absorb and slow my mind and heart to the subtle pulse of a landscape that beats a different tempo. I followed tracks around long disused quarries and along a necklace of farmsteads decorating Killhope Burn. It was easy going where I could focus on the view rather than my feet. The valley begins to show its character here as well as offer a glimpse of rural life. Various ducks, dogs and geese heralded my approach along the path like a Mexican wave and a steady high pitched whine alerted me to a overalls clad chap hidden behind a rowan in his garden. He had an electric sander and was busy removing some ancient paintwork from his kitchen door. He stopped working and removed his mask, turning to see me as I walked past. He smiled in greeting. “What colour will you paint it? The same blue” I asked. “No, red,” he replied, “Like the colour of my front door.” I walked along the path so I could see the front of the house and then walked back to continue the conversation. “Nice red,” I commented, “Like a pillar box” “We’ll have to see how long it lasts. The weather is not always kind. I don’t get up here as often as I should so thought I’d make an effort while the sun is out. Bit of a rare event really”. He paused, studying my rucksack. “Maybe I’ll go for a walk later, while the paint dries”. “Good idea,” I agreed, “Better than watching it.” He grinned and I waved my farewell. The path took me closer to the valley floor where I joined the Killhope Burn. This and its companion Burnhope Burn join at Wearhead where, as you’ll note from the name, the river is born from their union. Here, stream and river chatter filled the walking space with a rhythmical splash and whisper as the water rushed and tumbled over limestone ledges into pools. Whether in burn side meadows or wooded glades, the water’s song was an unceasing, soothing constant. And it is why I walk here. Whether in it, beside it or bridging it, a river pulls me into its simple journey, washing away life’s complexities and detritus with its paradoxically gentle yet inordinately powerful focus. Many made the most of the warm sunshine to play in the water. Parents coaxed youngsters into canoes and swimsuited rose hued mothers filled the air with cries of “Be careful” as dogs yapped and children swam and paddled. It was lovely to see and hear on a day when the river was in generous mode. Pools were just deep enough to swim in but not to lose your footing. Mini waterfalls were perfectly sized to sit in and enjoy the massaging flow. Benign and nonchalant today, the Wear was the welcoming playground that brought families and friends together; river and human chatter entwining in rich refrain. I returned to my car at Westgate after 9 miles of a wonderful introduction to the valley that has left me wanting more."
Medium.com,Life,Tiny Houses,Travel,https://medium.com/the-bad-influence/tiny-houses-265326c24055?source=topic_page---------323------------------1," Minimalism and living in a tiny house. I’ve been focused on the dream for nearly ten years now. It started with my friend, Brandy. “Here, look at this YouTube video!” Or “look at these pictures!” It took nearly nothing to hook me onto the idea. For me, it’s not about saving money (though it can). It’s not about finally living in a house — I’ve been a home owner for over twenty years. No, for me, it was the fascination with the idea that I didn’t have to live on the grid. That I could move my house wherever I wanted. I could explore. I never realized how much I needed that freedom until I flung myself to far away places to visit people I’d never met before to drive myself places I’d never been. My curiosity thrives on travel, exotic or not. Ten years is a long time to wait for dream fulfillment. My children had to grow up and finish college before I could even attempt getting my home ready for sale. But I could do other things. I pared down everything in my crawlspace until I’d reduced it to an amount that no longer required any use of that space. I went from looking at the stuff that I have as needing to be stored to linear feet of space taken up. I once viewed my objects as stuff that I need. Now I look at most of my things as ‘nice to haves’ but not entirely necessary to lead my life. (I will always need a hammer.) Back in 2010, though, tiny houses on wheels weren’t legal. They didn’t have any real designation. And they weren’t exactly on anyone’s ‘good’ radar. I’ve watched them go from fringe to mainstream. I signed and donated where I could to push forward the tiny house agenda. They were specifically named in the international builder’s code (Appendix Q)—and are slowly being adopted across the United States as something viable to live in. There are tiny house communities sprouting up all over the US as well. People value debt-free lifestyles over competition with the Joneses. It’s a slow process, but one that I’ve felt is the right direction for sustainable living. Or will be if people temper their need to have everything at the expense of planning better. It excites me to know that a good portion of people living in tiny houses also live off the grid. I listen to their stories on podcasts. I’ve purchased tons of e-books and plans. I’ve participated in not one, but two live free tiny house question and answer sessions (Before You Build by Ethan Waldman). Years of gathering from websites later, I’m almost within grasp of complete downsizing and tiny living. When I walk through my current home of 1975 square feet, I slip into that fantasy side of pretending I’m in my smaller house with smaller footprint, less people, and even less stuff. That two hours I spend one day a week sweeping my floors? I imagine myself both sweeping and mopping my floors in under fifteen minutes. Despite having a working dishwasher, I do my dishes by hand to practice not having an extraneous appliance. My basement houses cats and a roommate, but other than laundry, I don’t use the space. I’ve given up kitchen and bathroom cabinets in favor of reducing what I use to a small handful of dishes. Surprisingly, despite that downsizing, I still have plenty of dishes to throw murder mystery parties and provide full on meals with multiple courses. It requires slightly more dish-washing, but not much other effort. There is a dark side to tiny house living. Food smells linger. Composting toilets require a manual to use. Less space for people…is less space for people. Despite how widespread the knowledge and fan base of tiny houses are, they aren’t accepted everywhere. Mold loves tiny enclosed areas with little venting and air flow. Not all builders are created equal, and DIY home-building can be a gamble if you don’t have the right knowledge or skills. And yet. I love the tiny houses, still. There is a place in the future where I may not succeed in living in one, but I’ll cross that bridge when I come to it. In the meantime, I’m completely in love with the idea for now."

For many of us, the mere idea of zero waste travel feels completely unattainable. But is it? How close can we really get? I was curious about what simple swaps I could make to reduce my impact on the environment. It turns out, it was a lot less complicated than I thought. There’s no doubt that we, as a nation, need to recycle more, but that’s only one piece to the complex puzzle of battling global warming. Recycling alone isn’t enough. I wanted to go beyond just tossing my empty aluminum can into the recycling bin. Bea Johnson, author of the best-selling book Zero Waste Home, who whole-heartedly practices what she preaches, writes on her blog about rules she lives by. And, yes, only in that order. She says you should first refuse what you do not need, reduce what you do need, reuse what you consume, recycle what you cannot and rot (a.k.a. compost) the rest. Here are some additional ways to reduce your impact specifically when traveling is involved. Start small. Try something new on your next trip. You might be surprised by how easy it is. Travel is about experiencing things, not about collecting souvenirs or trinkets. Go out and see something new, just be mindful along the way of your environmental impact. If we all just do a little, we might help get this planet back on track."

I drove the nine miles up from Big Pine at 4,000 feet elevation to 7,500, and a sign from the bible appeared—a neon rainbow growing straight out of Owens Valley."

Medium.com,Life,Walking Across Britain — why I’d like to have been born 800 years ago,Travel,https://medium.com/@laurasheridan_28545/walking-across-britain-why-id-like-to-have-been-born-800-years-ago-2887dcac79a2?source=topic_page---------332------------------1," I was born in the 20th century, which didn’t have a great start with Suffragettes having to fight for the right to vote, industrialisation polluting the atmosphere and two horrendous World Wars. By the time I arrived, the prospect was a little brighter — Moon Landings, colour TV and The Beatles. But if I’d had the choice, I’d like to have been born in the Middle Ages, some time around 1300 to 1350 AD. What? Are you crazy? Yes, I know. That was a terrible period of history. The Black Death or Bubonic Plague raged through Europe; ordinary folk were poor and hungry with a short lifespan; lack of scientific thought led to superstition and fears of witchcraft; no books, no career prospects and little protection from thieves and murderers. Houses were rough huts — one room shared with goat, hen and pig. Not an idyllic existence by any means. Ah, but this was the time of Geoffrey Chaucer, creator of The Canterbury Tales. The pilgrims in his stories walked from Southwark to Canterbury, telling one another tales along the way. That’s what I would have done. Not been a pilgrim (I’m done with religion); I’m talking about the travelling bit. Walking the length of this beautiful land of ours. I’d take my time, rest a lot and sleep under the stars. A companion or two would enhance my pleasure and give me someone with whom I could share experiences. What was Britain like in the Fourteenth Century? Far fewer people, for a start. Currently, there are around 67 million people in the UK. The population then was around five million (though the Black Death reduced that to around two and a half million). So no built-up areas, crowded urban districts, concrete, cars and skyscrapers — just fields, trees and meadows from one end to the other. Fresh, clean air and water. Plant life sprouting happily, unpolluted by herbicides. I’d be soaking up every sight, sound and smell; share my walk with every bird, badger and fox; take a breath by a sparkling stream or sit for a while in a woodland glade. A bit too romanticised? Perhaps. But I’d be in the world. You are in the world. Yes, but I’m not fully experiencing it. When I drive somewhere, I’m whizzing past everything. I don’t really see, smell or touch the outside environment. I’m not in the moment. Go for a walk in the park. That’s fair enough, but it’s not quite what I’m after. It’s not that I want to be a hobo — I don’t like discomfort and I hate camping. What I want is to be immersed in the world and for that, I’d have to physically be in contact with it, walking on its surface. In Chaucer’s day, this would indeed have been a green and pleasant land and even though I might be beset by robbers, be sore of foot and lacking food and end up dead by the time I was 40, my life would be complete in a way it isn’t now. If I were to set off on a Great Walk today, taking it slowly and pausing to contemplate some of the sights, what would I see? In Scotland, I’d enjoy the wonderful views and visit the lochs, not forgetting Loch Ness.
http://www.lochness.com/ I’d wait till the sea receded and walk across the causeway to Lindisfarne, otherwise known as Holy Island where monks in the seventh century converted the area to Christianity.
https://www.lindisfarne.org.uk/ I’d pause for a while by Antony Gormley’s great sculpture — perhaps do a few sketches.
https://www.gateshead.gov.uk/article/3957/Angel-of-the-North I’d ramble through the beautiful Yorkshire Dales.
https://www.yorkshiredales.org.uk/ I’d tarry awhile in Sherwood Forest where legend has it, Robin Hood and his Merry Men once roamed.
https://www.visitsherwood.co.uk/ Lots of castles are dotted around Britain and I’d call in at as many as I could, including Fotheringay Castle where Richard III was born and Mary Queen of Scots was executed.
https://www.britainexpress.com/counties/northants/castles/fotheringhay.htm In the New Forest, ponies roam free. I’d spend a good week or two in their company.

https://www.nationaltrust.org.uk/the-white-cliffs-of-dover Alas, age and bad knees have put the dampers on that idea. As for the Middle Ages, I do dip into The Canterbury Tales from time to time, though it’s quite difficult to decipher — and there are plenty of historical novels in which to lose myself and dream of ancient times."

Medium.com,Life,Life Lessons from Driving in Scotland for One Weekend,Travel,https://medium.com/@ravenfreelance/life-lessons-from-driving-in-scotland-for-one-weekend-17adb0c3c355?source=topic_page---------335------------------1," Dear Scotland: As someone who grew up in a tourism-heavy place where visitors are often under-prepared for the unique driving experience, I understand how sharing the roads with us can be. I did my best to adhere to your unusually signed speed limits, navigate your blind turns, and follow the cues of drivers around me. I know it wasn’t always graceful, but I enjoyed my time in the country so much. A near-death experience can reshape a person’s entire perception of self and surroundings. Can a near-driving experience? I love road trips. I grew up in Alaska, where there’s not much to drive to and besides, your favorite band isn’t going to be within three thousand miles of you, anyway. When I moved down to the lower 48, the branching interstate highway system felt like a giant web at whose center I was the spider. At least, when I could afford the fuel. I’ve driven coast-to-coast along arteries that bisect the contiguous United States. I’ve gotten lost for long enough that finding a familiar stretch of highway feels like coming home. I prefer a manual transmission and I always use my turn signals and drive with my headlights on. However, I’d never operated a right-hand drive car. Nothing can prepare you fully for the butt-clenching backwardness of this familiar activity on the other side of the looking glass. I left my car behind when I moved from the US to Norway ten months ago. I haven’t driven in this country yet, but the highest speed limit nationally is 80 kilometers per hour, or about 50 miles per hour. This was my general understanding of Europe. Outside the Autobahn, you will not find America’s ludicrously unsafe high speeds. Well. The national speed limit in the UK is 70 miles per hour on a divided four-lane highway and 60 miles per hour on a two-lane highway. If you’re thinking 60 miles per hour isn’t that much higher than 50 miles per hour, you haven’t yet put yourself on that road. Lanes barely feel wide enough for the Hyundai i10 — the smallest size class of car available to me, in line with the Mini Cooper and Fiat 500 — I rented. Often, “two” is a generous number and “lanes” is a generous designation. There’s no shoulder. Bridges and tunnels are too narrow for two drivers to fit. Merges may or may not be indicated. Drunken arrows are painted on the asphalt willy-freakin’-nilly. People both speed and hug that center line like a man thrown overboard grasping at the rigging that will lead him back to the boat. Nobody turns their headlights on prior to sunset. I arrived in Aberdeen after a blissfully short one-hour direct flight from where I live here in Stavanger. Considering the exhausting treks to and from various locations in the US that comprised all the travel I’ve done in the last year, a flight the length of a bus trip felt utterly decadent. (Even if the choppy takeoff from this windy coastal town in a propeller plane scared me and my partner had to hold my hand.) We picked up the car, wobbled out of the rental parking lot, and made our way into the city for lunch (best darn Angus hamburger I’ve ever had — thanks Angus & Ale). After lunch beers (we were on holiday after all), we wandered the city streets enjoying the architecture. We picked up a £90 bottle of single malt, a dark and sweet GlenAllachie selected by the shop owner, and climbed back into our little white rental. Jesus wept. That parking lot was the only place I really drove wrong. Like, all the way wrong. Someone honked at me as I tried to find my way out. Sorry, man. Then it was onto the highway for the 68 miles down to Broughty Ferry where we were staying. Orienting the car properly in the lane when I was used to being on the opposite side of the vehicle was almost physically painful. We stuck to the leftmost lane where scraping the curb was unlikely to result in a vehicular collision. We circumvented Dundee city center on some cute farm roads with me singing the zany theremin theme song of Midsomer Murders to arrive and parallel park in one piece. The second day, I drove from Broughty Ferry on the east coast to Oban on the west. The trip is about three hours, less than the distance between Iowa City and Chicago, which I drove all the time including in a full-blown blizzard wherein I ended up in Peoria. The A85 is two-lane the whole way, littered with stretches of what my partner called “Postman Pat” roads. This was how I would have imagined a back-road route would be, wandering through scenic farmsteads and stony Highland vistas. However, we were apparently on a main highway. Complete with the occasional semi-truck and a flow of traffic that really wanted to be going that 60 mile per hour national speed limit. Or faster. Looking at you, BMW drivers. Our destination rewarded us with a tour of the Oban distillery given by a young man (name of Kyle) with the most beautiful west coast brogue I’ve ever heard. I had something of the opposite experience the following day driving down to Edinburgh. Getting to the city was fairly easy. I knew where the car was in the lane by now, and my brain had adjusted to divided highway driving on the left. Inside of the city, I swiftly learned that road markings in the UK are absolutely bananas. I made my way toward the castle while my passenger navigated. My brain understood how to operate the gearshift but my left arm wasn’t convinced. Lane markings were not a given, and a lot of intersections were filled with yellow crosshatching which made it difficult to determine exactly where which stream of traffic was intended to go. Then there were the roundabouts. I am convinced that there are two things that owe whisky a lot of credit in their creation: the sport of golf and the constant reinvention of how those roundabouts would work. If it had just been a matter of scaling the number of lanes and exits, I would have felt more confident about it. But every one seemed to operate on a different ethos. Some seemed to have rigid exit practices, some totally blind, some packed full of stoplights. Multiple stoplights. In the roundabout. Basically, my rational mind evaporated into pure survival mode approaching every place where two significant directions of traffic needed to meet and navigate one another. Surely, vehicles could approach you from everywhere, including above and below. After we parked, a full Scottish breakfast of haggis and black pudding smoothed my mind a bit. The windy castle walk and cream scones after didn’t hurt, either. And I got to hear bagpipes. My family lived outside London when I was a tiny child. My memories are faded but present. Obviously, I wasn’t driving then. Keep your heinie on the linie you’ll be finie was what they told my mother when she arrived with her toddler and newborn and all the family’s luggage. The load bemused the car rental agents. We weren’t told you needed an estate car. Neither was she. She was fine and still holds her international driving license. Next time she comes to visit me in Scandinavia, she’ll be renting a car. When we planned this trip, I knew I wanted to have a car because I wanted to see the countryside and have the freedom to visit sites without being on a tight schedule. I also knew I would be the one driving because I’m the member of our household who holds a license. I figured, if mum can do it on the heels of a solo transatlantic flight with two young children, I can manage with light luggage and a patient adult passenger. It took the tension days to fade from my neck and hands when I finally arrived home to my flat in Stavanger and car-free lifestyle. I carried palpable fatigue in my wrists and fingers from white-knuckling the wheel. It was only on our last day, driving back up to Aberdeen, where I really felt I had the hang of things. I would describe the majority of my driving experience in Scotland as harrowing. The car was barely powerful enough to maintain 60 miles per hour on a slight incline, even flat out. The brakes were touchy and it never really wanted to go into reverse (I swore a lot about that). That’s not a blemish on the trip, though. Not only were we quickly able to laugh about it, but there’s a powerful sense of accomplishment. Driving in this unfamiliar place with my terrible sense of direction and the UK’s mirror-land setup really was scary. But I did it. Ultimately, it was just fine. No damage to the car, myself, anyone’s personal property. We got where we were going. And now I’ve done that thing. I’d been concerned about the eventuality of driving Norway’s often-medieval streets. People told me about narrow mountain roads with switchbacks and questionable pavement. Based on the Norwegian in the passenger seat regularly exclaiming, why do they consider this a road?! while we explored Scotland, however, makes me feel like I don’t have that much to worry about. So cheers, Scotland. Thank you for tolerating this dumb American tourist. The scenery was breathtaking, the locals were friendly, and the chips were always crisp and searing hot from the fryer. I’m looking forward to coming back."
Medium.com,Life,What I Brought Back From Italy,Travel,https://medium.com/@carollennox/what-i-brought-back-from-italy-43a79c0dfc09?source=topic_page---------336------------------1," It isn’t what the movies promised me. First, these are the things I didn’t bring back from my ten days in Italy. I didn’t bring back a young Italian lover. I didn’t even leave one there, although I was open to falling in love in a romantic place with someone speaking a romantic language. Didn’t happen. The best I did was buy art from one. I didn’t bring back the deed to a 300 year old crumbling farm house. Nor one to a struggling vineyard. I won’t have to invest money, sweat, time and blood into renovating the imagined house, or rejuvenating the forgotten vineyard. I didn’t bring back more than one or two extra pounds, even though I ate pasta twice a day, bread with every meal, and gelato daily. Oh, and there was wine involved. I didn’t bring back a tube of hair gel I left in Florence, and a top and shawl I left in Montorrosso, in a pitiful attempt to lighten my damned suitcase. I brought back memories of seeing the chip marks Michelangelo made in the marble of unfinished sculptures. There is something about witnessing part of the process of creating great beauty that inspires awe at the commitment and skill, almost as much as seeing the finished result of genius. I brought back the joy of creation. I brought back new art from the city that contains so much antiquity. I brought back a healthier body than when I left. Again, this was eating pasta, bread, gelato and drinking wine. I was bemoaning my week back home living a sedentary life. I see clients for six to eight hours, four days a week, and then sit at my computer to write. My lover listened, then reminded me of the real difference between home and Italy. All of those places and experiences require walking. And walking. And walking. At least five miles a day. The difference is that here, at home, I fall into old habits and ruts. There is a lot more to see and experience in Austin than I have in the seven years I’ve been here. He recommended I map out walks and places I wanted to go to, and then walk or bike there. Or I can drive and then walk. There are an abundance of hiking trails here, and except for the days of 107 degrees Fahrenheit, most days are good for moving around outdoors. A desire to find ways to walk and bike in a city that isn’t as built for it as Florence. People literally put their lives at risk biking on roads and highways here in the overcrowded city of Austin. Of course, they do the same in Florence, with its narrow cobbled streets, but cars can only go so fast there, which isn’t very. Even when they drive half on the sidewalk to pass people, cars and bikes. I brought back the knowledge that many of the foods I think my body doesn't tolerate well, are simply not a problem when I’m walking constantly. I ate things in Italy that I never eat here. Cheese, cream, gelato, pasta, bread. Turns out I don’t have gluten sensitivity, and may not be allergic to the casein protein in milk. Who knew not being sedentary was the answer to eating things I want but had forbidden myself to have? Some who know me might sarcastically suggest that isn’t possible. At least the more confidence part. But I have always been good at faking it till I make it. While it’s true that I never shy away from adventure, often following paths with no clear end, and into dangerous situations, I’ve gotten a little wiser in older age. I didn’t follow my new Senegalese friend down the wrong street in Florence. (See above mentioned article). I handled wrestling my suitcase and backpack onto and off of planes, trains, and automobiles, and up and down interminable stairs. All this, after limping along far behind my sister in New Orleans the March before, because of knee and back issues. I seem to have mostly conquered both. Maybe it took the scare of not being mobile to make me commit to mobility, and top it by going to my dream foreign country alone. Whatever. It worked. Less burdened by things, more active and limber, and more committed to writing. It doesn’t beat a young Italian lover, a 300 year old farmhouse, or a forgotten vineyard. But it’s good. And there is always next trip."

Medium.com,Life,Humans of the Archway,Travel,https://medium.com/@hanathinks/humans-of-the-archway-363f3e147293?source=topic_page---------338------------------1," By Hanna Park D
UMBO, Brooklyn– Under the 45’ high cathedral-like ceiling, people get drunk from the music, booze, or both. A huge crowd sways to the deep mellow tunes emanating from the saxophone and bass. Vendors with miso-noodles and corn cheese are neatly packed to the sides, with chatty groups gleefully awaiting their free food. Meanwhile, an artwork projected on the wall is left ignored by the oblivious audience humming to the jazz band staged upfront. The Archway, carved under the Manhattan Bridge in Dumbo, celebrated its 10th Anniversary Party on June 21st. The event commemorates the community’s reclamation of the 7000 square-foot vaulted space from New York City in 2007. The party has been held free every annual summer evening since 2009. These are some of the colorful characters from that night. A
maury Acosta, 30, is a Cuban jazz-funk musician based in New York. When asked if he was enjoying his time, his eyes widened in delight as he pointed to the overhanging bridge bustling with cars, “I feel like we’re in a Batman movie!” He had high hopes of having an epiphany for a new tune that night. Eyeing a retro black Gotham City police car — a flower-adorned prop from the Batman series “Gotham” that had been filmed in the area, Acosta said, “That’s inspiring to me. The sounds I would put to that would be something that resembles the shades of the flowers but also the darkness of the car.” He added that the inspiration for his music largely reflects his experiences, so listeners would hear what he saw. Jenny McGowan, a.k.a. Ms. Saturn is also an artist — a circus performer who has appeared as one of the hula-hoop artists at the Archway Anniversary since 2015. She said bringing people together was the most rewarding part of the experience. “During our first time doing this, we only had 15 people in the audience. Now it has become this whole other entity.” As with Acosta, McGowan found inspiration at the event, specifically with the crowd. Dressed in a pink polka-dot costume, she took quick bites into her nachos, laughed, and said, “I perform for the children and drunk people. They’re similar because they don’t filter. It’s really about framing them right, and finding the moment to interact with them, which is quite lovely.” Before the Archway became a communal hub, it was a giant dusty blockade fenced at both ends that stored scrap metal and tools for the City’s Department of Transportation and Bridges. The Anniversary was a celebration of how that facility was transformed into the plaza it is today. A
lexandria Sica, the executive president of the DUMBO Business Improvement District, which hosted this event, explained how the group had been vital in pushing for community use of this space for years. “Not only was it a sin to have this amazing space be closed off to the public, it created a very stark dividing line between the east and the west side of the neighborhood.” Now, fittingly, the archway is a place of inclusion where locals and tourists alike come together. While the Archway has been transformed, it retains remnants of its past. Pointing to the metal posts arranged along both sides of the Archway, she said, “These are parts of the old shelving units.” When asked about her memories of the Archway, Ms. Sica beamed. “I think I saw some kids here who I’ve seen since they were one year old. To see what impact we’ve had in their life experience is just incredibly satisfying.” A decade later, the Archway boasts a stately presence; perhaps because of the rich history she has endured. As she spreads her dome-like wings, curious families, quirky artists, and vibrant individuals pour inside to gain shelter underneath."
Medium.com,Life,Reflections on being a Jew-Bu,Travel,https://medium.com/interfaith-now/reflections-on-being-a-jew-bu-df8843a42403?source=topic_page---------339------------------1," As a child, my father took me to synagogue only during the holidays. My mother (born Buddhist) tagged along for as long as she could, but at some point, I think she realized that staring at a bunch of gibberish-looking Hebrew words that she couldn’t read wasn’t all that meaningful. Eventually, my father and I stopped going altogether. On Rosh Hashanah this year, I dressed up for services. My heels clacked along the uneven pavement, still wet from the rain earlier that afternoon, as I dodged motorbike traffic. A strange and impractical outfit for Saigon, indeed. I was doing the High Holidays not only as an act of ritual, but also as a result of a deep yearning for something to feel familiar, amidst an incredibly abrupt change of scenery — moving across the world to a new country, getting food poisoning during my first week, and most recently, contracting dengue fever. All of this, of course, occurring at the same time as my first visit to Vietnam in over a decade. Approaching the Chabad center, I saw a man with a wide-brimmed hat in front of a sign that read, “Chabad Viet,” and I couldn’t believe my eyes. To see a Rabbi in Vietnam, to hear the lyrical hymns of prayer, to see books with Hebrew text lining the shelves. To be in the presence of Judaism in my mother’s homeland was a ‘coming together’ of experiences that I didn’t quite have words for. Passing by the kitchen, I noticed a Vietnamese family hard at work, preparing the evening meal for dozens of people, and I felt a pang in my chest. I couldn’t help thinking about my mother back home as a waitress, my mind unraveling into narratives and metaphors about being both the ‘server’ and the one being served. A young Vietnamese woman gestured for me to join the others at the dinner table, where I sat next to two white American Jews, the rest of the room comprised of Israelis, but still, all Jewish. As the Rabbi began a sermon on the importance of this holiday, more of the Vietnamese service staff appeared in the dinner hall, bringing plates of tahini, vegetables, and honey onto the tables. I imagined what this experience would be like had I not been sitting at the table as a guest celebrating the Jewish holiday, and if I instead was spending the evening with that Vietnamese family, helping them bring food out to my fellow Jews — most of whom were likely passing through on vacation, or were part of the influx of Western expats and teachers that was virtually nonexistent ten or twenty years ago. But tonight, that wasn’t the side of the table I was sitting on. When one of the workers approached my table to refill our water, I quietly acknowledged her with a “cảm ơn,” and faintly, she smiled back at me, her face revealing a hint of confusion. In the secret exchange between the two of us, I felt both more comfortable, and yet, more lonely, too. The truth is that more often than not, the way I feel about my place in the world can be likened to that exact moment in Chabad — a recognition of being in two places, of being two people. In my new life in Vietnam, it seems I am always choosing which version of me is going to appear. Will it be Gabby Cohen, the foreign American Jewish expat, or will it be Thanh Trúc — the name my bà ngoại gave me, the daughter of Hương Tran, who has now returned to her mother’s home in an effort to reconnect with her roots? As the “multiple identities” narrative holds, I am often both and neither. There will never be the right words for the way I feel about my walk along this tightrope of bi-cultural identity, the uneasiness of being both a minority, while also carrying a passport from arguably, one of the most privileged nations in the world. No matter how much I try to wrap it into a perfectly neat box that can be presented as a nicely polished essay thesis statement, it will always come out at least missing some element of how I really feel, always a little short of politically correct, ignoring or disregarding some important aspect I should have taken into consideration. I only know what I know. So, here’s what I do know. I may always have to add an addendum to answer the question of “Are you Jewish” and explain my mother’s Buddhist roots when someone asks, and I might require translations for all the Hebrew words, but I can and will always know the essence of shana tova in my bones. I know what it means to feel the sweetness and the blessings of a new year, the seeds of change. And this knowing, this deep internal knowing, is not unlike the knowledge I have acquired here in Vietnam. Even if my rudimentary Vietnamese and American appearance keep me from feeling like I am not fully part of this culture, there are some things that even you cannot undo about yourself. To remember the unforgiving scent but delicious taste of mắm, to smell the aromas of phở and hủ tiếu boiling in the streets, to watch your coffee drop from a phin filter like a light morning rain. To be a foreigner here, and yet, still know the sweetness of this country in all of its sticky humidity, wild tenderness, and warmth that shelters my people. To understand the concept of surrendering and giving oneself fully to family, to place, to time, through glimpses. To know that even if I am only participating from a distance, I have arrived home."
Medium.com,Life,Why Travel Is My Greatest Teacher,Travel,https://metizamagazine.com/why-travel-is-my-greatest-teacher-fad208a8829e?source=topic_page---------340------------------1," People tend to think that because I travel so much, I must be some confident, fearless girl who can handle anything life throws my way. But I can tell you right now that I travel precisely because I am not those things. For me, traveling isn’t about being fearless at all; it’s about feeling the fear, and doing it anyway. Because I’ve found that no matter how much hesitation I have before a trip, or how hard it is to drag my anxious ass onto that plane, I always end up thinking “thank God I did that.” Travel is my greatest teacher. Every single time, I am reminded, almost immediately, why I do this whole “travel” thing in the first place; of the reward that travel never fails to give me: the more I expand my horizons in the outside world, the more deeply I come to understand my inner world. Sometimes it’s terrifying. Sometimes it’s enlightening. Sometimes it’s both. But it’s a simple, shattering truth that I will never stop seeking. This was both my first solo international trip, and my longest trip so far. These eight weeks tore me apart so many times, and in so many different ways, but somehow, in the end, I feel even more whole than I did before. I couldn’t possibly summarize everything I learned, but I do want to share some of my biggest takeaways, because maybe it’s exactly the motivation someone else needs to push past their fear and get out there. Travel teaches you, whether you like it or not, that you can’t run from what’s trying to drown you. Your patterns will follow you, no matter where you are. Your bad habits and shadows will still come up, no matter where you are. And chances are they’ll come up even faster than usual, too, without all the distractions and routines of your everyday life. This is a unique opportunity…so listen hard, and make note of what follows you. Tend to it, before it turns from a whisper to a scream. You may meet certain people throughout your travels who make you feel like you’ve gone backwards, into some old version of yourself who you’ve since outgrown; one who’s naïve, insecure, and desperate for approval, no matter what the cost. Pay attention to this feeling — there’s a reason for it. It’s not that you’re in any way deficient; it’s that those are not your people. Do not shape-shift, or throw away all that you’ve become to fit in with them just because you’re lonely. Stay firm in who you are, be patient, and keep looking until your find your people…because they’re out there, I promise. And the right ones won’t ask you to bend. You will, perhaps even for the first time in your entire life, be completely on your own schedule. No boss to answer to, no deadlines to meet, no loved ones to satisfy, no obligations to anyone…and that can be incredibly intimidating as much as it is freeing. It’s on your shoulders to make the most of this experience…which also means there’s no one else to blame if you don’t. It will be tempting to latch onto others. To try to meld their experience into your own. To ease some of the burden, and try to create some form of certainty in the endless unknown that presents itself every single day. But when it comes down to it, no matter who you spend your time with, and for however long, this trip is yours and yours alone. You came here for a reason. Don’t lose sight of that…because it’s in that very place of uncertainty that you will grow the most. Whatever you do, stay open — to experiences, people, food, plans…all of it. Expectations and entitlements are what get you into trouble. As soon as you have an idea in mind of how you want things to go, it is almost guaranteed that things will go differently than that. Be flexible, and know that even the most stressful situations or the worst days you can possibly imagine all present an opportunity to learn — and more importantly, almost always a great story. Travel affords you the chance to see some pretty amazing sights, and those sights are a huge part of the fun. But the most meaningful moments are experienced, not captured… Like staring out from the balcony on your very first night, just you and the city, taking in the beauty of the skyline and trying to grasp the magnitude of what you’ve just begun. Like swapping stories with a complete stranger on a 13-hour train ride, wondering, by the end, how you ever went a day without knowing each other. Like late-night drives to the beach when neither of you can sleep, to look up at the stars, bury your feet in the sand, and talk about how sad it will be to leave all this behind. Like the local woman sitting next to you on the bus who doesn’t speak a word of your language, but has enough kindness to share her last few pieces of candy with you. Like the deep friendships forged, even in the face of an unspoken understanding that the two of you will likely never see each other again. Like the constant reminders that nothing lasts forever, and that maybe nothing should. Like the constant hellos, and just as constant goodbyes, and the mystery of what happens in between. The pictures you take will be invaluable, and you’ll love to look back on them. But don’t forget to put your phone away every now and then and just be. Because cliché as it sounds, all of this will be over before you know it. In my experience, the best memories are often the ones social media never sees. There will be high highs, low lows, and little in between. You will be busy most of the time, and exhausted much of the rest. But in those moments where you are neither, sadness has a way of creeping in. The kind of sadness that thrives in a travel environment, where everything is so transitory; where the intensity of each moment meets the understanding, in the big picture, of its insignificance. And it’s a resilient motherfucker — the kind that a phone call to a friend back home can’t quite fix, because beneath their comforting words lies the sobering truth that they’ll never quite get what you’re going through. And it won’t feel like it at the time, but there is so much beauty to be found in that space. As with anything in life, the time will come for you to leave this adventure behind…to return to the land of work and routines and structure. And chances are, you won’t be ready. Boarding that first plane will feel almost like a small death; like a piece of you has been ripped out and left there. But it doesn’t end there — home will feel different, too. You’ve been gone, but everything there has stayed the same…and you might even find that you don’t quite fit anymore. That in some subtle way, something has shifted, and it doesn’t feel as much like home as it used to. This can be hard, and maybe it hurts. But be proud of this in-congruency. It is, at its core, only an expression of your growth. And of all the measures of success in this world, this, to me, will always be the greatest."
Medium.com,Life,"To Know the Place Again, for the First Time: Two Months on the Road in the US",Travel,https://medium.com/@stephenheiner/to-know-the-place-again-for-the-first-time-two-months-on-the-road-in-the-us-4714041a499e?source=topic_page---------341------------------1," This summer I embarked on the most ambitious road trip of my life. I had a car the entire time and I interspersed places I had long wanted to see among business and personal appointments. Despite having traveled a fair bit in my life and giving myself (what I thought were) appropriate rest days, the journey ended up being one of the most challenging travel itineraries I’ve ever pulled off. I say “challenging” with a fair amount of joy, for we should take pleasure in our exertions, especially if they bring us lasting satisfaction, which this trip did in so many ways. The trip began, fittingly enough, in Dallas, Texas. My family first moved to Dallas from Singapore in 1988. We had relatives living there at the time (who live there still) and it was here that my first impressions of America formed. This long layover allowed me to visit with some of my relatives, catch up with friends who live in the area, and even see one of my Writerly clients that happens to headquarter out of Dallas. While there is much in my life to make Dallas dear to me, in regards to urban planning it represents some of the worst of the dehumanizing automobile-driven sprawl development perfected by post-war American “urban planners” (mostly comprised of car dealers, brutal architects, and unimaginative government officials). In this way Dallas can be a bewildering web of freeways with thieving tolls that is ever expanding outward with no real plan but OUT. As an aside, should you have a desire to stop over in a hub city of an airline, you can create a mini-trip like this for yourself. The airline will allow you to take a very long layover (sometimes overnight) at no additional cost. It will also give you a bit of “normalization time” — a chance to breathe non-airport air, feel the sunshine (or cold, as it may be), and walk around. It may make the circadian adjustments easier for you. This strategy also works with Singapore Airlines, I recently discovered. After eight hours in Dallas it was onward to Kansas City where I would stay for a week. For a long term car rental — anything over a week — it’s usually worth the trouble to rent from a non-airport location. Airport locations can charge a higher daily rate. I’d never rented a car for this long, though, and it was quoted at roughly $1800 USD, or $900/month since I would be in the US for eight weeks. This didn’t include insurance (which I didn’t get, trusting to that provided by my credit card) nor gas (which I’ll come to later on). This was the lowest rate I could find, and it was with Hertz, with whom I rent almost 100% of the time in the US, because they always seem to have the lowest rates in the Kansas City area. The price felt “high,” but what did I know, really? I’d never rented a car for that long before, and as I reflected on it more, I realized their exposure was significant: someone driving a car for two months might necessarily be a greater risk than someone driving for two days. I divided the $900 across thirty days and came up with a $30 “daily transportation charge.” Now, if we think about this in terms of a city metro, it’s unreasonably high. But if you think of it as on-call private transportation, the cost is suddenly quite reasonable. If you were to take others on the road trip with you and split the cost, it would become increasingly so. They didn’t have the size I booked so I got upgraded (a strategy that works some of the time), but after a month of driving a gas-guzzling Chevy Malibu, I took a swap (you have to report your mileage periodically on what Hertz calls a “multi-month rental” and you can either do an oil change and be reimbursed or swap out the vehicle) as a chance to get into one of my favorite rental vehicles, the fuel-efficient, roomy, and very drivable Hyundai Sonata. Gas prices on the trip across 20 different states were as low as $2.33/gallon and as high as $3.40/gallon so the difference between these could be construed as $2.86 (too many fillups for me to do an exact average), which for my metric friends is roughly 67 cents per litre. What America desperately lacks in infrastructure (no trains, buses, or budget airlines that provide reliable nationwide service) it more than makes up for in offering very low cost private transportation costs. I drove a total of 12,253 miles, or 19,719 kilometers, at a total cost of $1008 USD (921,27€) or $16.80 USD/15,35€ per day. So that meant my total transportation costs (car + petrol) for two months in the US was roughly $46.80 USD/42,62€ per day. If you add in some occasional expensive inner city parking and hateful tolls from the thieving state of Illinois, $50 USD/day would still be a conservative transportation estimate for a trip of such duration and mileage. The fuel costs in France are more than double what I’ve listed above and the tolls are eye-watering. Paris to Nice alone costs 160€ in tolls. Ask me again why I’ve driven in Europe a total of thirty days in six years. It was an interesting point of reflection that my strict Asian mother who had, in my youth, frowned on sleepovers and limited video games during the school year to 30 continuous minutes on the weekend after homework was completed, registered no significant protest at my driving from California to New Hampshire, a distance of 3000 miles (4800 km), never having driven more than 2–4 hours by myself before. How dazzled I was on that first long road trip, my freshman year of college, and with what wiser eyes I saw some of the same sights, and many new ones, on this trip. How could I possibly have driven so much? To be honest, I’m still a bit surprised myself. I certainly didn’t begin the trip in that way, spending a week in Kansas City attending to personal business and seeing friends, followed by another week in St. Mary’s, Kansas, spent with nieces and nephews and, for the first time in many years, cutting my mother’s lawn. This was one of the most luxurious parts of the trip for me. I often share that when you live in a different country from our family, it’s a good idea to visit “off season,” meaning, not during a particular holiday. You don’t have to share your family with their in-laws and other obligations, moreover you have the chance to simply observe and chat with them as they go about their daily tasks. I was able to get lunches with my brothers-in-law and see their workplaces, and take my sisters and mother for one-on-one weekday lunches. No kids — just a chance for a quiet catch-up. As for the nieces and nephews, I got to carry on the legacy of my late father’s “secret meetings.” More often than not this was simply a chance for us to go out of the house for an ice cream, but I adapted it for my nieces and nephews, dividing them into the 6-and-older and the 5-and-under groups, taking them to different places for a treat and for some time together. The “secret” was that we didn’t have to tell anyone where we went, before or after, but the chattiest (worst secret keepers) made sure it wasn’t secret for long. :-) Long drives, apart from giving you the opportunity to binge on podcasts and audiobooks, offer you plenty of time to ponder, and at the time of my trip I was approaching the first anniversary of my father’s death. I found some helpful reflections in this article, which reminded me, above all, that grieving exists outside of time as we normally conceive of it. My father had always told me that he never “got over” the death of his parents. They were always missed. I pondered that while he was alive. I know it to be true now that he is gone. I still miss him very much, and I hope I always will. It was at these meetings that I announced my first summer challenge to the kids, to be performed on my return visit in July. The girls could do one minute of hula hoop or two minutes of jump rope; the boys could do two minutes of jump rope or ten dead hang pull ups. While protests were registered by both children and their parents as to the ability to achieve these goals, I reminded everyone that yes, they were capable, and anyway, it was my contest, my rules. St. Mary’s, where most of my family now lives, hosted my paternal grandfather for boarding school, as well as two of my siblings for boarding school nearly 80 years later. I spent a year in the college there myself, in total living for about two years in a town of 3000 people. There are still friends in and around town that I catch up with, and it’s been nice to see the town slowly develop over the last twenty years. So, after the two weeks of seeing family and friends, I headed off on my first adventure: a road trip to Mount Rushmore, which would also be my first visit to South Dakota. Long drives are tiring when you are unused to them, and after 714 miles (1149 km) I arrived fairly tired to Rapid City, South Dakota, having spent eleven hours on the road. Perspective for my European friends? That’s the distance from Paris to Prague. Mount Rushmore has a carnivalesque atmosphere. It’s full of families with kids and can be as long or short of a visit as you want. Fans of Hitchcock’s North by Northwest will inevitably smile at the movie’s climactic finish across this edifice, but it really is an impressive bit of art and engineering. The trail is well marked and there are plenty of ranger talks or exhibits should you wish to learn more, but even the short 30 minutes leisurely loop trail will give you some impressive views and perspectives. Not too far from Mt. Rushmore is Crazy Horse, originally conceived of by Standing Bear as a Native American complement to Mt. Rushmore. While there is the faint outline of a monument to this legendary warrior, the family in charge of the memorial refuses to take federal funds and seems committed to a Sagrada Familiaesque timeline (i.e. who knows when it will be finished?). That said, the venue itself is a treasure trove of Native American history, with a museum, a college, and cultural center, among other things, on the sprawling property. It’s maybe a 45 minute drive from Mt. Rushmore, through some lovely rolling hills. But, by far my favorite destination on this part of the journey was Devil’s Tower National Monument in Wyoming. A large and spectacular igneous rock formation with no definitive geological explanation, it conveys a quiet peacefulness in contrast to the circus at Mt. Rushmore, and offers various trails around the monument itself, which you can choose from depending on your time and desire to hike. Everything about Devil’s Tower (known as Bear Lodge to the Lakota people) is serene, peaceful, and inspiring. I then had a chance to drive through the state of Wyoming and passed through the impressive Grand Teton National Park, where I spotted my first bison of the trip. I knew I would be back later in the summer so I only made a couple stops while enjoying one of the most scenic drives in the country. I would end up in Sundance, Utah. I spent a guy’s weekend with some friends I had been meaning to get together for some time. We grilled, kayaked, hiked, and just relaxed. My very first business mentor introduced me to Sundance in the mid 2000s, and I’ve been bringing friends there ever since, though this was my first visit since moving out of the US in 2013. After dropping my friends at the airport I drove south to Moab, Utah, just outside Arches National Park. It was high summer, so the weather was hot, but as long as you bring enough sunscreen and water you’ll survive. Arches, with its magnificent 36 mile loop of vast, endless vistas, is something all should experience and enjoy, whatever the time of year. You’re reminded almost continuously of the length of time in God’s creation, and our very small, but providentially ordained, role in it. I was reminded of the words of a favorite sermon: “life is short, eternity is long.” I made my way back from Arches to join my family for the July 4th holiday. My sister and her child flew in from California to join us for our first family pictures since her wedding. I think they turned out well and it’s always a pleasure for me to have pictures I can look at when I’m on the other side of the water. Almost all of us were together, though a death in his family understandably kept one brother-in-law from joining us. Fireworks and sparklers were lit, hamburgers and hot dogs were enjoyed, and I brought a couple Berry Chantilly cakes from Whole Foods, which are a regular contribution I make to large family meals (if you haven’t tried these, you should). What do you love about America, I’m often asked. Diners, in particular, Waffle House. There’s no rush. They are open at all hours and hold no judgment against your desire for a philly cheese hash brown bowl with jalapenos at 10pm. That late night unhurried comfort food is a luxury we simply don’t have in the same way in Europe, and that’s okay. I can savor it all the more when I’m stateside. The kids did their physical challenges, and it was fun to see it play out: Lucy, the brainiac who said she “couldn’t possibly” do a physical challenge…until she did; my nephew Dante, who had been working on his pullups since my visit the previous month and hit the goal of ten, unlike his overconfident older cousin Matthew, who like the hare in Aesop’s story of the Tortoise and the Hare, trusted too much in his own abilities and fell short. The younger boys, who couldn’t yet do pull-ups, were challenged to hold on to the bar without assistance for two minutes, which they did! It was a great reminder to everyone that the only thing holding us back from our goals is our work ethic and willpower. It was nice for our family to be all together. We live far apart now so moments like these are treasured (and have to be planned in advance). I prepared to leave for my next set of adventures and left a more complicated mental challenge for my August visit: memorizing the names of all 50 states. I drove to Illinois, to partake in a few days of the Fleming Foundation’s Annual Summer Symposium. This year’s theme was Shakespeare and the history of England. Dr. Fleming challenged some of us to recite some lines from the Bard and I reached back to a previous obsession with Hamlet which bore as one of its fruits a memorized monologue from the end of Act III. While some of my writings and work for the Foundation require a (free) login to access, some of them were originally written for Front Porch Republic. I next arrived for some work at St. Gertrude the Great in Ohio. I would record some episodes for next season of Restoration Radio. Before too long I was on my way to North Dakota, with an overnight stay in Minneapolis. This was the longest stretch of driving on this trip, over 1400 miles (2250 km) across two days. When I crossed into North Dakota, below endless clouds, I had at long last been to all 48 of the continental United States. After so much driving a pause was warranted, and I spent a day exploring the little known but beautiful Theodore Roosevelt National Park, which actually has three segments — I chose to spend the day in the Southern Unit. Bison, wild horses, prairie dogs: all were wandering around this beautiful and underappreciated park. In a certain way, this landscape that made Roosevelt (in his own words) a decided conservationist is responsible for all the National Parks Roosevelt created and fostered momentum for, which would be realized under future presidents. After resting a couple days in the far west of North Dakota, I pressed on to Little Bighorn National Battlefield, which is very well presented by the National Park Service, with wall-to-wall ranger talks (many of the Rangers are Native Americans), informative trail markers and grave stones, and a free audioguide. Four hundred miles later, on the other side of Montana lay Missoula, my next stop. I got to know the town a bit as well as drive up to the Lolo Pass, famous as part of Lewis and Clark’s journey but known also for the retreat of Chief Joseph. It straddles the Pacific and Mountain time zones so it’s an hour earlier when you get there but an hour later when you leave. Missoula natives will be the first to tell you that the town has changed dramatically in the last 5–10 years. Present-day Missoula reminds me of Austin or Portland in the early 2000s or Nashville ten years ago, before these towns got discovered, crowded, and overpriced. I suspect Missoula will not undergo something similar for reasons of weather (its non-summer climate is too extreme for most) and remoteness (it’s not convenient/inexpensive to get to by airplane). I’m sure that status quo is fine for most Missoulans, who are doing fine without you, thank you very much. After a couple days of rest in Missoula I pressed on another 500 miles (800 km) to Skykomish, which is located inside the Stevens Pass, not far from Seattle. The Pacific Northwest is truly beautiful, but I wasn’t in Skykomish for sightseeing alone. Some business partners and I had rented a cabin for a week in order to shoot six courses on starting a business, meetup groups, becoming an airbnb super host, travel, and long-term and entrepreneurial visas for France. One of my coaching clients had inspired me to bottle some of my knowledge and while the recording part was certainly a challenge, much more work and learning lay ahead, as Dan Fox went into editing mode to piece all of the recordings together in a coherent manner. We also added the right descriptions to turn browsers into buyers and we definitely came away with a true appreciation of how challenging putting together a single course is, much less six! We did manage to take a break from filming long enough to go to Vancouver and Seattle for the weekend. The natural beauty around Vancouver is as astonishing as the homelessness is shocking. Entire city parks have become homeless encampments and entire neighborhoods are punctuated by homeless encampments on the sidewalks. A city that lives like this is a city that has, in a way, given up on itself. Grouse Mountain provides spectacular views over the Vancouver region and on a clear day the views are endless. There are grizzly bears and birds of prey up there. Don’t miss it. Before we crossed back across the border we stopped in the picturesque beach town of White Rock for part of a business design fiesta hosted by my colleague Dan Johnston. The people he had gathered for a weekend of designing businesses to launch were engaging and lovely, and it was a perfect end to a long day in Canada. I didn’t get as much of a look at Seattle, as I spent most of our day there eating [note: do not miss June Baby if you, like me, love Southern Cuisine (but definitely skip the Wandering Goose) and if you are a burger lover, stop by Lil’ Woody’s; it’s underpriced goodness!] Many friends know me to be a breakfast hound. When I do research in a city before arriving and I see the same place consistently mentioned that can mean it’s either genuinely good or overly hyped. I can tell you that in case of Medina Cafe it’s the former. Get there 30 minutes before it opens at 9 if you want to make the first seating, or get there at 9 to be on the list for the first “turn” at 10. They will take your name and you can take a walk in the meantime. Don’t worry, they won’t push you out: Vancouverites, like many Canadians, don’t linger at any meal, much less breakfast, but the staff make you feel welcome and you can stay as long as you’d like. With the biggest project of the trip behind me, it was time to relax a bit and I headed south into Oregon to taste some of the renowned Willamette Valley varietals and blends. I also revisited some of my childhood by going to the end of the Oregon Trail, a goal I so rarely achieved in the computer game of my youth. Long before I had the joy of properly spelling it consistently, I had fallen in love with the Korean dish of bibimbap. As another testament to “you never know when you’ll come across it” some of the best bibimap I’ve sampled in my life was at Happy Bibimbap House in Salem, Oregon. Don’t be (or do be!) distracted by the Korean posters/art/photos that are crammed ino the establishment or the “we need to have lots of other dishes that might interest Americans” choices on the menu. Order the classic bibimbap and thank me later. Oregon wine country was an interesting discovery. Rather than giving small pours free, or for a marginal cost that is 100% applicable to the wine purchases (which has been my experience in France, Italy, Australia, New Zealand, and even South Dakota), they are going to charge you around $20 USD for a flight of 3–4 wines, all with pours that are double or triple the tasting portion you might have had elsewhere, and this cost is not directly applicable to a purchase of a bottle. While I did get to have some great conversations about wine with some of the staff, it’s clear that important revenue streams here are from memberships to the specific vineyard (which is a commitment to purchasing a certain number of bottles per year, sometimes with free shipping or access to exclusive runs as incentives) and special events like themed and paired wine dinners. My usual ambition of visiting 3–4 cellar doors on a given day was thus blunted and I was compelled to stop after visiting Ponzi and Argyle, though those were still a great exposure to what’s on offer in Oregon. The historic Oregon Trail had a very steep conclusion for hopeful settlers: descent with their wagons into the Columbia River Gorge. As I thought through all the parts of the trail that I had seen on this and previous drives, I wondered what kept people moving forward when they could so easily stop at any number of picturesque stops near rivers, mountains, and forests. Sure, it afforded none of the “protection” found near a large settlement as they could find in Salem, but so many died and drowned along the way that they may have been just as safe trying their luck in the open country as trying to make it to Oregon in one go. I thought, on reflection, that it wasn’t that surprising that I almost never made it to Oregon in the computer game of my youth. Many in real life didn’t either. The longest drives were behind me, and now the drives seemed easier, since I had been on the road for six weeks. I stopped at the wonderful Craters of the Moon National Park in the middle of Idaho and got to explore lava tubes, which are hollow caves in which lava once flowed and formed a fascinating underground topography. Unwittingly, I was preparing for my next stop by making this one, as this Park was the site of the last eruption of the supervolcano which, over time, had moved under Yellowstone, where it presently lies, biding its time until its next eruption. The landscape at Craters is unlike anything I’ve ever seen, though those who have lived in and around volcanic areas would see much that they would recognize. After arriving in St. Anthony, Idaho, I had a brief rest before embarking on the National Park highlight of my entire visit stateside: two days in Yellowstone and a day in Grand Teton. Both parks together could easily take a week of your time if you made the time to see them. They are extraordinary nature preserves open to the public: bison, elk, moose, bears, wolves, beavers, all beside rivers, lakes, waterfalls, canyons, mountains, geysers, and hot springs and bubbling mud. It’s a fairy land, and available for the cost of a song — an annual National Parks pass costs only $80 USD, which covers everyone in the vehicle you are driving. If you want to stay inside Yellowstone, your best bet is to book a year in advance. There are lodgings for every budget, but if you, like me, wait until two months before your visit, all you will see is sporadic availability in which hope is your strategy. I have never been to Alaska, but that doesn’t really blunt, just contextualizes, my assertion that the Yellowstone/Grand Teton ecosystem cannot be recommended highly enough. You will carry the signs, sounds, and smells of your visit for a long time afterwards. Full of the refreshment that only nature can grant, I next stopped at Wyoming Catholic College to meet the President of the school to discuss some future projects but also to enjoy its picturesque setting in Lander, on the edge of the Wind River reservation. While I don’t entirely endorse the “Great Books” argument as articulated by Mortimer Adler and others (I’m more a disciple of Dr. John Senior’s “1000 Good Books”) the matching of such a curriculum to the rugged Wyoming landscape would be utterly irresistible to me if I were 18 again. The weekend after saw me first in Boulder, then Denver, which gave me time to see friends in the surrounding areas. I also got to try some Colorado cheese and charcuterie (the local Colorado Blue sold by St. Kilian’s is particularly fine: one of the best blue cheeses I’ve ever tried on any continent). The final few days flew by. I drove through Colorado and Kansas to arrive back into St. Mary’s, with some stops along the way to see friends. My nieces and nephews recited the states, much to my delight, and they were promised a bigger challenge (and reward) when I returned next year. I returned to Kansas City, turned in my car, took another long layover in Dallas, then headed home to Paris. There were so many things this trip made me grateful for. In the first place, I remember God, and the marvelous details which light up creation, which were so on display for me during this trip, which occurred in some of the finest summer weather I have ever known in my short life. I was grateful to have my family, to be able to see them all together and to have the time to catch up with them and have some special time with my nieces and nephews. I was grateful to my professional mentors and colleagues, who punctuated the sightseeing with heads-down serious work, when we weren’t busy having a laugh (or eating pancake ice cream). Finally, I was grateful to have so many friends, old and new, who welcomed me cordially at every stage of the trip. They helped me to see the country I lived in for 25 years through newer, wiser eyes, so that I could know it again, for the first time."
Medium.com,Life,3 Things I Learned from Disappearing,Travel,https://medium.com/@mikayeap/3-things-i-learned-from-disappearing-affad8fa7318?source=topic_page---------342------------------1," At age eighteen, I moved to Canada to go to college. That fall of 2018 marked the first time I felt free to do whatever I wanted, to be the man I wanted to be. To my old world, I was pretty much dead. Friends went their separate ways, even the ones I still talked to knew a different person, and I never got past the weather when my family called. I stayed like this for about a year. No one really knew who I was or what I was doing, not the people I once knew nor the people I just met. I felt like a true ghost everywhere I went. In fact, nothing has changed. In many respects, I’m still gone. Even when I’m not by myself, the people I spend time with don’t know me at all. This is what I learned from disappearing for 14 months and counting. Lots of people ask me, “Why do you live this way?” And the answer is I can’t live any other way. Part of it stems from what I’ve seen from consistency so far: Bad things. For instance, I lived with my biological family for eighteen years, and never once has it felt like a family. Having the epoch of stability turn sour for you has a way of distorting things, I suppose. As a result, the worst thing I could ever be is stable. I’d lose my marbles. No two weeks are the same for me, and even individual days are sometimes wildly different. My reality is always changing, not just in the daily life aspect, but also in terms of the values I hold and the things I believe in. This is rather incompatible with many societal norms, like keeping a normal job, being in a relationship, or starting a family. Stability isn’t for everyone. Some people thrive, and in fact can only survive with, instability. Silence can be the most genuine form of connection. Seeing so many different parts of the world you thought you knew has a way of making you addicted. You get hooked on the idea of discovering something so new that it instills that sense of wonder you crave so much. Hence I relish the thought of just changing everything because I can. I relish the thought of posting a note on Instagram one day explaining that I’ll be traveling to random remote places and I’d rather not talk to anyone until further notice. I’d then buy a one-way ticket to Norway and get a job as a lumberjack, living a completely different life for a while. And when I would finally revisit people from my old life, it’d be like I had never left. Except people don’t work that way, because I think I see silence quite differently. If you’re my friend and I choose to be silent, I trust you to know that I still care about you although I don’t have to say things to reaffirm it. Silence is a mark of trust to me. And yet we often mistake it for disinterest, coldness, or busy-ness, especially in the context of an existing relationship. Ironically enough, I myself used to be obsessed with reaffirming connection through contact and communication, so I see where people are coming from when they take silence the wrong way. But now, even though I’ve grown to be an incredibly extroverted person who enjoys talking to anyone and everyone, I can see how silence can be a really genuine and intimate form of connection. I used to feel really threatened by people who were like the current me. There was an eerie sense of calm around them. Their past was full of red flags, and the uncertainty of their future always sounded too picturesque to be real. I really didn’t understand why this specific kind of person unsettled me so much, until that discomfort turned out to be manic curiosity. I finally understand why these people always set me into a defensive state: I wanted to understand them so bad that I was driven into a state of panic. It’s sort of like finding a pool of icy-cool, fresh water in the middle of the desert while you’re dying of thirst. When you see it, you could literally break a leg sprinting towards it because you want it so bad. I think that’s what my mind was doing with this specific character I feared. One of my favorite questions to ask people is what they’re afraid of. After we get past the casual things like “spiders”, “college debt”, and “marrying a man like my dad” (oops, was that one too real?), confusion starts to set in. They start trying to figure out why I’m asking them about those fears, the ones they’re actually dead scared of. In reality, I ask about fears because it speaks volumes about who we really are. You can learn a lot about someone by studying what they want and what they’re afraid of. In fact, I would argue that knowing these two things is enough to understand 90% of what they’re doing. Hell, most of us don’t even know this about the people we’re closest to. In my case, one of my most visceral fears turned out to be the unlock for tremendous happiness. I used to be terrified of people who would uproot themselves at a moment’s notice, but that’s exactly who I am now and who I want to continue being. Beware what you fear, because fears tell you things about yourself that you probably aren’t ready to face, yet desperately need to hear."
Medium.com,Life,On the Road Again,Travel,https://medium.com/the-partnered-pen/on-the-road-again-3aebf574495c?source=topic_page---------343------------------1," There was nowhere to go but everywhere, so just keep on rolling under the stars.~Jack Kerouac, On the Road I’ve asked myself this many times. I’ve searched for “home” for a while. I can’t seem to find it anywhere “out there”. Home exists where we are now. We don’t need a permanent dwelling to know what home means to us. For some, nomadic lifestyles are perfect. Others need to stay in one place for a while. I’m somewhere in the middle. I like to plant roots, but keep my wings for flying off to new lands. Some people are concerned about my children being unstable when we move so much. I disagree. They’ve learned to adapt, they’ve built relationships with diverse groups of people, and they’ve learned about nature and community. Living in different cites has expanded my awareness. It’s shown me that I have grit and determination. I’m adventurous, spontaneous, and brave. I’m willing to take chances because I trust the Universe will offer all we need and desire. I’m aware of our collective consciousness, even when our individual lives may differ. I’ve found my soul family, and I’ve accepted those who aren’t matching my values. I recognize what cities are most appealing and what might best meet our needs. I moved 3 times while pregnant. Her dad and I moved while together and we moved while apart. We’ve been platonic roommate parents off and on for years. We changed apartments maybe a half a dozen times, individually and collectively. Sometimes it was about our breaking up. Most of the time, we couldn’t afford to live in Santa Barbara, CA. I’ll admit it was stressful. I wasn’t sure where I belonged. I didn’t have much money. I needed to nest in late pregnancy and couldn’t find the right place. I also had two cats and a dog. It was a wild ride, I’ll tell you. Before Orion was born, I went to live in her dad’s tiny apartment. She was born at home. At least that’s what I called his place at the time. Eventually, I realized we couldn’t continue trying so hard to make rent. I didn’t want my kids to live in a cramped studio just because I grew up there. I chose Portland on a whim, after hearing about it from a fellow mom. I was pregnant with my youngest daughter Noa when we moved there the first time in July of 2015. She was born at home in early August. Portland wasn’t a good match, due to the big city crime and general hustle and bustle. We need safety and quiet spaces. We all returned and their dad and I split up for the last time. I lived with the girls in Santa Barbara in an efficiency one-bedroom, which is a fancy name for a studio with a partition. I couldn’t afford the rent so my parents helped supplement. He lived with his mom an hour away. We did this for a year. I got a section 8 housing voucher I couldn’t use because of high housing needs. It was impossible to find anything suitable at the time. When I decided to give Portland another try, he initially said he’d come. He was lying. He had no intention of going. We ended up leaving with him having a tearful goodbye to our kids and me wondering what we were doing. Our Victorian one-bedroom in NE Portland was difficult. My oldest had big meltdowns and would scream almost every day. I knew it was due to energetic weirdness in our building and community-at-large. She was too intense for it to be a fluke. Our next door neighbors made noise complaints and were appalled by what they thought was awful parenting. They were unwilling to meet face-to-face for any discussion. We did make friends with other neighbors who were wonderful. We did find some awesome parks and enjoyed some of our time there. But I knew we didn’t belong in Portland anymore. So we visited Eugene one day and fell in love. Nearly everyone is mellow and inviting. We couldn’t find anywhere to live the first time we went to Eugene. We stayed with new friends for about a month and camped a little bit. All of that was complicated and uncomfortable for a few reasons. So we moved in with my parents. The event made national news. People were swept away by debris flow. Evacuations were imminent. We had packed cars, just in case we had to leave. The roads were closed. Everything stopped. In the midst of a smoky haze, my kids’ dad served me papers calling for mediation. He tried to stop us from leaving the state. Our mediation was unresolved. We couldn’t come to an agreement. Then he lost his job and agreed to drop his case. We were free to leave. We secured an apartment in Eugene, Oregon, in March of 2018. It was a sweet place to live for a year and a half. We embraced our community and forged lifelong friendships. Their dad moved to Bend and we had regular visits. But I knew by the end of our rainy, moldy winter that I needed a change. Seasonal depression snuck up on me near the end of Winter. I didn’t realize I was affected until I woke up one morning in tears for no reason. We got sick from the mold in our apartment. Our landlord wouldn’t resolve the issue. I wasn’t sure where we should live next. I got an energy reading from a friend and she told me she saw us in Ohio, Idaho, or Florida. I had no interest in Florida or Idaho, but Ohio sounded promising. My high school friend lived in Cincinnati. I had my eye on Cleveland, due to a mutual friend selling a house there. Knowing I would likely be heading East, I decided to contact that friend. We reconnected in early March of this year, when we had the first of many deep, hour-long conversations. We were attracted to each other as teenagers. We seem to have transcended time and space. We have all kinds of matching pictures. He suggested we move to Cincinnati. I checked it out and decided Cincinnati wasn’t for us. I sat with the idea of Ohio a little longer until it fizzled out. Except for seeing Kyle, I wasn’t compelled to go there. All of a sudden, my choice was clear. We would go there. I planned on moving when my lease ended in March. My kids’ dad was reticent and didn’t want to move with us. He was concerned about the girls moving again. I’m not concerned at all. We have very different ideas about what that looks and feels like. He was out of any other ideas, so he eventually gave us his blessing. On September 17th, we set out on our road trip to our new hometown. We waited for housing paperwork to process since July. We’re finally here in Albuquerque, New Mexico, after 2 months of living with my parents on the Central Coast of Southern California. We had a series of unfortunate events in unacceptable Airbnb stays. We stayed in an acceptable hotel. We finally got our apartment inspected and moved in on September 25th. I feel nostalgic and miss my friends where I’ve lived before. My oldest daughter has a best friend in Eugene and being apart has been painful at times. Their dad hasn’t decided to move here yet. But I have no regrets. Intuition told me this was the right thing to do. I’m not one to question it. I’ve always been surprised at how easy it’s been to pack up and leave. I’m amazed at how seamless our transition has been, after all that waiting. We’re meant to be here in what’s called the Land of Enchantment. We have endless desert skies filled with possibilities. We’re ready. I was surprised, as always, by how easy the act of leaving was, and how good it felt. The world was suddenly rich with possibility.~Jack Kerouac, On the Road"

Medium.com,Life,Walking On Thin Ice — Mont Blanc Part 1,Travel,https://medium.com/@yongjunming_12604/walking-on-thin-ice-mont-blanc-part-1-e36464165e15?source=topic_page---------345------------------1," We got off the bus at Chamonix, greeted by bright sunshine and the magnificent Mont Blanc. From the bottom, you can spot the massive crevasses in the glacier formations leading up to a puffy white top. Glancing down at my Mont Blanc watched inscribed with 4810, my heart filled up with a quiet joy. This was not a deliberate pilgrimage by any means though. In May, when my mate Richard texted me and proposed that we embark on a Mont Blanc expedition, I agreed readily. For to see Mont Blanc in real life and challenge it was like a dream come true. From that simple text exchange, we would embark on this challenging walk up Mont Blanc. This story is an amateur aspiring alpinist’s attempt up to Mont Blanc 4810m. Every year climbing deaths occur on Mont Blanc. It is technically easy but can still be dangerous for the underprepared. I did not think much of it; I came with an open mind. The highest peak I had ever done before this was Mt Rinjani, Indonesia (3726m), and that was ages ago. There was no ice, no snow, no harnesses required. It was a straightforward walk up to the top. Anyone can do it. Mont Blanc was a totally different beast. That much was obvious from the beginning. On our first day, we went up by cable car to Aiguille di Midi, at 3842m. It is the main tourist link between Chamonix town and the mountains. When you’re up there you can admire Mont Blanc at a distance and assess the magnitude of the challenge. From the moment I stepped off the cable car, I could feel the effects of altitude. Even walking up stairs was becoming a challenge. At times, I felt as though an invisible hand was gripping my heart. It definitely takes time to get adapted. We collected our crampons, ice axe, and other equipment from our guiding company. I had done hill walking and scrambling in Scotland to prepare myself in the month prior, and even went to Norway to do some ice walking. However, doing it for a longer time was quite a different experience. Over the next two days, we practised our walking technique on different glaciers . You need to walk differently because unlike flat ground, ice is very smooth, with greatly reduced friction. You have crampons on to compensate for that. Each crampons has 12 pointy spikes to dig into the ice for good grip; and because of its sharpness, you have to be careful about how you walk or risk tearing your pants or hurt yourself. In many ways, one walks like a duck when using crampons. The stance is wider. An awkwardly cute waddle. We would wear our equipment incorrectly and were slow putting them on. We would slip on ice and trip over. Richard and I were still amateurs. When we got back from our second day of training, we were hit with bad news. The updated weather forecast meant our original planned Mont Blanc attempt on day 6 of the trip had to be brought forward to the next day (day 3) in order to maximise our chances. This was rather difficult to swallow, not least because we had barely acclimatised to the altitude and would lose valuable training time with the crampons. To add to the stress, our guide Giovanni also advised that we were unlikely to make the summit given our current skill and physical levels. I would have liked to think that we were strong walkers! We had trained diligently to prepare for this — with my efforts in Scotland and Richard’s in Singapore. Alas, we both knew, the altitude was affecting us and we were simply not in our top condition. We were walking on thin ice. Success or Failure could go either way. We decided to accept that we were dealt a bad hand and went for the summit attempt anyway. Having come so far, we might as well go for it. That night, it was difficult to sleep. Cognisant that we might be inadequate, there was a lingering fear in the air that we would fail our attempt. All the months hyping ourselves for this might be for nought. We took the train up to the start point. From there, it was a relatively gentle trek up to Tete Rousse on a rocky trail. Given Giovanni’s comments the day before, I was feeling a sense of urgency to walk quickly to prove myself. More than once, I had been cautioned not to run. Giovanni’s words weighed on me. It wasn’t long before we detected early signs that my mate Richard was not coping as well with the trail though. We had little rest as we made it to Tete Rousse (3,167m), as we aimed to reach the Gouter Hut (Summit Staging Point — 3815m) by early afternoon to have sufficient rest for the summit push the next day. I would say it was punishing for the unacclimatized. The other groups from our tour company were faring better under the same conditions. Oddly, we appeared the weakest. When we got to the Tete Rousse side, we took a short break to have water and put on our crampons. The hard part was beginning. From there on, it would be a steep scramble to the Gouter Hut. Richard had shared with me prior about the Couloir — an accident prone section where rocks might race down and hit climbers. A study showed that a rock fell on average once every 17 minutes between 11 am and 12 am. People actually die from this. It was important that climbers were careful, alert and fit, so that we could run if we needed to. We crossed the first glacier you can see on the right in the above picture. The real deal was beginning. I was pumped. I felt great. But, as we started our gradual scramble, it was clear that Richard was slowing down. This was strange, considering Richard is the more experienced and accomplished climber between the two of us. We were all tied together, Giovanni, Richard and myself, with rope. We trudged forward. Each step was getting harder with crampons and the elevation. We were going at a snail’s pace. Things were going slow. I tried encouraging Richard, and we both pushed on, but still we were not going at a good speed. The altitude was hitting him. Eventually, Giovanni stopped. He spoke to us- saying that Richard was not going to make it. At that moment, all I could say was ‘Huh!’. Was my adventure going to end as well? But I felt great. I could continue. It was a painful moment for our expedition. After some phone calls, Giovanni said that he would bring Richard to the Tete Rousse Hut and I could continue to the Gouter Hut. There was little protest. Richard acquiesced. Still, it was a hard moment seeing Richard descend the slope to the Tete Rousse Hut. The two of us go way back, having known each other since high school. We had done hikes together in Australia and were both enamoured by the challenges that nature had to offer. We came to do this together. So, it was definitely a difficult emotion to see him descend. In a way, we had failed. At the same time, I also felt a sense of relief that my adventure could continue; but even then, it was not an easy emotion to accept. No climber likes to fail but this sort of adventure is unlike others. Mountaineering is a risky sport. People die. You never want to risk climbing with someone with altitude problems up a steep scramble. If they fall, you would as well, because the whole team is roped up together. I believe if our ascent plan were less aggressive, Richard would have had greater odds of making it . As I sat at the spot waiting for Giovanni to return, I looked into the vast expanse, wondering how I would have felt if it were me instead. Could I calmly encourage my team mate to push forward? Why were two of us at Mont Blanc forking out so much money trying to conquer this mountain? Was there value in that? According to the philosopher Frederic Gros — walking does give us the freedom of disconnection. We are liberated from our daily lives. It frees us from the illusions about the essential. To be liberated from time. To be ourselves. In this struggle, we can’t pretend to be someone else. Stuck on a mountain with a pack, we are only ourselves. I am under no illusion that I can be a selfish person. My goals are important to me and I would spend heart or gold to gain every advantage possible to achieve them. So, whether it’s investing in a high-end mountaineering pack for its lightweight properties or spending a whole month in scotland scaling hills in fog and mud, I would do it all. But sometimes, I still look back and wonder to myself — was it alright that I wanted to carry on without him? Was that being very selfish? Am I good friend? Were my goals the only worthy ends? One thing I had going for me was my repeated failures prior in Scotland. The crazy weather and my poor navigation had taught me how to make peace with failed objectives. Things happen when climbing. We just have to accept it as part and parcel of the sport. An understanding that there is no certainty that you will seize your objective on the first attempt is what makes this sport fun. When we fail, we try again. The most important part is taking calculated risks — to appreciate if the danger is worth going for. I accepted that Richard was not going to make it. It was up to me to carry our ambition to make the summit. I had to focus. Giovanni came back and we trudged on. This section of the climb was extremely difficult. The angle of attack was very steep. We had to take very high steps and climb on all fours at certain points. It felt like proper rock climbing. I had to take many breaks to keep up. It was brutal. I spent everything I had to get through. The view of Gouter was helpful though. With each step, I knew I was getting closer and closer to the day’s goal. It kept my spirits up. Just as the Greek Master Sculptors carved out the statues of glory, I chipped away at the rock, patiently working on my own masterpiece. Bit by Bit. Step by Step. We pushed. The effort was singular. My heart might have been screaming, but I was going to make it. I found my rhythm and my feet moved forward at my own speed. There was no jostling, no hampering, no one else but me. Giovanni who was much stronger accommodated me and we moved at my pace. As a city boy, I am used to grabbing opportunity with a tap of my fingers. Be it a job opportunity, a date with a lovely girl, or discounts at my favourite Asian place. Here on the mountain, I was grabbing for dear life. Each handhold I had helped me place a better step. It was gruelling work. Totally unnecessary. Yet it was also totally necessary. Sport is the cultivation of endurance. A labour. We trade effort for joy. Being joyful for the very ability to walk. To experience the beauty the world has to offer and celebrate the maximisation of our potential. I had to continue. After 3 gruelling hours, we managed to reach flat ground. My heart sang. Finally, the day’s grind was over. When we got to the hut, I was pleasantly greeted by a well stocked cafe and cooked food. Supplies are delivered via helicopter to this refuge. To call this mountaineering would be a joke. This was French glamping at its finest. We were served a three course meal for dinner and drank Evian. Granted, that was some of the most expensive water I’ve had in my life, but up there, you did what you had to do to stay hydrated and stay strong. As an amateur, I took all these creature comforts in a heartbeat. If I had had to haul my food and camping gear up, I have little doubt that I would not have made it. As I sat in the hut taking in my food, I also realised I was now surrounded by mountaineers. Everyone in their North Face, Mammut, Quecha, La Sportiva, Scarpa, etc. People decked out in amazing and seasoned gear. I realised I was amongst adventurers. As I heard different stories from the others of their exploits, I was in awe. It felt as though I had found my tribe. These people came from everywhere, all sharing the joy of being in nature and testing themselves. It was rejuvenating to take in their energy. I belonged with the adventurers. Sunset came and I stood by the edge admiring the mountain’s glory. Above, the clouds were embraced by a sky saturated in a gentle orange that transitioned into an overflowing purple. As darkness set, I marvelled at the stars, and lay on my bunk bed. In the morning, I would tackle the summit. Edited by Constance Teoh"
Medium.com,Life,When being a ‘digital nomad’ does more harm than good,Travel,https://medium.com/@dannymaiorca/when-being-a-digital-nomad-does-more-harm-than-good-103f95c051f6?source=topic_page---------346------------------1," Long-term travel is exhausting. You’ve seen the Instagram posts. The ones of a MacBook Air carefully placed in a hammock, overlooking a beach somewhere in Southeast Asia. Ahh, to be a digital nomad. The ultimate freedom. The good life, right? Well, not for everybody. Freelancing in general comes with its share of challenges, and trying to do it while on the road can only add another unwanted dimension to those. Because at the end of the day, it’s still work. First of all, let’s talk about the boom in digital nomadism. According to statistics from MBO Partners, 4.8 million Americans would refer to themselves as a ‘digital nomad’. Meanwhile, an additional 17 million said that they aspire to be one someday. Much of this can be accounted to Tim Ferriss’ book — ‘The 4-Hour Workweek’ — which adopts the concept of moving to a country with low living costs and working for clients in wealthier nations. My route was a little different. Instead of getting a one-way flight to Bangkok, I headed north to Scandinavia. The reason for this was more about trying to decide where I wanted to settle, but I quickly realised some flaws in what I was doing. It actually had nothing to do with the living costs. Scandinavia is expensive, yes, but I had visited many times before and therefore knew that. There was also enough money in my savings account to fund this venture and I actually spent less on groceries than I would have in London. Instead, it was the constant moving around while trying to get a business up-and-running that started to wear me down. I spent two weeks in Stockholm, then two in Copenhagen. Afterwards, I headed to the USA for 16 days before returning. I returned north following that, going to Sweden, the Åland Islands and Norway. The original plan was to stay for another week and head to Gothenburg, but by now the grasp of burnout was firming. Thus, I instead booked a flight back to London so that I could really concentrate on my work for a bit. There wasn’t much time between booking that flight home and realising that the promotion of such a lifestyle could set a dangerous precedent. I think it can work for some people: But if you’re only getting started, have no clients and are looking to build a long-term business that you can survive on, then you need to question how the additional distractions will affect you. Long-term travel can be exhausting. Having to constantly look for accommodation and moving about all the time takes a toll on the brain. Then again, maybe you thrive off such uncertainty. Have a think about it, based on your own personal desires."

Medium.com,Life,Fear and Loathing in Iceland: How to Quit Your Job and Write Fulltime,Travel,https://medium.com/swlh/fear-and-loathing-in-iceland-how-to-quit-your-job-and-write-fulltime-eac49e6136d2?source=topic_page---------348------------------1," I was skirting the edge of a glacier in the southern highlands of Iceland when the LSD began to kick in. Steam rose from pockets in the volcanic hillsides and an eggy funk pervaded the air. Real chthonic shit. And the path was getting steeper. Dust and gravel scuffling under boot treads. The sun beat down from the middle of its 20-hour arc and I pulled my hoodie up over my head like a cloak letting the arms dangle so I wouldn’t overheat. Iceland was beautiful, a well-earned respite from the whirlwind past six months of opening and managing the cocktail program at an exciting new restaurant in Richmond, VA. I desperately needed a vacation so I took a few days off work and flew out to meet my core best friends all flying into Reykjavik from their four corners, and we settled into our Airbnb lakehouse for our tenth annual get-together. I was here to lose myself in Iceland and with my friends, to shake loose from some unnameable melancholy that had begun to take root. Reset my psyche and return to Richmond refreshed, with new ideas for the bar. The acid was a gift from a fellow bartender who was leaving RVA to pursue her comedy dreams in New York. We ate the tabs in the busy gravel parking lot and started up the slope, five of us joining the clusters and knots of hikers braving the 15 km loop up and over the hunched vertebrae of this tortured moonscape. Groups began to space out as the hike rose more and more strenuous and hikers stopped to rest or turn back. Behind us and far below was the canyon maze walled with broken blocks of dragonglass that guarded the approach to this steep path up the ridgeline and into a rich blue sky scantily laced with clouds. Ahead of us lay an alien realm the likes of which we’d never seen. My friend started laughing and I caught up to him. What’s up? Nothing, he chuckled. Just…this… I know, right? We lapsed into joyful silence and peeled off into our own deepening waves of the trip, periodically stopping and crouching to gaze at the weird striations of volcanic glaze decorating the flanks of this sleeping giant. I could stay here forever in this spot, I thought. Embracing this moment. Let it envelop me and take me all the way in… But we have to push on, I kept reminding myself. Maintain some kind of sensical pace lest we run out of daylight and fall prey to Loki’s wiles in the thin northern dark. I stood up from petting and peering deeply into the soft dry moss saddling the backstrap of Landmannalaugar and surveyed the undulating spread of neon green — from gobbling up surplus sulphur — that carpeted the black magma slag. Magnificent. Ahead of me and somewhat aflank were my two friends who’d also taken blotters. Wandering. Getting lost in the waves. Far up along the path trod my two friends who hadn’t. Talking. Photographing the incredible landscape. No one else was around. A mild anxiety gripped me and I realized I was thinking about my coworkers back home in Richmond, setting up the restaurant for a busy Friday service while here I was gallivanting in Iceland. What if they — I have to quit. It’s time to quit my cushy bartending job and take the plunge into fulltime freelance writing. Eyes wide I stood staring into the void as if it were a mirror. I heaved a sigh. Invisible talons loosed from my flesh and an enormous weight lifted from my shoulders. It all made so much sense. I had to quit. My heart wasn’t in it. I was just going through the motions. I want to write. It’s time to write. It won’t happen unless I commit all the way. It’s time to quit. I’m quitting. I skipped and floated through the rest of the hike, giggling and gazing in wonder at the colors and the shadows playing across the leeward landscape far below the crest of this ancient volcano. It was easy to see how early travelers here dreamt of giants. Even as we rounded a bend and came upon a thin footpath curving down a steep slope of loose scree with a stunning view of the countryside far below — even as we had to coax my non-tripping friend who’s desperately afraid of heights to shuffle step by tremulous step — all I could think about was setting myself up as a fulltime freelance writer and telling my creative, good-paying, plateaued and dead-end job to go stuff itself. Who can say what twisted mental pathways led to the hard and fast decision? All I knew was the idea bloomed in my shadowed soul with a vigor I hadn’t felt in a long time. A long time. I returned home and started researching and joined several freelance bidding platforms — which turned out to waver wildly between auction-block misery and lawless frontiers of scam and villainy. Maybe my decision was wrong. Or premature. What if I can’t do this? What if it’s impossible? Maybe I shouldn’t quit just yet… I hemmed and hawed and gobbled Medium articles about successful six-figure writing enterprises and the weeks went by and I kept getting older."
Medium.com,Life,Reverse Jail Break: How I Used A Cell As a Hotel Room,Travel,https://medium.com/@mrwritewhenever/reverse-jail-break-how-i-used-a-cell-as-a-hotel-room-5e2f7ca33657?source=topic_page---------349------------------1," Countless people have stories, or stories told about them, about how they broke out of jail. Few report ‘breaking’ into jail. I have such a story. In the early 1960s, I was a young writer in New York City — enjoying my first job where I could call myself a writer. My job was anything but exciting, but it was an excellent training ground, thanks to a boss with a great knowledge of and love for good writing. He helped me learn how to take the most mundane topic — episodes of such ‘classic’ TV series as The Patty Duke Show and My Mother The Car — and in 50 or so words, say just enough (but not too much!) about them that newspapers would be willing to print the synopses. Though it had existed for a couple of decades, television only then was reaching a significant number of Americans, and papers commonly printed TV Guide-like blurbs about upcoming episodes of most series, even ones in syndication — like the ones I wrote about. In the course of my job, I from time to time had occasion to call newspapers or television stations. Being me, I took every opportunity to ‘chat up’ every interesting- (and young-) sounding woman. On more than a couple of occasions, only one of them with a legitimate business basis, I spoke to a woman with a nice Maine accent at a TV station in Portland, that state’s largest city. Portland’s population currently is around 66,000. Then, it was around 72,000. It is, in other words, a small city. Then, like most American cities of its size, it was relatively unsophisticated. Life moved at a comfortable pace, crime wasn’t a big issue. And the local jail sat empty a good deal of the time. Without bothering to tell her, I decided to go visit that young lady — I’d established she was close to my age plus a few other details in our phone conversations — and I took a couple of days off from my job to do so. As a kid in Kentucky, I used to hitch-hike everywhere — to my job as a caddie at a golf club some miles from my home; to farm jobs picking potatoes and strawberries, to the store on chores. Hitch-hiking was a bit of a concern even of parents then, but it was widely accepted as a way for the less-advantaged (and people off bus lines) to get from place to place. I saw no reason why I shouldn’t hitch-hike the 300-plus miles from New York City to Maine. So, I did. I have no specific memory of the to-ing or fro-ing of that trip other than that it was uneventful — as most of my hitch-hiking adventures were. I hitch-hiked between New York City and Kentucky on several occasions — each representing a round-trip of well over 1000 miles. Over time, though, I’d sort of worked out a formula that I could pretty well count on reaching even a distant place, as Portland was in this instance, nearly as fast or faster hitch-hiking as I could have using long-distant buses. (From New York City, I’d have had to take one bus to Boston, probably by way of Hartford, then take a ‘stopping’ bus — stopping at every opportunity, it seemed like on such trips — to Portland. All told, that routing would most likely have taken me from one morning to the next.) As it turned out, my hitch-hiked to Portland stretched only from sometime in the morning until around dark — probably earlier than 8 p.m. If I’d eaten at all on the trip, it wasn’t much: I really was pressed for cash, and anyone with half a grain of sense would have realized this entire venture was a fool’s errand. I walked the last couple of miles into the town center, wondering all the while what I was going to do, where I was going to sleep that night. Inspiration struck when I saw, up ahead, a light on the local police station. Having no money for ‘proper’ accommodation, I went in, stated my plight, and asked politely to be put up for the night in the jail. I was. Clearly, I had to be both drug- and alcohol-free to get away with that, but who in their right, left or center mind would think inviting yourself to a night in jail was a good idea? The police officer who agreed to my beyond-strange request was probably in his 40s, and undoubtedly was an adventurous lad himself a decade and a bit earlier. Chances are, though, that he’s never had a request like that — ‘please put me in jail!’ — before. I had the place to myself. I got a blanket. There was, it was pointed out, a pail in the corner if it was needed. My ‘door’ — it was a real old-fashioned cell — was gently locked, and that was that: I was on my own, in a very quiet… dare I say it? — ‘private hotel’ for a night. I went to sleep quickly: I’d been on the road all day, with little nourishment. I slept like a log. Outside noises, and the jailer’s moving around, awoke me fairly early. I waited a short while, to see if he’d come around on his own; when he didn’t, I gently let out a ‘hell-lo’, and that attracted him. As any good bed-and-breakfast host would have, he asked if I slept all right. I assured him I had. He said he could offer me some coffee, which I gladly accepted, before I stepped out the door — a free man again!! — into the Portland morning. I must have eaten something, somewhere, in the next couple of hours, until it was time to call and actually surprise my intended visitor that I was, indeed, in town. (I couldn’t have phoned ahead if I wanted to, as I didn’t have her home number. And we were nearly 40 years away from being able to e-mail a message.) I was invited to visit, and given directions. She lived, as I recall, with her parents — of my parents’ generation. An age group not big on impulsive behaviors. It was a short visit… and undoubtedly the last time I reached out to the object of my visit. As efficiently as I’d traveled to Maine, I ‘rode my thumb’ back home to New York City. Adventure over, experience(s) gained, lessons learned. Among the latter were: [1] Be careful who you’ve impulsive with, and [2] you may get away with a ‘free get in and out of jail’ card once, but when you’re not playing Monopoly, you’d probably be best advised to seek different accommodations."
Medium.com,Life,A History of Blackpool & Blackpool Tower,Travel,https://medium.com/@stevenewman.newman/a-history-of-blackpool-blackpool-tower-8e341fa65d59?source=topic_page---------350------------------1," Britain’s Most Iconic Seaside Resort Blackpool is seen by many as an illuminated anachronism of the very worst, and the very best of the English seaside resort, but whatever your feelings it’s a step back into a time almost forgotten. Once there, and you’ve taken in several deep breaths of very fresh, very bracing Irish Sea air, climb aboard one of the original corporation trams and you’ll soon notice that Blackpool has a past that can be seen, and heard, as you clank and rattle passed three of the most beautiful Victorian piers you’re ever likely to see. Stay aboard the green and cream tram and you’ll witness a parade of 19th and early 20th century architecture at its most robust. And when you eventually get off the tram at the Pleasure Beach you can indulge yourself in the delights of one of the oldest fairgrounds in the world, with one of the biggest big dippers in the world too.

If you don’t fancy the big dipper you can still laugh along with the original Laughing Policeman — you might even spot a real policemen — and when giddy from the innumerable, and terrifying rides, you can (pink candy-floss in hand) take a horse drawn carriage back along the Golden Mile to the Tower Ballroom and watch, and listen, as the ‘Mighty Wurlitzer’ organ rises from beneath the stage in a fog of dry ice with the familiar chords of ‘Oh I Do Love To Be Beside The Seaside’, encouraging hundreds of ballroom dancers to their feet. After a quick-step or two why not take a ride up the Tower itself — 125 years old — and from your 518 ft (and 9 inches) advantage point see the lights of the Grand Theatre, the Opera House, and the Winter Gardens, venues that still pack in the paying audiences every summer. The political Party conferences have now gone elsewhere. After that visit the ‘original’ Gypsy Rose Lee can still read your palm, if you dare. You can then easily top that eerie experience with a visit to the Tower Circus, or a show at the Opera House, or any one of the piers, followed by some of the best fish & chips in the world, all washed down with a pint or two of Tetley’s ale. Blackpool is a living, breathing, historical monument that seems to constantly re-invigorate its own past by keeping it very much in the present. Just walk up and down the Promenade and I swear you’ll see those black and white steam driven days of the 1890s, and the motorcycles and sidecars of the 1920s and 30s. Sit in the galleries of the Tower Ballroom and you’ll hear the echo of those 1930s dance bands, or if you’re very lucky, The Beatles back in the early 1960s. Stay seated long enough and you’ll also see the decline of the resort in the 1970s when Blackpool lost out to cheap, sun-drenched holidays abroad — and ironically the not dissimilar attractions of Disneyland.

And it’s only in the last couple of decade or so — with a couple of large new hotels opening on the north Promenade — that Blackpool has tried again to attract more visitors, plus trade shows and conferences, including the International Chess Congress, and the ‘Talk of the Coast’, which is one of the biggest talent contests in the world; and according to those who know Blackpool has also become the gay capital of the North, with clubs such as ‘Funny Girls’ a popular spot for stag and hen nights. But many of Blackpool’s elected wanted to change its external image dramatically by building a huge hotel and casino complex — the gambling industry has been buying-up property along the Golden Mile for years — that will take more money in a single night than all the ‘eyes down’ bingo stalls could possibly take in a year — and pour a small fortune into the corporation coffers. Local opposition from small hotels and businesses, who saw the proposals as a threat to their livelihoods, have managed to see off the proposals for the time being. Time will tell. When the Scottish born screenwriter — he co-wrote most of the Will Hay films — humourist, and lyricist, Marriot Edgar (aka Edgar. G. Marriot, and half-brother of crime novelist, Edgar Wallace), wrote The Lion and Albert monologue for Stanley Holloway in the 1930s, he didn’t choose the geographical setting of his first verse lightly: There’s a famous seaside town called Blackpool, That’s noted for fresh air and fun, And Mr and Mrs Ramsbottom went there with young Albert, their son. Edgar chose Blackpool because it meant — had meant for over 150 years — exactly that: fresh air and fun. Blackpool was just a scattered collection of farms and fishermens’ huts in the first half of the 18th century, and it must have felt cut off too situated as it was at the end of a long stretch of flat rather marshy land through which no one had thought of building a road. What was the point? And until the construction of the M55 the road system across that strange piece of treeless land was pretty abysmal and confusing. But Blackpool did have something a bit special: several miles of sandy beaches and an Irish Sea that came right up to the shoreline at every high tide, which was soon to satisfy the craze for sea bathing. The 1750s saw the first real influx of bathers prepared to charge naked into the freezing Irish sea, which caused a good deal of consternation amongst the fisherman and farmers until they realised that with the arrival of these hearty folk came the chance to make some money. The 1770s and 1780s saw several enterprising locals build Inns and small hotels to house the increasing number of the gentry — and a growing number of the new merchant rich — who, in the summer months, ventured along the twisting footpaths to seek their watery pleasures. By the end of the 18th century a road had been built — with regular summer stage coach services from as far away as Halifax — which was the first step toward Blackpool’s future success, with ‘bathing accommodations advertised in newspapers across the north of England to encourage the new industrial rich to come to Blackpool. With the explosion of the Industrial Revolution — and the increase in the populations of the industrial centres of northern England and Scotland — Blackpool’s visitor levels increased steadily. At the height of the so called ‘cotton famine’ in 1863 — when thousands of mill workers were laid-off — an amazing 195,287 passengers disembarked at the Talbot Road Railway Station during that summer season. By 1873 — with the off-season population of Blackpool just 7,092 — the influx of summer visitors reached the all time high of 850,000. Forty years later, and in the last season before the Great War, Blackpool saw its visitor numbers rise to a staggering 3.8 million! Only New York’s Coney Island could rival Blackpool in 1913. Even during the dark years of World War I — and due mainly to severe travel restrictions — Blackpool still thrived as a tourist attraction, helping to put a little colour and fun back into the life of a nation worn down by war. During the 1920s and 1930s visitor numbers continued to grow, and by 1937, when a Parliamentary Committee was debating the desirability of making holidays with pay compulsory — and, according to a newspaper poll, an overwhelming majority of the British working-class agreed that the only proper holiday was one spent by the seaside — Blackpool was attracting 7.5 million visitors between June and September. In the early part of the 19th century new buildings appeared in Blackpool in an indiscriminate fashion, with most of them small commercial enterprises, and built as close to the beach as possible to attract as many customers as possible. The majority were built of wood and were often washed away. Only with the construction of the two-mile long sea wall in the 1860s did Blackpool begin to develop in a planned and orderly fashion. With the completion of the sea wall the North Shore development began in earnest — it was destined to become, for a short while, the ‘best end’ of Blackpool — with large three and four storey houses built along the Promenade, with slightly smaller versions in the streets behind — many of which later became small private hotels with such names as ‘The Claremont’, and ‘The Northland’, names which still conjure up the aspirations of those times. In 1867, the imposing Imperial Hotel was also built on the North Shore which, for those few decades before the First World War — and during the early 1920s — became a summer refuge for the wealthy Lancashire factory owners, who delighted in the hotel’s sumptuous interiors. The Imperial’s guests, turning their backs on the raucous downtown Blackpool, would, after a hearty breakfast, stroll northwards along the Promenade toward Fleetwood — perhaps sitting for a while to read the newspaper, or watch the fishing fleet heading out into the Irish Sea — before returning to the hotel for lunch. In the afternoons they might enjoy the delights of the many bars, play snooker, or broil gently in the Turkish Baths, or perhaps listen to an afternoon recital of Gilbert and Sullivan. Then, after dinner — for which it was obligatory to ‘dress’ — they’d dance to a splendid palm court orchestra, play cards, or read, before retiring to their beds. And you can still enjoy the four star luxury of the Imperial Hotel today. Along the South Shore the development was less grand, with row upon row of narrow three storey terraced houses — invariably built of bright red Accrington brick — with bay windows painted white and proudly displaying the inevitable Aspidistra. By the late 1880s, the ubiquitous ‘Vacancies / No Vacancies’ signs began to appear alongside the Aspidistras. These guest houses, and the larger private hotels on the North Shore became, and still are, the bedrock of Blackpool’s visitor accommodation. During the 1890s, and the early part of the 20th century, the front gardens of the terraced houses along the South Shore Promenade were gradually built upon and turned into either shops or attractions of one sort or another, becoming, with the arrival of electricity, the now famous ‘Golden Mile’. The first real visitor attraction in Blackpool was the rather ramshackle wooden building — a cross between a non-conformist church and a dilapidated Southern mansion — called ‘Uncle Tom’s Cabin’, which was built in the late 1850s on the North Shore to house such attractions as shooting galleries, a theatre and dance hall — with nightly minstrel shows — and a long bar in the style of a Western Saloon. It remained in use until just after the First World War. Blackpool’s first pier, the North Pier — a stone’s throw from the Talbot Road Station — opened in the mid-1860s for the exclusive use of the burgeoning middle-classes. It had a 2d entrance fee which allowed its patrons an ‘extensive and agreeable promenade’, and access to, and landing from, pleasure boats and other machines.’ It was a huge success, but according to the operators, attracted from the outset the ‘wrong sort of people’. A second pier, the South Jetty, was built for those wrong sorts, with its entrance constructed on land donated by Robert Bickerstaffe, which just happened to be opposite his own Wellington Hotel. It opened in 1868, but didn’t succeed until Bickerstaffe’s nephew, also named Robert, took over the management of the pier in 1870. He immediately instigated a bar and dance hall at the end of the pier, cheap boat excursions and fairground attractions, all of which attracted huge crowds, and huge profits. Over the next twenty years or so a small group of Blackpool entrepreneurs constructed the Raikes Hall Pleasure Gardens, the Winter Gardens, the Grand Theatre, the Opera House, and the Central Pier, plus large shopping developments, and the first Yates’ Wine Lodge. Blackpool was beginning to take on its now familiar character. The 1890s also brought the first Gypsy encampments — situated on the site of today’s Pleasure Beach — which became, in itself, a large visitor attraction. This encampment is thought to have been the home of the first, and original, Gypsy Rose Lee. The first official Illuminations opened in May 1912 ( there had been an earlier version where six gas arc lamps were used to illuminate a carnival along the Promenade in 1879, which attracted over 100,000 people) and with the exception of the two World Wars have gone from strength to strength, with, today, over six miles of lights (at a cost of many millions of pounds), creating one of the world’s finest illuminated extravaganzas. Paris’ Eiffel Tower, built for the International Exposition of 1889, provided the initial inspiration for Blackpool Tower, with the actual construction proposal coming from the London based Standard Debenture Company who, on paper, had plans to build several towers around the country. It was, to quote historian, John K. Walton, “…a shell company, with very little of its capital subscribed, which aimed to acquire a plot of land and sell it on to a newly created Tower Company, at an inflated profit, and then go into liquidation at an early stage.” This would leave the project stranded with virtually no prospect of constructing “…a viable business on the over-valued site.” What Standard Debenture had not reckoned with was the Mayor of Blackpool, John Bickerstaff (who’d invested 2,000 of his own money in the project), who was, like other members of his family, not in the business of losing money. And because Bickerstaff became suspicious of Standard Debenture early on he made it difficult for them to attract sufficient new investment, which effectively stalled the project, allowing Bickerstaff time to take over and reconstruct the Tower Company, attract new local investment and complete the job. The foundation stone of Blackpool Tower was laid by Sir Mathew White-Ridley Bart, MP, on the 25th of September 1891, with the main construction carried out by Heenan and Froude of Manchester, with steel erectors Bell and Wilcox working as sub-contractors. The legs of the Tower are supported by concrete blocks each 35 feet square and 12 feet deep. Embedded in the concrete are rolled joists so that the overall weight of the Tower (3,830 tons) is evenly distributed. A ‘Tower-Rearing Supper’ (topping-out ceremony) was held on the 29th September 1893 after the crow’s nest, at 480 ft, had been completed. Sadly, both architects of the project, James Maxwell, and Charles Tuke, died before the ceremony. The Tower opened on Whit Monday, 14 May 1894, with the red brick building beneath containing a restaurant, pavilion, aquarium, menagerie, roof garden, and, naturally, several bars. In July 1897 an electrical fault in a searchlight cable caused a fire at the top of the Tower and because of the Tower’s height was left to burn itself out. As a result of the intense heat the cables of the lift counterweights weakened and then snapped, sending the huge counterweights plunging downward to smash through two concrete floors before embedding themselves below one of the legs of the Tower where they remain to this day. The elaborate rococo style Tower Ballroom, designed by Frank Matcham — with its famous quote from Shakespeare’s ‘Venus and Adonis’ above the stage: “Bid me discourse, I shall enchant thine ear” — was opened in March 1899 and is still a breath-taking example of completely over-the-top interior design. But there is something magical about the ballroom, something warm and welcoming that no other building in Britain can offer. For just a few pounds you can spent a whole day in the Tower complex which gives a strange feeling of safety from the elements and the real world lurking outside. The white and gold Wurlitzer organ was installed in the Ballroom in June 1929 — just weeks before the now legendary Reginald Dixon began his 40 year career behind the keyboards. Most of the Tower’s steelwork was replaced in the 1920s, and after another fire in 1956 the partially destroyed Ballroom was completely restored to its present glorious condition. In the 1960s the Bickerstaff family sold the Tower to Lord Delfont’s First Leisure Group, and in 1998 First Leisure sold it to Leisure Parcs. It is now owned by the local council and run by the Merlin Entertainment Group. In these days of virtual reality Blackpool, and its treasured icon, Blackpool Tower, still stand out as a symbol of a genuine reality when fun was a collective and rather jolly experience. It’s still a great place to visit."

Medium.com,Life,Minimalism: Making Home a Mindset not a Space,Travel,https://medium.com/@kirsty.gordge/minimalism-making-home-a-mindset-not-a-space-78bcbf39f2f2?source=topic_page---------353------------------1," Thoughts from a traveller after 6 months on the road. I remember how I felt six months ago, squeezing the zip closed on my 55-litre backpack, only to realise there was another essential that I needed and reluctantly dragging the zip open again. This went on for hours as I stressed over what I could possibly want with me on the journey of a lifetime. When would I be back again? What could I live without? What should I definitely take? All these unanswered questions — that when I finally checked my bag in at the airport it was a relief; no more overthinking about what is appropriate for the #onewayticket lifestyle. Whatever I had or didn’t have — I could deal with it. Throughout my six months of making a ‘home on the road’, I’ve come to embrace the minimalist lifestyle and slowly my mindset has transformed. It’s taken me on a crazy trip of realisations along the way, and I want to share these with you. 1. You don’t need a lot of stuff, you just need the right stuff. This is broad, I know, but often you don’t need a choice of something. You just need something. One pair of pyjamas, one pair of jeans. Swimming togs. A scarf. The dress that’s appropriate for everything. I came to realise and appreciate that choosing what to wear was a practised exercise and instead of making a new decision each time I was repeating a comfortable old one. 2. Some things are useful. And some things are useful and sentimental. These are the things you call home. I then came to realise that some things I carried were practical, like socks. But some things were more to me than that, like my pink fluffy slippers. A few months ago, I wrote an article for an engineering firm about designing meaning into infrastructure at the planning stage. The ideas behind the writing that I did back then have stuck with me and magnified… I think we can design meaning into objects in our everyday lives. The value in my slippers is hidden in the association of meaning that I have built into them: home. Whenever I feel like I need to walk on clouds for a while, I put them on and I’m comforted, instantly. Because I’ve trained myself to believe that this is what home feels like. Some of the stuff that I had left with was just stuff. Now it was stuff with a meaning. 3. Everything has a purpose. If the purpose doesn’t serve you, you don’t have it. Carrying everything you live with on your back makes you immune to shopping. It’s not enough just to like something to add it to your collection; you need to see value in it, purpose, consistency, dependability, and consider the physical weight and size of it before welcoming it into your life (pack). Everything you purchase should be useful and in line with your morals in terms of contributing to supply and demand. Similarly, if you’re building a home and wanting to live the tiny home or minimalist lifestyle, ask yourself questions of everything. What is the utility of this? When and how will it be useful? Is it just pretty? 4. Learn to love how the things make you feel, not the things. This is where it gets interesting. After reaching the point of feeling at home in my slippers, I realised there was another whole level where the metaphor I worked so hard to create isn’t irreplaceable itself. If I lose my dear slippers, I lose the connection to home that I have been carrying for 6 months. Yes, I would be a bit sad. If I have completely internalised this concept of slippers = home, I could even be beyond repair, damaged for life. But in reality, I would have lost a $5 pair of slippers that are looking worse for wear anyway. The trigger for feeling ‘home’ would be gone, but the sense of home would not be; because that feeling is still built in my mind. I would need to find something else that is familiar and get used to building the same trigger into that instead. Suddenly my irreplaceable slippers became completely replaceable as I realised that if I lost them, it wouldn’t tear me apart. 5. Less clutter equals more spontaneity. Having less ‘stuff’ around you not only helps to keep a tidy physical space, but a tidy mental space. It forces you to realise the actual value of things and what’s important — not only in your home but in your life. Are you tied down to one location by a whole bunch of accumulated stuff that you can never imagine sorting through? When you have one bag, you can literally take it anywhere and have everything you need. Because of this, you say yes to almost every opportunity; and it would be silly not to. What do you have to lose? If it doesn’t work out, you just pick up your bag and leave again. It’s surprising how much more mentally open you can be without having all this subconscious baggage tugging at the corner of your t-shirt saying ‘but what if?’ I know what you’re thinking: this nomad life is a totally different story. Personally, I don’t need a soap dispenser for the bathroom; I don’t need space to store tea towels; I can walk through IKEA without buying anything. But I promise you, it’s not that different in terms of placing value into things. Whether you are on the road or in the space you have come to call home, you can still ask yourself of every item: what does this mean to me? It will probably fall into one of three categories: - I like the use of this and I enjoy it, but I guess it’s not irreplaceable.
- This makes me feel at home, has meaning, and I don’t want to live without it.
- I have this just because I have it and it doesn’t really serve a purpose. I want you to savour these thoughts.
Stuff is just stuff.
You can design meaning into things to trigger feelings.
This increases the value of your stuff.
If you let yourself have only meaningful things in your life, you’ll have way less in it.
And although these things have designed meaning in them, they are not irreplaceable.
They are a metaphor for the values that you hold in your head. After six months of reaching this conclusion, I leave you with this: if I lose my bag on a bus, I’ve lost a bag full of stuff, not my home. And it’s the same for you; if your house burns down, you’ve lost a house full of stuff, not your home. Because if you can nurture yourself to understand and internalise this level of metaphors, you’ll realise one important thing. Home isn’t a space, it’s a mindset. And you can never be truly lost if you carry home with you inside your head."
Medium.com,Life,We Kill What We Keep,Travel,https://humanparts.medium.com/we-kill-what-we-keep-52bf2a7ccd78?source=topic_page---------354------------------1," spent much of my childhood living in my head. Summers I’d spend lying on my fire escape watching squirrels ravage the trees. I’d peer into my neighbors’ windows and picture the lives they led. I occupied my days with fiction — the names I’d give them, their way of talk, the stories they told, and the lives they’d sleep through — and it was always a shock when I’d encounter them at the corner store. Drained of color and mystery, these people were never who I’d imagined them to be. This terrified me so much that I’d run home, close my eyes, and create new stories. It was only when I ran out of neighbors that I retreated to books. Stories were my shelter, and I was never alone. Now I often wonder if that was dangerous, a child confined to her imagination. The mind a warden of one’s body. Friends invented. Countless and elaborate lives lived before I actually lived them. I was 90, hair white, before my 10th birthday. I swept through a courtroom making my case for the defendant before I was 12. Reality was a body on life support. A will read aloud to grabbing, salty hands. A face covered in gravel and rock. A body withering under the mulch. Living in my head was a kingdom no tyrant could ruin. But my mother always warned me that we kill what we keep."

Just a little hole-in-the-wall.” Such phrases make the sayer seem mysterious and adventure-loving. The kind of person who takes gap year on a whim. A free spirit who orders without a menu. Yet most hole-in-the-walls are not something you brag about over cocktails. They are often places you remember vividly as you down another beer in an effort to wash away the memory. My boyfriend and I wandered into this kind of hole-in-the-wall in the middle of busy Hanoi. It wasn’t a planned meal, such stops rarely are. The combined forces of our hunger and crankiness at being lost resulted in me jerking my thumb sharply at the first place I saw with food. “That will do.” In fact it would not. But if either of us took one more wrong turn, then someone was going to have to switch their seat on the flight back. Right away I realized our mistake upon entering the establishment. To be fair the building itself hadn’t used any false advertising. It looked as if the corner of the structure had been left undone. Or perhaps a large creature had taken a bite out of this section. The restaurant had two large walls that united in a corner, sort of a large ice-cream cone look. The ceiling was more patches than drywall. Much of it was completely covered by large swatches of styrofoam and bubble wrap, taped messily to any non-crumbling bit of ceiling that could be found. This was the kind of place where you don’t look at the floor. And if you made the mistake of looking once, as I did, you will make a concerted effort not to do so again. The ground writhed with a multitude of bugs, creating an almost surreal vapor effect, like heat rising from hot asphalt. Now it is a game of chicken. I did not want to be the first to back out of this challenge. I was the one who picked the spot, without careful consideration. Now I must follow through, lest I be the cause of another fight for, “Not wanting to try anything new.” If we left he’d win a point for future arguments. And, the one thing I know about love, winning is the everything. Picking up the menu, which stuck slightly to my previously clean fingers, I casually suggested items. I hoped my partner had heard the crackling sounds coming from under his own shifting feet. The bodies of scouting ants dying in their quest to see if the floor beneath our table contained food remnants for their queen. Unfortunately, my partner was all in for this war of attrition that could only end with us leaving before we ordered, or, quite likely, food poisoning. We ordered, taking our chances. The food arrived, almost as soon as we’d asked for it. I suspect the menu is for show, that we are getting the pho of the day no matter what variety we ordered. Also, we didn’t live there, how would we even know the difference between broths? They got the meat right at least. As in, it’s some kind of meat. I wish I could say the dish tasted just like chicken, but that would be a lie. The whole time we ate the table moved up and down, it’s broken leg turning it into a joyless seesaw, trying to find equilibrium. We also tried not to move our lower bodies too much. The chairs were on their last good leg, and I’m sure we’d be forced to pay for new ones if they broke. Finally, with half-empty bowls and stomachs full of regret, we paid the bill. In our case we paid a laughably high price for the food we got. But weirdly enough though the restaurant gave us more than our money’s worth. It’s so easy to pick at the things that annoy you about a person, especially when traveling and stress takes hold. Eating there gave us something to hold on to when things seemed dark, or we were lost in the metro. It gave us an inside joke, to lighten our spirits. Oh, and it also did give us diarrhea."

It’s not a pricey vacation, by any means. I booked all my flights on budget airlines, spending not a single cent on a baggage allowance. This means that I’m traipsing through airports, cities, and cobblestoned old town centers with jacket pockets that bulge so severely that I look about 7 months pregnant, and with a collapsible, 5€ IKEA backpack so stuffed that it makes me look (as my previous partner used to joke) like a Ninja Turtle. Traveling more cheaply has also involved booking evening flights (which — depending on how you see things — can present some inconveniences); has entailed renting rooms in hostels rather than proper hotels; and has meant often relying on grocery shopping and leftovers to fill my belly for the larger part of the day. Would I love to be able to afford the privilege of a carry-on, thus saving my poor back from the abuse of an over-stuffed backpack? Would I love to be able to rent cushy rooms that offered a better night’s sleep, total privacy, and (let’s be real) a more eye-pleasing aesthetic than the typical dimness and spartan vibe of a hostel? Would I love to eat more of the local delicacies without worrying about the bill that will inevitably follow? Or would I perhaps even like to sign up for excursions, like tapas crawls or a breezy glide over the Mediterranean on the deck of a sweet boat? Of. fucking. course. But I can’t. Because I’m poor. And while I’m not thrilled with that, I’ve made my peace with it for now. See, if I stick to a minimal budget with respect to flights and lodging — and to a moderate budget with respect to food — I can be here in Spain at all. And being here in Spain at all, even if I’m not entirely comfortable or living my days and nights up to the max, is still preferable (as a short-term getaway) to the monotony of the day-to-day in the city where I live. So I stealth-pack my cheap IKEA bag. I jam my pockets beyond any reasonable capacity. I plan, once I land, to rely on public transportation to get to wherever my bed is waiting, and then I fill up on grocery store salads and instant noodles once I’m there. I’m just thankful that I have these options at all. The 60€ I might save by booking a bag-less airfare gives me an extra night or two at a hostel. The 20€-plus-tip that I save by not taking cabs from airports affords me a whole vacation’s worth of morning coffees. The money I save by eating instant noodles for lunch and leftovers for breakfast gives me some extra to set aside for a bigger splurge on local specialties for dinner, like (in Spain’s case) paella. I lose some luxury to gain a bit of freedom and pleasure in other ways."

Medium.com,Life,I live in a country where I don’t speak the language and this is what I learnt,Travel,https://blog.usejournal.com/i-live-in-a-country-where-i-dont-speak-the-language-and-this-is-what-i-learnt-6a8d72a8c89b?source=topic_page---------364------------------1," A year ago, I decided to jump into a new adventure: I moved to Budapest! I was no stranger to moving: born and raised in Portugal, I had already lived in France and England but Hungary had a particular twist: I don’t speak Hungarian. While this didn’t scare me — I had been travelling extensively and getting around using just English — it proved to be a very peculiar experience, and one that I am still going through. I moved here to study — I did a programming bootcamp that I documented here on Medium — and also for one of the main reasons people move abroad: love. I was in a relationship with a Hungarian for most of my first year here and that sure helped easing into the culture and navigating life here. But, one year later, I still don’t speak the language. I used to consider myself fairly good with languages. After all, I speak Portuguese, English, French, Spanish and can understand a bit of German. But Hungarian is a wilder beast. Sometimes, I believed it’s untameable. Impossible to even start to comprehend. During the first five months, I was too focused on the bootcamp and on learning Java — learning a programming language was enough, I couldn’t handle another one. But in the past six months, I have been really trying. I use Duolingo, Drops, books, and I finally signed up to classes on a school. I’m making progress but I am incredibly far from being fluent. Even though I still haven’t properly learnt Hungarian, I did learn a thing or two from this experience: 1. It is possible to live in a country where you don’t speak the language — maybe this is a consequence of the global world we live in and would not have been possible just a couple of decades ago. But the truth is that I completed my studies and I am currently working for a company here and none of that required me to speak the language. I also have been managing my everyday life without much hassle, including things like going to the bank or setting up Internet at home. 2. It is frustrating at times — even though it’s possible to live like this, it can get very frustrating sometimes. For example, when a letter arrives on the post and you don’t understand a thing. Or when you need medication and have to go to several pharmacies until you find someone who speaks English fluently enough. 3. Supermarket trips were incredibly painful at first — this one was really unexpected for me, but during the first month or two, going to the supermarket was a very tiring experience. Many products were different to what I was used to back home and, being vegetarian, I needed to read the labels. The problem was that I didn’t understand a word! And even though many products had labels in several languages, they were all foreign to me, like Czech, Serbian or Estonian. I eventually decided to shop at Lidl and Aldi because I could read the labels a bit better, making use of the German I learnt with Duolingo. 4. A big part of communication is non-verbal — true. There are many theories about this, quoting as much as 93% of all communication to be non-verbal. While gestures and face expressions can certainly help in a trip to the bakery, for example, they won’t perform miracles. I could never have a deep conversation with anybody that way and even holding a basic conversation with my partner’s family — who didn’t speak English — was frustrating and tiring. 5. Most people are nice and will try to help — many people are sympathetic to the fact that you don’t speak the local language and will try to communicate either way. Sometimes, people who have nothing to do with you will jump in to help as translators, for example when they are queuing behind you and realize you are struggling to make yourself understood. But some people can be really unhelpful too — several times, I started conversations in English and if they went a bit further and the person would feel uncomfortable, they would start speaking Hungarian and never revert to English. In these situations, you just need to let it go — it’s their country and their language. No reason to be upset about it, just move on. 6. It’s very important to have someone who can help you — I had my partner and that was super important, as I could count on help if I needed anything more serious. Like that day when I went to the Immigration Office and the lady at the counter didn’t speak English — because, why would they, at the Immigration Office, right? In situations like that, it’s very handy to have someone to call and ask for a translation from. 7. Budapest is one thing, the countryside is another — I live in the capital of the country and that is a major factor in me being able to live here without speaking the language. When I go to the countryside, finding English speakers is a much harder job. This can also be true in other countries — the cities will always be easier places to navigate due to the higher rate of English speakers, but some countries are also much more friendly in this regard than others. 8. Google Translator is helpful, stupid and funny — It sure saved me from many situations and helped me a great deal in navigating my life here. But the translations can also be very off, especially with more complex languages, like Hungarian. The good side is that, sometimes, those translations are some of the funnier things you’ll ever read. Like when I agreed a meeting with a guy I was selling something to and he wrote something that got translated as “I will be in the square with a chicken” (he meant he would be near the chicken food truck), or when my friend tried to translate “Merry Christmas” to Hungarian and Google suggested “F**k me up”!"

I’ve always traveled on a shoestring, and a few years ago, I tried to see if I could circumnavigate the globe on $1,000. Including airfare. It seemed like an impossible challenge, so naturally, I wanted to give it a shot. It started when a friend of mine alerted me that he’d found this weird thing where if you flew on these certain dates from New York City to Milan, and then from Lisbon to Thailand by way of Paris, the ticket was only $325. A jigsaw puzzle of a route. And I figured out that I could launch myself from Vancouver, Canada, where I would be for work anyway. I’d just need to use some airmiles to get from a connection in Seattle to NYC, and then a different set of airmiles to get home to Spokane, Washington, from Bangkok. So I booked everything. A hopper flight from Milan to Lisbon set me back another $30. When I travel on a budget, I try to come at things with the patience and level of inexperience usually reserved for a three-year-old playing with some improvised toy — a string of paper clips suddenly becoming flashing silver soldiers. It is the only way to get through long hours of exhaustion and enjoy the less-than-pristine environments you encounter. I have traveled often and the places blur together, but I must forget this and see each thing as if I were 19 again, on my first trip abroad, the mundane ache of daily need shot through with the exotic. And of course, it is easy to see the exotic in something that is unfamiliar. On vacation in a place like Thailand, it’s easier to be OK with the fact that the bed is a bit too hard, or the beer is a bit too warm, or the music is a bit too loud. There is no way of changing it without abandoning it; you might as well enjoy it. You might as well take the time to notice the small things you’ve forgotten about yourself, like how it feels to stretch your hands over your head in the morning. I know this already, looking at my itinerary. Each step is a challenge I must overcome with relish lest I waste all of it. Not just the $1,000, not just the month of November, but life itself."
Medium.com,Life,How a Whale Shark Eased the Pain of Watching a Friend Die,Travel,https://medium.com/@pamperkins/how-a-whale-shark-eased-the-pain-of-watching-a-friend-die-e1150a838031?source=topic_page---------366------------------1," I met Kaye on a 30-day, 1500 mile bicycle trip in Oregon, where I rode with a bunch of amazing women, many of whom had cycled across the country the year before. An outstanding athlete who accomplished everything she set out to do, Kaye rode across America too. With a squatty build and muscular legs, Kaye climbed the steep Cascade Mountains like they were rolling hills. On the flat road she flew past me like a bird, laughing as she called out “on your left.” I never saw her competitive with anyone but herself. She had an adventurous spirit which meant she was fun. Everyone loved Kaye. The year after that epic event in Oregon Kaye joined a 9-day ride that a friend and I organized. We were ten women in our sixties eager to challenge ourselves with a 420 mile ride from Mill Valley, California to Santa Barbara. We rode mostly on U.S. Route #1, which included the steep, curvy roads along the Big Sur coast. Like the rest of us, Kaye trained hard to stay in shape for these physical challenges, so six months later we rode together from Tucson to Bixby, Arizona and back, where the headwinds were so strong one day we were only able to ride 35 miles. Both in our sixties, Kaye and I knew we were at peak performance for our age, so we didn’t want to stop. That’s when I came up with the idea of doing something different. “How about a snorkeling adventure in the Philippines?” I asked. Kaye jumped on the idea and talked her husband and daughter into joining us. So we were a group of six with my husband, Bruce, me and another athletic super star and also a friend of Kaye’s, Penny. We booked a custom itinerary with an amazing guide, Lee, an American living in Manila. Lee is a PhD marine biologist, and an inveterate snorkeler and diver in those parts of the world. The trip was billed as “Swimming with Whale Sharks,” an adventure to top all snorkeling adventures, but what I didn’t know until we got into the water was that Kaye wasn’t a strong swimmer. Since she seemed eager to go on this trip, I never asked whether she’d ever snorkeled before, let alone questioned how much experience she’d had in the water. Perhaps I should have asked considering she grew up in land-locked Idaho. For the first three days we snorkeled with whale sharks, the largest fish on earth, reaching up to 33 feet long. They are not whales, but feed like whales and are no danger to humans in the water. Snorkeling just a few feet above these awesome creatures, we had to kick hard to stay with them. Because Kaye had strong leg muscles from cycling, she didn’t have any difficulty keeping up. Speed was never her problem. Then we left Donsal, the whale shark capital of the Philippines, and flew to Palawan, a national park with pristine waters and home to some of the most exotic coral and fish in the world. We kayaked and snorkeled for five days, with every day its own unique experience. On our last day, before leaving Palawan and flying north for more exotic snorkeling, Lee suggested a drift snorkel which he said would be a lot of fun and very different. so different that during the drift snorkel Kaye ran into some sort of trouble, and said she couldn’t breathe. She had help climbing up the ladder into the boat, but her face immediately turned blue; then she collapsed and never regained consciousness. With the engine in full throttle and the boat speeding to shore as fast as possible, Kaye’s husband, daughter and our guide Lee took turns performing CPR with no response from Kaye, except some water bubbling up from her lungs. For the full hour it took to reach shore, Lisa and Bud never stopped trying to breathe life back into Kaye, while Penny, Bruce and I just sat, shocked and numb, realizing we were living a nightmare — one of the most horrific things we’d ever experienced. With no sign of life in Kaye, we eventually had to grasp the terrible reality that she had died. Stunned, shocked and speechless, we just looked at each other in horror. We couldn’t even cry; the situation just seemed surreal. When we finally reached the dock, a local doctor based at one of the resorts, jumped on board with a blood pressure cuff and a hand full of needles which she began injecting into Kaye’s chest. We watched her do what she was trained for, but we knew she was too late. Not feeling a pulse, the doctor put her arm around Bud and whispered “I’m afraid she’s gone.” As hard as it was for me to see Kaye die, it was worse watching Bud and Lisa completely fall apart. With their lips swollen from an hour of CPR and their faces reddened from working so hard, they simply collapsed upon each other and wailed. In an instant they’d lost the closest person in their lives. In shock ourselves, Penny and I just lost a very dear friend with whom we traveled and cycled far and wide. As the boatman and Lee lifted Kaye’s lifeless body on to the boat’s hatch cover and transported her to the dock, Bud and Lisa followed close behind. A van waited to take them all to a hospital nearby. Penny, Bruce and I motored back to the beach where we had spent the last several nights, knowing we had to pack up our gear. The itinerary called for us to fly north to a new location for the last few days of our trip, and our plane was leaving in a few hours. We were in a quandary as to what to do. Once we were assured that Bud and Lisa had connected with the American Embassy in Manila, Penny, Bruce and I continued traveling with Lee for the last few days of the trip. We really hated to leave them, but Lisa and her Dad were very busy dealing with the daunting logistics of taking Kaye’s body back to the United States, and our being there only complicated things. Our hearts ached as we proceeded with the last few days of the trip, while Lee kept in close contact with what was happening back in Manila. We all tried to appear happy and jocular — we were at a beautiful resort — but it was impossible. While we snorkeled in silence, our thoughts were always about Kaye, remembering that frightening hour on the boat — watching Kaye die, watching Bud and Lisa collapse. What happened? Was it her heart? Did she have sports-induced asthma and take too much water into her lungs? We analyzed the situation from every angle, but had no answers. To obtain a reliable autopsy in Manila was impossible because of the bureaucracy, not to mention the bribes. Lisa and Bud were anxious to take Kaye back to California where her sons and grandchildren were waiting, totally devastated by this tragic news. While we were traveling on the boat taking us from the small island to the mainland where we would catch our flight back to the U.S., a lone whale shark appeared and swam along side. I could have reached down and stroked her, she was that close to the surface. Although we snorkeled with these gentle giants at the beginning of our trip, we’d left the whale shark area long ago. We were now hundreds of miles from where they congregate. In fact, whale sharks are never seen in this area because there isn’t food for them, so no one on our boat, except us, had ever seen a whale shark. She was small, “a teenager,” Lee told us, but she was still pretty big, about ten feet long. The ones we swam with were 30 feet long. Whale sharks are elusive fish and do not swim up to boats. But this whale shark was different. She swam slowly around the boat and very close to the surface. Others on the boat were so fascinated by this miracle they turned the motor off so we could just watch her swim. For at least ten minutes, maybe more, she swam around and around the boat, giving us all plenty of time to observe her. Finally, Lee grabbed his underwater camera and with his clothes still on jumped in the water to swim with her and take photos. Then another boat came along, and a few other people jumped into the water too. The whale shark seemed unperturbed and did not swim away. When Lee eventually climbed back into the boat, all four of us (Penny, myself, Bruce and Lee) looked at each other and just smiled. There was nothing to say — we just knew. it didn’t seem strange to us. We felt sure this whale shark was Kaye coming to say good-bye, to let us know not to worry, and that everything would be okay. None of us doubted this phenomenon because the scene was other worldly and the situation profound. Those ten minutes of silence when the whale shark swam around the boat provided enormous comfort, to know that our dear Kaye was by our side. Kaye was a devout Mormon all her life, something I didn’t know until the memorial service when the pastor of her parish ward referred to her as Sister Kaye. Perhaps I should have figured it out, since she grew up in Idaho and didn’t drink alcohol. But she never mentioned religion or anything close to sounding spiritual, and someone’s religion is not something I think about. Bud and Lisa hadn’t heard the whale shark story, but a close friend of theirs, who knew about this experience, encouraged me to share it at the memorial service. At first I wasn’t sure it was appropriate, but during the service, I felt a strong need to speak up, and I’m very glad I did. After the service Lisa and Bud hugged me tight. With their hands clutching mine, they cried and said how much my story comforted them, just like the whale shark comforted us when she swam slowly around our boat. Kaye was a kindred spirit, a good friend, and someone who had a zest for life. Her relationship with God was private, and one I wish I’d understood so I could appreciate what God meant to her. What I do understand and appreciate was Kaye’s constant desire to try new things, pushing the envelope so to speak, and challenging herself, like riding her bicycle across the country and snorkeling with whale sharks. At 66 Kaye died too young, but she will always be my role model. Even though she’s been gone for seven years now, I still miss her. Some people come into your life for a very short time, but they affect you, make you think about things that change you. Kaye taught me about life. The whale shark taught me about death."
Medium.com,Life,5 Reasons Why a Hostel Private Room is the Solo Traveler’s Holy Grail,Travel,https://medium.com/@michaelbjornhuseby/5-reasons-why-a-hostel-private-room-is-the-solo-travelers-holy-grail-b3f9bb30daab?source=topic_page---------367------------------1," I remember my first time in a hostel. London. 2015. After walking through the door in the back of the bar and up the stairs, I got to my room. Well… our room. In a normal-sized bedroom, some magician has managed to squeeze three triple bunks. I had the luxury of the middle bunk. I didn’t have to climb to my sleep. I was also safe from having my face inches from the floor. It was fine. I was just excited to be traveling. But now, at the elderly age of 28, I have made the executive decision. I’M TOO OLD FOR THAT SHEET. But what’s a solo traveler to do? Cramped hostel? Lonely hotel room? Neither! Just like Goldilocks, I’ve found a happy medium: a private room in a hostel. This is arguably the top reason travelers stay in hostels. Forming new relationships and hearing interesting stories is the essence of solo traveling. By staying in a hostel, you get access to tours, events, and other travelers. If you want to be social, simply step outside your room. Hostels have common areas where guests congregate. You’ll always have someone to talk to. If you’re a long-term traveler, sometimes you need some downtime. Drinking and socializing every night isn’t sustainable. You may want to read a book, watch a show, or go to sleep at a reasonable hour. If you’re a digital nomad, perhaps you need some time to work. When you’re in a shared room, there’s no telling what sort of nonsense can take place. People coming back at 3am from a party. Other people leaving for an excursion at 4am. Alarm clocks blaring. People having sex. It’s the wild west. When you have your own room, you are the master of your domain. Live according to your own schedule. Hostels cost less than hotels. Everyone knows that. You can get beds in a shared room for as low as $5 in some countries. But private rooms aren’t that much more expensive. When traveling around Latin America for three months, I stayed almost exclusively in hostel private rooms. I paid between $12 to $30 per night. Most of the time it was around $20. Not too shabby! Perhaps the biggest ordeal when staying in a hostel is the bathroom situation. The shower’s taken. The toilet’s clogged. It can be enough to convince you to forego bathing. But the private room changes everything. You can use the bathroom when you please! You don’t have to bring a change of clothes to the shared bathroom while shuffling in your towel. You can brush your teeth in a comfortable setting. Don’t overlook this benefit. It’s a big one. I know what you’re thinking. Fancy? A hostel private room? Come on… But humans tend to see their well-being in relative, not absolute terms. If you have a hotel room, so what? Everyone at the hotel has a hotel room. You’re not special. But at a hostel, having a private room makes you feel nice. You can observe the plight of the common folk as you retreat to your $17 castle. You’ll be known as “the esteemed gentleman or gentlelady of the private room.” You’ll be royalty. Everyone will want to know your name. You’ll have a line of groupies just waiting to make eye contact. They’ll be hanging onto your every word. Ok…perhaps I’m getting a little carried away. People probably won’t be writing home about how they met someone with a private room. But I stand by my premise. It can be nice to feel like a big fish in a small pond. There you have it. I’m sure you’re convinced. Now you know how to make it as a solo traveler. You can have a social life and your own bathroom…all without breaking the bank. Happy traveling!"
Medium.com,Life,Home is where the heart is,Travel,https://medium.com/@bethisabellaparker/home-is-where-the-heart-is-1270eb07f04f?source=topic_page---------368------------------1," A few days back into my ‘real’ life, I’m wondering whether I preferred living out of a backpack. I travelled for two months in South and Central America. With the privilege of hindsight, here are some musings on my trip. I’ll spend months or weeks planning and fantasising about my journey. But inevitably, as the day I’m leaving draws closer, so too do the grey clouds of dread. I see this long horizon of time stretch out before me and panic. It was no different before this trip. Will I meet anyone that I like? Will anyone like me? What am I going to fill all this time doing? The thing about travelling solo is, unless you’re super introverted and it suits you to be alone a lot of the time, you start to crave human interaction — on a deeper level than just “Hi, where are you from?”. I believe that I met so many more people being alone than had I been travelling with others. As a result, I got to listen to so many more stories, drink in a wider range of experiences and share countless opinions. Will I meet anyone that I like? — check. I feel like just being in the same place as someone else shows you have something in common. Something made you both decide to stay in that particular hostel in that particular town. You’re probably looking to see or do or experience something similar. That must mean there’s something similar about you both, too. Common ground is always a good place to start. Will anyone like me? — check. There’ll always be at least one person who grinds your gears or gets under your skin though. But that’s fine, because you can make your excuses and head on your merry way. If you’re alone and meet someone who doesn’t speak your native language, you have no one else to fall back on and no choice but to use what skills you have in that country’s language. This was great for me. My Spanish improved so much in Argentina — despite the reputation of having a difficult accent. I was grateful for every Argentinian/non-English speaker that I met, with whom I could practise away to my heart’s content. It was such a joy to be able to make small talk with waiters, crack a joke and make friends in Spanish. Locals are naturally also the best people to get recommendations from if you want a local experience. What am I going to spend my time doing? — check. On one of my first days in Buenos Aires, I met a Venezuelan/Argentinian couple. We chatted over dinner and the next day they drove me round on a tour and taught me the city’s history. It was so heart-warming to have such a lovely, local welcome. It’s funny how quickly you can get used to being somewhere. I love sticking around somewhere long enough that you learn how to get to the metro/supermarket/bar without looking at the map. That you make small talk with the guy who works in the coffee shop. That you have friends in that city. Whether it was locals or fellow travellers, what really made a place for me was the people. You’re brought together by shared experiences. A few days together in another country basically equates to a few months of friendship back home, right? At times I still got lonely, questioned what I was doing with my life with no structure and no plans further than a few days ahead of me, and felt exhausted after full days without speaking English so that my brain was like Spanish scramble. But the lows were so worth it for the incredible highs. My heart is full, although I’m pretty sure I left some of it on another continent."

We left Mexico last week and crossed into Guatemala via the Cuahtémoc, Mexico — Mesilla, Guatemala border. Certain experiences come to mind when I reflect on our three-and-a-half months in Mexico — the gothic and baroque fantasyland churches of San Miguel and Morelia and Coyoacán and Cholula at Christmas time, covered in tinsel and glaring poinsettias and felted drugstore stockings. The Sanctuario de Tontzíntla, where wall space down to the last inch swirled with the stucco reliefs of peyote flowers, morning glories, maíz, saints, twisting columns of red and blue signifying the old gods of fire and water, bunches of grapes for a mouth, a papaya for a nose, and two cacao seeds for eyes to represent the plumed serpent god Quetzalcoatl; all accumulated to glorify the divine feminine, the syncretic vision of the Virgin de Guadalupe and the Tonzín, the Sacred Mother. The “heretical” indigenous rituals practiced at the church of San Juan de Chamula, where women in their shaggy, black, woolen skirts shuffled softly as rabbits across the tile floor carpeted with fresh pine needles, and a man in a polo-shirt and jeans ducked around seated families, sweeping the needles away from half-spent tapers still burning and scraping up little pools of wax with an aluminum dust pan. They are all equal spectacles in my mind. Where and how do I begin? Again, I see the miles and miles of windmills flanking a stretch of highway from Oaxaca to its border with the state of Chiapas; the blades whirring in rhythmic foreboding of the wind,which many Spanish speakers simply call aire. The gusts were so heavy, they seemed to congeal around the bending and lashing of the trees to our left and right. I feared the tires would be shoved right out from under us; I observed within myself a creeping, primitive attribution of will to the whirling machines and an instinct to plead our safe passage from these colossal guardians and interpreters of the air. I recall the field worker who passed silently between the tables of the Puebla Starbucks where I last sat blogging, who placed type-written scraps of paper on each table. The papers told of the wind-strangled corn of his milpa, his ancestral plot of land, and of his need for our spare coins. I recall the fly-specked curtains of our cabaña, in the tiny fishing village of Chipehua, Oaxaca, dancing in the hot winds that poured through the open windows. The fine grit caught in that wind filtered indoors through gaps woven into the palapa roof, and settled on the nightstand, the soap dish, and the bathroom sink. And sixty-three year-old Adrián, who cooked and served us breakfast the next morning at his family’s Hotel Las Palmas. How he smiled and chided us in his soft voice for staying at those half-forgotten cabañas and not at Las Palmas, which was only just down the road. No no no, he said, as we pointed out our little shack on the hill. His inn was new, the rooms tipo Americano, con clima. Con clima, he repeated. Air conditioning. Adrián was happy we had come to eat anyway, and after clearing our plates he sat down at our table. He counted off his US-born grandchildren on his blunt, dark fingers and chatted about the importance of taking care of one’s parents, about one of his daughters who didn’t speak to him anymore, and about sewing the seeds and reaping the harvests of kinship — one’s cosecha, he called it, arranging and rearranging the bottles of condiments on the table for emphasis. He told us of the four years he spent living in Phoenix, Arizona, how he missed having access to name brands at discount prices, and of his plans for the expansion of the hotel. To our right, someone’s pet tortoise scrabbled against the low wall of the adjacent, sandy-floored patio, where Adrián planned to put in a pool. When we promised to come back for dinner, he proudly invited us to admire his kitchen, his wood-fire oven, and all the spotted and striped fish in his freezer. ✻ I sit here now at the Hostel del Lago in San Marcos la Laguna, Guatemala, wrapped against the unusual winds in a shawl hand-woven by an indigenous woman named Imelda. I’ve spent my days here hiking up the volcano of San Pedro, floating in Lake Atitlán, and watching the snaking progress of a wildfire and the heavy shadow cast on the hill by it’s black plume of smoke. Evening finds me sitting on the stoop of the hostel’s common area speaking with Imelda, in the Spanish which is second to my English, second to her Kaqchikel. She must be about the same age as my mother, perhaps a little younger. At times, I look at her and she seems to have been born a century before my grandparents — at other times, she promises to connect with me via her daughter’s Facebook account, and the themes of our conversation might be discussed by any of the women I know back home. She calls her handiwork the work of abuelos, grandparents; she calls her delight and pride in weaving benediciones, blessings from God. At the same time, she laments, she doesn’t live in the world of her abuelos and must earn money just like everyone else. She describes the loneliness of living with the alcoholism of her family members as a punch in the stomach. She says that her mind turns and turns back on itself, miming the sinuous mountain roads with her delicate hands, on the question of where to go if she could leave, of what to do if she could do something else. But like everyone and everything else in Guatemala, seemingly; like the chicken buses and tuk-tuks and pick-up trucks and pharmacies and convenience markets all claiming the protection of the Blood of Christ and Divine Providence, she says that God sees and blesses her struggle. I marvel at the way Imelda speaks to me — not to any preconceived notion of what an American tourist is like; not with the rhetoric of the Indigenous Struggle so often used by the affluent, ex-pat industry of this village. I’ve come to believe that she speaks to me as she does not only because she has no one else, but because the right people are brought together at the right moment. I’ve come to believe that my need for personal connection was as requisite to this moment as was my ability to listen; as was her need for personal connection; as was her willingness to share and trust. Such a connection gives rise to a feeling of wholeness that is promised by so many of the new-age therapies available here in San Marcos, in which I find value and within which I endeavor to be a part. But Imelda and I retreated to no sun-warmed yoga platform above glinting waters to find it; we sat apart from the drum circle and the fire. Last time, before we parted, she said that what she really wants is a thermos to carry hot water, or perhaps even coffee, as she hikes these sleeping volcanoes to gather herbs and firewood, and to keep her warm on these nights of so much aire, while she perches on stone steps with her spread of shawls. She hugs me before I go. ✻ As I sit and consider the end of my time in Mexico and my introduction to Guatemala, all the little moments of the past three and a half months roll over me and I could almost cry with the joy of reliving them — could almost cry with the peculiar loneliness that comes with not knowing quite how to share them. What I want to share often seems so much bigger than my own particular slant. And beneath my desire to relate my experiences in a way that feels authentic and immersive is the bare hope that someone else is listening. We all want to be heard. Rarely, though, do we know the peace of telling a worthy story without some grappling, without visions of pulling a dazzling fish out of the blind seas with only one’s hands."
Medium.com,Life,Expats in China Need to Spend at Least One Chinese New Year in Beijing,Travel,https://medium.com/the-expat-chronicles/expats-in-china-need-to-spend-at-least-one-chinese-new-year-in-beijing-1f11d9863247?source=topic_page---------370------------------1," Every year, locals and expats alike look forward to Chinese New Year, also known as Spring Festival. For some people, it’s the most extended vacation they’ll get that year. For a lot of locals in major cities, like Beijing or Shanghai, it’s the one time a year they can go home to see their families. If you’re one of the unlucky people that waited too long to buy a ticket, you’re stuck in Beijing. Most people think that’s the worst that could happen that time a year. I think it’s something every expat should experience at least once. Months before Chinese New Year, train ticket prices come out. If you’re not quick enough, all your travel plans could be destroyed within weeks. Train tickets disappear fast. Plane tickets can too if you’re not fast enough. Unless you have a job that’s smart enough to give you time off before the holiday officially begins, going to the airport and the train station is a nightmare. You’ll be caught up in the Great Migration. The picture above doesn’t do the real Great Migration justice. It’s the perfect time for thieves to pick-pocket your stuff. I knew a girl that had her computer stolen. Instead of showing up to the airport three hours early, you’re showing up at least four or five hours sooner to get through security. Train stations are the same way. For larger families, it could be a Home Alone situation waiting to happen. I love traveling, but I don’t like being stuck in a crowded, chaotic airport. Train stations are not the greatest when they’re crowded either. There are certain times in the day the subway’s unpleasant. Rush hour. Between 7–11 A.M., and 5–7 P.M., the tubes are a madhouse. That’s the time everyone goes to and from work. If you’re not as aggressive as everyone else, you’ll be late for work every day. On Chinese New Year, you could go on the subway, look both ways, and not see a soul on the train with you. You’re guaranteed a seat every time you get on. There’s no such thing as Rush Hour at this time of year. On top of that, different places around the city are quieter than usual, so you could go to various events and tourist spots you couldn’t go to before because of the people. It’s the quietest the city will ever be. On the first day of every Spring Festival, locals will buy as many fireworks and firecrackers and light them off. It sounds like you’re in the middle of a battlefield, but the colors are beautiful. The next day, the streets are covered in red paper from the firecrackers. There isn’t a single section of a clean road anywhere. The air quality is awful, and the city smells like sulfur. In recent years, the government has been banning lighting up firecrackers, so it hasn’t been happening as much. This might be wholly banned altogether in the future. With the city being near empty, regular stores are closed. A lot of restaurants don’t do delivery services, and there’s no guarantee you can get a Didi. The Internet at this time is spotty. Sometimes government officials white-list the Great Firewall so using VPNs can be extremely difficult. As long as you supply yourself with enough food for a few weeks, you can get back to cooking like you want to. There’s finally time to read that book you’ve been trying to read. For the first time in a while, you can finally relax and have time for yourself. Working in China can be crazy, but that makes vacations that much more special."

Her, a quiet yet deliciously adventurous girl from city centre Barcelona, Spain; me, a suburban boy from upstate New York, out of his element. We’d met just a few days prior at the Costa Rican backpacker hostel I was living and working at in the sleepy seaside Caribbean town of Puerto Viejo de Talamanca, a scant twenty minutes from the Panama border. I had just quit my job a few weeks prior, expediting an often viscously stressful Italian kitchen in the upscale Manhattanite retreat town of Rhinebeck, two hours due north of New York City. My last service was a Saturday night; wildly busy, yet just how I wanted it – to go out with a bang. I punched the last ticket on the pass, broke down the station and was soon after rendered unconscious at the bar around the corner, my beautifully off-kilter team’s idea of a farewell gift to me. Sunday meandered by in a hangover-induced blur as I packed my bag between sessions in front of the toilet; by 6 AM Monday morning I was sitting by the gate at Westchester County Airport awaiting JetBlue Airways B6 0913 with my single carry on backpack as the clock ticked down to my San Jose flight."

She looks back to casually inform the camera, “we’re going to Qatar,” before ascending into the first-class section of the aircraft. That’s when things really get going: “Clean anything you could possibly touch” she instructs, disinfects everything from the screen to the back of the headrest with a Dettol wipe with a gloved hand. “This is what I do on every plane I get on,” she continues. “I do not care what people think of me, it’s my health and it makes me feel better.” Finally, she drapes the entire chair in a bright pink blanket, dons a surgical mask, and settles in for her flight. The video has almost 1.8 million views and the comments are filled with believers. One such believer is Hillary Dixler Canavan. She hasn’t always been an airplane cleanser, but things changed in 2013 when she started traveling frequently for work. Although Dixler Canavan doesn’t take it to the latex-glove-wearing level that Campell does, she’s put a lot of thought into her routine and keeps a go bag of sanitizing wipes and hand sanitizer at all times. “If more people did routines like this […] everybody on the airplane would be healthier,” she said. “Wiping down those tray tables and the armrest, in my opinion, it’s a public service.” Campbell and Dixler Canavan’s personal plane hygiene routines are understandable, but are they effective? What are the actual odds of catching something on an airplane, and does the risk really come from a dirty tray table?"

The car is the same age as the UK’s accession to the EU and, since my government is hell-bent on taking free movement away from me, I thought I’d make the most of it while I can. So I set off to drive to 13 of the capitals that I have never visited (Lisbon, alas, the 14th, will have to wait) in a car that is the most European of all (designed by an Austrian, Ferdinand Porsche, for another Austrian, Hitler; put into production post-war by a Brit). This week was my first and, despite being restricted to about 70km/h and as few motorways as possible, I have travelled from London to Malmö in Sweden, via France, Belgium, Luxembourg, Germany, the Netherlands and Denmark.

Medium.com,Life,This is How Mount Everest Got So Overcrowded,Travel,https://medium.com/@mjosefweber/this-is-how-mount-everest-got-so-overcrowded-fe3bec2bc76?source=topic_page---------377------------------1," Before 1953, no one in recorded history had reached the summit of Mount Everest. This wrinkle in the Earth’s crust is the farthest from sea level you can get and still have two feet planted on the Earth. This was first determined in 1852 by mathematician and surveyor, Radhanath Sikdar, after decades of exhausting and deadly surveys into the inhospitable and often impassable Himalayas. But it wasn’t until 1885 when English mountaineer, Clinton Thomas Dent, speculated that it would be possible to scale this mountain, reach the top, and not die doing so. And the race to conquer Mount Everest began. Throughout the 1920s and 30s, various British expeditions tried to scale the mountain. The first recorded deaths happened at this time as well. One of whom was George Mallory who went missing while attempting to reach the summit in 1924. His body was found 75 years later, preserved and undisturbed, 2000 feet from the top of Mount Everest. Nearly 10 years later, wealthy British philanthropist and aviation pioneer, Lady Houston, financed an aircraft expedition to the mountain, making Air Commodore and Scottish Nobleman, Sir Douglas Douglas-Hamilton, the first person to fly over Mount Everest. But it wasn’t until 1953 when Edmund Hillary and Tenzing Norgay actually set foot on the summit. They became instant celebrities. Hillary was knighted and Norgay became a life peer of Britain — not to mention having the singular glory of being the first humans to conquer the highest peak on planet Earth. But they wouldn’t be the last. Almost exactly three years later, another expedition would make it to the top. And another one the very next day. Over the next 3 decades, an additional 200 people would set foot would conquer mount everest. But then the numbers soared. Throughout the 80s, about 180 people set foot on the summit. Over the course of the 1990s, that number would more than quadruple. Now the mountain has been conquered nearly 8,000 times by over 4,000 people. In 2018 alone, 800 people made it to the summit. And this can be mostly attributed to money. Since the 1990s, the commercial mountaineering industry has exploded at Mount Everest. Wealthy tourists would pay big bucks to sherpas and mountaineers to successfully guide them up the mountain. Where in Hillary and Norgay’s time, expeditions were non-profit, expensive affairs financed by governments or wealthy philanthropists or the climbers themselves, much of today’s mountain traffic is fueled by an industry that makes its living ferrying as many paying customers as possible up the mountain. What had been regarded as a nearly miraculous feat of human endurance and ingenuity has been reduced to a very expensive and uniquely deadly amusement park ride — complete with long lines and high ticket prices. This isn’t without its benefits. The commercialization of Mount Everest has brought steady wages and employment to local sherpas and boosted the regional economy. Commercial summiting trips have an incentive to minimize the danger and discomfort of scaling such a treacherous mountain in order to attract more customers. These companies provide ample oxygen, they choose the most familiar and well-traveled routes, and provide all the necessary equipment to make the journey as painless as possible. Therefore, climbing to the highest peak in the world might be safer than ever. But the increasing influx of tourists has led to a proliferation of trash, turning the slopes of Mount Everest into an impromptu garbage dump. The need for shelter, firewood, and the rapid development of the region into a tourist hub has led to deforestation and ecological destruction all around the Himalayas. Not to mention that global warming is changing the very character of the mountain. The snow and ice that has enshrouded mount everest for centuries is melting, leading to more avalanches and floods. While these mountaineering companies have made the trip to the top of the world safer and easier, it is hardly devoid of danger. The shear amount of people attempting the feat means that there is more opportunity for tragedy. 3 of the deadliest disasters in Mount Everest’s history have happened in the last thirty years. Avalanches killed more than a dozen people in 2014 and 2015. 11 were killed in 2019, many of whom died of altitude sickness and exhaustion while waiting in line to get to and from the summit. Mount Everest is named for Sir George Everest — a British surveyor who didn’t even want to the mountain to bear his name. But it has many local names that predate Everest. Some of these names mean “Holy Mountain” or “Holy Mother.” In the 60s, the Nepalese government named it Sagarmatha which means “Goddess of the sky.” Whatever the name, it is clear that the region holds a deep reverence for the mountain. It is so much more than a lucrative money making venture or an extravagant tourist destination. it is The stunning result of two tectonic plates smashing into one another for the last 55 million years or so. It’s also the base of an ecosystem and environment unlike nearly anything else in the world. this makes it a sacred, one-of-kind spot on our planet — the kind of thing you’re not supposed to put a price tag on. But alas, we have, and now we’re paying for it. Watch the video:"

The immediate cancellation of all its operations left more than 160,000 travelers stranded worldwide, forcing the British authorities to launch the largest peacetime repatriation ever. Thomas Cook’s demise provides a stark warning to companies that fail to adapt to the changes wrought by technology. How does a travel company go out of business at a time when more and more people are taking overseas trips? In 2007, as more and more people abandoned traditional travel agents and instead used the internet to book vacations, Thomas Cook tried first to adapt by buying MyTravel. That went badly wrong, losing the company more than $1 billion and burdening it with unsustainable debt, which together with unsuccessful attempts to sell assets such as its airlines and the costs of maintaining a network of 560 high street travel agencies throughout the United Kingdom, left the company highly vulnerable. Chinese investment group Fosun, which owns the French Club Med resorts chain and the Canadian Cirque du Soleil theater company, tried to incorporate it into its portfolio with a two-year investment, but finally decided to cut its losses and left the company stranded. This is a case where context is all: the British travel market is stronger than ever. It is estimated that around 60% of the population to overseas vacations in 2018, up on the 57% that did so the previous year. However, habits have changed: in addition to the growing popularity of city breaks over traditional beach destinations the company had specialized in, the way people book their trips abroad has dramatically altered: it is estimated that only one in seven clients still visit a travel agency to book their vacations, and those who do, in general, are aged over 65 and with less money to spend. A failure to adapt to a changing technological environment relegated Thomas Cook to the least profitable segment of customers and through a channel that generated comparatively high costs, incurring mounting and unsustainable debts. At the same time, climate change played a role: higher temperatures over the last two summers in the United Kingdom meant that people on lower incomes opted to stay at home. Add to that uncertainty about Brexit, and it was clear that Thomas Cook was going nowhere. Changes in how we as consumers use technology, poor management, financial problems and on top of that, climate change: the perfect storm. Thomas Cook is now history, a fading vacation snapshot of our habits in the last century, when its problems began. As said, context is everything."
Medium.com,Life,What influences the booking price of properties in Seattle on Airbnb?,Travel,https://towardsdatascience.com/what-influences-the-booking-price-of-properties-in-seattle-on-airbnb-32e274ffcfac?source=topic_page---------382------------------1," Airbnb, an online marketplace for booking properties for stay, published a dataset on Kaggle. It contains data of property listings in Seattle along with their availability and booking price during 2016. With a curious mind, I decided to explore the dataset. After some exploration, I figured out what kind of questions this dataset can answer. Here I am sharing some insights that I found from it. You can checkout my project notebook and Github repository to see the steps that I followed to derive these insights. There was a sharp increase in the properties becoming first time available on Airbnb in Seattle during the early part of 2016 from January to March. After the March, the rise was not so steep, although it the growth continued steadily throughout the year. This helps us understand what the percentage of listed properties are booked during the year in Seattle in 2016. It can be seen as the rate of utilisation of the listed properties through Airbnb. The occupancy rate fluctuates significantly between January and March, because there are large number a new properties becoming available first time during that period. Between April to July the occupancy rate is 22–25%. The maximum level of occupancy across all the listed properties was achieved to be just above 30% during the month of July, which is a summer season in Seattle. After July, the occupancy rate slumps from 30% to 23% by end of the year. The number of properties occupied is proportional to number of people choosing to book properties on Airbnb in Seattle in 2016. There are between 400 to 500 properties occupied during January to April. Starting from April, this number jumps to near 600. In July, there is one more jump with over 700 properties getting occupied. The occupancy drops gradually after July towards the end of year, with nearly 650 properties being occupied at the end of the year 2016. There is a steady overall rise in the booking price from January to July. In July, the average booking price crosses 150 USD and stays above 150 till end of August.Starting from the September, the average price starts dropping. Near the end of the year during Christmas, the prices rise slightly. There are roughly 4 spikes in the average price every month, can you guess why? Let’s zoom into the month of July. The price tends to be higher on Friday and Saturday than during the rest of the days. May be, it can be attributed to more people choosing to stay through Airbnb listed properties on weekend than on weekdays. Majority of the properties are of type apartment or house. There are also significant number of condominiums, townhouses and lofts. Coming to the question that I started this post with. Can we predict the booking price of the property based on its location, size and amenities? The dataset has file containing the attributes for the properties listings. It contains attributes including location, neighbourhood, amenities, size, number of bathrooms and beds, property type etc. Our common sense suggests that these attributes play an important role in determining the price of the property for booking on Airbnb. I created Heat map to visualise correlation between numerical attributes of properties including their booking prices over the year. Number in the cell at intersection of a column and a row indicates the correlation between the two attributes in the dataset. The closer the number is to 1, the higher the correlation is between two attributes. It’s evident from this heat map that the booking price is highly correlated with attributes like number of people that property can accommodate, number of bedrooms, beds and size in square feet. Number of people the property can accommodate is highly correlated to the number of bedrooms and beds, as expected. I investigated further in that direction by training a statistical model using Ridge regression technique to see if these attributes can be used to guess the price of a property. Following the standard process of training a machine learning model, I first prepared the dataset by performing these steps. Here is the list of input variables with highest absolute value of their coefficients in the trained model. They can be thought of as the attributes of the property and time of the year that has maximum significance in predicting the booking price of the property. Positive and negative value in the coef column associated with input_variable represent the amount of positive and negative influence that input variable has on estimation of the booking price of property respectively. As you can notice, the top two input variables with largest influence on the estimation of price are related to the type of the property. Another big influencer is the location and neighbourhood of the property. Number of bathrooms in the property is also a significant influencer of price according to this statistical model. Let’s dig deep into the coefficients of different types of input variables to understand how much influence they have on estimating the price. As per these table, the properties listed in neighbourhoods including Southeast Magnolia, Windermere, Westlake, Pike Market and Pioneer Square are more likely to have high booking price. Whereas, the properties located in Crown Hill and Laurelhurst are likely to have lower price for booking."
Medium.com,Life,East Coast Trek — Part III:,Travel,https://medium.com/the-northern-point/east-coast-trek-part-iii-b59f6e1c1452?source=topic_page---------383------------------1," On Thomas Jefferson’s grave he had inscribed the three achievements that he was most proud of: author of The Declaration of American Independence; of the Statue of Virginia for Religious Freedom and father of the University of Virginia. The sum of a life. Arriving early on Monticello is a bit like entering a Buddhist temple. A quiet Wind gently touches the leaves and even the Visitors Center seems a bit Japanese in its open, wooden structure. The Road taking you there is a winding forest Road, so the serenity of the Place is already Well established by the time you get ton he Visitors Centre. The final stretch of Road taking you to the top of Tom’s mountain, as Jefferson and his childhood friend, Dabney Carr, used to call it. And it truly is Tom’s mountain. No other place in the world is quite like it. Being dropped off by the bus, you get only the tiniest glimpse of what an organizer informs you is “not the exiting side — there’s a scaffolding up for restorations blocking most of the view. We’re on the 9.10 tour of the mansion. I’m not usually one for guided tours. I prefer to read about places myself but sometimes, like at Monticello, its worth it taking the guided tour. Even if the guide were obviously reciting the same tour, she had given a thousand times before, the story she told was, to my surprise, a story that deepened my understanding of the man, Jefferson, and his life. And the story is an inspiring one. So inspiring in fact, that you could even feel the enthusiasm of the guide telling the same story all over again. Maybe the title should have been all roads lead to Monticello, because Jefferson always returned to his central base of operations. He even tried getting back early from the Continental Congress because he was missing home and his wife. Lucky for the fledgling new nation, he did not succeed, and the rest is history. Reading about Jefferson he came across as somewhat of an introvert and yet Monticello was — especially during his years as president — a place of constant activity and constant visitors. Anyone could walk up the mountain, knock on the door and ask to be presented to the president, the guide told us. Monticello was a work in progress. As Jefferson brought home new inspiration the mansion changed. The neoclassical mansion that stands today is referred to as Monticello 2, but I’m not sure that really does it justice. Being from Europe, this didn’t really strike me as a mansion. The facades may present a certain grandeur, but in many places cheaper solution was used on the interior. Like the doors being pinewood and pained dark brow to look like mahogany. But what it does, in my opinion, is not detract from the charm of the place. Quite the opposite. Despite this being a mansion, it had quite a homely feel to it. Its an inviting place. I felt welcome in Jefferson’s house. The other major difference from European mansions was the choice of decorations. In the entrance hall one of the first thing you see is a great collection of things brought back to Jefferson by Lewis and Clarke from their great expedition west. The original artefacts have long since perished but replicas have been displayed ind their stead. Jefferson was all about education. Hence the third part of his epitaph. In stead of portraits of stuffy old relatives, the walls in Monticello were decorated with portraits of classical philosophers, scientists and politicians — including his fellow revolutionaries, Washington, Franklin, Madison and Adams. The first room you enter is the private chamber of Martha Jefferson Randolph, Jefferson’s Daughter and er husband Thomas Mann Randolph. The room also doubled as Martha’s office from where she tutored her 12 children and managed the enslaved people of the estate. Jefferson never remarried after he lost his wife Martha in 1771 and so the administration and day to day management of Monticello fell to his daughter. As a true man of the enlightenment he carefully educated himself on all subjects during his whole life. This meant reading and he build an extensive library. When the English burned the Capitol and The White House, Jefferson sold his entire book collection of more than 7.000 volumes to make of for the loss of records. This became the Library of Congress. This of course meant, that he started a new collection of books. To house alle these books he build — what is incidentally my favorite room in Monticello — the library. Jefferson’s Library and the adjacent cabinet housed both his books and a multitude of scientific instruments and in here Jefferson immersed himself in knowledge, conducted his correspondence and experiments of all sorts. To make life easier he connected the cabinet directly to his bedchamber. Like all bedchambers in the house the beds were French alcoves build into the walls. In Jefferson’s bedroom however the alcove was only surrounded by walls on to sides. In other words, he could choose to roll directly into his cabinet, when he got up or roll the other way into the bedchamber. Through the entrance hall the tour continues to the parlor, which served as the main forum for entertainment of the many guests in Monticello. Games, music and philosophical discourse were the order of the day. From the parlor a door connects directly to the dining and tea rooms also for entertaining guests. The final room of the first floor is simply known as the Madison room. This was where neighbors and close friends James and Dolly Madison stayed on their frequent visits to Monticello. While the Madisons’ Highland house is located only 30 miles from Monticello the journey took them a whole day. Today it takes about 30 minutes or less by car. I know because we went there after our visit to Monticello. But Monticello is a fascinating place and I’m so glad we went there. I can easily picture Jefferson finding peace and quiet and centering himself before venturing into the world. Read part two of this series: East Coast Trek — Part II: The Everchaninging Mount Vernon"

Medium.com,Life,A Filipino Foodie’s Culinary Adventures In Boston,Travel,https://medium.com/@maimislang/a-filipino-foodies-culinary-adventures-in-boston-cb6e8529113d?source=topic_page---------385------------------1," When I learned that I made it to graduate school in Boston six years ago, food was the last thing on my mind. It was not something I immediately associated with the city, unlike Singapore or Bangkok. It was also not the primary goal of my visit — I was going there to study — and was more focused on last-minute fundraising, immunizations and the agonizing search for affordable housing. What I discovered after living there for two years was how intimate my relationship with food really is, as a bootstrapping home cooker, fanatical diner, soup kitchen volunteer and dinner hostess. I was lucky to be living in a city that cared about its food. New England is nothing like the Philippines, but its seaside delicacies resembled and paired well with flavors from home. I was about to grow in the perfect milieu. Bootstrapping home cooker I lived in an apartment on Memorial Drive in Cambridge, my first taste of first-world living. It was always pristine, I can buzz people in, I had a dishwasher and the AC and heating were centralized. The rows of Manila shanties I would see in my daily commute were replaced with runners getting some cardio in along the Charles River. I was walking to school in a walkable city and smelling the fresh morning air. Motorists firmly stopped at STOP signs and new pedestrians such as myself could pass safely. It was weird, but very good weird I could easily get used to. To afford to live like that, I had to spend a good amount of money I did not have just on rent, so I had to scrimp on other things, like food. The closest supermarket to my apartment building was a Whole Foods — tempting, but not helping. An unshelled coconut costs $4.50, four dollars more expensive than the fresh coconut back home. One stalk of lemongrass I would normally just ask from a neighbor was $7.00. It was torture, and I tortured myself with those unhelpful comparisons until I realized I was not in Kansas anymore. There was a Trader Joe’s further down the street and that was not very helpful either. Every time I go to a Trader Joe’s I just want to buy the whole store. My senses run amok, rendering my grocery list useless. Whenever I plan to buy vegetables, I end up buying that and some cheese. Ooh they have a coffee grinder. Chips — gotta have those. Peanut butter cups — yes! Not. Helping. Soon I started hanging out with my Asian classmates and they too had the same conundrum: where can we get affordable ingredients for our home-cooked Asian meals? We were an interesting lot: Indian, Chinese, Bhutanese, Nepalese, Singaporean and Filipino. When we cook, we always share. And the more we cook, the more we party, so we urgently needed some intel! Alas, finally, some overstaying alums pointed us in the right direction. (Now if you live in Boston and plan to cook for the first time, this is your cue to start paying attention). The first great tip I got was Haymarket in the North End. Everything is cheap on a Friday or a Saturday (I went for the first time on a Saturday morning). The best way to tackle this is to invite other amateur cooks to share an Uber with you and venture into the market together. Taking the T with a trolley was a painful experience, especially when fresh strawberries are just $4…for two. It was a heavy load. So split a cab and market goodies with friends. Otherwise, you will end up overbuying and throwing away a ton of rotting produce that is impossible for one person to consume. One time my Chinese friend wanted to cook for me and invited me to go shopping with her. She took me to Chinatown, which was an easy trek from Central Square on the red line to Downtown Crossing. She was looking for a specific bok choy variety while I was happily checking out the other products in the store: fresh young corn, pechay, and almost every kind of mushroom. It was like being in a fresh open market in Manila. The difference is, I used to take these things for granted and let our helpers do all the shopping and cooking. My attitude towards market shopping has changed since. A month before graduation, the Korean grocery store H Mart opened in Central Square. It was like manna from heaven, only this time God took down all our specifications on our way to the Promised Land. Choc Nut from the Philippines — check! Fresh uni — check! Thai fish sauce — check! All at reasonable prices. So a lot of catch-up cooking was done, and the class of 2014 was well-fed with memorable weeks-long fiestas before the last day of school. Fanatical diner To cook well, one needs a sophisticated, maybe even slightly adventurous, palate. Luckily for me, I love to eat, so I pretty much eat anything. I did abstain from red meats for a while, but when I lived in the States I knew I had to become a carnivore again. My shoestring budget would not be able to afford a purely seafood and vegetable diet, sad to say. It was a good call. Cambridge is poppin’ with budget-friendly dining options that specialize in America’s favorite: the hamburger. I went to all the joints: Tasty Burger, Flat Patties, Mr. Bartley’s, Charlie’s Kitchen, Five Guys, and Shake Shack, the last being my top choice. I did find that my best restaurant experiences in Cambridge and Boston involved a lot of seafood. Reminds me of home in a way. The Philippines is surrounded by water, so I grew up loving the taste of the sea. I lived on crabs, oysters, and shrimp, usually during family holidays. But the crustaceans that abound in Cape Cod seem to have a richer flavor, and with a dash of Old Bay and hearty New England cooking, they showed me a different world best enjoyed by hand. For as long as they are alive, I will keep coming back to the clam chowder at Legal Seafoods with oyster crackers, the clam bake at Summer Shack, the oysters at Island Creek Oyster Bar, the octopus salad and lobster roll at Neptune Oysters, the lobster roll at B&G Oysters and the lobster roll and steamed lobsters at Alive and Kicking Lobsters. I think I can eat lobster rolls forever. My friend Leslie, a Boston native, is my best food buddy. We discovered our shared passion for food on a school trek in Japan, in a queue at the old Tsukiji Market at 5 AM. We carried on with a degustation tasting at Uni (which is my all-time favorite restaurant in Boston, did that again this year), the corn and paella at Toro, and the arancini and insalata in Coppa. Everything in these restaurants is excellent. Just off Central Square, I have fond memories of dining alone at Cafe Sushi. The sashimi moriawase there is so fresh and was still student-friendly, price-wise. The best brunches were at Craigie on Main and Henrietta’s Table, while the best group dinners happened at Barcelona Wine Bar & Restaurant, Eastern Standard and now-closed Via Matta in Back Bay where I celebrated my birthday. Soup kitchen volunteer Coinciding with that birthday was a chance to give back, which I did by volunteering for Community Servings. It was a truly meaningful experience that taught me lessons I am finding very useful now as I am setting up soup kitchens with partner church communities in Manila. Community Servings is not your typical soup kitchen where excess food is brought in, turned into a meal and distributed to the poor. This particular organization creates food from scratch and delivers them to people with chronic and critical illnesses. They supplement this service with nutritional counseling. The assembly line and industrial hardware at their kitchen in Jamaica Plain were impressive. We also followed very strict sanitary and hygiene guidelines for handling food. Since my trip there, I have been washing my hands for at least twenty seconds. I also continue to aspire to help in improving food waste management and direct those food resources to hungry, impoverished communities. Dinner hostess With graduation fast approaching, there was a call for volunteers to host “dinners for 6” for classmates they wish to get to know better. The number six is just a recommendation — an optimal figure to ensure intimacy. Hosts are free to invite any number of people they want. I was not picked at random earlier, so I happily stepped up. I knew it was time to showcase the best of Filipino cuisine that this Filipina foodie had been cooking on her own, so I did. In my entire stay in Cambridge, friends have tried and loved the pancit canton, beef steak Tagalog, and afritada, so I ensured a repeat performance. The piece de resistance was the fried lumpia, which I rolled by myself the first time, and then rolled by my classmates on the second try. We all get smarter as we go along. When graduation day did come, I still had a well-stocked pantry. I had a month to go before my lease expires so the feasts continued, and I did not make just Filipino fare. By now, I was already seriously experimenting, relying on pantry supplies and gut instinct to come up with something edible. I remember making vongole with manila clams using leftover pasta to reward my classmates who helped haul my bed out of my apartment. I turned leftover steak into beef with mushroom sauce and served it for breakfast at the Cape. I also made a coconut-based seafood dish for a rooftop picnic. There is, unfortunately, no such thing as leftover lobster in these parts, especially when you are dining with me. But in my head, a lobster omelet would probably taste great. I stayed in Boston for another year and continued to discover its food culture with a few friends left. We did so modestly, mostly cooking and eating indoors with the dark veil of unemployment upon us. The job market was tough for non-residents but we still needed to keep our spirits up. By this time, I was already staying in Brookline before finally finding work in Waltham. Boston is internationally recognized for its world-class schools and its world-class sports teams. I came to this city for all those reasons, including jazz and blues at Berklee. What I did not expect was this critical acclaim to transcend to its food, which I expect is the natural evolution for a melting pot of cultures. The best American universities that are located in Boston attract thousands of people around the world, and with that comes wisdom, talent, and diversity. We were in just one of 35 colleges in Boston — imagine how many hidden mixers are happening over exotic cuisine every day in every corner of the city! I did learn a lot from my readings and my professors, but the best things I learned about my friends and myself were conversations shared over food. Boston has a lot of that, hidden and out in the open. It has a lot of character because of stories exchanged during intimate dinners, picnics, and study groups over wine and food. I think that beyond academics and sports, Boston’s ability to bring people together through good food is a genuine source of pride too."

sk anyone in the west what they want out of their life, and I’ll bet you $10 one of the things they say is “travel.” If they don’t say travel, it’s only because they don’t have the money. Traveling currently occupies a spot of honor in our culture, something about which we testify and glorify whenever we get the opportunity. The real value of travel, though, isn’t the people you meet or the cultures you experience or the sights you see. It isn’t anything you do while traveling at all. The real value of travel is in what happens when you come home."
Medium.com,Life,Chancing Upon Basho,Travel,https://psiloveyou.xyz/chancing-upon-basho-a111aa627afb?source=topic_page---------389------------------1," It was still chilly in late March. Sendai, Japan is on the north east end of the Island of Honshu. Frigid winds blow down from Siberia and whip south east across Hokkaido and northern Honshu sometimes well into May. I had only been in Japan for a few days and was suffering from jet lag, tryung to adjust to my new job as an English teacher, and being immersed in a brand new culture I didn’t know much about. My tiny one bedroom apartment, actually one bedroom/living room apartment in all its dark and musty glory sat twelve blocks from the English school I now taught at, one block from Kokoban Cho(neighborhood), Sendai’s red-light district, and two blocks from Hirose Park which bordered the Hirose River. My, at that time fiance (now wife), had helped me move in three days earlier before taking the bullet train back to Nagoya, her home town, some five hours away. I had kissed and hugged her onto the train as she cried. I tried to put on a brave face, but wanted to curl up in a ball right there on the platform and cry myself to sleep. I was truly alone in Japan. At 33 years old, having never lived outside of the US and barely even traveled outside of it, Mexico for a day trip and up to Vancouver and British Columbia many times, Hawaii and Alaska, but that was it though. Billings, Montana was the furthest east I’d ever been at that point. From my third floor balcony I could just see the edge of Hirose Park. The thick evergreens marching along the rough hills above the river reminded me of my home near Seattle. I decided to take my notebook and pen and go for a walk in the park along the river. I passed by the narrow streets of Kokoban Cho. It was quiet and deserted faintly reeking of the stacked red burnable garbage bags sitting on the sidewalks. The rows of neon signs running up the 3–7 story buildings advertising girls were dull without their lights on. And there was no darkness for them to draw drunk salary men in with. I hurried past and continued on towards the park. A busy four-lane road runs down a hill towards the Hirose River Valley that marks the west side of the park. Out behind the valley high mountains, all still snow capped, stack their way north. On the hill to my left is Tohoku University and the ruins of Sendai Castle. At a bridge across the river I take some stairs that lead down into the park. Their is a bronze plaque and a “Statue of Liberty” green copper statue of two Portuguese Jesuits who drowned in the river in the 1600’s after being summoned from their monastery in the mountains by the ruling Daimiyo at the time. As I finish reading it I wonder which was worse, drowning in the icy winter river or facing punishment from the local authorities during the 16th century in Japan. Crucifixion being the most common form of “justice” at that time. Continuing on I can see the jagged rock shooting up through the sandy ground, evidence of past geological violence that occasionally dances with the massive fault line just off the coast Miyagi Prefecture. I’m surprised by a thick stand of bamboo mixed in with the evergreens. Tough and resilient they stand in their deep greens like infantry among the tall pines and cedar siege engines. In a clearing on top of a small hill in the park I can finally see the river. My fly fishing instincts kick in and I scan the water for rising trout, but see none. The river is still low and deep winter clear; so different from my home waters near Seattle that would be the color of a coffee latte now with the spring run off. I am happy though to see a large black carp making its way up stream stirring up clouds of mud as it roots along the bottom for food. The wind is blowing south east and I can smell the cedar trees, a nice reminder of home. Then I look down at the river again, thinking of the upper Nooksack River flowing down from Mt. Baker. I say quietly, “This isn’t my river and maybe I’m not supposed to be here.” I walk a little further watching my feet as I struggled with indecision. Had I made a mistake coming all this way to Japan? Or was anxiety getting the best of me? Back at my apartment the first draft of my novel was waiting for its first edit. I was hoping that it would be my exit strategy, a way to write for a living rather than teach. But I also knew that there was mostly likely years of work left on it before it would be ready to even submit to literary agents or publishers, something I didn’t even really know how to do yet. I walked though a thicker stand of bamboo. It was shady in here and the wind was rattling the tall bamboo. I noticed a very old looking stone stairway leading down to the river. I was about to follow it down to the river when I saw at the top of the stairs, embedded in the ground, a small plaque. It read, in English and Japanese, “It is believed Matsuo Basho stood at this spot in June 1689.” I don’t know why, but I found standing in the same spot as the great Haiku master once stood very comforting. I didn’t know much about Basho at that point other than the few times he had been mentioned in the English Lit classes I had taken in college. I did know however, that he was considered the greatest Haiku poet of all time. The wind was still cool and the bamboo still rattled loudly, but standing there and realizing that I had somehow landed in Japan where the great Haikujin had once visited reassured me that I could find a way to make a life here. I walked down the stairs to the edge of the river, sat on a jagged boulder, pulled out my notebook and began to write."
Medium.com,Life,Caspar: Returning Home,Travel,https://medium.com/@wayneboatwright/caspar-returning-home-3fc717389935?source=topic_page---------390------------------1," The urge to return grew as my doom approached. Visions of fog-shrouded trails, tidepools, and craggy coves filled my restless sleeping. Like a salmon thrashing and plowing back up its origin stream to spawn and die, I struggled to face my doom. I realize that I must return to Caspar with my children, for my children. My very existence demands it. Home? I guess that is the right word. My childhood was a nomadic one — never staying anywhere long enough to make a home. I had always seen myself a Valley boy, having lost my innocence under LA’s smog red moon. I know better now. Caspar was a one-street ghost town between Mendocino and Noyo Harbor far up the California coast, but as I prepared to say goodbye to my family, it was Caspar that haunted me, defined me. To take form as a person requires courage. I found mine in Caspar. I discovered a sense of adventure and independence by scaling cliffs of rock and sand searching for hidden treasures in tidepools, nests, and grottoes. I developed confidence crossing razor-sharp rocks between crashing waves and using landmarks and the setting sun to work my way home at day’s end. Unlike that magnificent fish that thrives in both fresh and saltwater, I fear my transition from free citizen to inmate. Soon, I must perform my citizen’s duty to serve sentence in a new different brutal world. As I steel myself to face this doom, I worry for my precious little ones. They must navigate life’s waters guided solely by their mother. Father is going up the river, to be gone longer than their entire existence; their life course permanently altered by my crime. How could I say goodbye? Give something to guide them across the years of separation. What signs and tokens could serve to keep alive our family bond? I marvel at how the salmon finds its way across the vast Pacific to the mouth of its creation stream. I have only a map and vague memories to prod me back. At this test, I cannot fail my family again. I was forged exploring Caspar’s magic wilds. No map exists to develop such traits in the next generation. Still, Caspar calls me — an incessant demanding that only there would I be able to retrieve and impart something of vital importance to my children. Behind the wheel and a manufactured confident smile, we headed north on the 101 toward Willits as I desperately searched my mind for the key to unlock my childhood treasure trove of memories. Upon arrival, we performed the customary tours of the lighthouse, harbor and old town. I discovered that Caspar had been swallowed up and become a mere Mendocino suburb. I recognized none of it. On this last weekend before my incarceration, I could find no path back to my memories. We checked into the Skylark Lodge’s last available room around 11 pm. My family fell asleep to the crash of waves below. I could not rest. As the morning broke, the sea, she called me overriding the constraints of adulthood and I knew. As must the salmon, my passage to the Lodge’s private cove was swift and sure. Out of the morning sea mist, a beach materialized strewn with long tangles, bulbs, and ribbons of kelp. I inhaled the pungent scent with the waves and watched the undulating kelp forests suspended on the ocean surface by iodine colored bulbs. Here was the key! The smells transported me back — the memories like waves crashed. The riptide of recognition pulled me under and I held my breath as memories swirled in my mind. I was taken back to the house and barn with a path lined by blood orange poppies to the stream across which lay fields of blackberries. As a boy, I had battled those bushes until my fingers were scarlet and arms scratched up to the elbows — evidence of my victory, loaded buckets of berries I would give my grandmother to bake into pies and fill Mason jars with tart sweetness. Over the horizon was the trail through the pygmy forest to the Jug Handle Park waterfall. The cove’s kelp scent had awakened these magical memories for me to share as treasures with my little ones. As with the salmon, I spread these gifts on the streambed of my little ones’ experiences before the current pulled me to prison. Over those next few fleeting days, my children collected tokens of driftwood, seashells and beach glass as emblems of a father’s love. I could only trust instinct that such take hold in their fertile souls and keep them safe until my return. The current of time was pulling me to a new existence, yet Caspar had renewed me. When the sun sets on this adventure, I know I can find my way home."
Medium.com,Life,The Reality of Traveling Alone,Travel,https://medium.com/@isabelorozco404/the-reality-of-traveling-alone-3e81a4ffbd2e?source=topic_page---------391------------------1," We love to romanticize certain aspects of life. For me, it has always been traveling alone. It has always been that vision of myself with a massive backpack crushing my spine, navigating new streets, meeting people from all over the world and listening to their stories, reading a book in a coffee shop where I can’t read the menu, and staring out the windows of airplanes and trains. It has always been that vision that I see before I go to sleep at night that keeps my ambition more alive than ever. Recently I made an immense change in my life. I decided to take a tremendous leap toward my aspirations. But before that, I had to visit. Thus, I took a solo trip to Europe before the big move. That was not only the first time I traveled alone, but the first time I left the continent. Before embarking on this short journey, I did everything I could to prepare myself. I read many articles on solo traveling and bought everything necessary to keep myself safe and prepared. I noted precautions, studied the maps, and asked questions. Yet nothing prepared me for the little things that can make a big difference. These realities were prevalent and I had to quickly learn to handle them. Here are the challenges of traveling alone: Navigating. Well, this one was very predictable. Having to follow the walking directions on your phone while also looking up, keeping an eye on your stuff, and not getting run over is a tedious task. I recommend taking screenshots of every street, trying to memorize where to turn on what street, and stopping at times to prepare for your next several steps. It is imperative to not make it obvious you are navigating. Travel like a local. Everything is on you. You choose where to eat, what time to sleep, what to see, and who to become friends with. Every decision up to you. I had trouble often walking endlessly for hours because I did not know where to stop. I would end up at the same place every day. This problem was solved after the first few days by having a rough idea of where to go. Also, your hostel may have walking tours where you will make new friends and be able to plan where to go together. This helps tremendously. You will feel lonely. You will make a lot of friends from all over the world. Yet this doesn’t stop the feeling of loneliness. Going from the airports, train stations, or bus stations alone can be a frightful experience especially if it is far. You may wonder at times why you are even traveling alone and how much easier it would be to have someone with you. This is overcome when you remember all the remarkable components of venturing in this world alone (which will be mentioned shortly). You will always meet new people. This was by far my favorite part of traveling alone and the main reason why I will keep doing it. However, always saying goodbye can be heartbreaking, especially because you know that you may or may not ever see those people again. You always have to be cautious, no one is watching your back. I had a small purse, backpack, and carry-on with me. Keeping an eye on all of this all the time while trying to get to certain destinations was a bit overwhelming at times, but again, having a sense of where you are going and keeping most things in front of you helps. You will be exhausted (and dirty) some days. It is vital to take afternoons (or even whole days depending on how long you are traveling) to relax. Lay in your hostel/hotel bed, read a book, watch a movie, or sleep. Spend an evening sitting at a coffee shop. People watch. Take time for yourself. Here why it is worth all the challenges: Independence. While I had the choice of spending the days with new friends, I chose to spend some days alone. Because of that, I got to know myself even more. I stopped when I grew tired, I got lost and found my way back, I wasn’t in a rush, and everything was up to myself. I spent several hours listening to live musicians in the park while I read a book and wrote. There was no one pressuring me to leave and I could enjoy what I loved to do to the fullest extent. New friends. Saying goodbye often made me despondent, but I learned to cherish people immensely. I learned to value every moment spent with my new friends in every city because of the fact that I would have to say goodbye the next day or so. I got to know them very well and I know that I will see at least a few again in their hometowns or at some point traveling. Crossing paths and having strangers become people you quickly grow to know and love teaches you to value each human and their story, regardless of the time spent. You will stop caring about what others think. Eating alone the first day was a bit odd honestly. Yet after the first meal, I looked around and realized that no one cares. There are other people alone. There are other people in large groups. It doesn’t matter.Taking yourself to a nice restaurant or to some street kabobs is showing yourself some love and it is admired. You will quickly learn that you are the only one that is worried. You will become stronger. After even a few days of solo travel, I felt as though I could do anything. No new city or problem could overwhelm me. I even caught a train once about ten seconds before the doors closed- in a French-speaking country! This was something I could have never envisioned myself doing without any stress. Yet even as I was rushing to the next train, I knew that everything would be okay, even if I missed it. When traveling alone, it is essential to keep a go-with-the-flow mindset. Come what may and love it. You will learn to ask for help. This world is filled with lovely humans who will do whatever it takes to help you. I experienced this even before I got on the airplane that left the states. I approached a woman who had a Spanish passport simply asking how to get to my hostel when I arrived there, and rather than just give me advice, she offered to drive me from the airport to my hostel and helped me every step of the way. To this day I still speak to her and her wonderful daughter who went completely out of their way for this stranger they met. Take the initiative and ask for help. You will learn to overcome fear. I was terrified the first day. I was still sometimes fearful in the very few taxi rides I took. Yet I learned to not enable trepidation to overwhelm me. I was quick to diminish fear and recall that I am greater than my fears. Everything is in my own mind. Your courage is a powerful force, and with that, all you face in life you are able to overcome. You will have a deeper love for the Earth and for humanity. I took overnight buses, long trains, got lost with my luggage and had to walk long distances, and got off at an incorrect stop. However, I was as happy as could be through that all. Simply looking out the windows gave me a vast, inexplicable joy of being alive. Even through how uncomfortable some rides were, I couldn’t have been more grateful to be alive and out in this world. I couldn’t have been more grateful for all those people I met, even for just the few hours they sat next to me on the bus and we had to use google translate to understand each other. I was told that as a young female traveling alone to places I have never been to was berserk. I was told that this and that could happen to me. I was told I wasn’t capable. Yet after three weeks of not just traveling and meeting people, but also planning out the next phase of my life that will be in a completely different place, I can assure you that you are more than capable of anything. While being smart and alert, you can take on anything life will throw at you. It will be tiring and frustrating at times, but nothing will compare to the fulfillment you will feel during and after, as well as the pure joy while looking out from window at this world. Nothing compares to being out with other travelers from all over the world as you sing and dance under the street lights of new cities, as you listen to their stories, and laugh until tears run down your face. You will be eager to go on your next solo journey again before the current one is over, just as I was. Nothing compares to the extraordinary reality of traveling alone."

A purely playful request, as what little I knew about you then would fail to captivate readers: Tall, Cute Guy Spotted At Coffee Shop In Roatán, Honduras. The aforementioned male had towered over my MacBook and asked, with genuine interest, what was I working on? A book proposal, I said. I was a travel writer, or aspired to be. I would get exactly zero writing done in your presence. When I asked what brought you to the island of Roatán — aside from every view being a stock photo of tropical paradise — you showed me photos I’d never seen before. A small deep sea submarine, painted a cheerful Minion yellow, its portholes like cartoon eyes. It’s a one-of-a-kind sub, you explained, that aids in marine research and takes curious, non-claustrophobic civilians to record-setting depths. Yesterday you had plummeted (purposely) to 1,500 feet and waited for hours in cramped darkness with the sub’s creator and pilot, hoping to spot a giant six-gill shark and other elusive creatures that only inhabit the deep. Your camera roll and still palpable excitement confirmed it was worth the wait. I’ll admit I barely noticed the scar on your shaved head. Too distracted by your stories, or perhaps by the crush I was developing. My friend noticed it, though. Her resolve to work quietly in the corner had weakened at the mention of six-gill sharks and your Jules Vernean adventure. “How’d you get the scar?” she asked. When you answered, my heart sank deeper than your submarine. Four years ago, a baseball-sized tumor appeared in your brain. It was removed in a ten-hour surgery fit for Grey’s Anatomy: the patient stays awake and chats so that doctors don’t damage his speech function while extracting nearly ten percent of his brain! After surgery you began a long course of chemo. A grad student at MIT at the time, and a self-described dork obsessed with data and technology, you wanted to learn everything you could about your tumor. So naturally you had it genetically sequenced, scanned, 3-D printed, and even molded into Christmas ornaments for family and friends. You gave a TED talk about the ordeal, using your own experience to advocate for open-sourcing patient data and a better system of sharing our medical records — our cellfies — across the global research community to accelerate learning and cures. When it comes to attraction, I’d always described my “type” as simply smart and funny. You were smart-and-funny on steroids. But there was nothing funny about what you said next. After years of clean scans, a routine check-up showed a nasty glioblastoma, the most aggressive type of brain tumor. The cancer had returned. You needed another risky surgery, and even if it went well, glioblastomas are incurable. So you called up your closest friends and a week later you were here together in Roatán, ticking adventures off your bucket list. The deep-diving sub was one. There are few times in my life when I can recall feeling more acutely that life is so royally un-fucking-fair. This remarkable guy sitting in front of me did not look or act sick, and even when his mouth wasn’t smiling, his eyes were. My mind seemed unwilling to accept the facts. “So yeah, the surgery is next week,” you said. “I don’t know how much time I have left, but I’d rather spend it happy and enjoying every moment I can.” Is the bigger tragedy that people get cancer, I wondered, or that more people can’t be happy while perfectly healthy? Why do we need the threat of death to remind us to cherish life? You needed no reminders. Next on your Honduran bucket list? Hunting for pirate treasure. Today people associate the Bay Islands, Roatán being the largest, with world-class scuba diving and beaches that rival Hawaii’s. But you taught me about their pirate-filled past. In the 1700s, Roatán was a safe haven for sea robbers in search of a hideout, both for themselves and their pillaged gold. It’s rumored that treasure is still buried around these parts. So you and your friends hired a local guy with a boat to explore a nearby uninhabited island, armed with machetes and metal detectors. Did my friend and I want to join the expedition? You were sweet enough to ask. I was unbelievably tempted but declined because I wanted you and your friends to have your bonding time. I did tell you some awful pirate jokes, though. What’s a pirate’s favorite sweater? ARRR-gyle! We kept running into each other around town. Accidentally at first. Then intentionally. Our groups met up for dancing at Frank’s, a beachfront bar with $1 tequila shots and the best reggaeton DJs in town. You and I outlasted everyone on the dance floor. The next day you went off on your treasure hunt while I scoured for the best dive school to start my open water training. Only one week into a two-month stay on Roatán, I had already caught the diving bug. You messaged me with news of pirate booty. After several amusing puns exchanged about assorted booty and who should bring their booty over where, I knew I’d be crazy to turn down the best kind of booty call a girl could get: “Want to pick out some pirate glass for yourself?” you texted. You had not returned rich, but not empty-handed, either. The loot included a few 18th century coins, some rusty spikes presumed to be old ship parts, and many interesting fragments of glass, metal and rock. I chose a few small pieces that could double as meaningful mementos and easy travel companions. On your last night in Roa, we sat outside gazing at stars. You must have felt fear and hope in nearly equal measure, though you tried to conceal the former. I kept searching for words of wisdom, something that didn’t sound like a useless cliche. Words failed. I strummed “Peaceful Easy Feeling” by the Eagles on my ukulele instead. “How old are you?” you kept asking when we first met. I kept deflecting until you played the cancer card. “Come on, it can’t be that bad. And I know bad…” (This card also proved handy in convincing your tired friends to take vodka shots.) Okay, six years older isn’t exactly cougar territory, but your nice round thirty made me feel old. What can I say? Girls get weird about their age after 30. You would make it to 31. You died the day before my birthday. The sad news wouldn’t reach me until a week later, but on that day I cried several times for no apparent reason. An overreaction to turning another year older, I figured. Another year of dead-end dating and dwindling fertility. Was an island fling on your bucket list? I’ll never know. And anyway, calling this thing a fling feels cheap. We had a real connection. But calling it anything more would be hyperbole. A week after you left Honduras, you went into brain surgery and spent some nail-biting days in the ICU. Your friend was kind enough to send me updates while you recovered. A few months later, you reached out to thank me for the good luck note I sent you just before your surgery. “You are such a lovely person and I hope you know that,” you wrote. “Till the next time we end up in the same place.” Those would be your last words to me. I wish so much that we could have that next time. But mostly I just wish you had more time. I replied too casually, trying to keep the mood light and breezy, not wanting to add any more heaviness to your life. “I’m so glad you’re ok!” I wrote. “Takes one to know one, fellow lovely person. Keep searching for pirate booty.” That’s right. My last words to you were pirate booty. Not my most poetic moment, but it’s because I never believed you would die. What I meant to say was, thank you. For sweeping into my life like a cool Caribbean breeze and reminding me what a privilege it is to keep aging. And what a treasure to cross paths with people who seem to make time stop. — **This article originally appeared in Off Assignment’s Letter To A Stranger section. Thank you, dear reader, for reading."

My family would drive to the nursery on the other side of town, load our beat-up car with budding impatiens and heavy bags of black soil, and carry them to the beds in our back yard. Beneath the jasmine bush that twined through the fence separating our yard from the train tracks, we’d dig up the winter-hardened soil, lay down new earth, nestle young flowers in their cradles. The sun would burn our necks, but the soil would be cool as we pressed our fingers into it, as it gathered under our nails. This was the beginning of summer. By the end of the hottest months, the impatiens would have burst into nodding blooms of red and white and yellow. The garden would be thick with the scent of blossoming jasmine, the grass humming with insects. But impatiens are annual flowers, here for a season and then gone, wilting and fading as the year tips toward fall. And in the end, even the empty stems would be crushed under fallen leaves and snow, leaving only an empty bed, the dirt packed and barren. But it was our home, our garden. We needed only to wait until next summer to plant those flowers once more."
Medium.com,Life,The Art of Staycationing,Travel,https://medium.com/@ben_56535/the-art-of-staycationing-54e84c8d8915?source=topic_page---------396------------------1," You’re scrolling through Instagram. One friend has posted a selfie at a Parisian cafe, croissant and coffee in hand. Another uploads a picture from Machu Picchu, wearing an outfit that doesn’t look hiking-appropriate. And another’s on a beach somewhere — or at least their toes are, creeping into frame in a scene of white sand and still blue waters. You grab your computer and start searching for flights. But stop: it doesn’t have to be this way. Yes, there are great reasons to travel, to see the world, to immerse yourself in other cultures and languages and cuisines. Life is short and the world is vast, and it can sometimes feel like we have to rush to see it all. But in our eagerness to get out there, we sometimes miss the benefits of staying home: Besides, whether you have things to do, friends to catch up with, or simply need a bit of extra sleep, spending a few days staycationing can be the perfect way to get many of the benefits of a holiday without any of the costs. And with many of us working longer hours than ever before, spending time off at home may be the only way you’ll ever see it in daylight! This is your opportunity to have quality downtime time, to explore your hometown and to prioritise what matters to you. But from the moment we wake up on that first day of staycation, it’s easy to feel a bit lost. When we’re away on holiday, we know that our time is limited and we are good at using it wisely. But at home? It’s all too easy to slip into bad habits, to end up working anyway, or simply to let the day pass by. So if you are planning a staycation, here are some ways to get the most out of your time: Tell people you work with that you are on holiday. You don’t have to say you’re going away, but it can be useful to clarify that you’re using this time for something specific and non-work related. Whether you tell them it’s ‘family time’ or ‘working on a creative project’, giving it a name will help people realise that this isn’t just a work-from-home week or ‘work-lite’, and will help set the expectation that you do not wish to be disturbed. Set an out-of-office, and if you do need to check in with work at all, schedule a regular time in the day and limit communication to this small window. Something we get on holiday is a change of environment, and one of the greatest benefits of this is that it allows us to set new habits. Ever realised how it’s much easier to leave bad habits behind straight after you get to a new place? How you’re less likely to hit the snooze button if you wake up to a different view, or can more easily start a diet or exercise regime on the first day back from time away? So replicate this at home. If you’re lucky enough to have a spare room, try moving in there! But if not, do everything you can to put your environment in ‘holiday mode’. This could involve simple things like tidying up, changing your bedsheets and setting out new towels to freshen up the place. But it can also mean more practical things like putting away items to do with work, and setting up your environment for the habits you want to build over your staycation. If you want to write, for example, make sure you have a desk or table set up specifically for this purpose. As well as our physical environments, our routines are a major trigger for habit-forming. Anything that feels like your normal life will therefore encourage you back into your regular habits, and will also likely serve as a reminder of work and other daily stresses. To replicate the mental and emotional distance a holiday allows, you therefore need to make some changes to your routine. If you’re travelling into town, take a different route to the one you’d use for work or meetings. If you have to buy groceries, go to a different store. And if you can, switch up your gym, your running route or your activity times to introduce an element of change. During the work week, it’s easy to spend our downtime in front of the television or mindlessly scrolling through the news or social media. And that’s fine, up to a point. But when we’re staycationing, we need to break out of these patterns and find activities that enrich us as well as relax us. Reading, creating, walking, spending time with others — these are all great ways to unwind without spending whole days lost in a Netflix binge. It may feel counter-intuitive, but you need some structure on your staycation if you are going to relax in a way that is healthy and reduces stress and anxiety. Indeed, experts have long-stressed the importance of structure and routine to good mental health. Unstructured days go faster and feel out of our control — this can lead to an increase in negative feelings, and ultimately lower levels of fulfilment and self esteem. Lightly structuring your day and sticking to a regular routine can combat this. You don’t need to have each hour scheduled as you might in a work week, but balance scheduled periods with unscheduled ones, and base your day around set tasks and activities. For instance, you might begin each morning with exercise, spend a few hours doing personal activities, and then set aside the afternoon for social and out-of-house plans. Whatever else you do with your staycation, try to go to at least one place you’ve never been before. We remember things better when they’re new, and novelty can even help us improve our memory before and after an event, so a bit of exploring will ensure you remember your staycation and feel that you made the most of it. It’s also a great opportunity to push your boundaries, find somewhere you might love, and maybe even support a local business or organization. Whether it’s a small museum you’ve always walked past, a new family-run restaurant, or an outdoor walk you haven’t tried, staying home doesn’t need to mean staying in. We all know about the importance of goal setting. Don’t go overboard on this — you’re supposed to be relaxing after all. But set out in advance what you want to achieve from your staycation. Do you want to relax and get 8 hours sleep a night? Do you want to write 5,000 words of your novel? Do you want to eat only home-cooked meals and get daily exercise? Or are you just hoping to catch up with all the friends you haven’t yet sat down with this year? The likelihood is, you already have some goals in mind. But setting them out will allow you to be more mindful in your actions and will make it more likely that you achieve them."

Medium.com,Life,Travel to Tomorrow: An Emerging Vision for the Tourism Industry,Travel,https://medium.com/activate-the-future/travel-to-tomorrow-an-emerging-vision-for-the-tourism-industry-a7aeacb53870?source=topic_page---------398------------------1," “Could tourism possibly create more value with fewer visitors, giving them the space to discover the things we want to share, the things that make us unique?” This is the provocative question offered by Peter de Wilde, the director of regional tourism authority Visit Flanders. For the past two years, this inquiry has been at the center of the organization’s quest to reimagine their industry — a quest they’ve been calling “Tourism Transforms” in acknowledgement both of tourism’s potential to transform us and of the need to transform tourism. And indeed, there can be no doubt that transformation of the industry is urgently needed. More and more areas around the world are suffering from over-tourism, with accompanying destruction of ecosystems and heritage artifacts, as well as disruptions to local quality of life. On top of that, the industry contributes 8% of carbon emissions globally, prompting a growing call for a halt to non-essential flights. Yet despite these pressures, international tourist travel continues to grow at a rate of 4% per year. In the first half of 2019, that meant 30 million more trips than the same period in 2018, according to the UN World Tourism Organization. Clearly, something has to give. The response among Destination Marketing Offices — in other words, among Visit Flanders’ peers around the world — has been to look for ways to divert tourists to less popular regions. But the model itself has remained unchanged. The conveyer belt that is the tourism industry is still going strong, continuing to churn ever more tourists through the ever more fragile human and more-than-human communities of the Earth. In contrast, Visit Flanders has sought a more profound shift in practice and perspective, with innumerable influences and contributors. “There are many, many who were influential to the thinking and practices that are taking shape,” writes Griet Bouwen, who has been intimately involved in the exploration. “From the very beginning, lots of them were open and courageous enough to embark on the journey and merge their expertise with what was emerging. Tourism partners, social initiatives and citizens in our beautiful Flanders were searching in their alternative ways to turn their tourism initiatives towards a contribution for the common good: for our communities, our planet, our local economies. This living system is broadening like a river, that is formed by many small sources that together become a lifeline that flows through our region.” Two of those influences she describes were particularly visible to me. One is travel industry pioneer Anna Pollock of Conscious Travel, who has been speaking and writing on the future of tourism for decades and offering guidance to Visit Flanders for the past two years. Specifically, she introduced them to the concept of “flourishing destinations,” in which (1) places are recognized as living communities, with stories and patterns of aliveness; and (2) residents, enterprises, community, visitors and the ecosystem are all supported in their ability to thrive. The other influence I could clearly see is Visit Flanders’ own Holiday Participation Centre, which focuses on ensuring that every citizen of Flanders has access to a vacation, regardless of disability or poverty. The underlying belief is that everyone has a right to a holiday, in the same way that many countries recognize a new mother’s right to maternity leave. Quite apart from the larger organization’s marketing activities, the Centre facilitates a network of more than 2,400 voluntarily participating service providers, partner organizations and citizens. Thanks to their collective efforts, more than 150,000 people experiencing poverty or disability are able to go on day trips or short holiday breaks in Flanders every year. The lifeblood of this work — what feeds it and keeps it going — is the practice of “storyweaving.” Many of those who experience a holiday are thoughtfully interviewed about their experience, helping them reflect on and recognize what was meaningful and giving them the feeling of being seen and valued. Each account is crafted into a short, authentic story that portrays the renewing, transformative power of a holiday. And as those stories are shared across the network, commitment to the movement grows. For Visit Flanders, these two influences — Anna Pollock’s concept of flourishing destinations and the Holiday Participation Centre’s place-based network of story-inspired collaboration and service — and many others converged to create the sense that tourism may have the potential to be a powerful force for good. In response, Visit Flanders launched the Tourism Transforms initiative, engaging in meetings with hundreds of tourism professionals; convening five think tanks; and conducting a listening survey eliciting more than 1,600 travel stories. The outcome has been an emerging intention to cultivate “meaningful encounters in flourishing destinations.” To add more detail to that vision and to begin to build a movement around it, Visit Flanders collaborated with Pollock and others to convene a two-day summit called Travel to Tomorrow, bringing together close to 300 tourism professionals from across Western Europe. The video invitation (below) offers a beautiful reflection on what is needed and what is possible. The summit featured international speakers (including me — here’s a video of my talk). But more importantly, it highlighted stories from local initiatives that were conceived and conducted in new ways. To commemorate the 100-year anniversary of World War I at Flanders Fields, for example, the local tourism office initially followed the conventional conveyer belt model: they created branding and signage that linked multiple sites together; they modeled the expected increase in visitors to ensure adequate local capacity; and they prepared to broadcast a marketing campaign across the globe. It was at that point that they were hit with a local newspaper article criticizing them for commercializing something so sacred and tragic, a sentiment that turned out to be widely felt. In response, the tourism authority made a bold move — bold because they didn’t know how it would turn out: they gathered local residents together in a series of open conversations about what this place and this anniversary meant to all of them; about what invitations they wanted to extend to the world; and about what principles they would have to abide by if the encounters were to be meaningful. The outcome was an explosion of sufficiently coherent yet entirely citizen-driven initiatives that were filled with personal connection and significance. In one case, visitors were offered poppy seeds and encouraged to plant them when they returned to their home places; the region’s Facebook page is now filled with images of poppies from around the world. In another example, hundreds of local volunteers gathered at dusk to stand along the former line of battle that snakes unmarked through the countryside; each person held a glowing torch, in a silent, solemn display. Stories like these and those shared by the Holiday Participation Centre are fundamentally at odds with the concepts of “tourism” and “industry” — those lifeless abstractions that demand our subservience. As a bridge concept, Pollock talks about the “visitor economy,” inviting a focus on the human visitor. But the presence of “economy” reminds us that it is about money above all else. As tourists or visitors, we are encouraged to show up with our money and our immediate, uncompromising demands. Ours are the only needs and wants to be considered. Yet a place is more than a destination for demanding tourists. It is first a story and a shared home. Or it could be, with some support. Many communities have been ravaged by individualistic capitalism. They don’t know who they are together anymore. They have lost touch with their shared story, with the soul of their place. But what we have seen in the examples of Flanders Fields and others is that it doesn’t have to stay that way. Indeed, what if we talked not about the “local tourism industry” but about the “local hosting community”? Imagine if the emphasis were on helping hosts understand who they are together in community, in this place, at this time in history. Imagine if they could be brought together in regular reflection about the invitation they want to extend and what flourishing might look like for everyone involved. What if they could be supported in discovering “sufficiently coherent yet entirely citizen-driven initiatives that are filled with personal connection and significance,” as we saw with Flanders Fields? Imagine if a local self-organizing network could be enlivened and set into motion, powered by stories of meaningful encounter and transformation, as the Holiday Participation Centre has demonstrated? What if the mandate of Destination Marketing Offices changed from “marketing destinations” to “hosting the hosts”? Such a shift in perspective has implications for those being invited, too. If you are hosting me for dinner, I will arrive with a certain measure of respect for you and your home. I will come ready to see the many gifts in the experience. This is quite a contrast to how I would show up to your home as a tourist, unthinking demands in hand, seeking only to extract and consume. In these ways, our hosting and our visiting might become far more human, thoughtful and personalized. And importantly, we might feel less need to venture to places that require a carbon-heavy journey. We might discover that the rest and re-creation — the transformation through meaningful encounter — we’re looking for can be found close to home. As we work together locally to develop the skills and orientation of hosting visitors from afar, we may also find new openness to hosting our own neighbors in conversation and in shared participation in society, even when our opinions differ. We may also find that our hosting practice more readily extends to those who come not with money to spend but with need for refuge and support. “If you ask me about the opportunities with regard to the tourism of the future,” says Chené Swart, author of Re-authoring the World and an advisor to the Holiday Participation Centre, “I think that tourism is part of a larger transformation across the world. It is coming back to the connections with one another, coming back to the connection with the earth. Then tourism will become participative citizenship.” Visit Flanders’ own Peter de Wilde adds, “I have hope, since every journey brings more tolerance and opens our minds to the rest of the world so that we know and recognize others and have a better understanding of what’s really precious.” What are your thoughts and stories about the future of hosting?"

he city of Te Whanganui-a-Tara, as Wellington was named before colonization set in, is located on a harbor at the bottom of the North Island, banked in by hills which allow the often vicious wind to circulate unfettered. Once accustomed to the fact that no one comes to Wellington for the weather, it becomes a city that is truly easy to love: compact and walkable, vibrant and welcoming, with enough side-streets and back alleys to feel that you’ve discovered something special, but not so many that you become overwhelmed by decisions and have to lie down. It’s also a wonderful place to visit if you’re vegan. The city has a renowned and diverse food scene, with stalwart establishments that have served vegan food for decades along with newer places catering lavishly to your needs. Indeed, you could say the best thing to do in Wellington, a place with more bars and restaurants per capita than New York City, is to simply eat and drink. This is a noble ambition, but if that’s not enough, there are a number of ways to expand this out to having not just a good time, but a sustainable time. There is little chance of bad coffee in Wellington. Try Customs on Ghuznee Street, a charming coffee shop serving single origin brews, the provenance and intricate flavour notes of which you can read about as you sip. You can also buy coffee accoutrements and bags of beans to take home. Black Coffee in Newtown, a five minute bus away from the city centre, enthusiastically serves up coffee six days a week and displays rotating local and international art on their walls. If caffeine isn’t your thing, their turmeric lattes are fantastic. Or get a beetroot latte at Seize, who also have a counter full of raw vegan cakes and a hearty breakfast menu. The busses run regularly but they are quite expensive, so have plenty of coins ready if you’re going to jump on one, and ride share apps like Uber, Zoomy and Ola are available and easy to use if you want to get somewhere directly. But it’s very easy to get around the city on foot. Lambton Quay, Willis Street, Cuba Street and Courtenay Place — the four main streets of central Wellington — are all linked, and right in the middle is Civic Square, where you can have a rest and plan your next move, or visit the City Gallery, a huge, beautiful building that hosts multiple impressive exhibitions."

All the city constants are here — fashion is here, just as in London or Paris. There are leather trousers everywhere, sexy boots and ‘distressed’ jeans, lensless glasses and bouffant barnets. Pretty hip youngsters parade in garish patterns and wear expensive jackets with lurid docketing (like Superdry for the Chinese — examples include MY EX DIED and DON’T WORRY, WE ALL DIE ALONE), there are old, haggard street-people hocking loogies onto the pavement; there are juniors gobbing incongruously between glances at their phones. Phones are everything. They watch you just as they listen to each other. Kids lollop about, glued to luminescence, parents trailing them along by a thumb. People are active. They are also everywhere. Street food vendors line narrow roads and churn out all hustle and bustle. Everyone is different — noisy, quiet, boisterous, timid, grotesque, refined — all nestled among architectural & societal & cultural contradictions. The city is oxymoronic. Stalls sell frogs’ legs and chilli squid alongside dried kiwis and skinned pineapples, bulbous wooden instruments and chariots made of sugar. WeChat is a god. It is social media profiling, instant messaging, filesharing, video chat, timeline, group conversations, it is scanning for a bike ride, paying for your taxi, it is your credit card, your face, your identity, your geo-mapped position and your way of communicating with everybody — friends, family, students, bosses, companies, yourself. The Metro is a recent addition to the city and is gorgeous. It is more navigable than the London Underground, even for an English speaker. Metro TV, bag searches, glowing arrows on the ground, flashing lights and screens and the future. Meanwhile, the busses wheeze like bloated locusts through the streets pumping dust and fumes into car windows. Rabbit head, duck head, chicken feet, pig trotters & snouts, lambs’ ears, squid and frogs’ legs are all available at a dime a dozen, shimmering with oil and flecked with chilli. At a hot-pot restaurant everything is available — intestines, brains, fish innards, offal of all shapes and sizes, some peachy pink, others maroon red. Personally I have seen very few selfie-sticks for sale (weird) though possibly a million in action. People are largely unabashed by social etiquette details which grind Englanders’ gears: proximity, being watched, spitting, eating with gusto (and I mean gusto), etc. Everything is honest, as it comes; you know where you stand. There are very few thank yous and, as far as I know, there is no way of saying please in Mandarin. Does language sculpt a national character or vice versa? What came first, the chicken feet or the steamed egg?"

Medium.com,Life,In sight of Croagh Patrick,Travel,https://medium.com/@megrmeg/in-sight-of-croagh-patrick-83154ff7a478?source=topic_page---------406------------------1," First thing I checked each morning, out the upstairs window facing west: Can we see Croagh Patrick? Is its elegant triangle on the horizon? Do shrubs point their shadows across the fields in its direction? Or is it obscured by the weather? It’s Ireland, mid-September. Croagh Patrick is Ireland’s holiest mountain. Its nickname is “The Reek,” coming from the Irish Cruach Phádraig, meaning Patrick’s stack. Saint Patrick fasted there for 40 days in 441 AD; pre-Christian artifacts show activity centuries before, when it was called Cruachán Aigle or high mount. At 2500 feet, it’s not the tallest mountain, even in County Mayo, but each year a million pilgrims come to climb partway or to the top. On the last Sunday in July, “Reek Sunday,” pilgrims number over 25,000. We hear it’s a hard-scrabble climb, steep and then steeper, over rocks both round and flat that slip and cut. Some pilgrims climb barefoot. Helicopters come as needed, should someone need to be carried down. Thanks to our sad knees and the mountain’s reputation, my husband Jake and I have walked up only to the first station. But staying in a house within sight of it, we looked for it each morning to gauge the coming day. The house was in Moyhastin, a tiny community in County Mayo (Mhaigh-Eo), just outside the town of Westport. It’s an airbnb, called an EcoHouse and built as the dream house of a woman who only visits, now that she’s moved to Wales to be with children. The hot water is solar-assisted; there are energy savers here and there. It’s a cozy house with warm wooden trim and folksy paneled cabinets, dimly lit at night, reminding folks they should be going to bed."

Medium.com,Life,Amtrak Advice,Travel,https://medium.com/indelible-ink/amtrak-advice-426a5141fe?source=topic_page---------408------------------1," As somebody who travels on Amtrak a lot, I’d like to share a few tips to make your next train trip more enjoyable. Ask. Several Times. What kind of idiot gets on a train heading in the wrong direction? All I can say is that it wasn’t my finest moment. But in my defense, the Amtrak agent who scanned my ticket before letting me onto the platform didn’t catch my mistake either. Now whenever I get on the train to New York, I ask “Is this train going to New York?” I usually ask more than once. You may feel foolish doing this, but believe me, you’ll feel even more foolish when the train starts moving and the conductor comes over the loudspeaker and welcomes you aboard the train to Harrisburg. Why? You get a table. And great views, because you have a clear sight line out all the windows, not just the one next to your seat. Plus, the cafe car is where the train personnel hang out, so it’s the best place to ride if you want to stay informed. They usually congregate at one of the tables, and they have all the inside info about train delays and scheduling changes and are happy to share it. (Plus it’s fun to listen to them gossip about the passengers.) Best of all? You’ve got access to coffee and snacks. If you do ride in the cafe car, buy something. Even a cup of coffee. And? Tip the person you buy that coffee from. It’s good karma. Before you leave the train? Clean up after yourself. Don’t leave your trash behind for the next passenger to deal with. Especially if you’re sitting near me, because I will call after you: Hey! Aren’t you forgetting something? Like this half empty coffee cup and discarded sandwich container? Do I look like a maid service? Come back here and put this stuff in the trash!” (Think that’s rude? You’re lucky I don’t throw it at you.) The noise you want to cancel out? Your overly friendly seat mate. The moment they start blathering, bring out your headphones and put them on. Especially if you have a sensitive sniffer. Over the course of a trip, the aroma can get pretty funky. If you use the bathroom? Always always always close the toilet lid before you flush. What happens if you don’t? Trust me — you really don’t want me to describe it to you. (But if you disregard this advice and the toilet did what it did the last time I forgot to close the lid? You will never do it again ) Don’t sit in the quiet car unless you intend to shut the hell up. No phone calls. No chatting. No loud snoring. Quiet Car Passengers take Silence very seriously. I was once reported to the conductor for the unduly loud crinkling sound my paper bag made when I removed my sandwich. I’ve also been reprimanded for snickering too loudly at a funny podcast. The woman in the seat in front of me stood up, confronted me with an angry glare and quietly snarled, “I’m so glad you’re enjoying yourself. But this is the quiet car.” Most important? Look out the window instead of vanishing into your phone. Don’t be one of those Road Warriors who spends the whole trip hunched over a lap top or blathering business verbiage into a cell, oblivious to the joy of watching the world roll by. Relax and Enjoy the Ride! (If you enjoyed this travel piece by Roz Warren, you might like this one too.)"
Medium.com,Life,Tokyo Kills Me,Travel,https://medium.com/@aaronpaulson/tokyo-kills-me-8e55ccfa1db1?source=topic_page---------409------------------1," (Scroll down if you want to skip to the pictures…) I crash-landed in Japan in 1998, a late-bloomer on a three-year overseas adventure from grad school, basement bachelor apartments, and a Gen-X future of under-employment in my hometown, Toronto. The plan was simple: a three-year overseas stint to pay down some student debt; raise a grubstake for the next adventure; and gather some material for the Great Expat Novel. Two decades later, now in Tokyo, there’s still no end in sight (sorry, Ma!). Turns out, the Greater Tokyo Area comprises the world’s greatest conurbation of cities, towns, and villages — even mountains and islands. Living in and exploring metro Tokyo taps me into enough adventures to last a lifetime. Or two even. Blogger Aarohi Narain captures some of the exuberance of moving to and through a world-class city in “Being Brown on Tokyo Tinder.” [Tokyo is] a city of opportunity. A tempestuous, dynamic vessel for the pleasures, pains, and aspirations of increasingly disillusioned generations. An economic hub powered by throbbing, vibrating, neon circuits of global industry and commerce. From all over Japan and the world, people pour into the city to craft visions of their futures into reality and to build their lives anew. Now, while still not quite a local, I continue to participant-observe in the daily life of my adopted hometown. Notebook and camera — or, increasingly, smartphone — in hand, I remain at one remove from daily life in the world’s greatest megacity. So. Running to the conbini convenience store for salmon rice balls. Or take-out skewers of terikyaki chicken from the local yakitori stall. And vending machines for beer or one-cup shots of sake. Or standing ten-deep on train platforms on banzai work-to-death commutes. Enduring typhoon days of the soul, when wind and rain scour the psyche. All I need do to transport back to those first heady days in Japan is take the first left out of whichever station I’m stranded in. Then, I discover a place I’ve never been before, a secret garden of sights and impressions tucked within the city’s origamied folds. It could be a five-minute time-out or a work-free snow day. I wander ’til quitting time. Viewfinder or touchscreen to eye, I snap pics of the mundane, the overlooked — all the haunting little details revealed in their proper light. No matter how jaded I grow about all this Tokyo livin’, and a settled life to which I never aspired. Or how much I pine for the youthful spirit that first brought me across the Pacific all those years ago, “The Big Sushi” still has the power to fill me with wonder, and remind me what an adventure daily life can be. Eyes wide, heart and mind open like any good aspiring Buddhist-wannabe… Notorious street photographer Daido Moriyama snaps the connection between the urban heart of Tokyo and its inhabitants. “I have always felt that the world is an erotic place… For me cities are enormous bodies of people’s desires. And as I search for my own desires within them, I slice into time, seeing the moment. That’s the kind of camera work I like.” To paraphrase late night TV, there are 38 million stories in the naked city. And like some cinematographic boddhisatva aspirant, recording all those stories begins with a single photograph. So, even after all these years, I find the constant (over-)stimulation a daily source of inspiration. Each day’s commute starts with the thrilling sense of a new story about to begin. I ride the trains, and spelunk the urban caves and canyons of this great megacity. Tokyo peels back layer after battle-scarred, disaster-ridden, weather-beaten layer to reveal its ugly, delicious heart. Or, as the unnamed narrator of Haruki Murakami’s Dance Dance Dance observes, All around me normal, everyday city types were going about their normal, everyday affairs. Lovers were whispering to each other, businessmen were poring over spread sheets, college kids were planning their next ski trip and discussing the new Police album. I alone was the outsider. I had no place here. … I could drink my coffee, read my book, pass the time of day without any special thought, all because I was part of the regular scenery. Here I had no ties to anyone. Even after all this time, The Big Sushi still has the power to inspire my (over-) active imagination, and remind me what an experience life can be in the world’s greatest metropolis. The pictures posted here capture those quotidian adventures — and the “real” city that is hidden in plain sight that opens to those who look. This is one reason I choose to live so far overseas from the place I first called “home” … to shake off the complacency of the overly familiar, and make the most of every moment by immersing myself in a new and challenging environment. To be, as the sci-fi writer Robert A Heinlein once had it, a “stranger in a strange land.” Did I need to travel so far to be inspired? To find value and beauty in the flotsam and jetsam of a megacity on steroids? Not if Thoreau and other philosophical homebodies are to be believed. Every place has its charms, after all, and — to quote Kahlil Gibran — “In one drop of water are found all the secrets of the oceans.” Still, there’s something about Tokyo the Ur-City. The original and still best conurbation continues to reveal layers of depth and complexity that make the world a richer, more beautiful, and infinitely more stimulating place than it would otherwise be. The Japanese have a word for it. Wabi-sabi translates in the work of some Japonisme-inspired artists as “nothing lasts, nothing is finished, and nothing is perfect.” The transitory, incomplete, and imperfect defines the city, and draws my photographer’s eye. This is the spirit of the city I most want to capture in these pictures. (Shot on Olympus cameras with a variety of lenses and, increasingly, smartphones. Processed using Oly art filters, LR, and PhotoLab to create a certain “fuinki,” or atmosphere, rather than a literal depiction of colour and light conditions at that moment in time.

Medium.com,Life,Regional tourism must move on from the Thomas Cook package,Travel,https://medium.com/@Rashmee/regional-tourism-must-move-on-from-the-thomas-cook-package-8d650241637d?source=topic_page---------410------------------1," Turkey, Tunisia, Egypt… the grim regional roll call of countries affected by the collapse of Thomas Cook, the world’s oldest travel company. The death rattle of Thomas Cook has been ­­heard over many years in the firm’s increasingly feeble announcements of losses and insurmountable debt but, now that the venerable British company has given up the ghost, it is time to appraise the tourism model it built and what it has meant for the Middle East and North Africa region. The truth is, Thomas Cook flourished because it was creative enough to package the Middle East — its places and people — as a stereotype. Thomas Cook was one of several mid-19th-century initiatives to help Western travellers navigate the region — but only the geographic distance, not the deeper complex layers of culture. In his book “Colonising Egypt”, Columbia University political theorist Timothy Mitchell argues that many European and North American travellers in the 19th century sought to tour Egypt as if it were an exhibition like those they might have visited at the London, Paris or Chicago world’s fairs. There, too, scenes of “the East” were on offer. Forging a tourism economy in the Middle East meant creating the same sort of accessible packages of reliable exotica. Mitchell calls it “the world as exhibition.” Tour companies such as Thomas Cook were part of that effort to create an easily digestible narrative about foreign locales for Western consumption. Incidentally, the first Baedeker guide, once considered indispensable for Western travellers, appeared around the same time as Thomas Cook’s tours. Baedeker typically offered advice along the following lines: Tangier market in Morocco is “an indescribable mass of Oriental humanity”; and the average Egyptian is “no more intelligent than a child.” Historian F. Robert Hunter said “tourism was inseparable from the West’s conquest of the Middle East. Beginning in the 19th century, the Middle East was subjected to European economic penetration and political control… Empire provided Cook & Son with new fields to conquer, not only in Egypt, but also in India and beyond.” Thomas Cook dominated tourism for 178 years. In fact, it created modern travel as we know it today, pioneering discounts, hotel vouchers, food coupons and tour operators. Established by a cabinet maker and Baptist minister in 1841 with domestic excursions in Britain, it was only when Cook & Son expanded to the Middle East that the business really took off. After a Thomas Cook-organised exploratory tour to the Middle East — Turkey, Egypt and Palestine/Syria — in 1868, the company grew rapidly as a result of its connection to Britain, then the world’s leading power. Cook & Son received special treatment from the Egyptian viceroy, opened its first Middle East office in Cairo in 1872, acquired hotels in Egypt and heavily marketed the country as a winter resort. Eventually, it opened tourism all along the Nile river and assumed a monopoly of Nile steamboat traffic. Thomas Cook tours became so famous they were written about by Charles Dickens and Anthony Trollope. Thomas Cook, the man, became a celebrity, attending the 1869 opening of the Suez Canal alongside Empress Eugenie of France. From 1869–1882, the year of Britain’s “temporary” military occupation of Egypt, Cook & Son claimed to be engaged in the “business of peace”. In a distant echo of the political pressures faced today by Hong Kong flag carrier Cathay Pacific to take sides during months of pro-democracy protests, Cook & Son remained aloof during the local rebellion against Egypt’s viceroy and his government. Hunter says that “by the turn of the century, there were two empires on the Nile — Britain’s military occupation and Cook’s Egyptian travel”. Despite 20th-century decolonisation and enormous geopolitical change in the 21st century, Middle Eastern tourism continues to be bound up in the model pioneered by Cook. This revolves around moving large numbers of Westerners through places they will barely remember in a week or two, having forged no real human connections in the process. Now that Thomas Cook is no more, the tourism prospects of Turkey, Tunisia and Egypt appear to have dimmed. However, this low point could be a launchpad for rethinking regional tourism. The 21st century is very different from the world in which Thomas Cook began his business. It is beset by worries about climate change and mass tourism’s carbon footprint in terms of flights and hotels. With migrants and foreigners increasingly demonised, it is increasingly important to forge human connections. There is an opportunity now to develop a richer visitor experience, which focuses on the region’s many-layered cultural, historical and traditional resources. Instead of the resorts, which Thomas Cook pioneered, how about home stays, tents, small pensions and a scaled-down, more organic form of hospitality? It would be more green and socially responsible, and it will be in demand as the world increasingly seeks authentic experiences. It would also allow for interaction with local host communities, taking East-West contact to a deeper level. It’s time to move on from the Thomas Cook package.

Medium.com,Life,What moving to London has taught me about loneliness,Travel,https://medium.com/@roselladelloioio/what-moving-to-london-has-taught-me-about-loneliness-5af536836330?source=topic_page---------413------------------1," I always suspected that London would be a lonely place to live, that’s probably why it took me so long to get here. When you visit, you see the worst of it. A cacophony of traffic, forced games of Sardines on the Holocaust Express (tube), cheetah-speed walking paces, a distinct lack of space and horrendous prices. Growing up in West Wales, I had the privilege of running the length of beaches without a soul around, I strolled home from pubs at 4am without a second thought and in those pubs, there was always at least 3 familiar faces to sing Mr Brightside with. “You’re so London, why don’t you move here?” Friends enthused years before I finally rocked up. “SO many reasons” I thought. “Maybe one day” I said, without ever truly believing it. But lo and behold, I live here now. I live east and work west. I gawp at beautiful buildings on a daily basis and there’s a mouthwash dispenser in the bathroom of my office. You can eat any cuisine under the sun, be totally anonymous and visit a never ending array of inspiring places. It’s acceptable to drink on Monday’s and you never run out of dating app matches. For the most part, living in London is peachy. But oh my god it is lonely. I don’t say this lightly. I’m the type of person that needs a few hours peace and quiet after socialising and for the most part enjoys being solitary. There’s loneliness everywhere of course, but London aches of the stuff. The disparity between the rich and poor is insane In London you are a pawn in the advertising game. If you have the misfortune of catching a tube or work anywhere near central you’ll be bombarded with things to buy, things you should aspire to buy and things you can never afford to buy on a daily basis. Reminders of your place in this world are everywhere. On Oxford Street shoppers step over homeless sleeping bodies to reach the best-dressed mannequins. Audacious designer labels coexist with hunger and extreme poverty. Council blocks and Victorian townhouses and exclusive members clubs and pawnbrokers and segregated playgrounds and free-range birds and spicy McNuggets. Welcome to the class club. No matter how close you get, you are totally, irrevocably alone I remember catching the bus at an optimistically quiet stop and bagging a window seat. The seat next to me (and all the others) quickly filled up as we weaved through the streets of Angel and Islington. But then, as the people in front of me got off I was shocked to find my neighbour practically leapfrogged into the vacant seats. Did I smell? Was an annoying sound coming through my headphones? No, this is just London and people are dying for space where they can get it. If two bus seats become vacant, someone will fill them to get away from you. Same goes for the tube. I’ve been dangerously close to falling over several times, I’ve used the tips of my fingers to steady myself against the tube door when personal space is at a premium and I’ve witnessed fights and aggression due to a lack of it. Dogs are the exception to the rule. The world will warm up for a fluffy teddybear. Look, it’s you. And another you. There you go, Glen Coco Ready to feel like a complete carbon copy of everyone else? Walk around. Spot a doppelganger multiple times a day. Witness your insignificant place in this cosmopolitan sprawling abyss. You are not magnificent, no matter what your Mum told you. In fact, there’s someone smarter, cooler and better adjusted right next to you. Community spirit is kind of a big deal In Wales I used to dread the way a trip to the supermarket would lead me to bump into everyone from my first boyfriend to ex-teachers. Can’t a girl just grab a tiger loaf without the world and its wife knowing about it, etc. I didn’t realise how lucky I was to endure those familiar faces. Now, I crave a sense of community so much that on the two occasions I’ve bumped into someone I know on the off chance, I’ve been absolutely elated. The people we grow up with and know are carved into our identity. Without them, navigating this topsy-turvy world is a peculiar thing. No woman is an island, and being a raindrop in a puddle of 8 million won’t change that."
Medium.com,Life,10 Life Lessons From My Solo Road Trip Across America,Travel,https://medium.com/@rebeccaahn/10-life-lessons-from-my-solo-road-trip-across-america-70a75a5c313e?source=topic_page---------414------------------1," As anyone who travels a lot will tell you, life on the road isn’t easy. Whether you’re taking a short road trip or trying to live the nomadic life full-time, you’re going to face some unique challenges that only the road can present. In preparation for my 2-month, 9,000-mile cross-country road trip, I’d formed several goals and expectations about how healthy I’d be (and further become), how much I’d do and see, and all the great self-reflection I’d achieve. I had pretty idealistic visions of how productive this trip would be for me. And this wasn’t my first rodeo, but it certainly was the longest and most ambitious road trip I’d ever undertaken. Yet despite my every intention to give my physical, mental, and emotional core needs solid focus, I still found it difficult to actually implement them on the road, where every day is different. What saved me was my predilection to make plans and lists, and give everything around me structure. Without that, I would not have been able to navigate what I discovered to be a very challenging way of life. Even for someone as free-spirited as me. As a dear friend of mine once put it, the key is to “create deep structure that allows for deep chaos.” I’m certain I will repeat this experience again, possibly even make it a more regular or recurrent lifestyle. So it‘s vital I figure out how to keep myself healthy and happy in the process. And perhaps you’d like to figure that out yourself as well. So to get us started, here are some key lifestyle lessons I learned on this epic road trip that I fully intend to better embody as I adventure onward. #1. Find Your Own Road Routines Good food, enough sleep, and regular exercise. These are the core fundamentals we need everyday to stay healthy, happy, and well. Going into this trip, I knew I’d have to keep a very strict focus on these basic needs. Because life on the road can make it that much harder. And because at the start of my road trip, I was the heaviest and most unhealthy I’ve ever been. So I knew I’d need to set some strong ground rules and (most importantly) keep iterating on them, learning what’s actually feasible and compatible with my road trip life. It’s pretty easy to create a healthy routine when you have a stable home, work, and relationships. But when all three are constantly in flux and on the move, the formula gets exponentially more complicated. So it’s important to figure out what works for YOU and how you live your on-road lifestyle. For my bedtime routine, I learned that I like to pull into my overnight spot just after sunset, have some settling in and reading time, and hit the hay by midnight. Then I’d let my body wake up naturally, which would often fall between 8am-9am. If I’d parked somewhere a bit less on the up-and-up, however, I might have to set an alarm to get up and out of dodge earlier before any cops came a-calling. But this was rare. I also set clear goals around what I’d let myself eat, and found I could get pretty healthy options at gas stations if I aimed for the larger truck stop travel centers (like Pilot or Love’s) which often had hard-boiled eggs, yogurt, and fruit in stock. For exercise, I designed my route to hit as many gyms in my 24 Hour Fitness membership as possible on my way. If you don’t have a similar gym membership, you can still find a way to regularly exercise. I got additional cardio from national park hikes and occasional morning runs. Plus, I’m a big fan of calisthenics you can do anywhere like lunges, squats, crunches, planks, and, my personal favorite, push-ups. No matter where I am, I have a goal of 100 push-ups a day. I rarely hit this, but just having the goal motivates me to get at least some in every day. You gotta figure out what works for you. And then don’t stray! #2. Budget For More Than You Expect This means both in finances and in time. It will cost you more of both than you originally estimate to get yourself from point A to point B to point C and so on. Why is that? Well you may not find as low of gas prices. Or you may have a sudden travel expense you didn’t expect. Like needing to replace your car brake rotors. That gets mighty pricey, believe you me. It’s even more important with respect to time, the one resource you can never get more of. I guarantee you it will take longer than you expect to drive (ride, bike, hitchhike, etc) to each next point on your journey. Or to explore each of those destination points. If I had a nickel for every time I wished I’d had more time to explore the various national parks I visited on my trip… well, I’d have a whole lot of nickels. A few hours is simply not enough, even for a quick driving tour. Even one to two days was not enough to get to know each of the amazing cities on my route like Austin, New Orleans, and Nashville. Especially when you’re already weary from all that travel, some sleep deprivation, and perhaps even a little altitude sickness. Ultimately, my ambitious plan to drive across the entire country (and back) and visit almost every state in two months proved to be much more hurried and harried then I’d anticipated. And I knew it’d be tight to begin with. So learn from my mistakes and give yourself more time and budget than you think you’ll need. #3. And Expect Less Productive Time At the same time, don’t expect to get as much work or other sedentary productivity done as you intend. Like reading. Boy did I have ambitions there. I’d designed one of the shelves in my custom cabinetry to the exact height for my books. Essentially, I built myself an in-car bookshelf. I packed the thing with about ten of my favorites and ones I’d been meaning to read for however long, fully intending to finish some of them and at least start the rest. But being on the road makes it very hard to actually do any of that. Not unless you (once again) budget in the time for it. By this, I mean giving yourself designated time to be still in one place (not mid-travel) to sit and work with your full focus. I’d also intended to do a lot of writing on the road (like on this blog), not to mention research into new potential career paths (a big reason for the long sabbatical in the first place). However, my trip had such an aggressive timeline of ground to cover that the vast majority of my schedule was necessarily budgeted for driving time. And as I discovered, reading and writing (and even Googling) are near impossible while also driving behind the wheel. Voice-to-text is so not as solid as it needs to be. I only got any decent work done when I made the time to stop in a town somewhere and stay put for a while to eat a good meal, relax, and access some reliable Wi-Fi. So if you have any intentions like this yourself, my advice would be to set aside some solid stationary time for your own work, or whatever still-sitting, high-focus activities you intend to do on the road. It will likely eat into your driving/traveling time and extend your overall timeline. So make sure you weigh where your priorities lie and design your road schedule accordingly. #4. Make Better Use Of Driving Time Now if you are too busy driving to read or work, you can still take advantage of all that driving time for other valuable activities instead. Like thinking through stuff. I do some of my best self-reflection while driving. So this road trip was basically that on steroids. I’d set a goal of making some significant discoveries and decisions about my next career and life path on this trip. So I made good use of all that time behind the wheel, driving mindlessly on one highway for sometimes hundreds of miles at a time, to do some solid soul-searching and what I call “self-talk.” Yes, I talked to myself. Out loud. A lot. One of the benefits of driving alone. My car is my little safe space where I can talk or sing or scream to my heart’s content without any (outside) judgement. Because I process things better out loud. I’ve just always been that way. Maybe you can relate. And if you do, I highly recommend embracing the relatively soundproof bubble of your vehicle to let your vocal ponderings fly free. Or do whatever else you find valuable and meaningful that doesn’t require your eyes and both hands. Maybe just your vocal cords and a few small one-handed gestures. Like belting out your favorite Disney songs. Or composing voice-to-text if you’ve discovered some magical software that doesn’t suck at that. Whatever fires your jets and greases your wheels. #5. If You Must Use The Phone, Mount It I can’t tell you how incredibly valuable a dashboard phone mount can be. It’s the bees knees of sliced bread, or whatever. It saved me time, focus, neck pain, and so much more. Of course, ideally we aim not to use the phone at all while driving. 😉 But there are always gonna be exceptions. Like navigating with Google Maps. Or responding to urgent (or even non-urgent) texts. Or looking up the few words you forgot in that Disney song. I also discovered, upon using all that driving time to think through things, that I then felt a strong urge to write down all those great thoughts before they faded into the limbo of my mind. And if I hadn’t had the dashboard mount to keep my phone in easy viewing and typing distance, I would not have been able to capture all those great personal insights, or at least not without seriously compromising my driving and safety. So be safe, be smart, and get yourself a dashboard mount (or finally install the one you bought months ago). Or if you’re super cheap, just use a binder clip and a rubber band. Same difference. #6. Be Prepared For Driving Pains Sitting still in a driver seat for many hours at a time, whether or not you have your phone car mount handy, will inevitably take a physical toll on your body. Car seats are surprisingly NOT designed to be particularly ergonomic. Which means, as I discovered, that considerable back and shoulder pain will inevitably ensue. As well as arm weariness if, like me, you’re still determined to try and do things on your mounted phone while driving. Holding your hand up nice and steady next to the car mount is actually surprisingly tiring after a while. My lesson from this was thus to incorporate some preventative means of maintaining better driving posture like a back brace or lower back pillow (or just a spare sweater you can shove down by your lower back in a pinch). You should also have ready some reactive means of addressing the pain once it occurs like tiger balm or a neck massager or just a tennis ball you can once again wedge down behind you and awkwardly roll against as you drive. You’ll also want to pay attention to how frequently your body asks for breaks to stretch and realign. I found that my sweet spot was about every 3–4 hours, at which point I’d find a place to stop and breathe (amazing how therapeutic just breathing deeply can be), stretch, pee, and perhaps refuel with a snack. Driving is especially exhausting on certain stretches of road across the country, like those long flat interstate highways with high winds that push your car about, or the kind of pavement that makes your tires whistle like an angry tea kettle. So be prepared for the longer hauls, stock up on supplies, and (most importantly) follow the next tip! #7. Pace Yourself! I can’t stress this one enough. I had so much ground to cover on my road trip that my pace ended up quite spastic and aggressive. It was not sustainable, even with back braces and tiger balm and frequent breaks. I ended my road trip completely wiped out, mental drained, decently sleep deprived, and in need of another vacation to recover from that one. I was certainly in no position to implement any of the revelations I had on the trip, let alone continue to uncover new ones. It took months to get back to a fully healthy state of body and mind. And we simply don’t have that kind of time. Life and responsibilities start nagging. And before you know it, you’re committing to another exhausting and costly endeavor. Why do we do this to ourselves? So please, for the love of all that is holy and wholey, take it slow as you go so you don’t have to madly (and unsuccessfully) play catch-up later. Don’t overcommit to too strict a timetable or pace or to do list. And give yourself the freedom to change your mind, change course, or just stop altogether whenever you need to. Your health is more important than seeing the world’s largest frying pan (especially since there are actually six of them across the country all claiming the same title). #8. This Too Shall Pass Remember, at the end of the day, this trip (or particularly frustrating section of the trip) will eventually end. When the going gets tough and you’re running on fumes, try to remember that it’s not forever. It will have an end. And until you get there, you can take it in small sections, with small milestones, one at a time. You can even give yourself a reward as you reach each. Like a whole week in a familiar city visiting your favorite old haunts to congratulate yourself for making it halfway through this insane behemoth of a road trip you’re already drowning in way over your head. After all, we only have so much time left on this earth. So you might as well enjoy the journey along the way and let go of the rest. However hard it may get, however much you may struggle, don’t forget to stop and smell the roses. I mean park the damn van, get out, and go smell some flowers. Or look at the trees. Breathe in some fresh air. Or whatever else that phrase means to you. Life is too short to spend the whole thing running around madly trying to cover as much ground as possible, and missing all the great stuff around you in the process. #9. This Too Shall Also Prevail At the same time, in the end, this trip will be worth it. In spite of (and no doubt because of) all the ups and downs. It will prove an amazing journey that will teach you so much about yourself and help you grow in more ways than you expect. It will be a wonderful, challenging, frustrating, amazing, life-changing experience that is entirely unique and special. So even as you are swearing at the other asshole drivers on the road, or balking at the price of gas, or tossing and turning at night kept awake by bright Walmart parking lot lights and thunderous rain storms, remember how lucky you are to be here on the road living this lifestyle. Practice some gratitude. I try to make this a daily habit every night before I go to sleep. I think of three things I’m grateful for and send out mental thanks to those people (or places or things). And then I let that fond feeling lull me into a gentle sleep. Works like a charm. Do whatever you need to do to find that same inner calm (like the next tip). And know that it will all be okay. More than okay. It’s going to be triumphant. #10. Find Your Inner Peace My personal mantra goes like this: “Breathe deep. Seek peace. Beat free.” No matter where you are or how rough the road may be (literally or like totally litrally), you can always press pause, take a deep breath (remember how good that is for you), and find a little slice of peace, however small and bite-sized. Take it in and let it fill you. There’s no better cure for the many kinds of pain that the road will inflict on you. Unless, you know, you’ve got some serious pain, and then maybe take some medication or go see a doctor. I got this great fortune cookie once that I’ve since taped to my laptop so it’s always front and center (well, technically top and left). It says, “No one is important enough to make you angry.” And it’s true. Of everyone and everything. So no matter what upsets you as you travel on your own journey, remember these mantras. Or find your own mantras or other tricks to bring yourself back to a peaceful state of being."
Medium.com,Life,A foodie’s guide to Seattle,Travel,https://medium.com/@jenny.ma1031/a-foodies-guide-to-seattle-31b1b61a63c8?source=topic_page---------415------------------1," Now I wouldn’t consider myself a Seattle-lite by any means, but spending 8 months in the city as a rookie-foodie (roodie?), I’ve stumbled my way to some of the best food I’ve had. Here are some of those places, for each and every one of your food niche. What else would a broke college foodie start with?! In an inconspicuous corner of U-District I have found one of my favourite Thai places, possibly ever — Thai Tom. This dimly-lit, literal hole-in-the-wall seems to seat about 10, with the waitress taking your order before you even step in the door. Expect to wait in line for a while. But don’t worry, the tease of Thai delirium wafting to your starved senses is just a part of the experience. Their pad thai is out of this world, packed with veggies, spices and some serious heat. Spice lovers be warned: I was in near tears from my level 4 (out of 5) spice, but partly from how good the food was. Good thing they have great Thai iced tea to sooth the burn, right? Best of all, our meal came out to just over $10 a person. Cheap, delicious, satisfying, this is where it’s at. Affordable and quick, Salumi and Paseo’s Caribbean sandwiches are tied for the ultimate (delicious) fast food. Salumi serves hearty (read: gigantic) Italian sandwiches overflowing with pulled porchetta, cheese, sauteed veggies. Their cold cuts are stuffed with assortments of delicious cured meats. Its location in the heart of Pioneer Square also makes it super accessible for a quick bite before a Mariner’s game or a walking tour. Paseo is food for the soul. Their eccentric neon building in Fremont is super easy to miss, without even a restaurant sign. I love their Paseo Press, which is stuffed full with tender braised pork shoulder and veggies, smothered in their delicious juices. This is certainly not the meal to be a neat eater. I can’t talk about cheap eats without mentioning the crowning glory of Seattle, the In-N-Out of Puget Sound, Dick’s (hamburgers). This retro diner/drive-through is allegedly frequented by Bill Gates, among its many loyal fans. Personally, I find while the price tag is great, the taste is a happy medium between McDonalds and cardboard (though improving exponentially with alcohol). Overall, meh. Not exactly the most accessible, but in.gredients located at Microsoft HQ in Redmond might be the best deal there is in town. For $17, you get three decadent courses from a seasonally rotating menu by award-winning chef John Howie. While I’ve had the occasional miss (raw angus burger, I’m looking at you), most dishes are phenomenal. My favourites include the Dungeness crab salad appetizer, grilled pork chops, and crème brûlée. in.gredients is the epitome of ‘fine dining’ on a budget. There are a few places in every city where missing out on them would mean missing out on the city. Admittedly, a lot of them are overhyped, but these Seattle staples are certainly not. P
ike Place Market — tourist attraction and foodie heaven all-in-one, this is the one stop shop for all your Seattle classics. Doesn’t get much better than that. Start your quest at Pike Place Chowder, the national award-winning chowder. Creamy and packed with fresh seafood, it’s not hard to see why there’s so much hype. They’re also nailing their variants on the classic New England chowder, so I’d highly recommend a chowder sampler split between friends! Pro tip! Do not wait in line! (No, don’t butt in line). Pike place chowder has a website where you can place orders online and pick up at the side counter when ready. The menu is slightly smaller (no lobster rolls or bread bowls), but well worth the 30–60 minutes you save to explore Pike’s Place! Daily Dozen might be the most underrated donut place in the world, that’s coming from someone who doesn’t even like donuts. They have some mind blowing mini-donuts, fresh out of the deep frier and absolutely doused with cinnamon sugar, their classic flavour. The crispy exterior and silky smooth (and piping hot) interior just melts in your mouth, sweet and buttery. It’s a must-go for any friends visiting, or even locals who missed it. The stand is inconspicuous and easily overlooked next to the boisterous fish tossing and the golden pig. Across the street, you have Ellenos Yogurt. Now I know what you’re thinking — how good could yogurt be? Me, thinking the same, put off trying Ellenos for a long time. Once I did, there was no going back. Somehow Ellenos has the creaminess and consistency of ice cream without the sickly sweetness hitting you after a couple spoonfuls. My unwavering favourite was their lemon curd — the sour curd cut the sweetness of the yogurt perfectly. Their passion fruit was a close second. Even if you’re not sure, stop by for a free sample of their flavours, although be warned, you might be hooked. Piroshky Piroshky is a traditional Russian bakery next door to the original Starbucks. No need to search, you’ll smell the buttery goodness (and spot the line) from a block away. They offer pastries with fillings from beef and onions (delicious) to apple cinnamon. Overpriced? Yes. Worth the splurge? Absolutely. Rachel’s Ginger Beer is also a popular spot for Seattle-lites and tourists alike. For me personally, I find it overpriced and, well, meh. While it’s really interesting to try, ginger beer just isn’t something I lean towards on the regular. Fremont Bowl, Fremont Bowl, Fremont Bowl. Please, if you don’t even visit the Space Needle (in fact, don’t), you need to go to Fremont Bowl. Their poke/chirashi bowls are insanely fresh, and absolutely packed with goodies from the sea. Their salmon, my favorite, just melts in your mouth, leaving a sweet and buttery aftertaste. The seafood is also nicely complimented by their in-house sauces. For under $15, this is one of the best seafood deals there is. Living 10 minutes walking from Fremont Bowl, my love for their poke bowls became a borderline problem. If you’re an oyster fan, The Walrus and the Carpenter is the place for you. The seafood spot in town, W&C offers a wide variety of fresh raw oysters from different locales. Their menu is a refreshing assortment of fusion seafood dishes inspired by French and Spanish cuisines. Here, I’ve had some of the most unique and unexpected flavour pairings. If you’re lucky, you can even catch their happy hour, when their oysters and drinks are heavily discounted. However, wait times for this popular spot are often a few hours. Good thing is, you can explore the charming neighbourhood of Ballard in the meantime! Another popular spot for oysters is Elliot’s Oyster House, along with the assortment of seafood places lining the Pier. While I get their hype (especially with tourists) for their great location, these restaurants were not worth the money for me — grossly overpriced and mediocre food with overwhelmed staff, they are a pass for me. Another Japanese cuisine on the list, Sushi Kashiba. Sushi Kashiba has become somewhat of a legend in the Seattle food scene, serving up some mind-blowing omakase for a very steep price tag. Dining at Kashiba is the complete experience, from the impeccable service to a knowledgeable introduction for every dish. I was half expecting our waiter to tell us the birth name of the fish on our plate. Their omakase menu is a fixed 5 courses featuring various exotic seafood, but also common ingredients such as steamed eggs and salmon, all cooked to absolute perfection. While my wallet’s in no rush to return for a second round, Sushi Kashiba is certainly a dining experience I would recommend to anyone. Admittedly, some spots I frequent not just for the food, but for the ambiance. If you’re looking for a place to visit with your special someone, these are a few of my top picks: The Pink Door serves up some phenomenal hearty Italian food, straight outta grandma’s kitchen. Even better, it’s a short walk away from Pike Place with a great view of the market and pier, and on weekend nights they even feature trapeze artists twirling in the air, in synchronization with the tagliatelle on your fork. Their menu might even top their view. From Italian classics such as ragù bolognese and seafood linguine to their carne mains with a modern twist, you can basically order anything on the menu with your eyes closed and be blown away. Their hearty Italian portions is guaranteed to have you stuffed to the brim on exit. Did I mention this amazing food is also super affordable? Expectedly, the Pink Door is in very high demand, so make sure to snag a reservation well in advance! Oddfellow’s Cafe might be my favorite coffee spot in town, and that’s saying a lot from the cafe junkie. The rustic decor and high beam ceilings is filled with sunlight and the smell of coffee during the day. I frequently made the trip to Capitol Hill with a good book just to spend an afternoon here. At night, it transforms into a cozy bar/restaurant with a delicious dinner menu — I especially love their creamy mushroom risotto! Even better, Oddfellow’s is just a few steps away from my favorite bookstore, the Elliott Bay Book Company. If you’re curious about the destination of all my disposable income, look no further than this duo. The Six Seven Restaurant takes patio season to a whole new level. This classy restaurant is located right on the water, where you can enjoy their delicious menu to the view of Bainbridge island across the water and the sound of waves splashing underneath your feet. Their restaurant is also the recipient of various awards throughout the years, and it’s easy to see why. I loved their cod, with a crispy miso crust, and their perfectly seasoned braised short rib. Though slightly on the expensive side, Six Seven is a great place for a special occasion. Often overlooked, farmer’s markets around Seattle have some kick a** food. Ballard is the undisputed queen of Seattle farmer’s markets. From street food stalls to fresh meat vendors to the aforementioned Ellenos yogurt, Ballard’s farmer’s market has something for everyone. I love their salted taffy and toffee stands, and the very decent tacos at one of the food stands I forgot the name of. There’s also a spectacular Swiss raclette stand, where they sell all kinds of foods just drowned in a pool of cheese, scrapped fresh from an entire wheel. Personally I found it more entertaining to watch than appetizing. Just taking a stroll around the market is one of my favourite weekend rituals. What’s Sunday mornings without brunch? My go-to is the absolute eden of gluttony, Portage Bay Cafe. Their Benedict sampler is my long-time favourite, featuring three of their best sellers: dungeness crab, classic smoked ham, and the Florentine. For seafood lovers, they even have an omelette stuffed with actual quality crab meat. If you have a sweet tooth, their pancakes/waffles come with access to their toppings buffet, featuring small mountains of various berries, nuts, creams, and sweets. This is the place for your next brunch feast."

Medium.com,Life,Tired of Clutter from Your Travels? Here’s Some Minimalist Travel Souvenir Ideas,Travel,https://medium.com/@aczerwinskiburkard/tired-of-clutter-from-your-travels-heres-some-minimalist-travel-souvenir-ideas-218ee18de439?source=topic_page---------417------------------1," When I was a kid, every vacation I took ended with at least one stuffed animal added to my collection. Up until probably age 16, I got one or two every trip, which led to my room being covered in stuffed animals. As I got older, I started to feel a certain guilt about having so many. Maybe that was because there were so many, maybe it’s because I realized having that many of something really doesn’t make me happy, or maybe I’ve just become more minimalist than I used to be. Becoming more minimalist means that, to me, experiences are more important than the physical things we have. I realize that certain objects enable us to do certain activities. There are certain items that we absolutely need in our lives, and I have nothing against that. But for me, more traveling means I want to remember those memories, but I want to do so in a way that just leads to more “junk” in my living space. So what are some minimalist “souvenir” ideas? This might be a pretty obvious one to some people, but I think it’s a good point and one that people don’t think of carefully before leaving for a trip. Personally, when I travel, I go to parks and forests, and places that are often part of the National Park Service. They almost always have inexpensive stickers (about $3 for two small and one large), and always have some fancier ones that are color and larger. You can find stickers from any city or area you’re in, and put them on different items that you have (such as a laptop, tablet, water bottle, etc). I personally bought a Nalgene (I needed another one for my summer trip anyways) and decided to buy stickers at every national park I went to and put it on the Nalgene. I use it almost every day, and the stickers remind me of the 2 month trip I took last summer. It’s very useful and doesn’t add clutter to my house. 2. Pictures I know, I know, you think I’m going to tell you just to take photos with your phone or camera and leave them there for years and scroll through them every so often. That can be fun, but there’s some better options for those of us who have an apartment or house with some blank walls. Whatever pictures you take, whether they’re with a fancy camera or a phone, know that you’ll be able to print them large enough to hang or put up somewhere. I went to a thrift shop one day to find some interesting frames, then used paint to make them nicer colors. Alternatively, probably going to Walmart and getting frames will be the least expensive (though I prefer to use recycled materials than new if possible). Then go to a printing center (there’s also one of these at Walmart, which I used and it’s pretty inexpensive and prints immediately). It might sound like a lot of effort, but you’ll be able to look at these photos all the time in your living space. 3. Journaling This one takes discipline. I probably got two weeks into my two month trip before I didn’t make time for it. But I have to say, even the writing that I do have left from my trip is pretty awesome and I wish I had kept going with it. Get a journal that you like before your trip, write a little in it, and then just make 10 minutes to write some basic information in it. I chose to do more of a narrative, but you can choose to just say where you were that day and one or two good things (and some challenges). You can always take pictures with this and put some in the journal so you have both a written and picture narrative to remind you of your trip. 4. Pens/Pencils This is something that yes, you’d have to buy at a gift shop or somewhere pricey, but I think it’s worth putting on this list. If you’re someone who uses a lot of pens or pencils, this is a good way to get something to remind you of your trip that’s also useful. Keep in mind that these can get lost easily on trips, so put them in your backpack/purse in a smaller pocket or even the front zipper of your suitcase/duffle bag."
Medium.com,Life,Four Reasons to Include Taranaki in your New Zealand vacation,Travel,https://medium.com/@jodylynnmcbrien/four-reasons-to-include-taranaki-in-your-new-zealand-vacation-a85bd138bc64?source=topic_page---------418------------------1," Ah, New Zealand. At just twice the size of Florida, it’s packed with diverse natural beauty. As a tourist there, you’ll be challenged to choose among the mountains, lakes, rain forests, glaciers, gardens, and seascapes. Consider Mount Taranaki. The second highest mountain on the North Island, the volcano, also known as Mount Egmont, towers at 8,261 feet. Like its taller cousin in Japan (Mount Fuji), Taranaki can hide so successfully in clouds that you can’t see the mountain’s outline against the sky. So, play hide and see with her, even if you only have a weekend. This area on the west coast of New Zealand is a natural feast for the senses. Check it out: The booklet “Taranaki: A Walker’s Guide,” (free at visitors’ centers in Mount Egmont National Park), states that there are more than 200 km of hiking trails (that’s 124 miles for Americans). Choose two or three short treks in separate locations to enjoy different views of the volcano. Begin your morning at Lake Mangamahoe to watch ducks and swans splash and cackle in the water. You can gain a vista of the volcano as you walk through a cool pine forest, then up a hillside of native brush. Next, drive to the North Egmont Visitors Centre, enjoying beautiful views of the summit en route. There you’ll find well-marked short trails to enjoy the “goblin forest” of lichens and moss-covered twisted tree trunks while catching glimpses of the mountain summit. Proceed to the Wilkes Pools Loop Track, a 45-minute drive from the North Egmont Center, and hike the Loop, but be prepared! We had to ford over a small waterfall and cross Kapuni Stream. We laughed at each other as we braved the chilly water and took selfies to prove our “bravery” to our friends. If you love the sound of rushing mountain streams and waterfalls, this short trek is a must-do. A bonus near this walk is the short hike to Dawson’s Falls, a 60-foot waterfall. After mountain hikes, head for sea level in New Plymouth. It’s the major town in the Mount Taranaki region, renown for another walking opportunity. The beautiful Coastal Walkway includes the uniquely designed Te Rawa Rawa Bridge, reminding viewers of a breaking wave or whale skeleton. Save this trek for the end of your day, and you can enjoy the red hues of the sunset lighting both the sky and the shimmering water. After a brisk walk with plenty of sea air, go into town and enjoy one of the many restaurants’ snapper or other fresh fish of the day! After a full day of walks and sights, you’ll be ready to relax. You can savor the region’s rural lifestyle with a stay at a farm or a cottage near the sea. I found a large, rustic Airbnb that produced its own energy. We enjoyed the warmth of a wood stove in the evening as well as two calves looking in our windows in the morning to a backdrop of snow-capped Taranaki. Beyond the pleasure of a pond and farm animals, we had the rare pleasure of enjoying a “dark sky” before lying down to a well-deserved sleep. A dark sky area has low light pollution, allowing you to see far more stars than is typical to view in a lighted community. We happened to be there during a new moon. The Milky Way glowed white and dusky from one end of the sky to the other. Everyone should have this experience at least once in a lifetime. The staff woman at the Dawson Falls Visitor Center encouraged us to visit Pukeiti as we left the area the next day. It was out of the way, reached on VERY winding, narrow mountain roads. Hidden within a mountain rain forest, this garden hosts one of the world’s largest and most diverse plantings of rhododendrons. Other plantings such as camellias, bulbs, lilies, and hydrangeas provide year-long color and scents along the trails. On clear days, you can view the Tasman Sea from trail lookouts. The forest hums with the songs of tui, bellbirds, fantails, and other native New Zealand birds. Overlooking a main part of the garden, Founder’s Café offers great light fare and coffee. Aside from glaciers, you won’t have to choose between mountains, lakes, rain forests, gardens, and seascapes. Taranaki has it all. Imagine what you can do: What are you waiting for? Don’t neglect Taranaki as you plan your trip of a lifetime to New Zealand!"
Medium.com,Life,Deconstructing the Icons on an Austrian Train,Travel,https://medium.com/swlh/deconstructing-the-icons-on-an-austrian-train-edfa7b61e0e7?source=topic_page---------419------------------1," As I was seated on a train from Budapest to Vienna last week, midway through a holiday in Central Europe, I heard passengers from all over the world speaking in different languages, with Hungarian and German being the majority. Since I do not speak either of those, I relied heavily on the icons on the train to point me to the right areas. It’s truly incredible what icons have done for travel — it has allowed travelers to transcend language barriers and have a more enjoyable and efficient experience. In the UX Design world, we can learn from how humans use icons in the real world to better incorporate them in our products in a way that is natural yet impactful. Icons are an essential part of wayfinding in a confusing or foreign place. They help us orient ourselves, feel comfortable and confident, and reduce our cognitive load so we can make quicker decisions. This is not just about catering to tourists — much like designing for accessibility can make the UX better for everyone, so can adding icons to a product or experience to help everyone work more efficiently. It’s so much better when a traveler can find their own way easily than when they constantly ask the staff or other passengers where they should go. After thinking about the importance of icons, I went searching for them on the train. Since it was run by an Austrian company, most of the text was written in German and subtitled in English. Icons were used profusely throughout the train, I must have spotted at least 50 different icons just on my single train car. A lot of the icons seemed like they were part of a national standard set of icons that are likely used throughout the country. To improve their ease of understanding, it seems that most icons are placed on or as close as possible to the object or area they are referring to, borrowing from the Gestalt Principle of Proximity. I also noticed their sizing was scaled up or down depending on the size of the object. For example, this trash bin has a small icon directly on top of the lid to indicate what it’s for. The icons also used color in a helpful way, but could still be understood without it, which is important for accessibility. Green was used to indicate a quiet area and a defibrillator which are considered positive concepts, but also a bit confusingly for an SOS call — perhaps they’re calling to mind the green phone icon from an iPhone. Red was used to indicate a fire extinguisher which is a common pairing, and as the ubiquitous red slash on signs like “no smoking”, indicating a negative concept. The rest of the icons use a consistent color scheme with blue and white, with some using a small yellow outline. They are all completely 2D with no perspective or dimension that could confuse travelers. They use round corners to give them a more approachable look."
Medium.com,Life,East Coast Trek — Part II:,Travel,https://medium.com/the-northern-point/east-coast-trek-part-ii-bb664ec2b33e?source=topic_page---------420------------------1," The house that George Washington’s father, Augustine Washington build on the premise of the present site of the Mount Vernon estate in 1734 was a very much smaller building than the one that greats the visitor to the estate today. From the time Washington took over the running of the estate in 1754 he started building out and up. This was also the sight that greeted us as we arrived at the estate. The western facade was in scaffolding as it was being cleaned off and a new layer of plaster was being added. The guide explained first that this was a unique opportunity to se the original process that was used to treat the outside of the mansion, which of course it was. More interestingly he told us, that the path approaching the mansion had been planned by Washington himself. The idea was the path winded its way up towards the house. So, when you were arriving in your horse-drawn carriage you would glimpse the house several times each time seeming bigger and bigger as you approached. From the 1750s Washington started expanding on the father his father had built. First by adding a second story to the original house and then adding on rooms in two stories on both north and west side of the building during the 1770s. In 1775 he added two single story secondary wings housing the servant’s quarters and the kitchens and these were connected to the house in 1778 through colonnades on both the north and south sides of the building. But 1778 wasn’t the last year of building, altering and renovation. The work continues to this day. In recent years the colonnades had been fitted with ramps allowing wheelchairs, strollers and walkers direct access to the house. You enter the house through “The New Room”. This was the latest and the grandest addition to the house and it was a place for entertaining guests and presenting of not only the Washingtons but also the country — presented through great commissioned paintings on the walls. The next room on the tour was the front parlor that was the grandest room in the house until The New Room came about. Next was the small parlor, that was a converted first floor bedroom. If you were a visitor when Washington lived here, you would of course have entered through the front door into the central passage. Both before the house was expanded and on hot summer nights the central passage was used for entertaining guests — best to enjoy the cool breeze from the open doorways. The central passage also includes the beautiful black walnut staircase that was added during expansions of the house. The previous staircase was moved and reused for access to the third floor of the house. From the central passage there was access to both the dining room and the downstairs bedroom. Through both these rooms and directly from the east and west front of the house you could access Washington’s study. Aside from the other accessways the study could also be accessed from the staircase from the Washingtons’ private bedroom. Since the private bedroom was Mrs. Washington’s domain George Washington kept his clothes and showered in his study. He used to say that the bedroom was Mrs. Washington’s room and he only slept there. Which is was cause the bedroom also doubled as Mrs. Washington’s office. The entire ground floor of the mansion was accessible one way or another. This was not, however, the case with the two upstairs floors but a solution has been found. Wheelchair users and others hard at walking was provided with a tablet and played a video of a guided tour of the upstairs rooms. Lavishly decorated the bedrooms on the first floor — four in all plus the private bedroom — were fit to entertain the most important guests. The Blue, The Yellow and the Chintz rooms were all rooms you could be installed in as a guest. In addition, the Lafayette room got its name because it is believed that the Marquis stayed here. The Marquis of course being an important ally in the war for independence. Finally, there was the room “at the top of the stairs”. A smaller room in a sense left over from a larger room changed in renovations. In the late 1750 added a third floor to the house. This floor was not a part of the tour, but it consisted of four bedrooms and storage rooms for lumber and the fine porcelain. More interestingly is the cupola that Washington had built atop the third floor. It’s a feature you don’t see often on private buildings, but the purpose of the copula was mostly to drain excess heat from the rest of the house — hot air travels upwards. It also had the added bonus of disguising the fact that the west facade was slightly asymmetrical due to the many addons to the building. Our tour ended and I was reunited with my wife who uses a wheelchair and was watching the virtual tour on a tablet on the porch on the east facade and enjoying the view. She was complaining that our tour of the top floors had been to short because she hadn’t finished the virtual tour yet. But an estate like this is much more than just the main building. If you want, you can spend hours exploring both gardens and the many workshops also on the estates. Many of them even working workshops like the blacksmith shop, the spinnery and the distillery. The grounds also include a green house, stables and, of course, the slave quarters. Read the first part of the Series: East Coast Trek — Part I: Accessible USA"

he moment I take a seat inside the car that will take me to the airport, my mind becomes clearer. I feel a weight lifting off my shoulders. I sense a calm in the pit of my belly.

I’m traveling, you see. I’ll be back next week. Until then, you’ll have to manage without me, thanks.

It’s a place where people’s personal dreams sometimes harmonize and sometimes collide.” -Hugh McKay It’s a strange and wonderful feeling when you make a decision to move somewhere new. They say the first three months are the hardest. Who ‘they’ are precisely I can’t tell you, but I can tell you I concur with their sentiment. My latest living adventure has planted me somewhere entirely new, and decidedly unexpected. It has been a little over three months since we moved to our quiet mountainous home in the heart of Tasmania, and much like the pace we find ourselves surrounded by, the process of settling in here has been a slowly slowly one. Tasmania was never a place we expected to find ourselves living, and yet, here we are. Despite the wonder of forging the next chapter of your life, collisions — in the words of Hugh McKay — are abound. There is a distinct difference between traveling in new lands and living in them. The nuances of a city, town or community can only be uncovered in the action of living. This is not the first time I have made big relocation changes in my life, but each time I do I learn a little something new about the process. “The process of learning how to fit into a particular geographical neighborhood — and then do it again and again as our circumstances propel us from place to place — is one of life’s most challenging lessons.” -Hugh McKay Any new village, town or city can be your home, your network, a calling card, and reason for being, or it can be the loneliest place you’ve ever existed. Discovering how and why any place you live fits into these categories is one of the most exciting and challenging processes to go through in life. In my experience, settling into a new city has been easy and fluid, like butter melting into all the right creases. But on another occasion, it has been fuzzy, difficult to grasp and more like treacle sticking where it shouldn’t. The art of moving somewhere new is about knowing what works for you as an individual and the community you want to be a part of and build. Not everywhere will afford you that space. You will have to work with what you have to hand. Does it mean you don’t enjoy it? No. Of course not. Does it make you nostalgic for what you once might have had? Yes. And that’s okay too. I’m fond of citing that the difficult moments in our lives often lead us to our greatest paths for growth. I feel confident my past experiences have set me up well to take on the new challenge of settling into my new home. It’s one I’m attempting, for the first time in my life, to approach heart first, as opposed to like a puzzle I need to solve as quickly as possible. And I think it might be working."

Medium.com,Life,Beautiful Blueberries.,Travel,https://medium.com/@sarah_holmes2/beautiful-blueberries-36fad2877c48?source=topic_page---------427------------------1," Over 10 years ago, for my birthday, I requested a DVD of a movie I’d seen advertised in an American teen magazine. The advert is iconic to me. Actor Emile Hirsch sits on top of an abandoned bus in the Alaskan wilderness. It’s icy blue. He looks cool as shiz. The biopic, called Into the Wild, is a movie based on a book of the same name. It chronicles the life and death of Christopher Johnson McCandless, an intelligent and affluent twenty-something who grew up in Annandale, Virginia. After he graduated from university, McCandless donated all his money to charity, abandoned his car and set off on an epic journey. For the next two years, he was mostly nomadic. He covered miles of the states, kayaked into Mexico and then made his way up to Alaska. In Alaska, he spent the last four months of his life living off the land and taking shelter in an abandoned Fairbanks transit system bus. After I watched Into the Wild, I read the book it was based on, probably three times cover to cover. The story would change my life."

Medium.com,Life,Ramen For A Loner,Travel,https://medium.com/@Doody.Richards/ramen-for-a-loner-89f568784d02?source=topic_page---------429------------------1," From the oval window of the Shinkansen to Tokyo via Shin Osaka station, I silently said goodbye to Hiroshima. The rain finally poured, and my heart was sinking. The city taught me that human’s altered ego on war has its lethal cost. The town was once flattened out on the ground, Burnt, beaten and defeated. On the other hand, I also learned how humanity brought men together to rise from the ground. Resilience, love and hope is indeed the power of all. The darkest days of the past are never forgotten. The city was rebuilt as the wound slowly healed. Hence Hiroshima has grown up to be the city with a reluctant charm. Having been travelling for almost three weeks, the first thing I learned from Japan was patience, discipline, and mindfulness towards others. I began to be hesitant to use the word Japan because the word itself doesn’t correlate well with the nation’s history, culture and tradition. I personally prefer ‘Nihon’, the sun of the east, as it corresponds with the true identity of the nation. Back in Tokyo for another four days, I was once again lost in the endless multi-level floors of Shinjuku station. I was on my way to Ameya Yokocho market. Soon I got out of Okachimachi station, just before my eyes, Just like watching the film’ blade runner’ on a giant 3D screen — without those fancy flying cars, of course — I was greeted by a cinematic hustle and bustle street market. Trains were zipping through the elevated railway. Colourful billboards and signs flickered both Hiragana and English words. The sea of people poured out of the station exit, dotting laneways and shops. Gentle sun and chilled breezes as the clouds gently revealed pale blue sky. Ameya Yokocho is an open-air market running parallel beneath the JR railways. This is the market where food stalls selling grilled oysters next to a shop selling discounted Onitsuka Tiger sneakers. A Japanese speaking middle eastern man at the charcoal chicken shop raised his voice to get attention from customers. Some tourists were seen sitting on the low plastic stools, waiting patiently. Smokes from the kebab truck were dancing in the air. A lady was calling out ‘Grilled seafood!’ as she was waving out a laminated menu on her hand. This is the new era of multicultural Japan. I strolled along the laneway, letting myself drifted in the crowds. Ameya Yokocho is a market that makes you feel never left alone. But when night fell, Tokyo was seductive. Its jazziness entertained me. It charmed me with its colourful lights and modernism, sophisticated culture, yet unpretentiously made me lonely and discontent. Loneliness is, indeed, Tokyo’s big enemy. When I thought I fell in love with the lights of Shinjuku, I was also left alone and lost in the sea of people; young lovers, hard-working husbands, single career women, office workers, confused tourists, and assertive immigrant pimps approaching me with the promise of resort pleasures. Fancy bars and Izakaya, Michelin star restaurants recommended by travel guide books and TV shows seem to be inviting, and a must-visit while in Tokyo. After spending the night trying to find the fancy restaurant recommended by the travel guide book somewhere in Nishi Shinjuku, I stopped right in the front of the restaurant. Some expats walked in, I heard laughers broke, then followed by a small group of Japanese men in dark business suits, and then a young couple walked out the doorway hand in hand. From outside, I caught a glimpse of the interior designer restaurant. I was looking down on my own feet, shivering. That moment I was feeling so lonely, all by myself. Loud music was racing with illuminating lights in the neighbourhood Yasukuni Dori. I just kept walking, bearing the cold. Suddenly, there was a dimmed neon-lit sign ‘Ramen’ in Hiragana. The shop had a dark green wall. I saw people walk in and out, but what attracted me was they were all alone. There was only a tiny doorway, and someone always either walked in or out. None of them came with a friend, colleagues, partner, or family. I was intrigued, so I didn’t think twice to walk in. And here I was, under the neon-lit front room. The staff greeted me and suggested me to order the food from the touch screen in the corner of the room. I was walking through the dark corridor leading to the main restaurant. The room had dark wooden walls with large calligraphic posters on each wall. Each long table was attached to the wall, and small partitions separate between the table on each seat. I chose the chair just next to the corridor. There was a little curtain in front of me, and suddenly it was opened. It only revealed a darkroom through the window. I could hear someone greet me in Japanese, and said something. I assumed he asked me to give him an order card from the touch screen, and I did, but he gave the card back to me, said different expression. I was confused. All of a sudden, I heard a girl quietly whisper behind the partition on my right.
‘He said you gave him the wrong card.’
I turned around, trying to find out where the source of the voice was. From the partition, I could only see the pink cat ears. A girl, probably early twenties, slowly raised her head, revealing her dark eyes, wearing the cat ears on her head — those of Halloween costume accessories.
‘You dropped your card back in the corridor,’ She whispered, handing out my card through the partition. I thanked her. She landed me a smile, then her eyes were back drawn to the mobile.
‘Did you come here by yourself?’ I asked quietly.
‘Everyone here comes alone. This is the ramen shop for a loner,’ She replied. I heard her giggle. Our curtains opened at the same time. Right from the dark window, two mysterious hands were handing out a bowl of ramen, followed by a ‘thank you’ and ‘enjoy the meal’ in Japanese. In front of me, there was a bowl of smoking ramen. I spooned the light brown broth and slurped the noodles just like local. It was warm through and through my throat. The cold night suddenly wrapped me with warmth and comfort. It was my first ramen in Tokyo, and it was ramen for a loner."
Medium.com,Life,My Booze-Soaked Hunt for Rattlesnake Tequila,Travel,https://humanparts.medium.com/chasing-the-snake-a-memoir-22df39007c45?source=topic_page---------430------------------1," “The usual hero adventure begins with someone who feels there is something lacking in the normal experience available or permitted to the members of society. The person then takes off on a series of adventures beyond the ordinary… to discover some life-giving elixir.” — Joseph Campbell “Are you crazy!? You want to go to Tijuana without me?” My wife stared at me in amazement. “On our anniversary?” I knew I needed to work fast in order to deflect Cheri’s less-than-positive reaction to the suggestion we celebrate our wedded bliss in separate countries. So I did what husbands have done since time immemorial: I blamed a friend. “It was Carlos’s idea.” Carlos had always been that special kind of friend: loyal, fun, and quick to pick up the check or have your back. Hispanic by heritage and wild by nature, he had an unbridled Hemingway-like passion for life. The tall tales of his adventures usually began with: “I was drunk and surrounded by beautiful women…” All of this made him the perfect fall guy to take the blame for my wife’s anger over my own potential misbehavior. I quickly launched into a plausible explanation. Carlos, who worked as a photographer for a large airline, was being sent down to San Diego for a quick photo shoot of a new plane. He had asked me to come along for free as his “assistant.” Once the photos had been taken, we would wander across the border to spend the evening in Tijuana. The whole concept of this elusive potion was tied to my own wanderlust dreams of life south of the border. My wife wasn’t buying it. She knew there was more to the story. “I don’t understand. What are you two going to do in Tijuana overnight besides get into trouble? You can get drunk and eat Mexican food right here in San Francisco.” She knows me well. I was forced to sheepishly confess our real plan. “We’re going to try and find the snake drink.” The snake drink. Tequila con cascabel. Tequila with rattlesnake venom. You can keep your mezcal with a worm in the bottle but that’s for tourists. I feel the same way about absinthe, moonshine, and your great-grandpa’s home brew. All of those “dangerous” drinks can be served to your sweet aunt and her church club social group. But the only drink that truly crosses the line of all that is good and holy can be found exclusively south of the border, where bone-dry winds burn the skin and desert heat scorches the soul. That is, if it can be found at all. This will-o-the-wisp beverage is known to many and tasted by few. Stories of it are told during bouts of late-night drinking and at bachelor parties, but no one will claim to have actually tried it. Occasionally a men’s magazine looking for page filler will run a blurb about the legend but offer no clue as to where it can be found. One thing’s for certain: you’re not going to see it on the shelves at BevMo or Walmart. The recipe for this bizarre cocktail is actually pretty simple. When a good-sized rattler is found threatening hearth and home, it’s captured and placed in a large jar or vat of tequila. The creature promptly expires, releasing its venom into the surrounding liquid. The jar is then left in the sunshine for a few days to marinate. When the tequila is properly saturated with sun and snake, it is deemed ready for drinking. The stories and claims surrounding this strange brew are many. Supposedly it cures all manner of pains and ills and adds years to one’s life span. Some say imbibing causes visions of God. One legend even claims the venom causes a sharp rise in the male libido and a surge in virility. In other words, erectile dysfunction is cured by a reptile infusion. Or so it is said. For me, however, there was a different lure. The whole concept of this elusive potion was tied to my own wanderlust dreams of life south of the border. Here was the Mexico of my fantasies: the heartbreak of Fuentes’ Old Gringo swirled together with the mysticism of Castaneda flying over the desert, high on peyote. Add in too many late nights spent watching Bogie in The Treasure of the Sierra Madre and you have the makings of a quest. I found myself plotting to somehow, someway, find this boozy treasure at the end of the rainbow. When I shared my thoughts with my wild-man friend, Carlos, he of course grabbed the ball and ran with it. “Hell yes!” he said. “We have to find this stuff!” So when Carlos got this work assignment in San Diego, it was our golden opportunity. We told ourselves that somewhere among the scores of Tijuana’s bars, one would surely have a bottle on its shelf filled with a dead rattlesnake. The plan, as I told my wife, was for me to accompany Carlos on his photo assignment, and then we’d head south to search for the mysterious beverage. Unfortunately, Carlos’s job assignment just happened to coincide with our wedding anniversary. As a result, like many great adventurers, I needed my wife’s permission to go. At the conclusion of my breathless explanation, Cheri couldn’t contain herself. Her feigned outrage gave way to a burst of laughter. “Really? That’s why you’re going to spend the night in Tijuana instead of taking me to dinner? To drink some crap that will probably make you sicker than a dog?” She shook her head in wonderment at my idiocy. “You know you and Carlos are both crazy, don’t you?” I admitted that this might be the case. “Are you really mad? Because if you don’t want me to go…” She laughed again and gave me that look of indulgence reserved for brainless husbands and small children. It was likely the same look Daniel Boone’s wife gave her husband when he told her he was setting out into the wilderness. “No. It’s fine. You go ahead. I have a ton of paperwork to get through anyway. We can celebrate on the weekend.” Her face grew stern. “Just don’t get hurt or arrested.” I promised I would do neither. And so, a few days later, I got settled into the cushy first-class seat of a jumbo jet heading south to drink the embalming fluid of a dead viper. Once we were in San Diego, it didn’t take Carlos long to take the required photos. By mid-afternoon, we were at the rental car office ready to start our journey. There was only one small problem. “I was hoping we could get a Caddy. Maybe a convertible,” Carlos said sadly, looking at the SUV I had just signed for (without mentioning that we’d be crossing the border). “We should be traveling in style for a mission like this,” he insisted. It was all they had but that didn’t seem to matter to Carlos. “I always drive a Caddy in Mexico,” he said, mostly to himself. Despite his disappointment in our ride, we climbed into the vehicle and headed for the border. I knew he would brighten up once we crossed into “TJ,” as the local boys call it. Tijuana has always been southern California’s source of secret sin. For more than a century, Americans have wandered across the river to find temptations not available at home. Soldiers and sailors wanting sex, underage high school kids looking for booze, and Hollywood superstars needing an illegal high have all made their way into the shadows of this border town. These days, Tijuana has followed Las Vegas’s example in hiding its more obvious guilty pleasures in hopes that taco stands and burros painted like zebras will somehow attract families from Cleveland on vacation. As a result, the main thoroughfare of Avenida Revolución now offers a glitzy, mall-like atmosphere guaranteed to appear safe and familiar to visiting gringos. However, the side streets still offer some of old Tijuana for those who might want it. And that’s where Carlos and I headed. We parked the behemoth SUV and started out on foot. Our path took us steadily around the edges of town. As the evening arrived and then wore on, we pushed through crowds of hustlers offering discount coupons, cheap cigarettes, and companionship. We hit every bar along the way, stopping in at strip clubs, sports bars, dance halls, and each hole-in-the-wall cantina we passed. By the time the clock moved into the next day, we were hammered. Knowing our search would be a marathon, not a sprint, we tried to pace our alcohol consumption. We started out by drinking in every other bar. That didn’t last. Then, we said, we would limit ourselves to one drink per bar. That didn’t work, either. For a while, we only drank beer. It didn’t matter. By the time the clock had moved into the next day, we were hammered. We had spent a small fortune, talked to several dozen drunks, reached a legally unacceptable level of intoxication, and still had not seen a single rattlesnake in a jar. Heavy tips to bartenders who claimed to be in the know only resulted in vague directions to places with names nobody could remember. Foot sore and disheartened, in the early hours of the next day, we finally found ourselves in front of a dark and worn shop exterior. A buzzing neon sign flashed B-A-R over the door. Carlos and I turned to each other. “One more?” he asked. “Okay,” I said. “But this is the last one.” We pushed open the door. Inside, a U-shaped bar jutted out from the wall, and a smattering of short wooden tables and straight-backed chairs filled the remainder of the room. While the space was unremarkable, the clientele was something different. More than a few of the men were dressed in the full caballero outfits of a Mexican cowboy. They wore short black jackets over white linen shirts. The tight pants (tighter around some aging bellies than others) were festooned with silver buttons running up and down the legs. Formal dress sombreros sparkling with silver or gold thread rested on their heads, the bar, and on hooks along the wall. Nearby, guitars and horns were carefully balanced in the corners of the room. The female customers also wore a uniform, but of a different type. Every one of them sported heavy makeup and dressy, spiked high-heels. Regardless of age or size, of which there was great variance, the ladies wore minuscule dresses or booty shorts made of the flashiest of colors and the cheapest material. Costume jewelry dripping with rhinestones hung from their ears, necks, and wrists. We quickly realized that this bar was a locals hideaway. It was a refuge for the boys who played Guantanamera to tourist families as well as for the girls who sold 30 minutes of pretend love to American businessmen in cheap motel rooms. Hidden only a short distance away from the action on the main drag, the bar allowed mariachis and sex workers to take a break, grab a cold drink, and rest their feet for a moment before returning to a long night of work. When Carlos and I burst in from the street, everyone turned to see who the interlopers might be. Carlos met every stare with a broad grin as he spread his arms wide and loudly exclaimed, “Viva México!” Someone laughed, and the chill dissipated quickly as people returned to their conversations. I followed Carlos as he pushed through the crowd and claimed a space for us at the bar. The bartender was a young guy, much younger than us. He wore a Dodgers t-shirt and spoke English with a southern California drawl. “Welcome gentlemen. What can I get for you?” We ordered Pacificos and shots of Herradura añejo. A tired-looking woman joined us as we waited for our drinks. I guessed her to be in her early thirties. Her shoulder-length hair was a brassy blonde (except for the roots), and her short dress — which seemed more like body paint than attire — was a blood red that matched her nail polish. She pushed herself between and against Carlos and me, firing rapid Spanish in my direction. I looked at my friend for help. Carlos grinned wickedly. “She says her name is Veronika and she is not from around here. She says she is 18, from Venezuela, and she can rock your world.” Carlos gave a soft chuckle. “I bet she could,” he added. Veronika from Venezuela had been waiting patiently as Carlos translated. She looked at me expectantly. As I smiled at her, I spoke to my friend. “Tell her I am very tempted by her wonderful offer but that I think she should look for someone a bit younger than me.” “You know she’s not really 18, right?” Carlos said helpfully. “Yeah, I know. Just tell her.” As Carlos explained the situation to our new friend, I heard him say “viejo” (which means “old”) several times. Veronika was not to be deterred. She laid her head on my shoulder and began to rub my chest. “Viejo es mejor,” she purred into the hollow of my neck. “Old is better.” Over her head, I gave the bartender a pleading look. He quickly leaned across the bar and said something to the girl who was now trying to climb into my lap. She snapped back at him and after a few angry exchanges, she pulled herself off of me and began to walk away. She stopped for a moment to smile at Carlos and say something quietly to him before moving off into the crowd. “So?” I asked when she was gone. He started to chuckle. “She said if I got you to change your mind, she would do me for free after you passed out.” Before I could protest Veronika’s evaluation of my potential stamina, the bartender interrupted us. “Sorry about that, guys.” “No worries,” I assured him. Before he could move away, I had to ask, “Is there any chance you have tequila con cascabel, or know where to get some?” The kid gave me a blank look. “Tequila what?” he asked. “Tequila in a rattle?” He looked very confused. “Tequila with a rattle, I mean with a rattlesnake,” I corrected him. “It’s tequila with snake venom.” Our young bartender looked like he thought I might be a problem. “Uh, no, we don’t have anything like that,” he said inching his way down the bar from us. He seemed to want to get as far away from the crazy guy as possible. “You will not find it here.” An elderly mariachi sitting nearby at the bar leaned in to talk. His thin hair was snow white, and his brown face was creased like leather. “There are no rattlesnakes left in Tijuana. Too many people for snakes to live,” he said, with perfect logic. “You need to get away from the city. Go down south. Maybe near Puerto Nuevo or past Ensenada.” He lowered his voice. “Besides,” he whispered conspiratorially, “no one around here cares about the old ways. No one believes in the magic anymore.” He settled back on his stool. “You need to go out in the country,” he told us with finality. We bought the old guy a drink to thank him for his advice. In fact, we bought him two. And we bought ourselves a few, as well. Then we bought some more. The crowd around us swelled. Strangers became, at least for the next few hours, life-long pals. Toasts were made to Mexico, America, our mothers, missing friends, and each other. At some point, I vaguely recall Carlos standing in the center of the bar waving his arms to conduct a bizarre musical revue. On his left were a few barely-able-to-stand mariachis playing a brassy, slightly out-of-tune version of “Hotel California.” On his right, Veronika and half a dozen other drunken prostitutes sat on the top of the bar singing along in enthusiastic if indecipherable Spanglish. The Eagles would have been so proud. Eventually, the party wound down. The mariachis headed home to get some sleep before starting their day jobs. The ladies went back into the streets hoping to catch a tourist with enough cash still in his pockets for a quickie. Carlos and I decided it was time to move on. We walked back to the rented SUV to nap in the big seats for a couple of hours before the pre-dawn half light found us racing further south down the highway. Somewhere between Tijuana and Ensenada, we saw a turnoff marked by a large wooden sign with faded paint proclaiming our arrival at Puerto Nuevo — “The Lobster Capital of Mexico.” As the sun peeked over the hills to the east, we turned down the narrow road towards the ocean. The SUV was enveloped by a dusty cloud of sun-baked dirt as we maneuvered between potholes only slightly smaller than our vehicle. The lobster capital of all of Mexico turned out to be a collection of small concrete buildings painted in bright colors and perched on a cliff overlooking the sheltered bay where the California spiny lobster thrived. We parked our car in front of a restaurant promising “see-side dining” and went in. A middle-aged, heavyset waiter who appeared no more awake than we were led us through the still-dark restaurant to a large deck filled with tables and chairs. He sat us at the edge of the platform where we could look out over the Pacific Ocean, which was just beginning to reflect the rising sun. “Dos margaritas,” the sleepy waiter said. It wasn’t a question as much as a statement of the obvious. We nodded our agreement. We also ordered grilled lobster, rice, beans, and two of the Cuban cigars we had seen in a glass case as we walked through the main dining room. Carlos and I leaned back in our large, leather-bound captain chairs and watched the sunrise in silence. When our waiter returned with our food, Carlos gave it one more try. “Hay tequila con cascabel?” The waiter gave us a look of surprise that quickly melted into a sad smile. “No, amigo. We do not have such a thing. But I have Mezcal with a scorpion.” Carlos tried again. “Do you know where we might find it?” The elderly Mexican thoughtfully pulled at a graying mustache for a minute. He looked off into the distant hills that lined the bay. “Allí afuera,” he said, pointing to the horizon. “Out there.” In that moment it suddenly all became very clear: Whatever the treasure you seek, it is always out there. “Time to head home,” I said to Carlos after our waiter shuffled away. He nodded in agreement, his eyes heavy with booze and lack of sleep. “Yes, it is,” he said. Maybe this was all for nothing, and we had come too late. Maybe we had missed the magic that was Mexico. I leaned against the rounded leather back of my chair, inhaling the sweet aroma of the Cohiba’s smoke as it mixed with the salty smell of the ocean below. I took a final bite of lobster and washed it down with a shot of the añejo tequila that had followed our margaritas. Below, the deep blue of the Pacific was beginning to glow, turning a lighter color at the edges of the shoreline as the sun moved higher in the sky. I watched a flock of pelicans drop and skim the water’s rolling surface in an easy glide. From the street outside, the laughter of children drifted in. Maybe the old mariachi had been right. Maybe this was all for nothing, and we had come too late. Maybe we had missed the magic that was Mexico. But somehow, I didn’t think so."

The speed of a Transatlantic jet, however, averages anywhere between 500 and 600 miles per hour. While these may not be the most equivocal of ways to get from point A to point B, it does illustrate just how slow walking really is in our modern age. Edward Abbey, from his writings in The Journey Home, says that “walking takes longer than any other known form of locomotion except crawling.” It begs the question as to why anyone would ever choose to walk. In this deadline-oriented, ever-increase-your-productivity-driven society we’re laced up into, wouldn’t it make sense to just take the fast way? Abbey elaborates on a vital fact about what walking does: “it stretches time and prolongs life. Life is already too short to waste on speed. . .Walking makes the world much bigger, and therefore more interesting. You have time to observe the details.” And the details really are where the magic happens. There is something so spell-bindingly magical when you let life find you, and not the other way around. Letting life find you in travel is one of the quickest ways to experience new things, meet new people, and expand your world-view. And the best way to do it is to simply slow down. Take a walk, and don’t have a place to be. La Rambla is an iconic street in the city of Barcelona, cutting through one of many spectacular neighborhoods nested and woven together in endless patterns. To describe La Rambla in the essence of Whitman: its wide avenue, lined down the middle with aged trees and endless cafe seating, its markets, its shops, the touristy pop-up stands, its endless scores of people milling back and forth, absorbing it all with their smartphones and digital cameras, Catalan locals loitering, selling and serving, the noise of a thousand people laughing and talking, eating and shopping, the gorgeous, omnipotent undercurrent of rich and storied histories rushing beneath every cobblestone and brick. It’s an incredible place to get lost. My wife and I, while ambling aimlessly through Barri Gótic — the Gothic Quarter, noticed dozens of travelers sitting under blue umbrellas in the middle of La Rambla drinking fruited sangria out of gigantic pitchers. We promptly decided that was exactly how we wanted to spend our evening, too. After we got our impossibly huge drinks, we struck up a conversation with a group of four ladies who had decided to do the same thing as us, plus dinner. Our conversation quickly turned to talking about our travel plans: my wife and I still in Barcelona for another week then maybe Valencia the next, and their group — well, they were to sleep the night in Barcelona after a late afternoon arrival from Belgium, Paris before that, prior to that somewhere else. The next day was to be a 5am flight as they carried on to three more places before they flew back home. The total length of their trip, we found out after asking, was less than two weeks. They had no problem detailing how exhausted they were, how blurry every moment had been, and how they couldn’t wait for it to be over, but couldn’t remember where they had been before Paris. At least they were enjoying their 25 euro pitcher of sangria."
Medium.com,Life,The Peace Park,Travel,https://psiloveyou.xyz/the-peace-park-504972e212bd?source=topic_page---------433------------------1," The sky was perfectly blue — it looked as if it was a painting. The sun was shining, too. It was a beautiful day as we stepped off the train and into the city of Hiroshima. We were in Japan for two weeks, and, given the history nerds that we are, it somehow seemed wrong not to visit the city — as it remains to be a pivotal part of world history. I’m not sure what I was expecting. You read about things in history books, and while intellectually, you can understand the horror of certain world events, the glossy pages somehow distance you from the magnitude of what they meant. Its as if your heart doesn’t quite fully grasp what your head is reading. And it often doesn’t. But when you go to places that hold the pain of the past, your heart immediately catches up. It was a beautiful day in Hiroshima. The sun, the sky, the vibrancy of the water, the bustling crowd of people — it was truly spectacular. We got off the train and made our way over to The Peace Memorial Park. That’s what it’s called, you know. The area around the A-Bomb Dome, one of the few buildings to remain standing after the A-Bomb exploded in Hiroshima is called the Peace Memorial Park. There are sculptures, and there is a cenotaph. There is a pool of water, and there is a museum — all dedicated to preserving peace. Peace. Peace is present and palpable in a city that was ravaged by flame, and horror, and heartache, and hardship for generations to come. Peace. Hiroshima is the site of one of the worst atrocities that humankind has committed to one another, and yet, the whole place celebrates peace. There could be anger. There could be resentment and hostility, and more violence on top of anger. And maybe there is some of that, after all these years. But what far outshines anything else, is peace and hope. Hope for a world where don’t hurt one another. Hope for a world where we help one another. Hope for a time where different cultures and customs can co-exist in peace and harmony, and even learn from one another. The call for peace is both humbling and overwhelming. It puts things into perspective, too. It asks you to let go of whatever anger you are hanging onto, no matter how large or small the flame of your rage feels. It reminds us that even after the darkest of times, even when there seems as if there’s no hope — peace is always possible if you reach for it."

Medium.com,Life,Remote Year Is Not Safe for Women of Color,Travel,https://zora.medium.com/remote-year-is-not-safe-for-women-of-color-18f74f5016e0?source=topic_page---------436------------------1," efore I made the decision to join Remote Year this summer, I spoke to other Black people and I read about their experiences in the program. Remote Year, I was told, was making some perfunctory efforts to be more inclusive, but I shouldn’t hold my breath. The message from each person of color I spoke to was clear: These folks don’t care about you. You’re coming for the travel and the professional network. Period. And so, with open eyes, I saved my coins and spent my money on a four-month, work and travel experience around the world. In the first day of orientation, we were told that we were “tramily” (travel+family), that the group would really make the trip, and that if we just followed our group norms we would learn and grow together as we traveled the world. As one of only two Black people in a group of 21, I looked around the room and wondered about that. An hour later, a circle of white girls on the trip talked excitedly about our upcoming time in Croatia, Portugal, and Spain and wondered out loud about our last destination: “Aren’t you terrified of South Africa though?” Immediately and pointedly, I asked, “Why would you be terrified?” Three pairs of doe-eyes stared back at me. “Because of all the crime,” they said. There were no mentions of crime in Europe, which has frequent and consistent issues with tourists being pickpocketed and raped (including while we were on our trip.) I would go on to have conversations in which my fellow Remotes, as we are called, defended their votes for President Donald Trump, their unwavering belief in the NRA, despite several shootings happening on our trip, and oh yes, their use of the n-word while rapping. None of this actually surprised me. Thanks to the Remotes of color who’d come before me, I was ready. Remote Year was an organization helmed mostly by white, affluent men. It had no desire to make its program more inclusive for people of color. Not when it rolled out a haphazard diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) effort that required the black, brown, queer, and disabled Remotes to take the lead in encouraging their less than enthusiastic travel mates to give a damn. Not when it allowed people to malign whole continents without giving any concern for the ways those statements might make people of color in their “tramily” feel. Not when, on an introductory webinar, Remote Year’s national staff told future Remotes that making fun of other people’s accents might be harmless joking and not something offensive. I was prepared for the many ways Remote Year didn’t care if I felt uncomfortable. However, I was not prepared for the many ways that Remote Year didn’t care if I felt unsafe. A couple of months into our program, it was clear that something was rotten in the state of “tramily.” One of the men in our group was causing a stir, acting erratically. He began harassing women, using aggressive and angry language, only to immediately claim he had no clue what people were so upset about. He was stalking people, threatening them, and generally sowing discord within our group. His targets were almost exclusively women of color. His allies were the other white men, many of the white women, and some of the people of color in our group. They were his shield. According to him, he was a good guy, an honest guy, a direct guy, as evidenced by the circle of people who defended him. The women who had legitimate claims of fear and intimidation were labeled by him and others as crazy, shrewish gossips. Throughout this process, Remote Year was silent. I once sent a screenshot of an aggressive message from him to our program leader, who basically gaslit me and sided with him. Other people cited concerns only to be dismissed. It was not until his actions rose to a level that might spell trouble for them legally that Remote Year acted. And even then, they did so without public condemnation of his actions, without an acknowledgment of the ways in which his behavior (and that of his friends) violated our community norms, and without public support for the women he’d harmed. When he was kicked out, he sent a vitriolic message to our group claiming he had no idea why he was being asked to leave. It wasn’t until five days later that Remote Year even acknowledged that they had kicked him out at all. And this was done only after numerous emails from women in the program, including me. In the intervening time, his friends in the group circled up around him, patted him on the back, and generally made light of the serious claims that led to his dismissal. I learned from other women in previous groups that this had happened before. Ours was not the first time Remote Year let a predator harass and threaten women without reprisal. Above all else, it was Remote Year’s silence that assured me I was unsafe. Companies like Remote Year have a responsibility to their patrons, the women who have trusted them to provide what their website deems a “hassle-free” travel experience. Remotes shouldn’t have to worry about being alone in a strange land because they have “tramily.” But when that supposed travel family are the predators and the aggressors, the promise of Remote Year falls apart. When men can violate women under the silent protection of a company that is supposed to ensure those women peace of mind, something is wrong. In a #MeToo world we can no longer claim neutrality as a virtue. Those who are silent as predators like Brett Kavanaugh, R. Kelly, and Brock Turner are complicit in their actions. Silence emboldens these men to harm others and to yell in the faces of women who would dare to challenge them publicly. Being able to access a program like Remote Year is an immense privilege. But having that privilege does not mean you do not deserve protection. Every last one of us deserves organizations that believe women. We need companies that defy rape and intimidation culture by boldly defending and uplifting their women patrons. We need to spend our travel dollars where they will be used to create positive, affirming spaces and not ones in which we are terrified. We need better options than Remote Year."
Medium.com,Life,The Eco-Friendly Way to Attend a Conference,Travel,https://medium.com/@tassia.aga/the-eco-friendly-way-to-attend-a-conference-2b8d04bdb44c?source=topic_page---------437------------------1," As a marketing professional who promotes a lot of conferences, training courses, and trade shows throughout the year, as much as I feel awful about it, I have to travel. I’m actually quite lucky that I work for a company that is working to reduce its carbon footprint and implement more sustainability policies. For example, our management is encouraging those who have to travel to events to take less carbon-heavy travel alternatives to flight, like taking the train or ferry. However, not every company is as environmentally conscious, so it’s up to you to make your own changes to the way you attend events to help reduce your contribution to the climate crisis. Here are some more sustainable choices that you can make the next time you attend an event: Instead of travelling by taxi, try walking, getting a train or a bus to the conference venue. The website of the event venue will have useful information about public transport links. It might not be as stylish or make you feel as important as an Uber, but you can feel a bit better that you’re adding one less car’s emissions to the air we breathe. They’re not just for hippie teens or gym bunnies anymore! Naturally, it’s important to stay hydrated at an event, but instead of purchasing water in plastic bottles, bring your own from the office or home. Most venues will have refill stations or a bar where you can ask for tap water. Plus, if your company has its own branded bottles, you can do a little bit of advertising for them with every sip. If you have to stay at a hotel while you’re attending an event, please please please make sure that you turn off the lights and other appliances when you’re not in the room. It’s a laughably small action, but if everyone did it, it would make a huge difference and would cut down on vast amounts of energy being wasted. Leafleting is leading to a huge waste problem around the world, to the point where some governments have had to implement restrictions. While at an event, it can be tempting to just grab all of the leaflets and brochures that you see, then tell yourself that you’ll read through them later to see which ones are suitable for you and your company. Spoiler alert: you won’t. Instead, actually talk to exhibitors about their services, to save throwing away brochures and leaflets that might not be of interest to you and your organisation. At the end of the event, simply return your lanyard or badge to the event organisers so that they can re-use them for future events. You have absolutely no reason to take it back with you, and it’ll only end up in the landfill when you throw it away. Most events have bins where you can leave lanyards, so they can collect them easily. Honestly, at this point, who still gets takeaway coffee in a disposable cup? There are so many options for travel mugs, so there’s not really an excuse for using a disposable cup. Do the world (and yourself) a favour and get a travel mug! If you’re just going to watch the presentations and not to actually network, then ask the event organisers if they’ll be live streaming the talks. It’ll save you and your business money on your travel expenses, free up more time for you, plus you can watch the presentations from the comfort of your home or office."
Medium.com,Life,Sailing Away.,Travel,https://medium.com/requiem-for-ink/sailing-away-6f55f58dc575?source=topic_page---------438------------------1," T
here are people in this world who still know the art of curving a sail exactly so to catch the wind and pull a boat across the water. I’m not one of them, but I’m lucky enough to know a few who are. One fine week in late summer we went sailing. The plan was to circumnavigate Isle Royale, in the far northern waters of Lake Superior. It’s big and it’s remote, a 45-mile-long island surrounded by 450 smaller bits of land and wave-splashed rock that could easily sink the unwary sailor. Together they make up Isle Royale National Park. It’s not as famous as a park like Yellowstone or Yosemite. It’s relative obscurity is a selling point if you’re intrigued by the feeling of having an entire national park to yourself. The only way to arrive is to cross the deep, cold waters of Lake Superior by boat or float plane. I began the trip as mentally drained as I’ve ever felt. Work had been too busy for too long — we writers are stupid about not turning down good projects, even when they arrive at a machinegun pace. Worse, I’d been overconsuming the news. Maybe I’m more patriotic than I knew. I see the country pitching itself into a dark and leaderless void, and can’t stop obsessing. It’s exhausting to watch each dizzying news cycle augur us deeper into the hole, like a daily marathon. I needed an intervention, maybe something in twelve steps. Instead, I simply sailed away. Travel is supposed to be restorative. Being on a sailboat heightens the effect dramatically. The bars indicating service on our mobile devices gradually winked out as we put the Minnesota shoreline behind us. Soon everything glowed “No Service” and would stay that way the next seven days. Life is busy on a sailboat. Unlike the madly interruptive schedule of a day at work, the things you do while sailing all pertain to sailing. A sail fussed-with rewards us with half a knot of added speed. A rope coiled avoids tangles when it comes time to lower the sail. The day gets filled with things that are good and true. We all felt this on our first morning out as a cool breeze blew in from the big waters of Lake Superior carrying a simple message, “Raise the sail.” This is an exciting moment on a big boat. You instantly realize the power of the physics involved. For a few adrenaline-filled moments you are on Mother Nature’s dance card. Turn into the wind, so it doesn’t explode into the sails before you’re ready. Tug on the halyard. Keep pulling until the sail reaches the top of mast. Unfurl the Genoa, which is the oversized sail rigged to the front of the mast. Then fall away and let the wind fill the sails. The final step is the one I like best. Kill the engine that’s been powering us away from the harbor. The sudden silence fills your soul in the same way the wind is filling the sails. The only sound is the water moving past the hull. As an added benefit, the wind in the sails stabilizes the boat against the big swells that have been hitting just off the starboard bow and rolling the deck in a way that had me glad for the anti-seasickness patch stuck behind my ear. Our boat is a 36-foot sloop, built in 1983 by Canadian Sailcraft, and named the Escapade. It’s a luxury accommodation for the four of us aboard, with a galley, berths and comfortable salon below-deck. We’d forgotten most of the beer, but we had plenty of good wine and Scotch, rations of rum to keep up the old naval tradition of a full gill at mid-day, gin and a healthy cargo of limes to ward off scurvy, and enough food stowed away to sail halfway to the North Atlantic if we’d wanted. When it’s my turn at the helm I keep an eager eye on the compass just forward of the enormous wheel, determined to stay on course. We’re on a close-hauled point of sail, aimed almost straight into the wind. The sails are pulled in tight to the boat so they work like an airplane wing to power us forward. This means I also need to keep an eye on the weather vane at the top of the mast. If it aligns too directly with a pair of metal guide bars we are what sailors call “in the irons.” That means I’ve steered to close to the wind and the sails will lose all power. In the irons is where the waves want to push the boat, so I’m making constant small corrections. Isle Royale is a faint line on the horizon. Eventually I learn to stop overcorrecting, keep my eye on the point of land ahead and let the boat ride out the wave action. Go with the flow, as it were. The first of many lessons worth taking back at the end of the trip. Our approach to the western end of Isle Royal is a dog’s breakfast of shoals and old wrecks. We have charts spread across the cockpit, plotting a safe route in. Off the port side is a lonely quarter-acre-sized lump of rock topped by a lighthouse and surrounded by nothing but waves. The Rock of Ages lighthouse. A hundred years ago the massive lens was manned by a crew of five, who had to live year-round on a patch of rock no bigger than a suburban lot. Mercifully, the light is now automated and the rock inhabited only by seabirds. We thread past the shoals and rocky islands and sail deep into Washington Harbor, finally dropping anchor near the Windigo Visitor’s Center. Windigo’s main attraction is its substantial dock. Saturday morning we take the Escapade over and tie up for a day of exploration. For a few hours the place bustles with the energy of a backwoods crossroads. A ferry arrives and spills a couple dozen backpackers onto the dock. Float planes buzz in and out. The new arrivals are quickly absorbed into the wilderness. As are we, pointing ourselves down a long trail that skirts the water’s edge for a mile, then veers inward and upward toward the island’s higher ground. The forest grows denser. The shadows moving among the trees are moose. Three bulls. I’m astonished at just how big they are, and how frighteningly close to the trail. The spread of their antlers is so wide I wonder how they can fit between the trees. The moose regard us for a moment. Then one-by-one lumber deeper into the woods. We fill the next days with more of the same. Sliding in and out of secluded bays and looking for good hiking trails. Any sense of life in the fast lane was entirely dependent on wind speed. On one long run down the north side of the island we rode over swells big enough to feel like a roller coaster. The Escapade hit 8.2 knots, about a knot more than her hull speed should allow. Hull speed is a complicated calculation based on the amount of water the hull can physically displace as it moves through water — the likely explanation for the extra speed is we were surfing down the back side of the waves. Doing this on a 16,000 pound sailboat is a thrill ride. On a run back across the south side of the island I got another dose of adrenaline, this time like it was coming from a firehose. We had just found the wind and put out all our sails, when we were hit by a sudden squall. The sails were wildly overpowered. The boat heeled over abruptly. The weather helm fought to take control and push the bow into the wind. After working the Great Lakes for more than three decades, the boat had been through this before. Yours truly at the helm had not. My pulse rate responded accordingly. The fix is to reef in the sails. One of us attaches a life line to go forward and man the mainsail, the rest grab ropes to bring it in. I stick to the helm like glue, trying to keep the boat turned into the wind and the deck as stable as I can. We don’t want to add a man overboard drill to all the excitement. The front sail takes on a life of its own with the boat in the wind, flapping and cracking the deck like a bullwhip. Grab more ropes and pull it in as well. It’s a wild few minutes, even for the more experienced members of the crew. Then it’s over and we fall back into the wind. With the sails properly reefed the wind is once again our friend. By early afternoon the wind is gone, replaced by a thick bank of fog. Engine on, and I take over fog horn duty. It’s a long brass tube with a mouthpiece and braided red cord to wrap around my wrist (don’t want to lose it overboard). Take a deep breath and blow — and yikes it’s loud, our best impression of an ocean liner making way. I do my best to keep it pointed away from our ears. The protocol for a boat under motor power is one long blast every two minutes — my lungs get a workout. This would prove to the be the most intense day of the trip. When we drop anchor in pretty Hay Bay I drink one of our limited supply of beers and fall asleep on the foredeck. I woke to a Vaudeville act playing just off the bow of the Escapade. The water was smooth as glass. Then ploop — up popped a feathered head. Then ploop — another. Ploop-ploop-ploop. Pretty soon I was watching a flotilla of some 20 Merganser ducks. They’d paddle for a bit, then run madly across the surface of the water chasing one another. And suddenly, as if on cue, all dive in unison. Only to pop back up about 50 yards away and repeat the show. Feathered comedians. We have dinner above-deck as the last of the afternoon’s fog blows into the bay. It surrounds us in ghostly tendrils that catch the last rays of the setting sun and glow alternately gold, silver and rose. It’s as hauntingly beautiful as anything I’ve seen. One more day of sailing and we were back where our trip around Isle Royale began, in the mouth of Washington Harbor. On our final morning we were full of optimism as we raised the sail for the trip back to Minnesota. The wind blowing out the northwest was exactly right for the crossing. Once we put the Rock of Ages lighthouse behind us there would be nothing but deep water and a fair wind ahead. Then about three miles out a bat flapped out of the rigging. Like some dark portent out of an old pirate’s tale it circled the mast a few times. Then started the long journey back towards Isle Royale. A half-hour later our perfect wind began gasping for breath. Six knots became five, then three. The expected arrival time shown on the boat’s NAV went from eight hours to fourteen. Then the wind died altogether. We were becalmed. The only option was to start the engine. Even with zero wind there was a subtle roiling motion on the surface of the lake. It looked like surreal pools of liquid mercury, extending all the way to meet an impressive bank of thunderheads stacked up behind us on the horizon. If Salvador Dali had painted a seascape of Lake Superior, it would have looked like this. We busied ourselves on the long crossing with stowing, cleaning, knot-tying school, watching the bars of service reappear on our mobiles. Over seven days we had seen seven moose. A pair of eagles soaring majestically along the sheer face of a cliff. The flotilla of Mergansers. A tree nearly three feet in diameter that had been felled by an industrious beaver. It was on a high hillside, nowhere near water. I think he took it down just to show he could. We had seen exactly one other sailboat and a small assortment of fishing vessels. All told, maybe enough human beings to fill a high school classroom. The thing that stays with me still is the feeling of being connected with the living planet, carried forward by its ancient movements of wind and water. I returned to port no longer the same world-weary person that had sailed away."

Medium.com,Life,El Fénix is Montevideo’s Coolest Retro Hangout (Because It Feels Like Your Friend’s House in 1989),Travel,https://medium.com/@agchazaro/el-f%C3%A9nix-is-montevideos-coolest-retro-hangout-because-it-feels-like-your-friend-s-house-in-1989-57a29791f5ec?source=topic_page---------440------------------1," The fact that Uruguay is the smallest Spanish-speaking country in South America doesn’t stop its people from doing cool shit, like inventing time machines. For example, in Montevideo — where 50% of the entire country’s population resides — you can find a time capsule hidden on a dark, graffiti-covered corner in the Cuidad Vieja neighborhood. It’s not a DeLorean from Back to the Future, though it’s an equally time-warping experience that you can’t find anywhere else in the country: a restaurant that serves local food and drinks with the accompaniment of an arcade, a life-sized E.T. sitting at the bar, Darth Vader’s helmet, a Nintendo 64, a jukebox with 80s and 90s music, comic books, toys, mom’s recipes, and other quirky relics from previous eras — all from the owner’s childhood. Federico is an Uruguayan native who moved to New Jersey as a boy, growing up like any American kid from the late-80s through the 2000s — addicted to Playstation, trading cards, and Star Wars. After studying Restaurant Management at a community college, he returned back to his home country, carrying big dreams and a nostalgic hunger for the past. Today, Federico runs El Fénix — located on the edgy outskirts of Plaza Independencia — which originally opened in 2012, and which he bought in 2015. “I used to live in the apartment upstairs, until one day it was going out of business, so I just decided to buy it,” he explained to me over Fernet and coke (a national cocktail favorite). The joint used to be a punk rock hangout with an unwelcoming environment. He wanted to change that and decided to rebrand the restaurant in a way that locals and tourists alike could come to and feel the comforts of childhood and home cooking. “I wanted to do something different to create community. In Uruguay we are respectful and humble, and I wanted to bring that here by providing a space where everyone comes together to hang out, eat, and play games. I wanted to make it like everyone’s home. I even use my mom’s recipe for the pizza dough. You should try it.” The restaurant catches your attention with Super Mario Bros-inspired signage outside promoting cheap drinks. After walking in, you see an old school coin-operated Tekken 2 arcade. You sit at the bar, decorated with VHS tapes of classics like Home Alone, then order drinks and food to keep you feeling fuzzy for the rest of the night. It’s a win-win for any millennial, and an unexpected gem in an otherwise sketchy part of the city. This sort of offering may not seem like much to the average U.S. citizen living in a bustling area, but to find a spot like this in one of the southern-most countries of the world, so far from the usual comforts and aesthetics you’d find at home, makes El Fénix more of a sanctuary than an ordinary restaurant. As the name suggests, it resurrects the aesthetics and pleasures from a long-ago buried time in our lives, when having fun and hanging out at a friend’s house playing video games and eating pizza was what you did. It’s a simple but necessary concept, and one that I’ve rarely found done authentically. “All the toys you see are actually what I used to play with. My mom sent me a box from our house and I just used them to decorate,” Federico told me, pointing out limited-release Batman and X-Men action figures next to our table. On the other side of the small downstairs space, a collage of Spanish-edition DC Comics are plastered along the wall. It all feels charmingly haphazard in a very Latin American way, while maintaining an authentic Americana vibe, giving it a unique feeling that I didn’t find elsewhere — the best of both worlds. While there, you can order a delicious chivito — Uruguay’s national sandwich, which is “a slice of juicy beef, some bacon, ham, cheese, sauce, tomatoes, mayonnaise, olives, I don’t know why, and a fried egg” — while Alanis Morrisette or Nirvana grooves in the background, as you’re surrounded by a diverse crowd of laughing regulars. In all, Uruguay was full of small surprises — like a hidden track on an album you’ve recently discovered — but none was more welcome than a restaurant that feels like your 12th birthday party in a foreign country. El Fénix is indeed a rebirth of everything that we leave behind in our lives as adolescents in order to remix a better future, and it tastes like the best pizza and chivitos your friend’s mom can make."

There were no smartphones nor free roaming. I’d booked my flight online using a student-oriented travel agent and relied on a hostel website to tell me where to stay. Upon arriving in a new city, my friends and I prayed that the map in the guide book was still in date. At one point a lady walked off down a dark alleyway with our passports. Thankfully, she came back within 24 hours with our Laos visas. This was my first experience of backpacking and shoestring travel. Now with the proliferation of travel app-based businesses, my early experiences seem unimaginable in so many ways. How did I know where to go? How did I stay in touch with friends and family back home? How did I meet up with people? The answers to these questions were usually intuition, rarely, and with planning and/or pure luck."
Medium.com,Life,Traveling The World Has Taught Me These 4 Epic Lessons,Travel,https://psiloveyou.xyz/traveling-the-world-has-taught-me-these-4-epic-lessons-c32726f85b32?source=topic_page---------442------------------1," I’ve had a passport since I was 2 months old. So, in a lot of ways, a life of travel is all I’ve known. I’ve lived in 9 countries and visited 31. And just when I start to think I’ve seen all I can, I see something even more gut-wrenchingly beautiful. I feel incredibly lucky to have had the opportunity to travel from such a young age. Especially because it’s taught me to prioritize traveling over all else. Yes — I’m one of those Millenials who isn’t saving for a house, but instead for their next trip to a new place. A nomadic lifestyle is addicting, scary, relaxing and 18 million other emotions. For me, every trip I've taken has always felt very therapeutic. It’s an opportunity for me to remove myself for my everyday life and connect with something bigger than myself. I’ve been traveling the world my whole life and it’s taught me these 4 incredible things. You don’t. Vagabonds are continually collecting new things while simultaneously leaving things behind. This applies to trinkets, money, memories, people, worries, and — if you’re me — handbags. This constant exchange of gaining and losing material items has shown me how trivial they are. It’s sort of like an unspoken rule of having a traveler’s mindset — things won’t make you happy, experiences will. Traveling exposes you to areas you’ve never been to before. I’ve been through townships in Capetown, played with street children in Cario, and watched the sunset over the slums in New Dehli. It’s these experiences can make you question the capitalist notions and attachment to belongings that have been ingrained in us since we were born. Experiences like these can help you analyze and ask: what do you need to be happy? Instead of feeling like you deserve more (or need more), practicing gratitude for what you already have is one of the best ways to create happiness in your life. Traveling has made me realize that I don’t need things to be happy. Instead, I thrive on experiences, laughter, and the feeling I get when I breathe in a new place for the first time. Traveling expands your experiences, your food palate, your friends and both your geographical and mental views. It helps expand your mind and teaches you about the world and about yourself. Each trip I’ve taken — whether it was to Turkey, Hawaii, Egypt, Peru, Paris, Dubai, or Croatia— has been its own little lifetime. Each trip had its ups, its downs, its lessons, and its triumphs. These little lifetimes have allowed me to analyze my own, larger, lifetime. My favorite thing about traveling is that it has helped me learn about who I wanted to be. As humans, we are constantly shapeshifting and shedding layers. We are blending into backgrounds and breaking out of molds. Our life long journey is all about evolving. Traveling can catalyze your personal development by showing you things about the world and yourself that you didn’t understand (or even know about). Exploring the world will juxtapose your perspectives and propel you to come to more knowledgeable and experienced conclusions. Each new place I’ve been to has taught me about myself, and the world. This has helped me become the person I am today. It is! Getting out of your own culture and experiencing someone else’s allows you to fully understand the concept of a cultural norm. It’s almost absurd to realize how immensely culture shapes our view of the world and of ourselves. It molds our perception to allow and reject behaviors, actions, and ways of thinking. Culture is upheld by the pillars of ethnicity, language, and religion. It’s the root of music, food, comedy, dance, and ceremonies. While there should be enough room on this earth for every being and every belief, social norms sometimes deny us that truth. We’ve drawn lines in the sand to separate us. We’ve made distinctions between our beliefs to disconnect us. We’ve made assumptions that interfere with our ability to learn from experience instead of what we see on the news. Nationalism, xenophobia, prejudice, racial profiling, stigmas, pigeonholing, stereotypes are birthed from the womb of culture. We live in a culture where fear creates hate, and therefore, differences are despised when they should be dismantled, understood, and appreciated. We are all so different, and that’s a good thing. Instead of promoting those differences culture tends to reject them — which ironically is a culture in itself. Traveling has shown me no matter how different we are, we are all humans. If you want to create or experience something incredible — you have to be willing to go out of your comfort zone. I think this is one of the reasons people feel so passionately about traveling: it takes you out of your normalcy and into the unpredictable. Traveling has been the best teacher I’ve ever had. It will teach you about things that you could never learn from a textbook. Traveling allows you to try new things. It brings you to landscapes and animals you’ve never seen before. It introduces you to new people and allows you to learn about them, and in turn, learn about yourself. Going to a new place can open your mind and help you understand yourself, different cultures, climates, and regions. In a world with wars, terror, famine, and poverty, travel — hopefully — can help us to connect resources, compassion, and understanding. Conversely, if you don’t travel you might only see the world through the lens of your favorite news channel’s cameraman. Through my travels, I’ve been pushed to evaluate what I want to bring to this world. It has made me ask myself how I can make this planet a better place. The more you go outside of your comfort zone, the more you experience new cultures and places — the more you know."

But then you meet people that move through the world in a way that gives you hope. One of the best parts of traveling is chance encounters with people you’d never have met if you stayed in your own city, country, and comfort zone. While living near Lake Chapala in Mexico, we fell in love with the most delicious chipotle goat cheese we have ever tasted! The flavor is undeniably impeccable; so much so that when I ran out of crackers I had to find something else to put it on. I tried it on tortilla chips. Amazing! When I ran out of them, I licked the delicious cheese off the knife. Each week, I looked forward to going to the market and renewing our supply. As I relayed my love of their product to the vendor, she mentioned that they gave tours of their farm. I needed to go. I have always adored goats. Back in my punk rock, volunteering on reservation days, I even had a goat named Darby Crash! When we adopted Darby, we brought him home in the backseat of my roommates old Buick. I’ll never forget the looks we got while driving down the highway. When I told my family about our invitation to the goat farm, I wasn’t sure if they would be as enthusiastic as I was, especially at the prospect of doing some milking! However, I am fortunate that my family is generally up for any adventure I envision. The next time we saw the vendors, Juan Diego and Laura, we told them we were in and we couldn’t wait to visit their farm. Juan Diego told us that the tour of the farm also included treats. I was even more excited. As it turned out, the best treat was getting to know them. We met Juan Diego and Laura in Ajijic and followed them out to the ranch. The drive from Ajijic to Mezcala is excitingly beautiful and bumpy. Mexico is notorious for its unmarked speed bumps, topes, and although we encountered some along the way, we mostly encountered what I called inverted topes, essentially huge potholes. It was impressive watching the cars in front of us navigate the potholes effortlessly by weaving from one side of the road to the other. The scenery along the roadside is unlike any I have seen, to the right the mountain has flowering trees all the way to the top, to the left a stunning view of Lake Chapala and the historic Mezcala Island. Much sooner than expected, we arrived at the ranch. Along with a few other tourists visiting the ranch that day, we were welcomed with fresh fruit, goat yogurt, and granola. After enjoying our delicious snack, Juan Diego instructed us to wash our hands before feeding the goats to protect them from our human germs. The goats’ favorite snacks were the leaves of the plum trees growing all around the ranch. They gently ate from our hands. Some were super affectionate and loved being petted — others not so much. After feeding, Laura freed the goats from the pens to wander among us as we climbed up the hillside. At the top, Juan Diego introduced us to their “office” ­- large rocks for sitting, a small fire pit, and a magnificent view. Juan Diego started sharing the story of how the Galo de Allende farm came to be. He found the property while hiking and knew it was the perfect place to raise goats. He was already a cheesemaker and for many reasons, the next logical step was to raise their own goats, which would offer them a fresh supply of milk. What struck me the most during the conversation was how intentional Juan Diego and Laura are about their place in the community and the natural environment. Buying land is generally not an option in Mezcala if you are an outsider. Juan Diego, along with his mother, had to meet with the village elders and convince them their intentions were good, they would not harm the land, and they would contribute in a positive way to the community. Juan Diego shared the values that permeated the endless conversations I had in the US Pacific Northwest in the 90s. Many of us had envisioned how things could be, but instead of sustainable community development, I watched corporate greed completely destroy the natural areas I loved. When I went to the Galo de Allende ranch, I hadn’t expected to see a successful business model that was actively focused on giving the best care available to the animals, protecting the land, while also providing jobs for a community that has an extremely high rate of poverty. As if that isn’t all amazing enough, it was also incredibly inspiring to meet people who have forsaken the traditional modern lifestyle to go back to small batch cheese making and ranching. A huge part of my work over the past fifteen plus years is coaching youth and young adults to find and follow their dreams. To the depths of my heart and soul, I believe that quality of life is more important than making a bunch of money, fitting into the status quo, or doing what is expected by the current measures of many societies. As Laura and Juan Diego talk about their plans for the future and how they got to where they are; their eyes sparkle and their smiles widen. Their gentleness, intentionality, happiness, and generosity are contagious. I wonder how much more peaceful the world would be if more people followed their dreams and lived their passion? I am not sure if they realize it yet, but Juan Diego and Laura are inspirational to others. I am honored they shared their dream, ranch, and delicious food with my family! If you happen to find yourself near Lake Chapala, look them up (www.facebook.com/galodeallende) … you’ll be glad you did."
Medium.com,Life,Green Space for Urban People,Travel,https://medium.com/@mairibunce/green-space-for-urban-people-334c3eb4e788?source=topic_page---------444------------------1," How Vienna turned a landfill with a dark history into one of its biggest public parks It’s 2019 and everybody loves plants. But before Instagram inspired a thousand apartment jungles, before we gave our snake plants the appreciation they deserve for oxygenating our bedrooms and promoting restful sleep, the city of Vienna had already recognised the link between green spaces and wellbeing. ‘Soziales Grün’ or the Social Green Space has been a buzzword here for decades. In the early 1960s, mostly recovered from the war, Vienna undertook what was at that point its most ambitious social greening project. When the plan was first proposed, the mayor, Franz Jonas, had two goals in mind. Firstly, to send a message internationally that Austria was open for business. Secondly, to invest in the wellbeing of Vienna’s residents for future generations under the maxim ‘green space for urban people’. And how did they plan to achieve this? By hosting the biggest International Garden Show that Europe had ever seen. This idea was not as mad as it might sound. Throughout the 50s, Germany had hosted numerous garden shows in cities in various states of recovery from the war. They generated visitors and income for a city, gave at least the impression of economic prosperity, and built bridges between regions, even countries, through friendly competition. After the shows were over and the turnstiles were taken down, the parks often remained free for the city’s residents to enjoy. Franz Jonas wanted in on the action but, when a competition to find a garden designer to put the show together yielded neither a suitable candidate nor a location for the show, he turned to one of his own, the director of the Vienna Parks and Gardens Department, Prof. Ing. Alfred Auer. Auer quickly put aside the idea of using one of Vienna’s existing parks, such as the Prater or the Lainzer Tiergarten for the show. The reasons for this choice aren’t particularly clear — perhaps the Prater, though accessible, lacked the necessary infrastructure. Perhaps the slope on the Lainzer Tiergarten was deemed too steep. Maybe there was simply too much imperial history in both of these parks and they wanted to make a strong statement by giving the city something new. Either way, an unexpected location was chosen: a vast swathe of landfill on the east bank of the river Danube. It had always been clear that Vienna would have to expand into to the land on the east bank but, for hundreds of years, there had been problems just with building there, let alone making it an attractive place to live. Until the 1870s, when the first of the city’s flood defences were built, the east bank regularly found itself underwater. The landfill was created around the same time, first taking waste from the nearby gasworks, then from private contractors and then from the city officially. The city did build houses there in the 1920s and 30s (notably the Göthehof complex of 650 apartments, a kindergarten and a library around a massive shared courtyard) but the fact remained that these houses were 5km from the city centre. If the Viennese still make jokes today about taking their passports when they visit friends on the east bank, how much more must that have been the case before the city’s underground was built? And even as communities were constructed, even as they were provided with schools and swimming pools and medical facilities, the landfill was still sprawling out to meet them. The situation only worsened in the 1940s. The Nazis used the land at the edge of the landfill as an execution ground, murdering 129 people there. A memorial service is still held for the victims every year on the day after Austria’s national holiday. After the war, the illegal ‘wild settlement’ of Bretteldorf grew on the edge of the landfill, with many of the 1000 residents making their living by combing the dump for valuables. Every time the landfill expanded, the residents of ‘the slum of Kaisermühlen’ were pushed out. The final ‘settlers’ left in the late 1950s, when the city expanded the landfill for the final time. When Franz Jonas and Alfred Auer set out to create their park, no one would have envied them their to-do list. The goal was rehabilitation, both of the land on the far side of the river and the international reputation of the city. They had to appeal to potential visitors from outside Vienna, but also to the city’s residents, for whom the park could be an incentive to live and work in a part of the city with an unpleasant history. It was a balancing act which put pressure on every decision that Auer made. Nevertheless, he rose to the occasion. Auer’s ‘Donaupark’ (Danube Park) was 600Km2. The area is largely flat, sloping gently down towards the Alte Donau section of the river. His team built 25km of paths around large meadows. They dug a 30,000m2 lake, the Irissee (Iris Lake), and they built the excavated soil into a hill with a coffee house at the top. The park was natural, rolling and open, very much in keeping with the philosophy of accessible social greening but in striking contrast to the manicured, symmetrical gardens of the palaces on the other side of the city. Auer planned to plant 1.5 million flowers, 2 million perennials, 50000 shrubs and 40000 conifers, and they all had to be established before the garden show, which would need a backdrop for a vast range of exhibitions. Although the meadows were left empty throughout the garden show, there were attractions all around them. First, there were the flowers — a rose garden, a dahlia garden (it was the 60s, after all), an alpine garden, model allotments and an exhibition from a tree nursery to name just a few. Then there were the exhibits designed to make a visit to the Donaupark a whole day out for the family — a floating performance stage, multiple restaurants, mini-golf, a children’s playground, a cinema, a library, pools to splash in. In the spirit of international cooperation, there were also ten ‘world gardens’ exhibiting plants and artwork from countries as far away as Indonesia. To tour the exhibits, guests had options. Naturally, they could walk the wide paths and take everything in at a leisurely pace. However, Auer had also built a miniature railway with stations in each corner of the park, and a chairlift offered guests yet another perspective as it carried them on a triangular route above the flowerbeds. At the very centre of the park, the city had also built the Donauturm (Danube Tower), a massive concrete pillar with a rotating restaurant at the top, offering a bird’s eye view of the garden show and unparalleled views of the city beyond. At 252m, it is still the tallest structure in Austria. The views must have been even more spectacular in the decades before we took flying into the airport over the city for granted. The tower was not uncontroversial when it was opened, but it did have the effect of bringing a diverse crowd of visitors, not just plant enthusiasts, to the park. The garden show opened on the 16th of April 1964 and was an immediate success, drawing 25000 visitors on the first day. It sold tickets until the 11th of October, during which time 2.1 million people visited. Thereafter, the turnstiles were removed and the park stayed open for free. To this day, you only need to pay if you want to ride on Auer’s miniature railway. Not only was the garden show popular, not only did it generate money for the city, international interest, and general good feelings, it also became a symbol of economic recovery. By 1964, Vienna was enjoying a boom after the war. There had been growth in the 1950s and it had trickled down to many of the city’s workers. Archive footage of the event shows many families driving to the park in their first cars, or people taking pictures of their children among the flowers with their first cameras. On top of this, the 45-hour working week had just been introduced in Austria, giving people more leisure time to enjoy the outdoors without leaving the city. Today, people still use the park as an escape, but the chaos of the garden show is long gone. Spectacle is confined to occasional outdoor performances on small stages in the summer, or family birthday parties with balloons strung up between the trees. The Donauturm is still there (today you can even bungee jump from it) but, unfortunately, most of the other structures from the garden show have been removed. The last of the exhibition halls went in the 90s, with the completion of the office and living complex of Donau City on the edge of the park. The chairlift and the coffee house were taken down in the 80s, though there is still a mosaic where the coffee house was. The international gardens are also gone, though the free tennis courts in the park correspond almost exactly to where they once were. Vienna’s kids might have been especially curious to visit the Astronaut Garden, also lost, where the designers of the 1960s speculated on what crops we might be able to take to, even grow, on the moon. Perhaps most sadly, we’ve lost some of the exhibitions which, while they were curiosities in the 60s, seem increasingly relevant today. The show included what was essentially a farm to table restaurant, serving produce from the gardens and inspiring people to grow their own. Perhaps the biggest loss is the 41m ‘vertical greenhouse’ designed by Othmar Ruthner. The greenhouse explored the concept of vertical farming with an eye to making efficient use of land in areas at risk of famine. If the greenhouse still existed, perhaps even if it had been better documented while it was still standing, projects such as this could have played a role as we confront the 21st century’s most pressing issues. Though it no longer sees 10000 daily visitors, Vienna still holds the Donaupark close to its heart. We wonder how much more excited the city’s children would be if they could have a ride on the chairlift after they were finished on the train, and we’re sad that we’ll never see a brass band playing on the Irissee, but the simple open space is attractive too. In fact, the city uses the park now just as Franz Jonas and Alfred Auer intended, as a social green space, an escape from the madness of life in a major European capital, an extension of our living rooms. It’s fun to sit in the middle of a meadow and imagine the park when it was newly opened. It’s a little uncanny to think of all the history that’s buried underneath you. But, for most of us, it’s just nice to have a place to go that’s quiet, open, and that’s been given back to us."

Medium.com,Life,Hiking the Appalachian Trail: Why I’m Considering a Thru-Hike (and Why You Should Too),Travel,https://medium.com/@aczerwinskiburkard/hiking-the-appalachian-trail-why-im-considering-a-thru-hike-and-why-you-should-too-2e0228708a83?source=topic_page---------449------------------1," I’m constantly looking for new adventure. After living in my car last summer, I couldn’t just let my life go back to normal: graduating college, getting a job, and staying in one city for the next however many years. I needed to find other seemingly “crazy” ideas to pull off. I tend to think that life is more interesting when I do things that most people think are impossible, atypical, too adventurous, and maybe even a little dangerous. So what is the thing that I’ve come up with to scare myself (and probably my family and friends) this time? Thru-hiking the Appalachian Trail by doing a flip-flop (I’ll explain in a minute). I’m not going to lie that this idea is a little daunting to me. There’s two reasons for this: One, that I don’t typically backpack alone, and there’s definitely more danger in doing so than in a group. Two, that everyone I know won’t understand the nature of thru-hiking, especially when it’s not only in one direction on the trail. Let’s focus on the second one for the purpose of this post. What is thru-hiking? Chances are, if you’re reading this, you know about thru-hiking. But just in case I’ll explain. Thru-hiking is when you hike the entirety of a long distance trail within 12 months. Traditionally, it was thought that you had to start from one end and end at the other, but there are many reasons why this isn’t the case. More recently, the idea of a “flip-flop” hike has been accepted as a way of thru-hiking a trail. What is a Flip-Flop (F-F)? A flip-flop is when someone completes a trail in different sections, and not as one continuous trail. It’s easier to give an example than to try to explain it without an actual trail, so I’m going to use the AT as an example (if you’re still confused, refer to the picture). Keep in mind there is not one way to F-F, and it can be done in as many sections as necessary. On the AT, one F-F option is to start at Harper’s Ferry and hike northbound to Katahdin. Then drive/train/bus back to Harper’s Ferry and hike southbound to Springer Mountain. The requirement that you finish the trail in 12 months is still the same to become an official thru-hiker, but this allows for more flexibility as to when you start and end your trek. Why F-F? I was originally very opposed to any sort of F-F hike. I wanted that badass picture on Katahdin at the end of my thru. It’s hard to get over that (I’m still trying, to be honest, because that really was the dream). But there’s a few reasons why I’m justifying a F-F hike:"
Medium.com,Life,Why I Did a Ski Season in Japan,Travel,https://medium.com/@gavinbrennan/why-i-did-a-ski-season-in-japan-630f5e0909fe?source=topic_page---------450------------------1," I came to Japan to explore two lifelong obsessions: one nurtured as a child, spending countless hours playing ‘the Nintendo’, I developed a fascination with the land that had produced Super Mario and Street Fighter, Donkey Kong and Pokemon. Since then, this early programming has revealed itself in a wonder in all the facets of the traditional culture that had inspired them and their worlds. The other I developed as an adult, as I fell in love with snowboarding on a serendipitous post-college adventure to Canada. A friend called me a “swine” in response to me telling him I was going to Japan “for a long ski holiday”. A more common response from people was that they “didn’t know you could ski in Japan”, or even “I didn’t know it even snowed in Japan”, or “you’d have to be fucking different, wouldn’t you?” You can ski in Japan and it does snow. It snows a lot. And going on a snow holiday to Japan is hardly that different these days. Along with my own cultural curiosity, Japan holds its own mythological place in ski and snowboard circles for the amount of snow that God sends its way each winter. Siberian weather fronts spit precipitation measurable by the metre all over the north of the country, which has the most ski resorts per capita of anywhere in the world. The snow is known for its dryness. You can pick it up and blow it out of your hand like a handful of dust. You get covered in it in seconds on the way to the shop but you don’t get wet. It’s powder. Powder is good. Although skiing is a more efficient and ergonomic means of travelling down a snowy mountain, snowboarding came about for reasons of pure pleasure, as a means to recreate surfing on land. Riding through dry powdery snow gives this sensation of surfing waves in the mountains. It’s like floating on air, it’s like flying, and to fly is to escape the everyday. It is magical. Japanese Powder — ‘Japow’ as it’s known in the scene — is now renowned worldwide, having been ‘discovered’ by Westerners in the 90’s and 2000’s, and this along with the Land of the Rising Sun’s exotic allure has put Japan on every serious ski and snowboarder’s bucket list. So despite my travel motives being personal, they’re hardly original. The village I’m working and staying in, Echoland, sits halfway between Hakuba 47 and Happo-one ski resorts, two of the 10 or so resorts in the Hakuba Valley area. It’s popular with huge numbers of Australian ski tourists and season workers, and smaller numbers of other international tourists who come for the same reasons as me. “Echoland was built for foreigners,” my boss Sky, a Taiwanese property investor, informs me with a laugh after collecting me from the bus station. “They didn’t even bother to give it a Japanese name.” Such is its popularity with overseas tourists and season workers that at times the village feels like an Australian ski resort, with some Japanese restaurants and occasional visits from Japanese holiday-makers. Hundreds of season workers make a living here in workplaces that can maintain a roaring trade from international tourists, with English being their primary language of communication. The guesthouse I’m working at, exchanging household chores for a basic living with front-row access to the ski hills of the valley, caters mostly to Australian and Taiwanese guests. It’s snowing when I arrive in Hakuba on a mid-January afternoon and the next day it’s still snowing. It mightn’t have snowed the following day, but it definitely snowed the day after that, and then it kept snowing until the day after that. And here when it rains it pours, as they say. Even in the flats of the village, the stuff piles up rapidly. Several feet in a matter of hours, and by the following morning the car is buried. Shovelling snow is a never-ending routine that must be done more than once a day, and then the day after that. Early mornings are spent digging out submerged cars, part of the endless routine of winter. Weekends stick out as busier days of the week, but other than that days follow a predictable and psychologically endless cycle. Wake up, shovel snow, go snowboarding, repeat. The next couple of weeks continue like this. Amazing days riding inspire a resurgence of deep-rooted joy and euphoria of a kind that has lain dormant within me for years. There have been other joys but not quite like this. A week-long trip to Hokkaido a couple of years ago had been my only snow trip since I’d spent my last full winter season in the French Alps six years ago. A new-found love of trail running offers a similar release in me, and thrilling downhill bursts in that sport brought me joy as they mimicked the same feeling of hurtling along on a plank of wood in the snow that I recalled from my mid-twenties. But here I’m reminded that the speed, the aerodynamic flow, the underfoot sensations of running downhill can’t compare to this. This is why I’m back. My first adventurous love, its effects still felt deep down having left its mark on me at an impressionable age, like any young love. It’s been a while, and ploughing through this stuff burns your thighs and core like leg day at the gym. It might be light but it’s not air. This is a sport. This is hard. A 5 minute run through trees, full of technical turns, tight squeezes, near misses and bursts of adrenaline, not to mention the altitude inherent to this sport, will have you gasping for air by the time you line up for the next chairlift. But like being winded on the ground after you run the length of the pitch to get on the end of an inch-perfect cross and nudge the winner into the net, this exhaustion carries an elation that negates the discomfort, turns it into something to feed off. The bigger the gasps for oxygen at the end, the bigger the smiles. The bigger the high-fives. An early powder-day trip to Cortina resort on the northern edge of the Hakuba valley provides some of the deepest snow conditions I’ve ever ridden in. Cutting sharp turns unleashes waves of snow overhead, like getting overtaken by a truck in torrential rains. I’m momentarily blinded and I need to stop lest I hit a tree. On our first run my friend Michi takes a tumble and is buried up to his neck. You do need to be careful in such conditions, sometimes the snow is so thick that it slows you down to a halt, or the terrain flattens out, or your legs just aren’t strong enough, you’re just not skilled enough to stay upright, and you have to burrow like a dog through the snow to find your board at your feet, unstrap and swim to safety (another advantage to skis — your legs aren’t tied together so it’s easier to get out of trouble). But we’re both experienced enough at this, Michi having spent several winters in Niseko on the northern island of Hokkaido, the home of powder skiing in Japan. So enough of the caution, days like this are for letting go, letting rip. The deep and dry snow offers all and no resistance. ‘Normal’ snowboarding on pistes is a reference point, as is surfing a wave; but it’s not the same thing. There’s a cushion beneath you that gives way but pushes back, supports you. You can’t feel the bottom when your board is flat, but you’re able to create your own waves when you turn. It’s like floating through air but flying on a magic carpet at the same time. The moments where you reach a state of flow and are completely present in the moment in these conditions is divine; in control and finding the perfect line through a technical zone, or just having at it and opening up through a field of powder, momentarily at one with the lay of the snow and the flow of the terrain. Although physically testing and frustrating at first, once you’ve ridden powder you wonder if there’s any point in going back to pistes or parks. This, to me, is what snowboarding is. Maybe it’s a programming thing and a case of ‘whatever you were raised on’, but park riding doesn’t appeal to me as much as free-riding through rugged natural terrain and pure untracked snow. It’s a different sport in my mind, a series of gimmicky diversions for skateboarders (I also freely admit that land on a cushion of soft snow when I mess up than willingly slam down onto a hard-packed landing or an ice-cold rail). While I respect the bravado and sacrificial endurance of pain in pursuit of landing tricks, of achieving goals, to me the process is the goal, the meaningful part. No objective other than pure experience and enjoyment. There’s artificiality to park riding, of mechanically manipulating the snow and contaminating it with mundane metal and foreign objects which looks cool but shifts the goalposts to turn a way of life into a sport; the logical progression is to judge skill and award scores based on perceived quality (again, I’ll be the first to admit I possess none of the skills, quality or dexterity required to excel in the park). What do I like? Riding through natural forests and off-piste powder zones I’m reminded of the first times I was dragged into the Revelstoke side-country to experience real powder-boarding. Giddy joy so effervescent that childish laughter was the only reaction my body could muster, a feeling that I’d previously mostly experienced at music festivals. There’s an artistry to finding your own line on the mountain, at once restrained by the contours of the mountain but limited only by your imagination, your skill and your mastery of fear. Skiing may have been around for millennia as a means of functional transportation; more than mere pleasure, surfers knew when they took their boards to frozen mountains that this was a path to transcendence. And like a surfer knows that most of their life is spent bobbing in the ocean, waiting, waiting, waiting, and often failing, there’s more to it than just the photo reel, the action shot. The environment plays a huge part. The mountains form their own majestic ocean, surrounding as far as you can see, isolating the small mountain villages and towns from the dry land of the outside world, the more southern reaches which remain untouched by snow and breathe freely throughout the winter. Being immersed in the heart-aching beauty and vastness of endless mountain ranges is part of the life, the place you must venture to in order to partake. It’s important to often pause and take it in, for the beauty of your land is as important for the soul as the rush and exhilaration of travelling through it at high speeds as its master. And the fresh air is not to be taken for granted. Back down in the valley, I settle into the slower moving and always shivery routines of ski-town winter. There is a culture here that we only understand in Ireland from Christmas cards, that we think we know due to our own experiences with shite weather and the odd ‘big freeze’ but in reality we know nothing of its kind; a range of sights and experiences that come with living on the frontier of civilisation. There is a partial feeling that every day is Christmas, particularly when it’s snowing and you can’t wait to get an early night to jump up early the next morning and unwrap your presents on the hill. There’s a slower and more methodical pace of life, where people get on with their journeys, head down into the flurry of snowflakes blowing at them in the wind; slowly digging themselves out of hibernation every morning, grinning and bearing it through extreme cold and lack of sunlight. On sunny days the mix of icy air and dazzling snowblindness from the sun’s reflection on the brilliant ground electrifies the senses, wakes you up like an ice bath. A steaming hot onsen under a dump of snow is a magical thing. Echoland, for all its rather non-Japanese atmosphere, exudes a charm reminiscent of the planned frontier-town street grids of Revelstoke, where I fell in love with ski life, a youthful fling. There’s a camaraderie amongst the people here that comes with journeying to extremes to do something you love, or getting on with where you’re from. Something active, something thrilling, something that requires care and skill and a sense of adventure. The secret is out at Hakuba Cortina, and we wait impatiently for over an hour in snaking lines to get on one of the inadequate 2-person chairs to get halfway up the mountain, then another. We strap in, newbies to the resort, meandering a little aimlessly down a cat-track flanked woods through dispersing crowds. Half unsure of the lay of the land, half scared of disappointment, unsure yet if it’ll be worth the wait. I’ve been waiting to drop in here for a while. And it’s amazing. This is more than just pleasure. It is deep. It’s one thing to rationally remind yourself of all these things, to look at the pictures, to make the decision to come here based on what you think or remember to be true, to know that something is good. It’s another to experience it all again and feel it deep down within you. This is something that you need to feel first hand. I’ve traveled somewhere new, again, somewhere different, but all the same, it’s good to be back."

In the past it’s always been in Europe that we’ve indulged our love of old churches and their art and history. But since we’ve lived in the American SouthWest, we’ve become afficionados of old churches on this side of the Atlantic as well. Ours may not be as extravagant as the great cathedrals of the Middle Ages or the Baroque churches of the Catholic Reformation, but the stories they tell of generations past are equally fraught with sacrifice and suffering, resplendent with hope and faith. Catholicism was at the heart of Spanish Colonial daily life and the parish church was the center of the community, and — in what are now border states with Mexico — many of those churches still stand. While they welcome visitors, most still function as places of worship to the Catholic faithful. This is the story of the oldest church in America. The earliest known documentation of the existence of San Miguel Chapel is from 1628. Oral history holds that the “Hermita de San Miguel” was originally constructed under the direction of Franciscan friars, ca.1610. The adobe church was erected on the site of an ancient kiva, and was built by Tlaxcalan (Tas-cal’-en) Indians who came to New Mexico from old Mexico in 1598 with a Spanish contingent led by Don Juan Oñate. The little church served a small congregation of soldiers, laborers, and Indians who lived in the Barrio de Analco — so-named because the Tlascalan Indian word “analco” means “the other side of the river.” It distinguished this south side barrio from the plaza side of the Santa Fe River, where government officials and other prominent citizens resided and attended mass."
Medium.com,Life,Is Working in Japan Worth It for High-Skilled Foreigners?,Travel,https://medium.com/@alexstwrites/is-working-in-japan-worth-it-for-high-skilled-foreigners-b37e36fcb556?source=topic_page---------452------------------1," A little over three years ago, I uprooted my quiet European life, packed two large suitcases and moved to Japan. Some of you may be thinking this is the typical Millennial story — let me reassure you. My move wasn’t a soul-searching mission to a countryside temple, I didn’t learn how to channel my Ki, and my calligraphy hasn’t improved an iota. For me, it was a necessary cultural experience, a natural progression in life. Japan is the fifth country I’ve lived in, Asia is the third continent. There is nothing I find more interesting than to witness how culture shapes individuals, influences our life experiences, and what we could learn from one another if we were to step out of our cultural bubbles. It wasn’t enough for me to just learn basic Japanese and make some friends here. I wanted to become proficient in the language and truly immerse myself in the unique, fast-paced and quirky culture of Tokyo. It took me years to achieve some semblance of what I came here for, which means it’s just about time to look back and ask myself: Was it all worth it? A warning I have for those seeking to someday work in Japan: know your value-added to the local job market. I’ve seen too many foreigners come to Japan thinking, “I speak English, I can find a job,” just to move back home frustrated and broke a few years later. Knowing English can land you a job, but English will be your job, and it’s not necessarily a very rewarding one. It is much easier to find meaningful work in Japan if you are trained in the technical skills they need here, such as software engineering, chemical engineering, advanced manufacturing or even translation. That isn’t my case. I have a master’s degree in Human Rights Law, which in Japan is about as useful as having a postcard with the words “not a lawyer” printed in boldface on either side. I needed a more sought-after skillset I could sell to employers. I went to Japanese school for almost two years. In that time, and with more effort than it took to get my university degree, I was able to pass the Japanese language proficiency exam (JPLT N1, for the connoisseurs). I was ready. I had my Japanese language certificate, my past professional experience in international relations and my master’s degree. I went to my first job interview with a consulting firm, my head held high and brimming with unwarranted confidence. Sure enough, I got rejected. The reason they gave: my Japanese wasn’t fluent enough. After a lot of screaming into my pillow and ultimately lowering my job-seeking standards, I landed a low-paid part-time position as an administrative staff member in a local university. This is what working in Japan looks like for many highly-educated generalists in the social sciences or international relations. Despite my advanced degree, proficiency in three languages and prior job experience, I was doing repetitive administrative tasks for a fraction of what I would be earning if I had just stayed in my home country of Switzerland. For me, this was still a step-up from teaching English, because at least I was working in Japanese with Japanese colleagues, but it was hardly a comfortable life. As you can probably tell, I was pretty bitter about it. I probably should have heeded the advice of my friends and tried harder to find a job in either a foreign company, or a company like Rakuten (basically Japanese Amazon) that uses English as its working language. But that’s not what I wanted. I came to Japan to immerse myself in Japanese culture. I didn’t go through the pain of learning Japanese just to spend all day working in English with other expats. Luckily, after six months, I found a better job. I was hired in the corporate communications department of a purely Japanese software company. To clarify, I was hired by a Japanese company to do their English corporate communication. My interview was exclusively in Japanese and I was not required to submit a writing sample. My CV doesn’t mention that I grew up in the U.S., so for all they knew my only qualification was that I had a degree from the U.K. and used English in my previous job. In other words, I was hired mostly on faith. In many respects, it was a blessing. I get to spend most days doing what I love — writing. All of my meetings and most of my daily interactions with colleagues are in Japanese, which means my language skills have become much better (I bet those buggers from my first job interview would hire me now!). I have learned a tremendous amount about how Japanese companies work, and the workplace reform movement the country is currently undergoing. On top of that, I genuinely feel like my perspective as the only foreigner in my department is valued and appreciated. There is however a dark side — one that is systemic, affecting many English speakers working in Japanese companies. While English teachers are a dime a dozen and the standards for teaching English have risen in recent years (they still lag behind most of the industrialized world, but that’s a story for a different article), foreigners who are fluent enough to work in a purely Japanese environment are still somewhat rare. We’re talking about a country where only about 2% of the population is foreigners. That number is about 25% in Switzerland. The problem with such scarcity is that we’re so few and far between, there is practically no quality control for what we do. Take a random person from your entourage and ask them if they think they could write for a living. Chances are, they can’t. Not every native speaker can or wants to become a writer, and not every writer is a good writer (but hey, I try!). In Japan, companies don’t have the luxury of choice, so any native, native-fluent, or even somewhat proficient English speaker is expected to know how to write compelling prose. It’s an impossible standard they would never apply to themselves — my Japanese colleagues in the editorial department all go through a rigorous competency test. This leads to two major issues when it comes to communication work. First, nobody can really check what I write — I have to be my own editor. When I bring it up with my boss, I usually get told: “Why don’t you ask another native speaker from a different department?” The simple answer: They’re not editors. If a Japanese editor were to raise a similar issue, nobody would imagine telling them: “Oh, just go ask anybody with free time.” The second issue is that there’s no incentive to produce quality over quantity. Quality takes time — it takes many more working hours to polish a text than it does to stitch together a rough draft. Sure, quality is important: for our foreign clients, it demonstrates professionalism and helps build trust in our brand. But if none of my bosses can notice the effort, is it really worth making? In essence, my work is like a jazz composer making elevator music. I can knock myself out trying tirelessly to compose a masterpiece, but those who hired me would be satisfied with an eight-note loop. I’ll do my best anyway, for the sake of those who take the elevator, and for the love of jazz. You basically have three options as a high-skilled worker in Japan (apart from teaching English). The first is working for a foreign company, making a decent living doing a purposeful job, but somewhat isolated from the local community. The second is what I did, become decent in Japanese and find a job that requires English skills, but without being able to reach the level of professionalism, quality and purpose that you would achieve in your home country. The third is becoming perfectly fluent in Japanese, to the point where you blend in with the local workforce. This last option can be very rewarding for personal reasons, but keep in mind that on average, Tokyo salaries are lower than in many large U.S. and European cities — and becoming perfectly fluent takes many years of hard work. If you spend years of your life and a big chunk of money to assiduously learn anything, you may expect a positive, or at least neutral, return on investment. Not Japanese. Financially, the decision to learn the language wasn’t just bad — it was disastrous. I realize it takes a hearty slice of hubris to come to a foreign country and expect to be treated differently. To some, it may sound like I suffer from a white savior complex, aggressively asking for recognition for what is essentially my own passion project. I would argue however that it isn’t a matter of being white or foreign, but rather that the language of the global economy is English, and difference being an average English speaker and a communications professional is grossly overlooked in Japan. Japanese companies have been able to prosper by dominating their local market, but overseas competitors are slowly creeping in, investing tremendous resources in hiring a diverse and highly-qualified international workforce. This is becoming particularly prevalent in tech, where giants like Google and Salesforce are opening up huge offices and poaching all the highly qualified expat professionals. Unless Japanese companies step up their game, they will have to rely on people like me, who come here out of overwhelming personal interest and despite harsh economic disincentives. This isn’t a sustainable model for economic growth, and may provide some explanation as to why the Japanese economy has been stagnating for many years. I’m lucky enough to have phenomenal working conditions, so I can’t write knowingly about the oppressive hierarchy, excessive overtime and antiquated cultural relics that many other foreigners experience. Nevertheless, I hope Japanese companies will acknowledge the necessity of nurturing a culturally diverse, qualified and professional workforce. I hope they become more attuned to skill differences between foreign workers, and understand that English ability is a broad spectrum, not just a checkbox on a job application. If you are considering moving here too, I hope my experience can serve as a cautionary tale. Working in Japan will inevitably be a sacrifice on some level, especially for highly-skilled generalists. It’s unlikely that Japanese companies will become sensitive to the difference between refined jazz and elevator music, so for us aspiring musicians of the written word, motivation will have to come from the inside. My advice would be to make sure you have a plan, that you understand the value-added you’re bringing to the Japanese labor market. Don’t assume that being a native English speaker will land you an amazing job. Don’t assume that learning Japanese will lead to high-paid career opportunities; it will more likely be a negative return on investment. Be prepared to have to hustle, find your own path, build your own niche, and find motivation for what you do from the inside. All of that being said, for me, moving to Japan has been the experience of a lifetime. It has opened my mind to an entirely new culture, and in so doing brought happiness and meaning to my life in ways I could hardly explain. I may not have much in savings or own a fancy car, I may have closed some doors for career success and professional development, but for the things I value the most in life, there’s been nothing quite like living in Japan."

Medium.com,Life,Paris in December,Travel,https://medium.com/@elena.prince21/paris-in-december-ec71a5876f18?source=topic_page---------455------------------1," I’ve been to Paris in spring and summer, and I didn’t think that Paris in December was going to beat taking a Seine river cruise on a warm May evening or walking through Versailles gardens in June. But my trip to Paris in December didn’t disappoint, and it wasn’t because of subdued expectations. The main perk of traveling in December is obvious — you get to escape the craziness of getting ready for Christmas. And then there are minor things like cheaper airfare and hotels, less tourists, and shorter lines to popular attractions. I booked Hilton Opera for four nights, mostly because of the location. Since it wasn’t my first trip to Europe, I expected the hotel room to be slightly bigger than my airplane seat, but the room was nothing short of first class. It may be small by US standards, but you’d forget it the minute you walk into an elegantly decorated room. But back to the location. Hilton Opera is located next to metro and the train station Gare St. Lazare, which can take you to several popular destinations like Versailles, Rouen, and Caen. It’s within walking distance (less than 2.5 miles) to the Notre Dame Cathedral, the Louvre, Montmartre, and Champs-Elysees. In mid-December the temperature was in upper 40’s, including one gorgeous sunny day which we spent exploring the Latin Quarter. The only drawback of traveling in the winter is shorter days. My advice is to get your day started as early as possible, but even if you’re out in the dark — night Paris is not going to disappoint. Even during your first trip to Paris after a day or two you’ll feel like you’ve crossed several items off your bucket list — the Eiffel Tower, the Cathedral of Norte Dame, the Louvre, Arc De Triomphe, and Musée d’Orsay. Some would stop there and take a train to London or Amsterdam, but if your reason for travel is more than crossing items off the list, consider exploring these Paris gems: If you’re a history buff, you know that Rouen is famous for its connection to the French hero Joan of Arc. And if you’re a trip planner like me, then after minutes of research you’d determine that Rouen is one of the top candidates for a day trip from Paris. The 1-hour high-speed train ride to Rouen was quick and comfortable. Using the map on my phone, I figured out where I wanted to go — past the Tower of Joan of Arc to Abbatiale Saint Ouen, then to the Rouen Cathedral, and finally to the old town featuring the famous clock Le Gros Horloge. Even if you don’t have a digital map, the signs around this pedestrian-friendly city will guide you. One of the reasons I wanted to go to Rouen is to see medieval architecture. Just minutes into our walk we saw rows of crooked half-timbered houses. Almost empty streets made it feel like we were in a period Halloween movie. After visiting a few cathedrals in Paris, you may think that Abbatiale Saint Ouen is “just another cathedral”, but I’d encourage you to do whatever you can to cleanse your visual palette to appreciate the beauty of this church. It hasn’t been restored as much as some cathedrals in Paris, but that’s one of the things that makes it stand out. Next stop — Rouen cathedral. If the façade looks familiar, it’s because you may have seen it on the famous paintings by Claudet Monet’s in Musee d’Orsay. The estimated value of one painting is over $40 million, and if you forgot your checkbook at home, you can always buy a replica for a few euros. The cathedral is located next to the old town where you can walk down on cobblestone streets to the 14th century astrological clock knows as Le Gros Horloge. If you like organized tours, you can always book one through a tourist company. If you are an independent traveler, you can take a couple of days to see different parts of the city. Start your walk by the Notre Dame and walk toward the Louvre. Catch a boat ride at Pont Neuf to see the lit-up bridges and buildings along the river. The one-hour cruise will take you to the Eiffel Tower and back. Another part of the city not to miss at night is Champs-Elysées. Take metro to Arc de Triumph, then walk down the grand street until you run into the Christmas market. Wrap up your night tour of Paris with the breathtaking view from the famous department store Galleries Lafayette. The store will be busy, but don’t let it stop you from going to the rooftop café. At that time of the year most visitors stay on the ground — to look at the electric puppets in the window displays. If you time it right, you will see the amazing sight of the Eiffel Tower lighting up in the night sky."
Medium.com,Life,A phenomena is made real when our experience is connected to that which we can only begin to…,Travel,https://medium.com/@kwhatch/a-phenomena-is-made-real-when-our-experience-is-connected-to-that-which-we-can-only-begin-to-c35e9543b591?source=topic_page---------456------------------1," Molokini Crater is one of the most popular snorkeling destinations in the Hawaiian islands — and for good reason. Molokini is a volcano almost entirely submerged beneath the ocean with only the top of the rim poking above water. The crater rim forms an islet the shape of a crescent moon and it sits in the Alalākeiki Channel between the islands of Maui and Kahoʻolawe. The floor of the crater holds a coral reef resplendent with fish of most any color, shape and size imaginable. A couple of years ago we boarded a catamaran and sailed out to take a look. The fish were cool; the bay that Molokini Crater is nestled within is even cooler. It’s just off the migration route for humpback whales and it’s a safe place for moms to birth and raise their calves. This means that during the winter there are whales everywhere. We visited in March and by that late in the season many of the whales had departed — headed for the nutrient rich waters of Alaska. Still, we had the chance to see a few and hear their breathy exhales at the water’s surface. The captain told us that if we’d descended into the water to snorkel a few weeks earlier, the bay would’ve been singing. The whale songs are so prolific that they can be heard throughout the bay by swimmers and snorkelers like us floating around and gazing at coral. We didn’t get to hear the water lit up by song, but we chatted about what that would’ve been like as we cruised back towards the port snacking on Lay’s potato chips and sipping cans of Coors Light that the captain had cracked open for us. To this day, I still wonder what it would be like to swim in a singing sea. I thought of Molokini when I heard an episode of On Being where Krista Tippett interviews Katy Payne, a self-taught acoustic biologist who spent her life listening to elephants and whales. Despite lifelong observation, Payne is quick to admit to the things she doesn’t know — to the questions that remain and the places where conjecture is all that science has revealed thus far. There’s an ease to her unknowing and at the age of 82 she seems to have nothing to prove. The lack of certainty endows her stories with a sense of richness and wonder, as if she herself is contemplating their meaning even as she shares them. In the telling, Katy makes you feel like a comrade. Well into the conversation, Tippett asks about the challenge of motivating a change in behavior of people who live at a great distance from some of the pressing problems facing our world. Problems like saving the whales, quite literally. How do we create change when people can’t clearly see the connection between their actions and the crises of our time? “I think that’s a hard equation for people to feel,” Tippet says. This is the central question of social change, isn’t it? How do we show people the connection between their actions and the perpetuation or lessening of harm and suffering? In its most expansive form, the question can never be answered. We can never fully know the repercussions of our actions. Still, there’s much room to explore the relationship between our choices and the harm or help they may cause. If we are people who have much (too much, maybe, says Payne), how do we make decisions about what we save and spend and give? What do we believe about the word enough? And what do those things have to do with other people and institutions and our planet? The simplicity of Payne’s response stopped me in my tracks. Here’s what she says: Ms. Payne: Yeah, that’s absolutely right. And so that’s our task, you see. Here you are on the radio, here we are on the radio. Our task is to make this real. This planet, this planet is the only place where we have this kind of life. Let’s not blow it. Our task is to make this real. This. This thing you care about and are working towards. This problem you see and understand and work with. This vision you hold and work to usher into the realm of the real, into the line of sight of those who hold the power to participate and create change. Real. Make this real. How do we do that, exactly? Perhaps it begins with giving people a way in — to feel the problem, to wrestle with what a solution might look like and what their role might be. We tell stories and share ideas and point to what just might be the path forward. We find ways to show instead of tell. And we look into the nooks and crannies of our experience for the details that give life and anchor our stories in a singular moment of space and time. We dig into the specific and hold it up. Then we stand back in awe as the specific is somehow changed into the universal. The specific of ‘over there’ ends up being akin to a memory of ‘over here.’ Like recognizes like and we are moved towards action. The alternative is to make it unreal. And unfortunately, this is what happens a lot of the time in the social sector. We sensationalize and exoticize the crisis and the poverty. We trade the shared human experience for the sensational. “Otherness” becomes the call to action. The problem is that it’s difficult to catalyze change around something at arm’s length, around something we haven’t seen or felt or understood. A phenomena is made real when our experience is connected to that which we can only begin to imagine. We remember bobbing about while gazing at the the yellow tangs and the brain coral. We’d never considered an interspecies musical accompaniment to such an experience might be possible. But once this idea is introduced, we toggle back and forth between what we know and the wonder of what could be. Henceforth our view of what’s possible shifts. We find ourselves wondering what it would be like to swim through the chorus of whales. And wondering what action we might take to ensure this song continues until next winter when we might experience it firsthand."
Medium.com,Life,Seattle with Teenagers,Travel,https://medium.com/@elena.prince21/seattle-with-teenagers-c833c413fd6?source=topic_page---------457------------------1," Getting teenagers to pay attention to the world outside of their phones is a monumental task. But if you can’t beat them, join them. Snap a picture, post it on Instagram, and watch the number of likes, wishing your retirement savings grew as quickly. My daughter, just an average teenager, has over 1,000 followers on Instagram. Until a recent family trip, I didn’t realize how much effort she put into taking just the right picture for her Instagram feed. Frustrated by her dedication to this task, I made a comment that she and her friends are just trying to outdo each other. “You got it all wrong, Mom,” she’d said. “It’s the way we communicate”. I decided to buy into that, and on our next family trip I assumed the role of the location scout for the perfect Instagram picture. With mountains, water, and modern city skyline, Seattle is one of the most photogenic cities in the world. Whether you like recognizable landmarks or something more unique — you’ll find it here. To get the best photos of the city skyline, go to the city parks. Kerry Park, located on Queen Anne Hill, offers the most recognizable view of Seattle: the Space Needle set against the backdrop of downtown and Mount Rainer. The park is actually a small area where you can take photos, so if you want a lunch with a view — head across the bay to the Seacrest Park. You can get there by taking a water taxi from Seattle waterfront, which will offer more opportunities to take pictures. At the Seacrest Park, enjoy a stroll down blackberry-lined path along the water, daydream on the beach, or enjoy fresh seafood at Salty’s on Alki Beach. You can also rent bikes and kayaks if your teenager needs to burn off some extra energy. By now you’ve snapped the picture of the Space Needle from two angels. The only thing left is to take a picture from it. The Space Needle is located in the Seattle Center. As any tourist attraction, it will be crowed. If you didn’t book tickets ahead of time, there’s plenty to do while you’re waiting for the time of your tour. You can watch kids trying to outsmart the musical fountain, which soaks them with sudden bursts of water, listen to street musicians, or grab a bite in the gourmet food court. Sleepless in Seattle is probably not your teenagers’ favorite movie, but you don’t have to tell them that you want to go to the Gasworks Park on Lake Union to see the famous houseboats. The rusty gasification plant is still standing on the park grounds, making the park look like a set of a young adult dystopian movie. The Gasworks Park is popular with the locals, and if you’re lucky, you may be able to see jugglers and tight rope walkers honing their performance skills. With more than eighty million photos loaded per day, your chances of posting a picture with a unique background on Instagram are smaller than your chances of winning a lottery. But just like with the lottery, if you don’t try, you’ll never win. Three easy stops are the gum wall, the Olympic Sculpture Park, and the Freemont Troll. If the sight of chewed gum on sidewalks makes you nauseous, you may want to ask a stranger to snap a picture of your teenager in front of the gum wall. Located in Post Alley under Pike Place Market, the wall adds a colorful pop to any picture. Here sticking gum on the wall is not littering, it’s art. You’d never guess that the wall was cleaned in 2015. If after the gum wall you feel like you need some fresh air, head to the nearby Olympic Sculpture Park. You can enjoy the views of the Elliott Bay while your teenagers snap pictures of futuristic sculptures. Finally, head to Fremont, the artsy neighborhood just north of downtown Seattle. The eighteen-foot troll’s torso is large enough to support a bridge and safe enough to climb even for cautious climbers. The view of Mount Rainer from Seattle is spectacular, but to see it up close… Let’s just say it’s like looking at the cake and eating it. Mount Rainer National Park is only seventy miles from Seattle. If you’re going just to take pictures, you can make it a day trip. But if you enjoy hiking, plan to stay for at least two days. The “must do” is the drive to the Paradise visitor center. The loop road, which you can finish in two to three hours starts in Ashford. You can go on a few hikes along the way and stop for a refreshment in Paradise. By the time you’re done, you’re guaranteed to have too many pictures of the mountain, alpine meadows, lakes, and waterfalls. If you would like to get a picture of a glacier, don’t miss the Glacier Basin Trail. The hike starts in tranquil old-growth forest. Thirty minutes into the hike you’ll cross a creek, and after a short climb you’ll see the glacier. On the way back, there is a chance that your teenagers will look up from their phones: battery could be dead or there could be no service. But there is also a small chance that they would put the phone away just to enjoy the nature."

Medium.com,Life,The Probiotic I Use When Traveling and Taking Antibiotics,Travel,https://medium.com/superhuman-by-science/the-probiotic-i-use-when-traveling-and-taking-antibiotics-5e23aecbfcd6?source=topic_page---------460------------------1," I don’t know about you, but I worry about my ass a lot. That’s why I love the supplement I’m going to talk about today: it protects my sensitive butthole from the ravages of both modern medicine and third world water supplies. Wait, you know what– let’s back this story up a bit. You see, I’ve been sick for the past three weeks. Yep, you heard that right. Three weeks. First it was bronchitis. I thought that was just a cold at first, but after it kept getting worse I had to take a course of antibiotics. Right before I was prescribed the antibiotics, I also developed conjunctivitis, aka pink eye. The doctor said that would go away on it’s own. It didn’t, so a week later my bronchitis was better, the pink eye was worse, and it was more antibiotics. Then a few days later, even more antibiotics because the pink eye wasn’t improving fast enough. Now, taking oral antibiotics for two weeks straight normally causes severe diarrhea. In my case, that was only an issue for about the first two days, then it stopped being a problem. Why? Because I was taking a probiotics– but not just any probiotic. Not the ones you usually find in stores. This probiotic is called Saccharomyces boulardii, or S. Boulardi for short. I also use it to prevent traveller’s diarrhea on some trips, most notably in 2016 when I was living as a digital nomad. Now, probiotics have been the subject of a lot of unsubstantiated and really inflated claims over the years, so let’s make this clear: S. Boulardi works, and there’s ample research evidence to support that. We’re talking dozens of studies here. Here’s a quote from a 2010 meta-analysis of 31 studies on S. Boulardi: Of 31 randomized, placebo-controlled treatment arms in 27 trials (encompassing 5029 study patients), S. boulardii was found to be significantly efficacious and safe in 84% of those treatment arms. A meta-analysis found a significant therapeutic efficacy for S. boulardii in the prevention of antibiotic-associated diarrhea (AAD) (RR = 0.47, 95% CI: 0.35–0.63, P < 0.001). In adults, S. boulardii can be strongly recommended for the prevention of AAD and the traveler’s diarrhea. Randomized trials also support the use of this yeast probiotic for prevention of enteral nutrition-related diarrhea and reduction of Heliobacter pylori treatment-related symptoms. S. boulardii shows promise for the prevention of C. difficile disease recurrences; treatment of irritable bowel syndrome, acute adult diarrhea, Crohn’s disease, giardiasis, human immunodeficiency virus-related diarrhea; but more supporting evidence is recommended for these indications. The use of S. boulardii as a therapeutic probiotic is evidence-based for both efficacy and safety for several types of diarrhea. In other words, it works, and perhaps even better than the more commonly-sold lactobacillus probiotics. In the next few paragraphs I’ll explain why it’s so awesome and where to buy it. Simple: it’s a yeast, not a bacteria. Probiotics, for those who don’t know, are living bacteria (usually) that replace or augment the ones already in your intestines. Not to be confused with prebiotics, which are fibers that feed the bacteria in your gut. Taking probiotics when you’re on oral antibiotics is usually tantamount to lighting your money on fire, since the probiotics will get killed off just as surely as the bacteria already in your gut. As one of the few gut flora that’s a yeast instead of a bacteria, S. Boulardi is immune to this, and in fact can replace (at least temporarily) the lost bacterial gut flora, doing the work they’re unable to do, since they’re mostly dead. This part’s also simple: it’s heat-stable, i.e. it doesn’t need to be refrigerated. Most probiotics won’t live very long at room temperature when they’re stuck in a capsule without food. To be clear: obviously, it’s not cold inside your gut. It’s not that gut flora need to be cold to live; it’s more that they need be cold to go into a sort of hibernation when they’re nothing for them to eat. S. Boulardi can hibernate– or at least survive somehow, I don’t actually know the specifics– without food, and at room temperature, for months. That makes it the only probiotic I know of that’s actually any good if you take it with you when you travel. For that matter, it also means it’s the only probiotic you can order off the internet, or buy off a non-refrigerated store shelf, and have any confidence that it’s still effective. It’s sometimes sold in stores, though not as commonly as other probiotics. I’ve seen it at Whole Foods a few times. As a side note, Whole Foods also refrigerates its probiotics, which is why it’s the only store I’ve bought any other probiotic from in the last decade. However, I usually buy it off Amazon these days, since that’s cheaper, shipping is free and only takes a day, and there’s no Whole Foods near where I live now. I like this supplement by Jarrow Formulas, since it’s very clear about what’s in it, including how many viable cells per capsule it contains (5 billion), and Jarrow has great quality control. I’ll usually take two capsules with each meal, so about six a day, and ideally I’d start a few days before I begin traveling if possible. Obviously that’s usually not possible with antibiotics, even though it would be ideal. If I’m traveling longer-term, I’ll get this 180-cap bottle, which is otherwise identical to the first. For a really long trip I’ll cut back to 2–3 pills a day after the first few days, and if it’s over three months I’ll drop to one pill a day after a month or two to stretch the bottle out for longer. Regardless of how you’re using it, it’s important to remember that this is just one probiotic, and your gut actually needs a variety of them. I prefer to get the others from food rather than more supplements, so while I’m traveling I’ll eat fermented foods like Greek yogurt, kombucha, sauerkraut, kimchi, and miso whenever I can. If I’m on antibiotics, I’ll instead consume massive amounts of a variety of fermented foods, along with a lot of fiber-rich vegetables, for about a week after I’m done with the antibiotics, to replenish my gut flora. Not much point doing that while I’m still on the meds, though of course it doesn’t hurt. I think you can see why I love S. Boulardi so much. It’s my favorite probiotic, and quite possibly the only one I’ll ever take in supplement form from here on out."

Medium.com,Life,Freaky Fly Day: Five Techniques I use to Deal with my Fear of Flying,Travel,https://medium.com/@sempiterna/freaky-fly-day-five-techniques-i-use-to-deal-with-my-fear-of-flying-f043268ab921?source=topic_page---------462------------------1," I used to love flying. I run a travel blog for goodness’ sake! Back in the old days, I used to get three days off in a row and immediately start looking at cheap flights. Over time, I began to have unexplainable nightmares during my flights, then I began fearing the nightmares. When the Ethiopian Airlines plane crashed, that was it. Every flight has me paralysed with fear, sometimes even to the point of crying. You could sit me in front of all the facts, it wouldn’t matter. Yes, I am more likely to die doing literally anything else, yes planes are safe, but anxiety is irrational. Even the above unsplash image makes me queasy. For those, who like me, cannot be appeased by being told planes are safer than cars (seriously, stop telling me that, all you do is make me scared of cars too) here are five super useful techniques I use to calm my fears of flying. I hope they help you too! I had to take a nine hour flight from Melbourne Tullamarine to Bangkok Suvarnabhumi in the height of my fear of flying. The plane was doing all sorts of twerking and jerking. My husband told me outside the window he could see an enormous lightning storm. To get through it, I somehow managed to make Beyoncé’s Netflix documentary ‘Homecoming’ last nine hours. It’s a two hour documentary! But by watching it, and absorbing myself in something other than being 35,000 ft in the air, I managed to relax. If you have the kind of phone that allows you to download movies and tv shows, I highly recommend this. Brooklyn 99 and anything funny is one of my favourite things to watch on a flight because I’m laughing so hard, I tend not to notice the flight is happening. This is straight out of the Jessica Dore playbook. In fact, I learned it from the great lady herself. This is a brilliant technique for managing anxiety. My biggest fear is take off, followed by turbulence. When my anxiety starts to rise, I look around for evidence that makes it clear my anxiety is not rational. Questions you can ask yourself are: Often, airlines will give a choice of seats, and those extra pounds or dollars may be worth a few hours of comfort. The front of the plane is a better choice for nervous fliers because it endures turbulence much less than the back of the plane. Being seated at the front is a quieter journey too. If you can’t do that, consider over-wing seats where you can see what the wing is doing (during turbulence you can see the plane is not in turmoil) as well as flying during the day, when you can more easily see what’s happening outside of the plane. This is something that comes with time. Did you know, Airbus flights and Boeing flights sound different. After months of flying with Airbus, I got used to the whines and whirrs of Airbus, and taking a Boeing plane freaked me out because the noises sounded different and I thought something was wrong. Smithsonian Mag covered some of the noises you’ll hear that are completely normal. Another thing that really helped me was watching the altitude map. What I thought was us plunging tens of thousands of feet, was actually just my plane ascending a couple of feet. For example, what felt like dropping from 35k ft to 30k ft showed on the altitude map as going from 33,662ft to 34,000ft and we ranged from 33,000–35,000ft throughout the course of the flight. If your flight does not have a screen, download maps.me which has a built in altimeter that may display this information. It really helps to disprove what you think is happening in the flight based on the misjudgments your anxiety is pushing through. Sounds counterintuitive right? But this is a technique from cognitive behavioural therapy. What would happen in the worse case scenario? The plane starts going down, how would you handle it? Imagining myself having a huge party at the end as things go down, dancing in the aisles to Smells Like Teen Spirit, knowing that I will handle a crisis like this as well as I handle other crisis, approaching the end with as much grace as I approach other things, all helps me realise that the worst case scenario – as rare as it is – is something I can handle. In the end, you’re really safe, and you know you are! I hope these techniques help you get from one end of the Earth to the other – and if it doesn’t, remember that by not flying, we’re doing the universe a big favour!"
Medium.com,Life,What Color is Travel?,Travel,https://medium.com/@lmcdonell/what-color-is-travel-f186019fd7ab?source=topic_page---------463------------------1," Understanding Life by the Colors we Choose I asked students to tell me what color “Travel” is for them. Answers varied from shades of green to bright red. One girl said red described the word travel because as she started to think about this weekend’s trip to Washington DC with our school; it had been quite some time since she had flown which created a sense of nervousness and fear. A colleague of mine said red when I asked her, but her reasons were quite different. She explained that the word evoked feelings of optimism, excitement and new experiences and therefore red was the color that came to mind. When I thought of the word travel, the color green immediately came to mind. In my mind, the color green is unlimited, and vast. I visualize land that stretches for miles; kind of like the green hills in Ireland. It is funny that the color of money is also my color of travel. Interestingly, that I would use green to paint the word travel and money for different reasons. Travel feels comfortable and unlimited as I have visited several places in the world. However, the word money is green because I see the dollar bill in my mind and that is the color of our currency. When I think of the word budget or debt I see red, and the shade is bright. This is because both of these topics evoke passion, frustration, limit, and fear. When money is by itself it feels non-threatening, expansive and simple. I now realize that it is not until I change my perspective and place my own emotions on a color that I feel uneasy. Money itself is not what bothers me, it is what I associate with money that creates the problem. Since I had looked at travel, money, debt, and budgeting I thought about something that I do every day: running. The first color that came to mind was yellow. To me, yellow feels familiar and ordinary. I am a disciplined runner and don’t miss very many days. When I think about the long-run for the week it feels blue with hints of turquoise. It is a blue that is the shade of the bottom of the ocean. The long run feels endless and peaceful. It is the part of running that allows me to relax and want to soak in over two hours of blisters and bliss. When I think about racing I see red. Racing is challenging. The red that illustrates races is bold, excited and full of power that is ready to be unleashed. The red is daring and a little nervous. Some moments feel exhausting and I wonder how I will manage to finish. Red is the color of fire. Red feels like the color of persistence. Red can be overwhelming but red is never overlooked and not noticed. It makes a statement and is powerful. I hold the same color in my mind for my job. Thinking about it, I have the same reasons for seeing red when I come to work as a middle school teacher that I do when I toe the line in a marathon. The marathon could be used as a metaphor for so many parts of life. I could argue that every part of my life includes hints of red. However, when I think about my life as a writer purple jumps out. Purple has shades of red, but it feels like something more, something special. Purple feels rich and full of untapped potential. It is full of opportunity. Purple is my favorite. Purple reminds me of passion and purpose. These are reasons why I write. When I think about each area of my life, I ask myself what color it is. Not just what color, but which shade and why. I am realizing this is a way to tap into my subconscious thoughts on so many areas and learn about which emotions I associate with parts of my life. Colors are one of the first things we learn to organize and label. What if something so incredibly simple has the power to unlock our deepest thoughts?"

Medium.com,Life,Don’t Let Boeing off the Hook for the 737 MAX Disasters,Travel,https://onezero.medium.com/dont-let-boeing-off-the-hook-for-the-737-max-disasters-1ead1ef957c1?source=topic_page---------465------------------1," ix months and billions in losses after two of its 737 MAX airliners suffered deadly crashes, Boeing is still working on a fix for the troubled aircraft model. What’s clear by now is that the problem isn’t just, as originally suspected, a faulty sensor. Like a homeowner whose attempt to repair a soft spot in the molding reveals a rotten joist and then a whole rotten wall, the facts behind 737 MAX fiasco reveal a corporate culture that has been quietly deteriorating for decades. While the proximate cause of the accident was a piece of hardware you can fit in your hand, solving the problem might require tearing the company down to its foundation. Thanks to reporting by many superb journalists, the genesis of the tragedy is now understood in detail. The tale begins in the 2000s, when Boeing decided against investing in a clean-sheet replacement for its hugely popular but aging 737 narrow-body jet. It continued in the 2010s, when the company decided to make massive payouts to investors through dividends and stock buybacks rather than invest in engineers or technology. And it reached its culmination with the decision to hastily update the 737 by slapping together a Frankenplane whose powerful new engines caused it to be dynamically unstable. To paper over the plane’s flaws, Boeing fitted it with an ill-conceived automated system that would spring into action at unexpected times, and farmed out the software that ran it to coders in India. Worst of all, it didn’t even tell pilots that the system existed. The 737 MAX is considerably less than perfect. But even after the grounding Boeing kept building more. To be sure, the 737 MAX that started to roll off the production line in Renton, Washington in February 2018 was mostly fine. It was sleek, efficient, and solidly constructed. And it worked as intended almost all the time. But in modern aviation, 99.99% reliable is not reliable enough. Tens of thousands of planes take off every day, and in order to preserve public confidence, all of them have to land in one piece. A plane that crashes once every hundred thousand times isn’t good enough. And there’s no reason today for anyone to build a plane that is less than perfect. The 737 MAX is considerably less than perfect. But even after the grounding Boeing kept building more. The company now has some 250 undelivered planes on its hands, more than it can fit in parking lots in Renton, so it has started shipping them down to the California desert. It’s currently adding another 42 to the inventory every month. The world is hungry for new airplanes, but the wait for the 737 MAX to be declared airworthy is stretching way beyond what Boeing’s customers expected. In the immediate aftermath of the grounding, Boeing hoped to have a fix ready within weeks. Then it had to further postpone that fix. Now it doesn’t expect to have the first planes back in the air until the fourth quarter, at the earliest. In some parts of the world, the wait could be considerably longer. Last week, Bloomberg reported that Ryanair CEO Michael O’Leary called the delay in 737 deliveries the greatest operational challenge for his airline. “The best outlook for the first aircraft will come in January, more realistic outlook is end of February or March,” he said. “If it runs later than March, April, or May we will have to take some more aircraft out of next summer’s schedule and slow down growth further.” Getting the plane in the air isn’t just a question of Boeing fixing its problems, however. Boeing has to convince authorities in the U.S. and around the world that its solutions will really work. How to restore trust? As they say in recovery, the first step is admitting that you have a problem. Somewhere along the way, a company that was all about building airplanes had become something else. Aggressive acquisitions turned Boeing into a conglomerate. It moved its headquarters from Washington state to Chicago. Its priorities shifted from making great airplanes to engineering great financial results. Between 2013 and 2019, its spending on research languished while it poured more than $60 billion into stock buybacks and dividends. CEO Dennis Muilenburg’s compensation in 2018 grew 27% to $23.8 million to $30 million even as quality control problems in Boeing factories multiplied. In this context, writes the New Republic’s Maureen Tkacik, the 737 MAX “was the entirely predictable outcome of the byzantine process by which investment capital becomes completely abstracted from basic protocols of production and oversight.” Change is needed — but change can be painful. It’s easy to tell oneself that everything is basically fine, that the real problem is someone else. Boeing management has consistently tried to shift blame for the fatal accidents to the pilots at the controls. And they’re not without advocates among the ranks of journalists. Disrespect for one’s customers does not make for healthy business relationships. Nor does cutting costs at the expense of quality. In the New York Times Magazine, writer William Langewiesche places ultimate responsibility for the two fatal crashes on the poor training of the Indonesian and Ethiopian pilots who were at the controls. “It was the decisions made by four of those pilots, more than the failure of a single obscure component, that led to 346 deaths and the worldwide grounding of the entire fleet,” he writes. Langewiesche, himself an experienced commercial pilot, is confident that had he been at the controls, he would have known what to do. He is a real airman, someone who has wrestled the yoke in many dangerous real-world situations. Today’s young pilots, Langewiesche suggests, are ill-trained and hapless. They learn by rote and cheat on tests and generally suck, especially those from developing countries. Langewiesche has talked to several retired white men who agree on this point: Dave Carbaugh, the former Boeing test pilot, spent his first 10 years with the company traveling the globe to teach customers how to fly its airplanes. He mentioned the challenge of training pilots in Asia. “Those were the rote pilots,” he said. I asked about China specifically. He said: “The Chinese? They were probably the worst.” One need not squint too hard to read this kind of characterization as inherently racist. But this perspective is apparently endemic in the industry. Langewiesche reports that Lion Air founder and chairman Rusdi Kirana feels Boeing to be “presumptuous and typically condescending” and quotes him as saying: “They look down on my airline and my country […] they treat us as third-world.” Disrespect for one’s customers does not make for healthy business relationships. Nor does cutting costs at the expense of quality. For decades, Boeing has profited handsomely from its unimpeachable reputation. But trust is easier to lose than to earn. The stacks of 737 MAXs piling up in parking lots are a bonfire of both cash and goodwill. If Boeing wants to save its reputation from the flames it should swallow its pride, oust its feckless management, and return to building planes worthy of its founder’s name."

Medium.com,Life,How to Make Boarding Passes More Traveler-Friendly,Travel,https://modus.medium.com/a-better-boarding-pass-e269e646253d?source=topic_page---------467------------------1," someone who has travelled to 108 countries and territories so far, flying 35 to 40 airlines from six continents, I’ve had the chance to study airline boarding passes at some length. Being a travel and design aficionado, I go so far as to keep all my boarding passes, classifying them by various criteria and comparing the designs among airlines. In my opinion, too few airlines pay attention to the design of their boarding pass. Lately, even the branding colors and the logo have disappeared from some ticket designs. Below is an example from Malaysia Airlines (until recently one of only a few five-star airlines in the world, according to Skytrax ratings) and another from United Airlines (sold as a flight codeshare via All Nippon Airlines, a five-star airline). As one can easily notice, not much consideration is given to the hierarchy of information or the grouping of similar elements. In fact, the data seems haphazardly printed on both these tickets. With examples like these, it’s honestly pretty easy to create something significantly better, as even a modicum of attention to detail would generate an improved experience. First, let’s look at the prototype below. I divided the boarding pass into three equal sections, framed by two bands of equal size at each end (note that one of the bands is tearable). Now, let’s ask ourselves what are the three most important things to know about your flight when you are at the airport, right after you’ve checked in. Based on my research, these are: In other words: General info, pre-boarding, and boarding. Since you already know your own name, where you’re flying, and what day it is, the first section is more useful for the TSA (Transportation Security Administration) officers and personnel who double check the boarding pass before entering the passport control area. However, an increasing number of these officers are now equipped with scanners that gather all the information from the same barcode scanned by the flight attendants when boarding the plane. Personally, I would prefer to only display the passenger info as the initial of the first name + last name (in this case, “D. Vuia”) for privacy reasons. Far too often, as people wait in line to board the plane, they keep their passes in full view, with their names displayed boldly for prying eyes to see. For this example, however, I will leave it as full first and last names. The really important piece of information in this section is the flight number, as this is the one detail the traveller needs to know prior to starting the process of getting to the gate, as they check the monitors for additional information, and also to see if the flight is on time, has any delays, or if the gate has changed. One of the improvements in this design is displaying the flight number with the original airline (in this case, Air France AF374) and also the codeshare flight KL0681 (in this case, a KLM flight). When checking the status monitors, one will notice that flight info may be displayed in three or four formats, depending on the codeshare agreements with the partner airlines. It can look something like this (however these codes would be displayed alternatively, not all at once): AF0374 / KL0681 / DL5672 It is sometimes beneficial to have at least the second format printed on the boarding pass, as passengers often stare at the monitor visibly confused when they see the destination and time of departure, but not the flight number they were originally familiar with. This is the main area of focus for any traveller before they get to the gate. The boarding time and terminal/gate numbers are the most important pieces of data and therefore should be emphasized. I see some boarding passes with the departure time printed, but that might create confusion and make the passenger think that’s the time when they should arrive at the gate (which, obviously, would be far too late). A basic map could be added to help orient the passenger to the direction of their gate, in relation to the security area/passport control. Also, having the sentence “average walking time to your gate after passing through security:” followed by a blank row for the variable [time] would let the passenger know how many extra minutes to allow for that journey. Sometimes, it might take 20 or more minutes to walk to the gate. Add to that a stop to the bathroom or a tired child, and it can become half an hour. So, you’ve arrived safely at the gate, hopefully with time to spare. If it’s a large airplane, you will notice a few queue rows set up at the gate, with large numbers above them, usually from 1 to 5. This is the boarding sequence. Airlines have finally realized that filling an airplane should be done like filling a bottle: from the bottom, up. If you invite the passengers in rows 1 to 20 to board first (assuming Economy starts at row 1), all passengers situated in rows 21 and higher would later have to crawl over the ones already boarded, as they arrange their suitcases and fuss around. It’s best to start boarding with the rows in the back of the plane and move toward the front. Of course, Premium Economy, Business, First Class, and passengers with children are awarded priority above all else. The example above highlights the most important detail to remember: your seat number. It also tells you where it is located (by the window in this case), displays a small icon with a yellow dot to show on which side and in which area of the plane your seat is located, and finally, shows a snippet of a map with your seat highlighted, similar to the ones online when you are given the choice to select your seat. (For this example, I used a snippet with only a 2–2 seat configuration, but in reality, a flight from Paris to Vancouver would have a 2–4–2 or a 3–3–3 configuration.) Below all that is the infamous barcode, containing all your sensitive information used by the gate and flight personnel to identify you. And now, on to the side bars, one of which is tearable. Most current boarding passes have a tearable section that is about a third of the length of the ticket and that contains essentially the same information as the rest of pass. This is the stub, which you keep and show to the flight attendants as they direct you to your seat when you get on the airplane. This design reduces the tearable stub to only a fraction of the original length and adds another one at the other end. Both display vital information such as the flight number, boarding time, gate, and seat number vertically. Why is that? So that when the boarding pass sits in your passport, you do not have to take it out to review the info. You can just glance at it at any point. Oh, but wait—where is the branding and logo in all this? Well, as I mentioned before, more and more airlines choose to go with the generic black and white pass, with a logo perhaps in an outlined font. In this case, the side stubs could be the airline’s branding color and the logo could be displayed on the verso. Another option is to use one of the stubs (the non-tearable one) for this purpose. Either way, the option is there."
Medium.com,Life,Indrajatra,Travel,https://medium.com/@razenmanandhar/indrajatra-29db6757081?source=topic_page---------468------------------1," Razen Manandhar Yenyaa, which is also known as Indra Jatra, is perhaps the biggest and the most eventful festival of Kathmandu. Literally, “Yen” means Kathmandu and “Yaa” means celebration or procession. This is now commonly known as Indra Jatra for the outsiders, which present the Indra as the central figure of the festival. This autumn festival also marks the beginning of the most revered festival of the Hindus, the Dashain. The eight-day long festival is one of the most exciting and colourful festivals of the Newar community. In fact, this is an assortment of around two dozen separate events, shows or processions, which fall on the same period of time, in various parts of the core of Kathmandu. It consists of the elegant chariot procession of the “royal” Kumari, the Living Goddess, visit of the president and other dignitaries, series of mask-dances, a showcase of a tableau and so on. The festival follows the lunar calendar. It starts from Yonlathwa Dwadashi and ends on Yonlaga Tritiya, that is, in around the middle of September. Kumari History has not yet traced the origins of the Kumari tradition. So far, the chronicles argue that it started as early as in the time of a twelve-century ruler Gunkam Dev, to whom the credit of making this Kathmandu city goes. A chronicle says that he instituted Yenyaa festival by erecting the images of Kumaris. Writers have stated that manuscripts written in 1280 and 1285 AD describe the method of choosing, ornamenting and worshipping Kumari. Interestingly, a young girl from exclusive Newar Buddhist family of Shakyas is elected in around every half-decade to be worshipped as Taleju, the clan deity of Hindu Kings of Nepal. In the past, she was the main protector deity of the rulers. This is the reason, the heads of the states do visit her at least once in a year to pay homage to her. Nepal has now turned into a republic and secular state, but the head of the state continues the age-old tradition by paying a visit on the first day of the chariot festival and on the last day too to receive her blessing. People believe that the country is protected by the goddess and she gives the power and rights to the head of the state to take all formal proceedings for one year. In the past, people were not aware of the importance of education. Now, the Kumari receives a special tutor in her house and she attends all examinations. After retirement from her position, she goes back to her home and lives a normal life, joins collage, gets the job and gets married in due time. And Kathmandu Metropolitan City has allocated certain allowance for her, to pay tribute to her contribution for the society and the country. Ganesh Similar to the tradition of Kumari, a boy from a Newar Buddhist family is also selected to make an attendant of Goddess Kumari. He is known as Ganesha. He does not have a separate house to live during his tenure. He comes to Kumari House for the procession and then goes back. After a certain age, he is also retired and goes back to normal life. Bhairava Just like Kumari and Ganesh, a boy is also selected to make Bhairava, another attendant of Goddess Kumari. The chariots of Ganesh and Kumari precede that of Kumari during the procession. After the festival, both the Ganesha and Bhairava go back to their homes and continue their normal life. Both of them receive allowances from the Kathmandu Metropolitan City Office these days. Chariot procession The most visible and crowd-attracting event of this festival is, of course, Kumari Jatra, the chariot procession of Kumari, the living goddess and those of Ganesha and Bhairava. The living goddess Kumari is taken out in a procession through the main streets of Kathmandu in a decorated chariot. The processions take place with three four-wheeled chariots. Two chariots of the gods precede, while the bigger one, that belongs to the Kumari, comes at the end of the procession. The history of the process is not very old, however. It is said that the last king of the Malla dynasty of Kathmandu, King Jaya Prakash Malla started this procession in 1756 AD. The president, the prime ministers, ministers as well as ambassadors come to enjoy the first day of the procession at Gaddi Baithaka of Basantapur. Along with the chariots, the dance troupes of Lakhey, Akash Bhairava and Pulukisi as well as dozens of musical troupes, with their traditional drums and cymbals, join the crowd. The procession goes to three areas on three days. On the first day “Kwaneyaa”, the chariots are taken to southern quarters. On the second day “Thaneyaa”, they go to northern quarters. The last day “Nanichayaa” is for the central quarters. On the last day of the festival, including the president, other stage dignitaries visit the temple to receive blessing from the Kumari. This procession is totally Hindu, for the deities, the girl as well as the boys represent, are all Hindu. Still, the procession is followed by five Buddhist priests, who represent five dhyani Buddhas. This can be taken as an example of social harmony in the Kathmandu Valley. 00 Yosin pole Solemn erection of Yosin, a wooden pole, made of a single tree trunk, in front of the historic royal palace of Hanumandhoka signals the commencement of the festival. The pole is made of a pine tree, selected following the tantric rituals in a particular jungle of Nala, Bhaktapur. It is brought to Kathmandu by dragging manually along the streets for around 29 kilometres. Bringing of the pole as well as erection of it is done by the members of Manandhar community, by using a primitive technique. A special dance of Dee Pyakhan is performed here in this annual event. A special banner is hung from the top, and a golden image of Indra, sitting on an elephant is kept at the bottom. People in groups visit the pole, worship, sing hymns and also offer oil lamps during the whole week. These days, some men from Nepal Army also provide support for this event. And a troop of soldiers in traditional uniform celebrate the completion of the Yosin ceremony with gunshots. Hundreds of people come to watch this event and many of them think that any accident in this event forecasts a stroke of bad luck for the country. And finally, after completion of the third round of the chariot procession, this Yosin is fallen, with the same mass, cheerfulness and religious rituals and taken to the river. 00 Upaku procession On the first day evening, people take a long walk along the periphery lanes in memory of their family members who have passed away in one year. They also offer tiny butter lamps to different shrines on the way. Some others come in groups and walk along, singing hymns along the same route. Similarly, some of the trust members come with their drums and others chant Buddhist and Hindu hymns on the way. The procession goes along the streets of Maru, Chaswando, Damaitol, Nyata, Tunchhe Galli, Kulanbhulu Ajima, Chhatrapati, Swanchhapu Ganesh, Thahiti, Jyatha, Inbahal, Kamalachhi Galli, Taha Galli, Bhotahiti, Mahabauddha, Tasithu Ganesh, Bhosikwo, Duganbahil, Tebahal, Sundhara, Bagdarbar Ganabahal, Galan, Mahabauddha, Naypacho, Wonde, Hyumata, Kwohiti, Bhindyo, Kwaparakyaba, Koprakyaba, Khyokyaba and Maru. In addition, this is also to be noted that a similar Upaku procession is also taken out around the Pashupati area. 00 Dagin procession On the night of the first chariot procession day, a man, wearing a gloomy white mask and a woman’s attire, make a long walking procession along the Kathmandu streets. That man is acting as the legendary mother of Indra, who had come to Kathmandu in search of her son. A legend has it that Indra (the Hindu king of deities), once visited Kathmandu to steal some bunches of night jasmine flowers (locally called Palijaa swan) for her mother, who was performing some rituals of mother-goddess Basundhara. Unfortunately, he was caught red-handed and bound him in the market place against a pillar, stretching his hands. Here, this masked person is supporting the myth of the mother, of searching for her son in the dark night. A musical troupe precedes the masked goddess. Then thousands of people, who have lost their family members in the one year, mostly in white dresses, take fast and follow her in the procession along the streets. The participants follow the festival route north to Asan and then back to Durbar Square. The procession starts from Luku Falcha, Maru and continues around mid-town of the core city. They walk along the streets of Maru, Pyaphal, Yatkha, Nyata, Tengal, Nhyokha, Nhaikantol, Asan, Keltol, Indrachok, Makhan, Hanumandhoka, Maru, Chikanmugal, Jaisidewal, Lagan, Hyumata, Bhimsensthan and finally the procession ends at Maru. The participants also leave some bunches of various types of dry beans along the street while walking. 00 Bau Mata Bau Mata is another procession that takes place on the night of the first chariot procession. It consists of a long effigy, made of reeds. This represents a burning dragon with a big head. It is decorated with rows of around three dozen tiny oil lamps stuck on the reeds and looks quite attractive in the dark streets. It is hung on ropes and carried by a row of people on their shoulders. It is jointly done by members of various quarters of Manandhars. After the episode of Dagin comes to half of its procession, a group of people, belonging to a certain community, take them along the same traditional route, making lots of noise on the way. Like the procession of Dagin, this also goes along the streets of Maru, Pyaphal, Yatkha, Nyata, Tengal, Nhyokha, Nhaikantol, Asan, Keltol, Indrachok, Makhan, Hanumandhoka, Maru, Chikanmugal, Jaisidewal, Lagan, Hyumata, Bhimsensthan and Maru. It becomes almost midnight when this procession completes. Shweta Bhairava Bhairava is the wrathful manifestation of Hindu god Shiva. This is one of the deities worshipped during the festival of Indrajatra. Huge images of Bhairava is an interesting part of this festival. The streets, mainly those, where the chariot procession takes place, are decorated with mask figures of the Bhairava. They are the age-old manifestation of Newar art too. These masks are, in fact, big earthen or metal pots, filled with liquor. The liquor comes out of a long tube stuck in the mouth of the mask. Most of the time, this liquor is released when the chariots arrive. And hundreds of young people push one another to drink some drops of it directly from the pipe. Akash Bhairava This is another image of Bhairava, placed in front of its temple at Wonghaa (Indrachowk). It is relatively smaller than Shweta Bhairava, but heavily decorated with fresh flowers every day throughout the festive week. Thre is a huge vase behind the blue-painted mask and also has a similar pipe attached to its mouth. Liquor is released from this mouth at the time of arrival of the chariots and people again put all efforts to drink some drops from the pipe. They take it has the holy blessing of Bhairava. Some say that this mask of Aakash Bhairava is the head of King Yalambara, who went to participate in the war of Mahabharata, a Hindu epic, and his head was chopped off in the war. Throughout the festival week, different troupes from the Valley come here to perform their devotional songs in front of the temple. And a crowd is gathered there every day. Bakadey Bhairava Bakadey Bhairava is the third big image of Bhairava displayed during the festival. It is kept at a lane going from Indrachowk to Wotu. The image of Bakadey is quite similar to Akash Bhairava. This is also decorated with a carpet of fresh flowers every day. Apart from this, many other smaller faces of Bhairava can be seen displayed in different quarters of the city in the period of the festival. Unfortunately, many of them are disappearing year by year. Similarly, quite many other places are also decorated with images of such Bhairavas in the streets. Those which deliver liquor form the Bhairava’s mouth are named as “Hathu Dyo” and all such images of Bhairava are commonly called “Aju Dyo”. Young people often go around such images and ask for Samay-baji, a tradition Newar set cuisine, consisting of bitten rice, chopped and smoked buff meat and others. Indra Images Apart from masks of Bhairava, another visible image displaying during the festival is that of Indra. Images of Indraraj Dyo with his outstretched hands bound with rope are exhibited on a tall platform at Maru near Durbar Square. Similar images are on display also in and at Indrachowk, Naradevi, Mazipat and some other quarters of the core Kathmandu. This Indra is the main character of the celebration of Indra Jatra. This is the reason this festival is given this name. According to a legend, once, Indra, the Hindu king of deities, was caught red-handed by the locals of Kathmandu while he was trying to steal some bunches of unique flower Palijaa Swan. They took him for an ordinary thief and insulted him by tying him up against a pillar, stretching both of his hands. Later, the locals recognized him and celebrated his arrival in Kathmandu. The biggest such image is kept next to the Kasthamandapa and other communities. Others display smaller such images in other parts of the core city. This practise is followed in Pashuptai and Bode area as well. But again, many of them have ceased displaying such images. Some argue that this image belongs to a typical Newar deity named Yomba-dyo and it does not attribute Indra, the Vedic deity of King of the gods. They claim this is only a result of Hinduization of Newar culture of the Kathmandu Valley. Majipa Lakhey Indra Jatra is also a festival of mask dances. Among others, the most popular is the fierce-looking demon, named Lakhey. According to historians, the tradition began as early as in the seventh century, though opinions vary about the exact date. A popular legend has it that a man-eating demon fell in love with a local farmer girl and married her on the condition that he would protect the city and stop eating human flesh. The dance is to honour the Lakhe’s keeping of the promise. On the other hand, some people call him Shanta Bhairava, that is, this demon is a manifestation of Bhairava but he is relatively peaceful and does not accept animal sacrifices etc. There is a Lakhey House in Lakhenani Mazipat, from where the dance of Lakhey is taken out around Kathmandu streets during the eight-day Indrajatra. People believe that the wearer of the sacred mask is possessed by the demon-god. And he dances in trance. Along with the beats of the drums and cymbals, the Lakhe jumps here and there and entertains the crowd during the festival. He is accompanied by a young boy Jhyalincha, who teases and provokes him to demonstrate more wrathful modes of the dance. The demon-god dance of Majipa Lakhey is performed on the streets and market squares. The Newar families of Ranjitkars have been keeping the tradition of Lakhey alive. Dee Pyakhan Dee Pyakhan, performed exclusively during the festival of Yenyaa or Indra Jatra is one important variety of mask dance. It is performed by the farmers’ community of Kilagal, Kathmandu. Probably, this name is derived from Sanskrit word Devi. Pyakhan means dance and drama in Newa language. A legend has it, a lengthy epidemic hit the country and people died at an alarming rate. And, the king of that time saw a dream that the prime Goddess came to him and told him to commence a dance of goddesses. The king asked the experts to design a dance of the goddess and her team. The dance thus started and peace prevailed in the country. Seven characters play roles in this dance. It also tells a story of how Kumari, the daughter of Bhairava and Chandi, kills the demon, the Daity. Kawon, Betaa and Khyaa are other assisting characters of this dance drama. Musical instrument players, as well as singers, also give company to the dancers. KMC Photobook 2019"
Medium.com,Life,The High-Flying Life of an International Journalist/Adventure Traveler,Travel,https://medium.com/@jhubbel/the-high-flying-life-of-an-international-journalist-adventure-traveler-e5da9544c219?source=topic_page---------469------------------1," The early morning Mongolian sun is rising beyond the helter-skelter towers that have popped up like butt-ugly mushrooms against the skies here in Ulaan Bataar, the capital. At barely 6:30 am, the traffic is just a few minutes before insanity. Anyone who has traveled here can speak to that piece of UB life, but I digress for now. My Outdoor Research pants, newly washed in the bathroom sink and dried with all the towels I could find in the bathroom (please don’t wash your clothing in our sinks) are drying in the morning air. My problem is that I am leaving very early tomorrow morning, long after the local laundress will be done with them and all my Icebreaker socks, so sink it is. In this waning summer, the dry air will take care of business swiftly, for which I am most grateful. There’s no hot water in this hotel room. Or, let’s just say that what does come out out is so tepid that it’s little more than a sun-warmed stream, which in all frankness I’d prefer. Because at least out in the countryside, the air is so fresh and clean you think you’re on a different planet. And you get this: Because when my guide Naka brought me here last night — a move we had to make because the Lotus Guesthouse room where I’d already settled was situated right above an extremely busy street corner and families with screaming babies lived upstairs- the first thing that greeted me was the unmistakable smell of raw sewage. I just wanted a quiet place to sleep before heading back out on the road tomorrow. So I traded screaming for sewage. Sigh. It’s no secret that UB has an infrastructure problem. On the outside, the city seems to be all modern hustle and bustle. On the inside, it is beset with the kinds of rapid-growth issues that all fast-growing cities in the world suffer. They cannot possibly keep up with the growth, and what serves right now is simply awful, especially if you walk into a relatively expensive hotel room expecting something different. As in: no sewage smell, hot water, potable water ( you are strongly warned not to drink the water, and by the way, the water system shuts down unpredictably in summer for repairs, we’re sorry, but that’s the way it is…)and a shower drain that actually drains. Twice since I’ve been here I took the time to wash my hair, which falls all the way down my back. The resulting flood ended up in the hallway, to my chagrin, as the water simply refused to drain. I ended up getting on my knees and using the dull end of my toothbrush to clean out great massive wads of hair, likely from every tourist on the planet, that had likely been there for many years. There is a sink and kitchen just to my left. You’d think that would be a good thing, since I also have a fridge- convenient, right? The sink is a prime offender in the sewage smell department, being a long, seven-story tube which allows whatever happens to be in the basement to waft upwards. And, as it were, right into my room. Last night I dumped the very nicely fragranced shampoo into that sink, which quelled the odor somewhat, then slept with a brand new bar of Nivea on my pillow. You deal. Some years ago I was staying at a very nice Hilton for business in Atlanta or some southern city. That bathroom also had a problem with reek. When I called down there was great consternation, and an immediate apology, and I was not only moved forthwith but compensated for the night. Here, it’s just the way it is. Sewage smells are normal here. Out in the bush, which is barely outside the city limits (which are constantly moving outwards at speed) drop toilets are the norm. Not only are the older ones damned dangerous (imagine balancing precariously on very old wood, wood that has held the collective weight of millions of pissers and shitters) but also over a massive hole in the ground full of same, into which you feel strongly that you are about to take a tumble. Yesterday my crew and I stopped at a roadside spot en route back to UB and I did my best not to howl with laughter as I tried to relieve myself standing on ancient plywood over a hole so huge the Mongolian wind actually blew my unmentionables back up in my general direction. I could do an entire series of articles on long drop toilets but I suspect it wouldn’t get much play. Still, they’d be funny. In the rare instances (twice so far) that I’ve been supplied with a functioning hair dryer, I have used it to dry a lot more than my hair. They are also pretty effective at warming you up in buildings that have no heat, which is kind of everywhere. There are other dangers, too. Last night, when I headed out to the Circle K downstairs from the Lotus (before the screaming babies sent me screaming) I was using the banister to get downstairs. The stairs are painted a garish orange (just in case you didn’t realize you were on stairs) and so was the banister. As I ran my hand down as I walked, something tore the holy shit out of my hand. Suddenly there was blood everywhere. I walked back up, and sure enough, the banister had a long, raw line of wood that was pointed upwards. You should see the cut on my hand. It’s impressive. No way you could have seen that raw edge of painted wood in the thin, grey light of the stairwell. You might be one of those folks who gets pissed at the Feds for intruding in your business, but this is one of those perfect examples of where OSHA plays a key role. I have been in so many guesthouse stairwells where the lights didn’t work and you can’t see where you’re putting your feet. The stair wells are strewn with trash. That’s a serious accident waiting to happen. As a traveler, this isn’t what you signed up for: a midnight trip to the local ER because you did an ass- over teakettle trying to manhandle your luggage up four flights of steps in a guesthouse with no elevator. I’m not terribly sure what folks imagine I “get” to do while I’m out on the road like this. Most assuredly, there are memorable moments."

Medium.com,Life,How I Connected With My African-American Roots in Italy,Travel,https://medium.com/airbnbmag/https-medium-com-airbnbmag-italianroots-7d184a258469?source=topic_page---------471------------------1," Illustration by Kadir Nelson he feeling catches me unexpectedly; it flutters in on the synthesized melody of a Euro boy band getting down in the piazza, on drums thwacking, electric strings twanging, and the pure joy of a big sweaty crowd swaying in the muggy night air. I am too enrapt to notice what’s happening the exact moment the unburdening occurs, and that’s probably a good thing. I’ve been conditioned to grab that feeling and squash it before it takes hold. Back in the States, such weightlessness, forgetting that melanin often incites malice, can be at once seductive and deadly. But on this hot night in the Piazza di Santa Maria in Trastevere, Rome, surrounded by modern rock and ancient stone, I decide to let go. I had arrived in Italy from the U.S. a bit tense, and eager for the typical tourist indulgences of good food, wine, and sightseeing. But until that moment in the piazza, far removed from crazed American suspicion, I had been unable to shake the images of the viral video of a Phoenix cop yelling at a pregnant black woman: “I’m gonna fucking put a cap in your fucking head!”; was still sickened from scrolling through the vile, racist, violent Facebook posts by dozens of cops in ­Philadelphia; was still haunted by images of hundreds of immigrant children warehoused in filthy cages along the South Texas border. But on the piazza, the tension faded. I suppose, on some deeper level, black travel has always been as much about survival as recreation, a search for an antidote to the nagging or Richter-scale pain, past and present. My first transatlantic getaway, a couple decades ago, was to visit a friend in Paris, the most famous if not clichéd destination for weary black souls. In my mid-30s, the fatigue of pathological white scrutiny — at work, in stores, in my neighborhood — was already taking a toll. Walking through the City of Light, I felt an instant sense of levity and renewal reflecting on the legacy of black expats, artists, and intellectuals, from Louis Armstrong to Count Basie, from Richard Wright to James Baldwin, who had walked those same streets, free to live and ply their trade far removed from Jim Crow segregation. “Paris,” the late poet Langston Hughes had once gushed: “There you can be whatever you want to be. Totally yourself.” But something more powerful than intellectualism and idolatry draws me to Italy, something more magnetic: a visceral connection to Italian culture and its expressiveness, a messy swirl of pop images, dialogue, and lyrics — from Mario Puzo’s The Godfather (“I’ll make him an offer he can’t refuse”) to Sal, the gruff pizzeria owner in Spike Lee’s Do the Right Thing (“You see this fucking place? I built this fucking place with my bare fucking hands”), to shopping mall melodies of Frank Sinatra, quintessential Casanova and boss. It’s a culture that has overlapped with my own. As Jay-Z raps on “Empire State of Mind”: “I’m the new Sinatra, and since I made it here, I can make it anywhere. Yeah, they love me everywhere.” Of course, there’s also a deep wellspring of black social and political history here, dating back to at least World War II when the Tuskegee Airmen and the Buffalo Soldiers, both segregated divisions, helped bring an end to Nazi occupation in Italy — despite being second-class citizens in their home country. The connections moved beyond the battlefield: Indeed, a popular Neapolitan song from the 1940s, “Tammurriata Nera,” blushes at the affairs between Italian women and Negro soldiers. “Nunziatina! Nunziatina! / Eh, what’s up? / Look what happened! / What happened? / Dunetta Bomba-bomba has just given birth! / Eh!? / She had a child all black, just like coal!” suppose my connection to Italy is not so different than my late mother’s lasagna — layered, flavorful, and shamelessly cheesy. It’s also somewhat earned: African Americans have been traveling here since at least the 1850s, as slaves brought by their owners; as musicians, writers, activists, and public intellectuals; and as tourists like me hoping, perhaps vainly, to see ourselves fully or to even glimpse our humanness in mirrors foreign and undistorted. Even the abolitionist Frederick Douglass couldn’t hide his giddiness over pending travels to the Eternal City, enthusing in his 1892 memoir: “All that one has ever read, heard, felt, thought, or imagined concerning Rome comes thronging upon mind and heart and makes one eager and impatient to be there.” Strolling amidst the stone and marble carcasses surrounding the Roman Forum on a humid afternoon — from the decayed arches of the Basilica of Maxentius, a behemoth government building, to the skeletal Ionic columns of the Temple of Saturn, one of the oldest sacred places in Rome — I snap a few pictures of the fallen dynasty while trying to ignore the peddlers and street hustlers vying for my attention. My step might be lighter here, but I am still haunted by home. I think of Detroit, where I was born and raised, itself a fallen dynasty, a crater left by the implosion of the auto industry, police brutality (take, for instance, the police raid of an after-hours bar that left 43 black patrons dead and incited the 1967 Detroit riot), white flight, and concentrated poverty. In a grotesque way, the ruins of Rome, and its subsequent scrappiness — all its pushy purveyors of bottled water and portable phone chargers and cheap tchotchkes — feel strangely familiar to me, like home separated by a couple thousand years. By the time I see the famed Colosseum, pale and hulking and hollowed out in the distance, the sight transports me, rather irrationally, back to the Americas and the horrors of the antebellum South. I imagine Rome’s gladiators, the niggers of the ancient world, bludgeoning each other for sport for the ruling class, like in Quentin Tarantino’s slave fantasy film, Django Unchained. Unlike the other tourists that surround me, there is no romance in imagining gladiators as death-defying warriors; I can only pity them as the slaves they actually were, trained to fight to the death with daggers, swords, forks, and nets, who at the behest of their masters, faced off against other slaves and criminals with as many as 50,000 people cheering them on. I think it was my granddaddy who spoke of similar spectacles during the Jim Crow era, of so-called “battle royales” — staged black-on-black brawls at carnivals or before boxing matches, in which men and boys were paid a pittance to beat each other senseless. The New-York Tribune blithely described such a match in its August 18, 1915 paper: “Six big, husky negroes were mingling in a battle royal at the old Long Acre Club, in Twenty-­ninth Street, one night. To be more exact, five were big, but the other hadn’t flirted with a steak in weeks. It so happened that the five picked on the one, and ere long the little fellow was knocked down. He was wise, this little fellow, and, rising on all-fours, he crawled across the ring, climbed over the lower rope, and dropped to the floor. ‘Hey, you!’ yelled Mike Newman, ‘ain’t you going to fight any more?’ ‘Oh, yes Marse Newman. Ahm goin’ to fight plenty more. But no more to-night!’ replied the coon, and he kept his word.” Standing in front of the Colosseum, I snap a couple of ­selfies. Through the ages, it seems, Italy’s black tourists are lulled easily away from protest to pleasure — which is strange given the fact that Italy has its own history with racism. (Think of the hateful rhetoric hurled at the country’s first black minister, Cécile Kyenge, when she was appointed immigration minister several years ago.) But even David Dorr, the Louisiana house slave and armchair historian who was forced to take a world tour with his owner, wrote an entire book of his travels, including a chapter on Rome, with nary a wink at the gladiators’ plight — or even his own. Modern scholars seemed more impressed by the enslaved man’s lyrical language and worldly sensibility than the text’s sly omission of sightseeing on a leash. “We wear the mask that grins and lies,” goes the Paul Laurence Dunbar poem. Some of Dorr’s lush descriptions would make Martha Stewart blush. “The way they make macaroni in Rome, is thus,” he writes, “when it is hot or warm the men stand by the aperture that squeezes into a reed-like shape, and wind it round their bodies until they are totally covered or mantled, and then they walk around in great haste until it is nearly cool, after which they walk on the aforesaid platform and unwind themselves from its cooling grasp, and there it stays until it comes totally dry, after which they box it for export.” Ultimately, though, Dorr’s tale is redemptive: Upon his return to New ­Orleans, when his owner reneges on his promise to set Dorr free, Dorr escapes on the underground railroad, fleeing to Ohio, and in 1858 self-publishes A Colored Man Round the World, perhaps the first African American–authored travelogue, years before the abolishment of slavery. Fernando, my taxi driver, begins the trip away from Rome through the urban congestion and the honking horns. (Accelerating past a swerving sedan and merging onto the freeway, Fernando slaps his forehead in frustration, crying out in clipped English: “The mother of idiots is always pregnant!”) Finally, about an hour north of the city, the chaos gradually fades into a rolling green countryside where narrow dirt roads wind through the town of Monteleone Sabino and funnel toward an ancient villa called La Torretta. Constructed as a convent from Roman ruins around the 13th century, La Torretta was restored as a country house in 1995, and its magnificent mountain views kindle thoughts in me of how the African American–Italian affinity has, historically, cut both ways. Looking out over lush valleys and vineyards, I think about how Italians once drew strength from African Americans’ epic fight for freedom, and how nourishing it is when other ethnicities affirm our cultural contributions unsolicited — how it feels to unabashedly trumpet our intelligence, creativity, humanity … anything other than the trope of our genius with a ball or dance beat. After the Second World War, black writers such as Langston Hughes, Zora Neale Hurston, and Richard Wright became all the rage among prominent Italian ­intellectuals who, in their own opposition to Italian ­fascism, viewed African American artists as kindred spirits. The Italian journalist and writer Italo Calvino argued that Richard Wright’s Black Boy, an autobiography that recounts the hardships of growing up in Mississippi, Arkansas, and Tennessee, represented “a cultural weapon of defense and of conquest.” The Italian novelist Elio Vittorini suggested Italians find inspiration in W.E.B. Du Bois’s poem “A Litany of Atlanta,” which refers to the city’s historic massacre of blacks in 1906. “Poetry is poetry for this reason; it does not remain bound to the circumstances from which it has arisen and, if it is born from pain, it can refer to all pain,” Vittorini wrote. “If for no other reasons than hunger, cold, and disappointment, could not millions of Europeans today unite their voices to this old Negro song?” The Italian lyricist Gian Carlo Testoni characterized this movement of a common cause between postwar Italians and African Americans “the Negro moment” (“l’ora negra”). The following year, the Italian literary critic Leone Piccioni declared in an essay that, within American life, “the greatest originality, the greatest innovation in the relationship between men, is to be found in the participation of the Negroes.” The Italian writer Giovanni Battista Angioletti offered that “the social condition of the American Negroes is, you might say, one of the rallying cries of postwar engaged literature.” More recently, Charles Leavitt, a professor of romance languages at Notre Dame, has dubbed this cross-cultural exchange impegno nero. The history only emboldens my sense of belonging. Back in grade school, when my language arts teachers drilled into us the importance of Harlem Renaissance writers, it was lost on us that these artists’ words had fueled fights for freedom this far away from home. But now, as I nibble fresh prosciutto on the patio and watch a fluorescent orange sun descend on the horizon, it stands to reason how one of my favorite Langston Hughes poems, “The Negro Speaks of Rivers,” which I recited once in class during a Black History program, would touch fascism-fighting Italians as powerfully as it had touched me, a black kid already conditioned to fear white law and governance. “I’ve known rivers: / I’ve known rivers ancient as the world and older than the flow of human blood in human veins. / My soul has grown deep like the rivers.” ver lunch in Rome, between bites of fresh tomato and ­mozzarella — calorie counting in Italy? Senza senso! — the historian and jazz scholar John Gennari is sharing a story about how Ralph Ellison, after publishing Invisible Man in 1952 and winning the National Book Award, took residence with his wife, Fannie, at the American Academy in Rome, which, Gennari notes, is located just minutes away from the hotel restaurant where we are sitting. Ellison never fell in love with Rome. Homesick for Harlem and the overall energy of New York City, he groused in a letter to a colleague: “This place has little of the creative tension so typical of New York. You can see more art, hear more and better rendered music, and heaven help us, find more interesting writing there in a day than you can in months here.” Considering Ellison’s distaste for Rome, it begs the question why he stayed a second year, or, by contrast, why other African American writers such as William Demby so cherished the place. In fact, it was Gennari who introduced me to the mercurial and undercelebrated Demby, a Pittsburgh native and World War II veteran. After the war, Demby returned to Italy and made Tuscany his second home, living with his wife, the Italian writer Lucia Drudi, in a sumptuous countryside villa that she had inherited. While in Italy, he translated the screenplays of big-time Italian directors like Michelangelo Antonioni, Federico Fellini, and Roberto Rossellini and wrote his own well-regarded novels such as Beetlecreek and The Catacombs, an experimental hybrid of fiction and nonfiction. Living in Italy, Demby’s books were often at odds with a black American literary establishment intent on writing about race and Jim Crow oppression. But Demby didn’t feel an onus to write exclusively about African American ­experience. “Our commitment to what is happening now is not only a commitment to America. This is the beauty of the age we are living in. Our commitment now is to humanity.” Gennari, an English and race studies professor at the University of Vermont, revels in stories about pioneering black ­figures — the “Afro-stocracy,” as he affectionately calls them — race leaders whose works and views have so indelibly shaped global culture. Our similarities may end there. Gennari hails from a lily-white enclave in western Massachusetts. He was born to working-class Italian immigrants: His father was a welder, his mother a seamstress. His interest in African American culture started in the ’70s as a kid watching Soul Train. It was nurtured at Harvard by a worldly African American dormie from a prominent Washington, D.C., family, and it ultimately blossomed into what would become Gennari’s life’s work. As he says of his longtime roommate and pal, J. Lorand Matory, now a professor of cultural anthropology at Duke University: “Randy left the womb and the only question was whether he was going to Harvard or Yale. Me? My parents didn’t know anything about college, or how we would pay for it. At Harvard, though, we were both outsiders; Randy racially, and me by class.” Since those days, Gennari has devoted his life to exploring both Italian American and African American cultures and the nexus between them (He’s also married to an African American woman, the author Emily Bernard, and they share adopted twin daughters from Ethiopia.) In his view, the cultures share a wonderfully complex and often rocky relationship, creating a kind of Afro-Italian sensibility marked by “mutual emulation and suspicion, a joyous cultural meeting sometimes darkened by violent collision.” A couple years ago, Gennari published his research and musings on the topic in Flavor and Soul: Italian America at Its African American Edge, a fascinating exploration of the affinity and fault lines between the two cultures through film, music, sports, and food, and how the relationship coalesces and collapses around urban space and often-parallel histories of discrimination and suffering in America. My lunch with Gennari is nothing less than fortuitous: Back in the States, while reading his book, I had emailed him some praise. Upon learning that we both had plans to visit Italy, I eagerly asked for a meeting. After all, page after page of Flavor and Soul affirmed the swirl of feelings and thoughts I have about the two cultures — his paean to Sinatra and his signature brand of masculinity, his ambivalent praise of Spike Lee’s crude portrayal of Italians in such films as Jungle Fever and Do the Right Thing, his insight into the colorful interplay between African American hoopers and Italian American coaches and broadcasters and how it profits the sport, his cataloging of the gross similarities in dehumanizing caricatures of both cultures in mainstream media. “In the American popular imagination, an Italian man was a bootblack, a ditchdigger, a dago, a wop, a stiletto wielding bandit. Or a lover like Rudolph Valentino, whose film roles as a fantasy Mediterranean lover made him Hollywood’s first male sex symbol.” Gennari goes on: “Italian men, like black men, were feared, reviled, denigrated, and subjected to ritual violence.” But the words in Gennari’s book that hit me the hardest were not his own but those of jazz critic Albert Murray, who may best sum up my affection for Italy: “Long before there were southerners in the U.S.A., there were southerners in Italy, and it meant a certain climate, a certain hospitality, a certain musicality in the language, and sometimes even a certain kind of violence and tendency to vendetta…. The European vision of the Italian Southerner is much like that of anyone who understands the American South; the feeling created is that of an easeful relationship to culture and a spontaneity that says, deep down, the point of learning to cook all this food, and talk this way, and wear these fine clothes, is to have a good goddamn time, man!” My good goddamn time abruptly ends when I check my email for my flight information home, and my Twitter feed flashes. I open the app to find a brewing racial controversy, this time over news that Disney has cast a young African American actress in the starring role of Ariel in the live-action remake of its classic film The Little Mermaid. Inside the protests of a fictional mermaid being played by a real live black girl, I notice that a new hashtag, #notmyariel, has been born, and I scroll — partly due to curiosity, but mostly as a reflex to locate my peoples’ pain. “Nooo way!!!! Ariel is shining bright white from Denmark!” “This is NOT about racism, we just want an Ariel that looks like the Ariel we love. Disney, stop being lazy and create new stories if you want more black representation.” I have not quite left Italy, but I am home again already."
Medium.com,Life,A Perfect Vegan Week in Denmark,Travel,https://medium.com/tenderlymag/a-perfect-vegan-week-in-denmark-e357249f74ca?source=topic_page---------472------------------1," Y
ou know a country is on the forefront of environmental action when a café cashier points to the water cups and without provocation exclaims, “Don’t worry, those aren’t plastic! They’re made of maize.” This happened to me at the Louisiana Museum of Modern Art this summer on my 10th trip to Denmark in 25 years. There are more pigs than people in this little country, but according to the German-based search engine for vacation rentals, Holidu, Copenhagen is the sixth best city in Europe for vegans, based on the number of eateries in relation to its population of almost six million. Plant-based eating is on the rise here — from Michelin-recognized New Nordic-inspired restaurants down to the open-faced sandwich (smørrebrød ) spreads marked “vegansk” in the local grocery stores and the date-based truffles available in every 7–11 store. In 2017, Danish politicians even took a public “22-day vegan diet challenge.” It hasn’t always been this way, though. It has long been a challenge for vegan travelers to eat in the country where the national dish is still “stegt flæsk med persille sovs” (fried pork with parsley sauce) and its citizens love their cod, herring, and pølse (bright red boiled pork sausage, sold in street stands). But the new focus on vegetables fits right in with the locally-sourced bio-dynamic precedent set by restaurants such as Noma and the entire country’s commitment to caring for the environment, as seen in the bike-friendly city of Copenhagen and the government’s goal to phase out coal by 2030, replacing it with wind power. Chef René Redzepi took the culinary world by storm when his two-Michelin-star restaurant Noma first topped the list of S. Pellegrino’s 50 Best Restaurants in 2010 (and later again in 2014). The concept of Nordic terroir emphasizes local, natural, and seasonal ingredients, including much of the formerly overlooked produce of Scandinavia. The restaurant was not vegan but revived an interest in little-used indigenous plants such as sea buckthorn, beets, celeriac, lingonberry, and elder flowers, among others."

here’s no denying the looming “monsters” we call Facebook, Instagram, and Snapchat hiding in the back of our brains, calling out for attention whenever we do something interesting. Whether you post to include others, to show your status, for self-fulfillment, for entertainment, or some other reason, that is completely fine! However, before snapping and posting everything while traveling, take a couple things into consideration. You aren’t living in the moment It’s hard to contain your excitement while traveling, and every experience is so unique! It’s even harder because you want to share the experience with your best friends or simply capture it for yourself to look back on. There is nothing wrong with wanting to share or include others, but ask yourself these questions: How much time are you spending to get the perfect shot? Are you living in the moment? An example to think about is concerts; a majority of people now will be recording the entire thing, but imagine how nice it would be to embrace the band, feel the groove, and be hands free? Likes do not equate to validation More often than not, people in modern society find the instant gratification in receiving a like on a post. Likes are the new drug to millennials. Most people say that they feel good when they receive over X amount of likes, however how much is enough? Something to pay attention to is when is this emotional high is going to diminish. Is it after 50 likes? 100? 1,000? With this in mind, there really is no end to the desire for likes, as you will never feel fulfilled if you’re constantly craving more likes on social media. Instagram has been hiding the amount of likes on accounts since May 2019, testing this feature in several countries, including Canada, Australia, Italy, Brazil, and Japan. This will be useful to show that likes do not equal proof of your success. If you need a measurement of your validation for personal well-being, try circling back to the original way of speaking face to face with others who cherish your presence. Diluting the experience While on your adventure, there are many times you go to places specifically because you saw it posted by someone else. In turn, you then take a new picture or recreate it, and essentially it is creating this idea of where you are rather than an accurate portrayal. This can go on and on, therefore devaluing the originality of the place to begin with. Just think back to yourself a place you’ve gone to because you saw it on social media, expecting one thing, and getting there to find the ambiance completely different. Contribution to the “snob effect” The term snob effect originates from microecon, describing the situation where the demand for a product by high income segments varies inversely with its demand by those in the lower income segment. The more that you are on your phone posting about your trip versus just enjoying your trip, the more it really shows the income disparity and the demand that you feel the need to quench simply due to the fact that people in your social group are doing it. The difference with products such as iPhones and Galaxies is that unlike your normal products that have a demand increase when the price decreases, the snob effect will have the opposite effect- high prices and low practical value if we are being completely honest (at least when it comes to a trip). Imagine that everyone is slowly becoming a character from Clueless, but not in the good way. Do you really want to contribute to the snobbery? Feeding your little narcissism demon It’s no surprise that we are living in an increasingly narcissistic society, which does happen to correlate with the generational shift and the rise of technology. You guessed it, this includes social media as well. Since social media platforms focus on the user, they focus on likes, views, and comments, allowing users to feel better about themselves. This only gets more and more drastic as you go on social media more often. After a while, this inevitably will lead to those negative facets that create a full-on narcissist — inflated sense of self, entitlement, lack of empathy. So before you become a full on ego-centric maniac, try to feed that little narcissism demon a little less. It’s difficult to not want to share your fun experience with everyone while you are out and about, but perhaps refrain from posting until you are cozy in bed and done for the day, or save it until you are on your way back from a trip. Destructive to mama nature Many travel destinations have been seeing a drastic influx in tourism, largely in part by social media influencers. Today, countries are using influencers as a way to bring in more visitors, and it’s working! This is great for revenue and is even better when the impact is manageable. Something many visitors are not taking into account is how they are impacting mother nature. There are things everyone knows about such as trash not being properly disposed of. They increasingly can also be seen when you are trying to get that “wow” picture in some caves or snorkeling. What needs to carry more weight on your mind is how your natural oils are compromising the growth of formations, how your footprints can change something permanently, or how the choice in your sunscreen is impacting coral reefs (RIP Great Barrier Reef). Even on local hikes, small things such as not cleaning your shoes or tent afterwards can lead to bringing foreign flora and bugs to new locations, running the risk of introducing an invasive species to an ecosystem that cannot handle it. Other cultures may frown on it Lastly, if you don’t plan on slowing down your snap story for any other reason, the least you can do is be mindful of other culture’s beliefs. Whether it is because they are not as technologically advanced, or it is just frowned upon, try to pay attention to your surroundings. For example, Japan has announcements asking for mobile devices to be put on “manner mode” while traveling (aka silent/vibrate). If you see all the locals doing their own thing and you don’t see phones out often, I would refrain, but if you see everyone posting, go for it. To each their own!"

Medium.com,Life,It’s fun to stay at the MBA — in praise of the mountain bothy,Travel,https://medium.com/@matthew__dawson/its-fun-to-stay-at-the-mba-in-praise-of-the-mountain-bothy-c5086e8d64d6?source=topic_page---------477------------------1," Approaching Shenavall bothy from the south is no easy task. It requires a trek of over eight hours across the (entirely treeless) Fisherfield Forest wilderness, carrying heavy packs and fording rivers which during periods of heavy rain can be waist deep. This is a landscape where you can’t fuck up; with no settlements, tracks or frequently even paths, any rescue attempt would be extremely difficult. But as you enter the final straight it’s clear that it’s been worth the effort. Earlier this month, we saw the sun setting over Loch na Sielga to the West, flanked by the imposing castles of An Teallach to the North and the Fisherfield Munros to the South. Nestled in the centre of this was the most perfect mountain refuge a tired walker could imagine. Like a scene from an idealised children’s book the Shenavall bothy basked in the sunset, smoke wisping from its chimney. Across Scotland (and in a few cases Northern England and Wales) similar sights welcome walkers to some of the most remote places imaginable. Their names such as Ruigh Aiteachain, Taigh Thormoid Dhuibh and Taigh Seumas a’ Ghlinne root them to a language and a way of life that can seem entirely detached from the mainstream. According to the Mountain Bothy Association (MBA), the charity who maintain and publicise these bothies, the practise of ‘bothying’ began in earnest after the Second World War. Rural depopulation led to many abandoned buildings across the countryside and with increased leisure time and incomes more and more hikers and climbers were using them for overnight stays. In order to secure the future of these dilapidated refuges the MBA was formed. Their Bothy Code sets out the standards expected of bothy users. The key points are to keep the place tidy, to make others welcome and to not take a dump near the bothy (no rule is needed for avoiding others doing their business as the presence or otherwise of the infamous bothy shovel signals whether a fellow guest has headed out to the woods). The total lack of facilities in the always free of charge bothies makes them a unique experience, the enjoyment of which will depend on your personal tastes. Some will find, while lying cold and wet on a stone floor, that they wish they’d powered on to the nearest hotel. The MBA themselves make no attempt to sugar coat the challenges of the experience: “No tap, no sink, no beds, no lights, and, even if there is a fireplace, perhaps nothing to burn. Bothies may have a simple sleeping platform, but if busy you might find that the only place to sleep is on a stone floor. If there is no fire then on a cold night you may have trouble staying warm. The great majority of nights in Britain are on the cool side and remember that most bothies are up in the hills.” Despite these demands, when everything comes together and a group of like-minded travellers sit drinking by a roaring fire, it’s like nothing else. On a good night bothies knock their rivals out of the water; alpine huts (often £30+), Scottish Hotels (the nearest to Shenavall starts its very basic rooms at £115) or even Youth Hostels (£40+ at popular sites) all lay claim to being for outdoors travellers, they fail to feel like they belong to us. It’s difficult to name a single comparable institution to the MBA. One which gives away a resource of such clear value (nights spent in exceptionally beautiful locations), with no strings attached or any particular pressure put on users to donate. While true that the MBA is constrained by the near impossibility of enforcing payments across its remote and disparate network, it seems certain that even if technology somehow allowed this they’d refuse. This is clear based on how they’ve dealt with their network over recent years. With an ageing membership meaning that volunteer numbers are at risk of decline, they’ve taken the view that increasing bothy visits (rather than say focusing on revenue) is essential for the future of the organisation. Bothy locations and descriptions were put online in 2009 (the first time they were publicly revealed) and the popular Bothy Bible book was published separately from the MBA but with their blessing in 2017. This trend for greater openness has not been without its critics however who believe that the locations of the MBA’s 104 bothies should be kept secret. Negative reviews on the Amazon page for the Bothy Bible include comments that “books like this run counter to the bothy ethos” and “now the yobs and cretins will give bothies a bad name”. Media coverage has also tried to link the publication of the book to the abuse of bothies, highlighting parties and vandalism by groups of “ignorant yahoos”. The Police have responded to these worries with a recently launched ‘Bothy Watch’ campaign to tackle misuse. The police lead told the press that “this trend for the bothy has attracted a different type of user”. The common element of these criticisms seems to be a largely unevidenced fear of the uncouth, who are perceived to be abusing this free resource for their own gain (an article on the Walk Highlands site puts this explicitly warning of the dangers of attracting “society’s dregs”). It’s worth noting a couple of things about this question. Firstly, when detractors make the emotive warning of ‘drink and drugs’ in the bothies it’s clear that they’re not referring to middle class groups passing a bottle of whisky or maybe going outside for a spliff. Their big fear is essentially “yob” lads heading to the hills from Glasgow and elsewhere. Nevermind that these city kids might not be particularly excited by parties requiring a long drive and a couple of hours walk over rough country, with no beds, power, toilets or lighting at the end of it. Secondly, warnings about the ‘wrong kind of people’ is a theme that’s all too familiar in political discourse: benefits can’t be too generous in case the ‘scroungers’ choose idleness over work, borders must be strong or ‘bogus’ asylum seekers will try to take advantage, and even toilets must charge a fee to discourage ‘undesirable’ users. It’s what has led to a shutting down and pricing up of our public realm. Bothies are a direct challenge to this world view. To trust that complete strangers have left the bothy in a usable state, that they will respect your belongings and will make space for you to sleep if needed; this is to place a great confidence in others and in the overwhelming majority of cases it works. It’s not to deny that there will be cases of vandalism and misuse, it’s to say that we should approach these questions believing the best in human nature, not obsessing over the potential for the worst."
Medium.com,Life,The distance between Tel Aviv and Copenhagen is 3.200 kilometers.,Travel,https://medium.com/@ceciliebodker/the-distance-between-tel-aviv-and-copenhagen-is-3-200-kilometers-98640ba90cc8?source=topic_page---------478------------------1," On the door are three red circles with a red line crossing over. One circle contains a drawing of a cigarette, the other a dog, and the third a machine gun. I traveled to Israel and started questioning what normality is. Two men in pastel-colored speedos are lying close to each other in the sand, their bodies glistening in the sun. A moment before, they stood embracing in the waves. I am lying horizontally in the sand, the hangover is banging away somewhere in my forehead. I close my eyes, and hear the sound of wet kisses. “I am from Russia,” he says.
“I am from here,” says the other man.
“Lucky you! I wish I could stay here in Tel Aviv forever.” The sound of several kisses, followed by a quiet moan.
“You are so bad!” The bearded, bald man whispers. After a while, they pack their towels. I make eye contact with one man before they leave and send him a smile. He smiles back happily. Tel Aviv organizes one of the worlds largest Pride festivals. The colorful liberation of the city was one of the things that attracted me to it. I walk along the coast, turning at one of the smaller streets where people are crowded into café corners, busy talking to each other and dipping pita bread into hummus. I keep walking. I notice two young women dressed in military green from head to toe, one of them is wearing a pink backpack, a fluffy keychain is dangling from one of the pockets. They are waiting patiently in the ice cream queue. Two massive black machine guns are hanging from their sides. Among fashionable queers, pierced bohemians, oiled beach lions, LGBT flags waving from balconies, ultra-orthodox black-clad med with tall hats, long curls dangling in front of each ear on the way out of the synagogue, backpackers with hangovers, sunscreen and falafel, there are more machine guns at the same place than I’ve ever seen before. Tel Avis is a bubble that is easy to get absorbed in. The machine guns remind me of what is happening outside this bubble. I just shook her hand, and I sit down next to her on the couch, we’re sitting quite close, with each our beer in our hands. She has long reddish hair, pale skin covered in freckles. She moves uneasy around in the couch next to me, like she never feels completely comfortable with her body’s placement in the room. She tells me that is from The US and has Jewish ancestry, and therefore she can receive military training in Israel, which is something that is offered to all Israeli women and men under the age of 24. She has been in the military for a few months now, but for this weekend she is partying in Tel Aviv. “Oh, you will find this funny!” she exlaims, eagerly pulling out her iPhone from her pocket. She shows me a picture on her Instagram. She is posing in military green with a machine gun that almost looks bigger that her. “Isn’t it cool?” She laughs. I try to smile, but I can feel the muscles in my chin tighening. “Do you ever think about how you are taking part in actually killing people?” I ask. Her grin fades. She become quiet, her eyes is looking at the couch between us. I immediately feel guilty. Here, at a hostel roof filled with backpackers drinking beer, putting on 90’s hits, I am asking her to think about whether she has been a part of killing another human being. “Sorry!” I say quickly. “I can be pretty blunt about things. I really want to understand why you are in the army. I am a pacifist, you see.” She answers, uneasily. “I am just in the air force, but not in the planes. I am just helping with communication…” She starts explaining that the walls sorrounding Israel are so fragile that is it important to fitght to protect it. She tells me that it gives her a sense of meaning in her life to be among those who fights for it. She says she does something good for others. Her gaze starts flickering when she tells me about the officers in the corps, she calls them Emotional Robots. The stories she tells sounds similar to the few military movies I’ve seen. Officers portrayed as emotionless men whose missions are to break down their soldiers, so they can be rebuilt, now hardened and invulnerable, ready to kill. I tell her, that I like the fact that the Israeli military doesn’t make any difference on being a man or a women doing military service. That women in this context is not considered “the weak sex”. But what does it mean in this case to be strong? “Strenght” measured in the capacity to practice physical violence? I take another sip of my beer and think about why she showed exactly that picture on Instagram. I understand why she considers it to be a cool picture. A skinny long-haired girl can take on a classic masculine role as any man. A tomb boy is cooler than being a girly girl, right? Tomb boys are equally bad ass as the guys. She can also smoke two packs of cigarretes a day. She can also drink herself to death. She can also punch someones teeth out. She can kill, too. Why is it cool to take on that part of toxic masculinity: the destructive, the self-destructive? The bottle of beer in my hand is empty now, but I can still taste the guilt from asking her about killing people. But still, I want her to be aware that it’s not just white dots on the screen that the pilots in the fighter jets are watching. I imagine the pilots in the clouds, how easily they erradicate with a single push of a button. Are they aware of that each of the single white dots on the screen has a mother, a father, a best friend? Maybe the white dot has dimples, or gets freckles in the summer. Would the pilots really push the button, if they knew these things? “What do you want to do after military training?” I ask, after getting two new beers, handing one to her. “I don’t really know what my dream is. I just really want to adopt a puppy.” Tel Aviv as a bubble, it feels necessary to stay inside it, it is easy to stay inside it, it is much more enjoyable to stay inside it and forget about what happens outside. The bubble as normality for those who are priviliged enough to choose to be in it."

Medium.com,Life,Should You Be Paying for Campsites?,Travel,https://medium.com/@aczerwinskiburkard/should-you-be-paying-for-campsites-9a75d1551de?source=topic_page---------480------------------1," When I set out to travel the United States from coast to coast this summer, there was one thing I was most concerned about: my budget. I set a pretty strict limit, and ended up staying a good amount under it. One of the things that saved me the most money was knowing when and where I could camp for free. This is a topic you’ll see frequently on popular van life YouTube channels. Most of them will tell you about Walmart parking lots and highway rest areas. Please don’t think these are your only option, because they’re a small fraction of what you can find with some good research. This post is mostly to help you with finding campsites that are inexpensive or free. There’s no guarantee that you’ll find any good options where you’re looking, and I suggest doing your research before you decide to head to a specific area. I’ll also say that most of my luck has been in park and forest areas, and it’s pretty difficult to find anything good in cities (however, I’ll try to cover city areas a bit). Without any more background info, we’ll start with how to get you better, less expensive campsite options, based on what kind of area you’re in. National parks pose unique challenges. They’re more regulated than national forests or BLM land, but can still have some inexpensive options nearby. If you’re heading to a national park, check out what’s around the area before going. Chances are there will be some national forests in the area (in which case, read my section on national forests, because that’s where you’ll most likely end up). If there isn’t national forest land that you can find on a map, you still have some options. One that people tend to gravitate towards is Recreation.gov. This isn’t a bad place to go, but be aware that prices range from just a few dollars to upwards of $35 per night. That isn’t going to save you money, and if you’re looking to actually stay within a national park, chances are you’re going to have to plan 3–6 months in advance. Another good option is BLM land or areas around a national park. The website that helped me the most throughout my trip was freecampsites.net. This website is quite reliable, but you have to know how to read reviews and tell how credible someone is. There’s a few campsites I went to that were quite amazing yet had a few terrible reviews. Be aware that your vehicle, skills, and tolerances might be different than other people’s. I stayed at some sites that had no bathroom (or vault toilet), no water, and were at high elevation (aka freezing). These were some of my favorite campsites, but they were terrible for a lot of people, especially people who didn’t come prepared. If you use apps like Yelp and know how to navigate reviews on there, you’ll be set to use freecampsites.net. 2. National Forests I was confused at first that the National Forest Service was part of the USDA, but it is, so don’t be surprised if you see USDA campsites. These are actually some of the least expensive paid options out there. Many USDA sites I went to were $4 per night with running water and vault toilets. Be aware that these aren’t always maintained or in great shape. USDA campsites that don’t have water (and sometimes no toilet) are often free. To find these campsites, you have two options. One is using freecampsites.net (I have no affiliation with them, I just really like their website). The second option is using the USDA website. If you look up “campsites in _______ National Forest” you’ll probably find their official list. Their website certainly isn’t fancy and won’t give you pictures or a full rundown, but it works. Try to avoid other websites that are trendy, in my experience, some of them are far too picky, and will lead you further away from where you want to be the next day. 3. Cities This is the most tricky one, and probably where you’ll be sleeping at rest stops, Walmarts, or just driving all night to avoid paying for a hotel (I’ve done this 2–3 times and it’s rough). Cities are where those Yelp review analyzing skills really come in handy. Use the freecampsites.net, use Google reviews (I usually find them by looking up a specific rest area or Walmart), and use your common sense. I once ended up at a rest area in San Francisco that just didn’t feel safe (lots of people wandering around, cars parked all along the ramp back onto the highway), so I drove all the way to Redwoods and found a free campsite near there. You can find safe and dangerous places to stay in both cities and in rural or forest areas. It’s just easier to find places in forest areas that don’t have anyone at the sites, and therefore that tends to be a safer option. In my opinion, driving an extra hour just to be in a safe place in a forest is better than staying all night at a rest stop that you’re unsure of."
Medium.com,Life,On the Road to Ginzling — backpacking mom meltdown,Travel,https://blog.usejournal.com/on-the-road-to-ginzling-backpacking-mom-meltdown-30cc717d2b5e?source=topic_page---------481------------------1," “I lost my wallet!” exclaimed my husband, as the train raced from Italy to Austria. We looked at him, various degrees of worry on our faces — me and the four kids. “Search the compartment!” he commanded. We rummaged under seats and scoured high luggage racks, to no avail. The train arrived at Innsbruck station. That’s it, I thought. We’re all gonna die. I wasn’t being dramatic about the wallet. I was merely projecting myself an hour into the future when, as the only family member with a driver’s license, I’d have to drive up a mountain in a rental car. I hadn’t driven a standard shift in 20 years. I’d clearly kill us all. We had to find the wallet. It had already been a long day since we woke up tired in Trento. We’d arrived the night before from a multi-day trek in the Dolomites and knew we’d only have a few hours to eat, sleep and catch the train to Innsbruck. After enjoying the warm splendour of our first shower in days, it was pasta, gelato and logistics until bedtime. Motivating four young kids to get out the door for 7 a.m. is tough at the best of times, but this day the troops were understandably weary and slow. They eventually slung on their packs and lumbered to the station. We had to leave early to stop in Bolzano to see Ötzi, the prehistoric human mummy found in a melting glacier in 1991. Like King Tut’s ‘Curse of the pharaohs’, Ötzi has a curse of his own, with 7 rumoured deaths related to the discovery of his remains. “Do you think it’s his revenge for being murdered?” I asked, to pump up the younger ones as we walked to the station. Ötzi bled to death after being shot from behind by an arrow. Stopping to see Ötzi would be fantastic, but we couldn’t miss our train onward. We had a hard deadline to pick up a rental car at the airport — the only agency in Innsbruck with a car large enough for 6. I’d already asked if we could arrive a little later. “We close at 5 p.m. sharp,” replied the no-nonsense agent. He was Austrian. I believed him. Now here we were, at last in Innsbruck, with just enough time to catch the next shuttle to the agency, leaving in precisely 15 minutes. If we didn’t get the car, we’d have no way to get to Ginzling, our destination. There was no time to search for a wallet. Ginzling, population 400, is known as ‘the alpinists’ village’, and is the trailhead for the High Mountain Nature Park (Zillertal Alps), known for long-distance hiking trails and its ice blue lake, surrounded by snow-capped mountains. I’d chosen Ginzling, a tiny town at 1000 m, based on two glowing sentences in my Lonely Planet guide. It was an extra 8 km up the mountain, past the main tourist town of Mayrhofen, but it sounded lovely. Lodging just off the beaten track often enriches my family’s travel experiences tenfold. We were heading to the Zillertal for hiking, canyoning and the novelty of alpine skiing in August on the Hintertux Glacier. Besides, I liked saying the name Ginzling. It rolled off my tongue and left me tickled each time. Ginzling. Ginzling. I hoped it would be as good as I imagined. But first, we had to make it there, and for that we needed a car. “Remember when we boarded and waited in the corridor for a family to leave our compartment?” asked my husband. “A guy brushed up against me. I bet he stole my wallet.” We stopped to call the luggage check in Bolzano, where we’d stored our bags before paying respects to Ötzi. No dice. They assured us we hadn’t left the wallet there. We stood in line at Innsbruck station’s Lost & Found — with less than 10 minutes to make the shuttle. I was concerned about logistics. My husband was, understandably, more concerned about his wallet. My children, as can be the case, were somewhat oblivious to our stress. No, the station couldn’t reach a conductor to search the compartment again. No, they would probably not be informed if anyone found a wallet. No, we couldn’t call to check the next day because the office would be closed. The Lost & Found pitstop was not a resounding success. T-minus 5 minutes for the shuttle, the six of us charged the corridor with backpack bustle — the undignified-train-station-run. Once outside, I quickly purchased pastries no one wanted to get change for the ticket machine. After deciphering the German instructions, I realized it was a card-only affair. I inserted my credit card — now the family’s only card. The machine ate my card. The shuttle arrived. I looked at the machine, eyes wide. The shuttle left. My family looked at me. I stared at the machine in mounting disbelief, which rapidly turned into uncharacteristic anger. I watched the shuttle as it drove away. I ran after it for a few seconds before fully appreciating the futility. The machine eventually spit out my card — and six useless tickets — after what seemed like a ridiculous amount of time. “F*ck, f*ck, f*ck, f*ck!” I shouted, loudly and despairingly. My children stared. They’d heard me swear before, but never in public. At least, never in public raging quite like that. Austrian people were looking at me. Austrian people were moving slightly away from me. My family waited for my meltdown to conclude. The angry clouds parted to let rays of lucidity shine upon my slightly contrite, but still frustrated self. My children will forever talk about this incident. It’s one of their favourite travel memories, ever. My husband, observing the scene ironically, from what seemed like a great distance, had a genius idea. “If we can find a cab, maybe we can make it.” I love my husband, but in that moment, I adored him. Perfect! We needed two cabs. I felt grateful the machine had had the civility to spit my card back. We arrived at the rental agency with moments to spare, and would finally, thankfully, make it to Ginzling. Epilogue: I did not drive the car that night. I decided my husband driving uninsured was a lesser evil than me killing everyone in a standard, in the dark, in the rain, up a mountain. The next morning, in beautiful Ginzling, my husband said it was time for my stick shift refresher. He’d just spent an hour on the phone cancelling his cards. As I put on my shoes, I heard him banging around the kitchen, then calling me to the living room. He’s getting distracted again, I thought. Starting something new when we’re on our way out In the living room, I saw two pots and a pan on the floor in front of a chair. He handed me a wooden spoon. “What, pray tell, do we have here?” “This is the gas, that’s the clutch and there’s the brake. You can use the spoon to shift.” I practised with the pot and pan handles, until I was ready to try the real deal in the guest house parking lot. The family-run (since 1790!) Gasthaus Alt Ginzling conveniently doubles as the trailhead parking. Early morning hikers and grazing cows would be the only witnesses — and potential victims — of my stick shift endeavours. Shoes on and ready, my husband reached into one of his backpack’s many pockets for the car keys, and pulled out … his wallet."

Medium.com,Life,Escaping Love & Moving Across The Country,Travel,https://psiloveyou.xyz/escaping-love-moving-across-the-country-b0e33b2a1ba?source=topic_page---------484------------------1," I was a mess. I didn’t know what I wanted or needed in my life. The ideal relationship was a paradox to me. I was young, nineteen, and in love with a man who wasn’t ready to feel the same. I remember the moment I first saw him. The first time I truly noticed him after months of knowing him. It came over me; too fast for me to even notice what was happening. I have a way about me, youthful and free-spirited. I pursued him at a dinner party, after having had a few beverages. What followed was months of steamy moments, ones I soaked myself in. One look in his eyes and I was head over heels. He came to me like a dream — European, tall and handsome, but this was no fairy tale. Everything felt unclear, but I knew I wanted him. I settled for whatever I could get, convincing myself I was capable of playing it by his rules. The relationship was torn in pieces and left me teary-eyed most nights. He wasn’t ready, and I was too young. I had always wanted to live in Montreal. I was captivated by the culture, the language and the allure of a new city. I had it in my head I would move in the summer, something I had shared with him on our first date. But as time went on, I found myself falling harder between the emotionless gap. I became consumed in chasing his affection, losing myself in the process. I began to question how I would ever find my way to Montreal. We didn’t talk for the entire month of April. Not rare for us. We would often go days or weeks without seeing or hearing from the other, but I remember April feeling like the longest month in a year. It was during that time that I realized what was missing. I was on the other side of the country, amongst family, mourning the loss of a relative, and I couldn’t even tell him that. This person that I cared so much for didn’t even know I’d left the province. It broke my heart. These feelings I had, while strong and passionate, felt empty. I recalled months previous, running into him shortly after the new year. He saw me, stopped in his tracks, smiled and gave me a hug. I remember feeling safe in his arms and not wanting him to let go, but after months of back and forth, I knew that wasn’t possible anymore. Upon returning home from the funeral, I booked my ticket to Montreal and made a commitment to myself; there was no turning back. In July, I boxed my belongings, filled my suitcase and set out, leaving Vancouver behind. I was filled with emotions. My heart ached, having to say goodbye to my friends and family, but above all I missed him; the reason being, I didn’t think I would ever see him again. My first month in Montreal, I was lonely. I spent many of my nights thinking of him, missing him. Montreal kept me on my toes. I frequently got stopped in the streets, receiving compliments on my hair or the dress I was wearing, and often followed by a request for coffee. Weeks of proposals and gratitudes, I felt even more alone and more heartbroken — my heart still belonging to someone else. But we were too different. Seemingly similar, sharing common interests, but ultimately, we were worlds apart, and I continually had to tell myself, it wasn’t possible. Some days I felt strong, confident, and was happy living on my own. Writing was my outlet. I wrote about my adventures, faraway countries, and solo travelling; reminding myself of everything I was capable of. But I was easily reminded of him. I would quickly fall back, remembering his touch, stroking my side, like a silk sheet, soft and delicate. He was powerful and seductive. His rough exterior and his sensitive touch weakened my body. One look into his eyes and I was forever his. Pulling myself out of the empty pit I had made, grew tiresome. I didn’t want to be sad anymore. I realized the best thing for me was to say goodbye. It hurt. I sobbed, thinking of everything that I was giving up, though unaware of what future events were yet to come. “When one door closes another one opens,” they say. I thought I could leave the door open, thinking we still had time. Time to undo all of the mistakes that we had made. It wasn’t fair. We were miles apart. Still saving ourselves for what felt familiar, convenient and safe. Despite our differences and all of our challenges, I wanted him to be happy. Loving someone means you want what’s best for them, even if what’s best, isn’t you. Longing became acceptance. I stopped seeing his happy future through teary eyes, and over time, the thought of him happy with someone else became easier. “We both deserve better,” I told him. I couldn’t live while missing someone who wasn’t capable of feeling the same. I had to close the door. I vowed to work on myself, continue writing and veer away from any prospective relationship. I felt raw. I didn’t think I could feel that same way for someone else. I secluded myself to my thoughts, leaving any desires I had behind. I needed distance. Despite my wishes to remain alone, ultimately, that wasn’t my choice. Life is funny that way. I would have been perfectly content with spending my future days in Montreal, writing, alone to myself with a coffee and fresh croissant. Needless to say, life had other plans."

Girl, boy. She was my translator. And me, of course, being one who adores camels and anything else with paws, pads or whatever constitutes feet. We stopped, and all the camels turned as one. “Yes? You here to help?” As clear a question as there ever was one. I leapt out of the van and strode across the sandy soil. It was hot. The camels, many of them quite young, all had the bone piece that is pushed through the muzzle to keep them under control. Not my custom, not my country, how I feel about it is none of my beeswax. As I do with all unknown animals, I slowed down and stopped. A large female stepped towards me, no malice, no danger implied. I stepped towards her. We did this until we met in the middle. You approach all camels (and most horses) on the left, as that is the mounting side, what they are used to. I reached up and tentatively scratched behind her ear, which was marked with a metal ring."
Medium.com,Life,In the Steppes of Central Asia,Travel,https://medium.com/@jhubbel/in-the-steppes-of-central-asia-740624ff8b8c?source=topic_page---------486------------------1," In 1880, the great composer Alexander Porfiryevich Borodin wrote a tone poem dedicated to his friend and fellow composer Franz Liszt. The piece had been formally commissioned by Russian Emperor Alexander II to celebrate his Silver Jubilee. At that time, there was a small, dedicated group of composers determined to write music that wasn’t some rework of existing Western European material. That music, of course, was magnificent in its own right. But Borodin, a chemist by training, instead looked to inspiration from his own country. Which at that time was vast, unpeopled, lonely and windswept. Much like it is today, although borders and rulers have changed many times over. Emperors may come and go, wars fought, list, won, languages change, adapt, merge. Races melt into one another. Religions rise, fall, disappear. The steppes remain. Borodin’s tone poem, which was nearly lost to history because of an aborted assassination attempt against the Emperor, was later resurrected by fellow composer Nikolai Rimsky-Korsakov. Those of us lucky enough to have been brought up in a classical music- loving household (and I am one of them, despite having been raised on a chicken farm in Central Florida) might have been introduced to this concert hall favorite. For my part, having grown up with a tangle of palm trees, thickets of dense brush and citrus groves for miles around, it would have been impossible for me to imagine the stark, endlessly empty steppes scented by sage and dotted in all directions with the fleet-footed Saiga antelope that can almost outrun a cheetah. It’s hard to visualize unless you are in a car, hurtling along at speed, while a herd of some forty Saiga are outrunning you. Unforgettable. An autumn sunrise on the Gobi steppes, an area which prior to 1946 was still considered a state of the USSR, takes over nearly three-quarters of the horizon. The windswept land lies flat in every direction, the tallest structures are the dried scat of wolves, camels, horses, sheep and goats. At least, this far off the maze of up to twenty dirt tracks that qualify as roads out here. People really do just make their own. This is the Wild Wild East in many ways. Every so often you pass a structure made of boardwood. This is impossibly expensive, for trees are thousands of miles away and the wood has to be shipped in. The corral, which is this time of year cracked and compacted by millions of steps, is just about ready for harvesting. The animals tread on their own shit, it hardens in the harsh summer sun, and is eventually left to dry out. Cracks form, and the farmer lifts the dried sections-a near-perfect form of cooking fuel and heat- into a pile for the winter. Here, of course, in some areas, are towers carrying modern power and signal to a few outposts. There were none near us where we slept."
Medium.com,Life,Surviving Sober Burning Man,Travel,https://medium.com/@carlicita/surviving-sober-burning-man-3fc9affb2126?source=topic_page---------487------------------1," I’m one of those weirdos who brackets her year in Burns. Watching the wooden man erupt into flames on the final night of Burning Man has always felt like New Year’s Eve to me. Burning Man marks an end and a beginning, a chance to acknowledge transition. Where was I a year ago? How far have I come? Last year, I was a total mess. I’d been struggling with major depression for the better part of two years. Not the kind of depression that makes you feel a little bummed out around the edges. The kind of depression that chains you to your bed for days at a time. The kind of depression that makes walking to the metro station or typing up an email feel like impossible tasks. The only things that gave me even some semblance of relief were drugs and alcohol. Which I used frequently and heavily. I told myself that Burning Man would be the turning point in my depression — that simply being out there would cure me once and for all. I did drugs in secret as I packed my bags, vowing to stop as soon as I made it to the desert. I fantasized about making new connections with people, waking up early to watch the sun poke over the mountains, and feeling like my whole self again. But Burning Man tends to amplify whatever state of mind you’re already in. The harsh desert dust storms, the heat, the physical labor, the incessant option to party, the abrupt transition into “survival mode”: not for the faint of heart, or for the cripplingly depressed. Needless to say, my depression followed me out there like a straitjacket. I drank myself into a stupor each night and spent my days nursing hangovers under the blaring sun. I returned home and wound up in rehab a month later. That’s when everything changed. Since getting sober eleven months ago, my depression has completely evaporated. Now, I’m out of bed every morning. I’m present for my friends and family in a way that wasn’t possible before. I’m grateful for the small minutiae that unfolds in my everyday life. But that’s for another essay. My “burn year” came to a close, and going back to Burning Man sober didn’t feel like an option. How could I possibly fare at my year’s biggest party without the salve of substances? All-night dance marathons? Exhausting. One-on-one connections with strangers? Terrifying. Drugs and alcohol? Plentiful, free and almost everywhere you look. At the same time, I didn’t want to miss out. Over the past year, I have made it through weddings and stayed out until sunrise. I’ve been on dates and I’ve danced and I’ve survived holiday gatherings. Why did Burning Man have to be any different? Could I do it on my own terms? It turns out, I’m not the only person who’s asked that question to themselves. The Burning Man website has an entire page dedicated to sobriety in the desert. The answer was yes, I decided, under two conditions. One: I join a designated sober camp so I have a safe space to retreat to if things get hard. Two: I only stay for half the week, lest I start to feel trapped after too many days out there with nowhere to go. Much reflecting and many AA meetings later, I was on my way to Black Rock City. After a flat tire caused a five-hour delay forty minutes from the entrance (also for another essay), I showed up with a tent, a backpack and a resolve to stay sober. No matter what happens this week, I told myself, that’s the most important thing to focus on. I found my sober camp, plopped down my belongings, and set off into the desert. I spent my first night eating dinner with a group of close friends. They were grateful for the fresh kale and avocado I’d brought them from home — green vegetables halfway through the week are a rare treat. While I was drinking and using, I never made thoughtful gestures like that, and it felt good to give a little gift and expect nothing in return. As it turns out, dancing with my pals in the desert is no different than dancing with my pals in the real world. As the night continued to unfold, they drank margaritas and I drank Yerba Mate. I didn’t even want booze. But that didn’t mean I couldn’t have fun. We biked around all night, stumbling upon a two-story speakeasy, a particularly aggressive dubstep show, and an adventure on an art car. I fell asleep feeling happy and held by my community, and I woke up hangover-free. I decided to spend the following day getting familiar with my sober camp. The first thing I noticed was that it looked like any other camp: hexayurts, a handful of RVs, a giant carport that served as a kitchen, some dusty sofas and armchairs. Everyone was wearing the same sorts of costumes and partaking in the same sorts of shenanigans, but there were no drugs and alcohol in sight. We held an AA meeting in the afternoon and talked about what it meant to have a “sober Burn.” A few people shared what their experiences at Burning Man had been like before they got sober, and their stories weren’t too far off from mine. We discussed the challenges of living out in the desert for the week — challenges that everyone, not just sober people, faced. That night, determined to take care of my body, I went to bed at 11 p.m., confident that I wasn’t missing out on anything. That never would have been an option if I wasn’t sober, but this time around, there were no dragons for me to chase around, no highs to try to extend. I woke up in time for a beautiful solo sunrise bike ride, and then bumped into some good friends inside a giant art piece shaped like a human head. I quickly realized that Burning Man, like everything else in my life over the past year, is better sober. I was able to finally do all the things I’d wanted to do in the past, but couldn’t because I was too distracted by partying. Scary vulnerability workshop with a stranger: check. Giant naked mid-day foam party: check. A visit to the temple, where I wrote a goodbye letter to my addicted and depressed self: check. That night, on my way back to camp, I met an amazing woman who was 27 years sober. We stopped for mocktails on a giant pirate ship and watched the sun disappear over the mountains together, cheersing our tin mugs against each other. This year, I had more energy for the things I really wanted to do. Connections with strangers and friends alike felt more authentic and less fleeting. Dance parties became more joyful because the joy wasn’t artificially-induced. I learned the value of self care. And it turns out, when you aren’t actively looking for drugs, you tend to not see any drugs. Nobody is pushing them on you because nobody actually wants to share them. Being sober doesn’t mean giving up on the experiences you cherish. It just means seeing them through a bit of a different lens. A cleaner, less foggy lens. Last year, I got back from Burning Man and spent a week in bed recovering. This year, I made it to work the very next day. My co-worker even told me I was glowing so much I looked like I had been to a spa. Another New Year’s Eve passed marks another chance for transition. In the coming year, I’ll find out what kinds of new experiences my sobriety continues to unlock. Until then, I’ll see you at the Burn in 2020 — this time, I’m staying for the whole week."

Medium.com,Life,Where to find Bowie in Berlin?,Travel,https://medium.com/@willrussell_46069/where-to-find-bowie-in-berlin-ebb5c89de361?source=topic_page---------491------------------1," Aladdin Sane, Diamond Dogs, Young Americans and Station to Station ensured Bowie had only gone and conquered America, and as Elvis and Lennon learned, you don’t want to go doing a thing like that. Into the void, Bowie dove, scurrying about borrowed houses, sustained on a diet of milk and cocaine, or so goes the myth, there’s a lot of that about Bowie, the old myths. Yes, there is valid evidence on Alan Yentob’s 1975 documentary, Cracked Actor, where Bowie’s fragile state is apparently illuminated. Still, in one scene, he looks pretty content and well, wearing a large felt hat, motoring through the Californian desert, sitting in the back harmonising to Aretha Franklin’s Natural woman, gulping milk , Tony Mascia and Coco Schwab sitting up front like his auld pair, as they pass a wax museum, he grins “A wax museum in the desert, you’d think it would melt.” How much was he putting us on? The Isolar world tour to support the album, Station to Station marked Bowie’s journey away from Los Angeles and towards Berlin. That record, in the words of Allan Jones, writing in Melody Maker in 1976, “captured the spiritual malaise of the decade.” Through it, Bowie was leaving the decadence and America behind and pointing towards the technological phenomenon of the Berlin LPs. The train was leaving town, Bowie was on it. On the opening track, he haunts the vocal - Tall in this room overlooking the ocean
Here are we, one magical movement from Kether to Malkuth
There are you, drive like a demon from station to station He’s taking the freight train from Kether, the celestial crown on the kabbalistic tree of life, to Malkuth, the most earthly of the kabbala’s ten stations - It’s safer than a strange land
But I still care for myself
And I don’t stand in my own light
Lord, Lord, my prayer flies
Like a word on a wing
My prayer… He wasn’t partying in LA, he told John Robinson, “I didn’t really use drugs for hedonistic purposes, I didn’t go out very much. I wasn’t getting totally out of it and going to clubs and all that; I’d never really done that to a major extent. i was really just working, I’d work days in a row without sleep. it wasn’t a joyful, euphoric kind of thing. I was driving myself to the point of insanity…I was in a fragile state at that time, it was time to get out of this terrible lifestyle that I had put myself into, and get healthy, it was time, to pull myself together.” Glenn Hughes, whose house he was staying in said, “David told me the thought his demon had caught up with him. He told me he had to get out of LA. Whilst touring Station to Station, Bowie had met the writer Christopher Isherwood backstage at the Forum in Inglewood, California. Isherwood had lived in Berlin during the early 1930s, and the city became the backdrop to his works including Mr Norris Changes Trains and Goodbye To Berlin — which became the basis of the 1972 film Cabaret. Bowie was fascinated by Isherwood’s memories of Berlin and coupled with his avid digesting of German expressionism, he began considering the city for his next destination. He began to Berlin as “the center of everything that is happening and will happen in Europe over the next few years”, he wished to, “experiment, to discover new forms of writing; to evolve, in fact, a new musical language.” Six months later he moved to Berlin. His assistant, Coco Schwab found him a modest, first floor apartment, above a car repair shop in an Art Nouveau building in the modest area of Schoneberg. Life in Berlin changed Bowie, Rory MacLean in his chapter on Bowie, in his fascinating book, Berlin, provides a delicious description of a day in the life of Bowie in West Berlin in the late seventies, “The cyclist swung off Hauptstrasse onto the deep, tree-lined streets. His bicycle tires thrummed on the cobbles. The warm air ruffled his hair. He pedaled past the buildings where Isherwood and Riefenstahl had lived. At a co-op cafe pale-faced students in PLO scarves looked up from their copy of Kierkegaard and ordered another espresso. Above them ‘US Army Go Home” was graffitied on the walls of a squat… At Brecht’s blitzed apartment block on Spichernstrasse he veered north, retracing the old playwright’s daily stroll to the Romaishces Cafe. Over coffee and chess — the cyclist had read — Brecht and Grosz had called for a new kind of art and gifted it to the world. Some mornings the cyclist turned left rather than right and rode south to where Ernst Kirchner — one of the fathers of Expressionism — had had his studio…the cyclist past the vacated bunkers, the demolished Sportpalast where Goebbels had declared Total War, the People’s Court where Hitler’s would be assassins had been sentenced to death. Templehof’s vast arrivals hall and cold stone eagles rose behind him…At Mie van der Rohe’s New National Gallery, built on the abandoned foundations of Speer’s Germania, he turned right to follow the canal..into Kothenerstrasse, avoiding the tracks of the trams which no longer ran, and glided towards the Wall. At the edge of no man’s land he coasted to a stop and rolled his bike into Hansa Sound Studio.” In this imaginative piece, I feel that Rory MacClean sums up better than anyone, the new Bowie, the Bowie who wrote in his diary, “I have now got the will . I will be and I will work. “ MacClean succintly puts it, “Many come to Berlin on a search, often for themselves. Bowie found himself in Berlin. He pulled away from addiction and shed his false personas.” Bowie said of the period, “Life in LA had left me with an overwhelming sense of foreboding. I had approached the brink of drug-induced calamity one too many times and it was essential to take positive action. Berlin was one of the few cities where I could move around in virtual anonymity. I was going broke, it was cheap to live. For some reason, Berliners just didn’t care. Well, not about an English rock singer…” Alastair Mackay, writing in Uncut, says, “Bowie, enjoying his isolation in Berlin, remained enthralled by the electronic music of Neu! and Kraftwerk and was heavily under the influence of Eno. But the real sense you get from Heroes, is of an artist relaxing into a new identity…What you hear is a kind of alienated psyche music; European, and narrated, as ever, in the Mockney patois of Anthony Newley. There’s no denying the influence of the Cold War’s divided city on the mood. The three instrumentals on side two — Sense of Doubt, MossGarden and Neukoln — are like a soundtrack to the geopolitical anxieties of the day.” Hansa’s Studio Two had been used as a dance hall by the Gestapo, and was known by Bowie as ‘The hall by the Wall’. “It was a Weimar ballroom,” he told Uncut in 2001, “utilised by Gestapo in the ’30s for their own little musical ‘soirées’. The studio itself was a relic. My first impressions were of the curtains surrounding the studio, and the darkness in the studio. It was not foreboding, just that the air was thick with a darker vibe. You have got to remember, we’re painting a picture based on our emotional disposition and you’re thinking: Germans, Nazis, the Wall, oppression. These things are hanging in the air, and when things get darker physically, you kind of think of darker themes too. Berlin was a rather dark, industrial place to work. There was one point when we wanted to see a bit of light and we asked them to open the curtains. There were these gigantic, heavy curtains and when they did that we saw the walk where the gunner is and that was a rather rude awakening. Although it gave us a cold slap in the face as to where we were, it also gave us a heavier resolve about the intensity of what we were doing. All five albums that Bowie made during his time in Berlin are extraordinary pieces of work, but the one that is most firmly rooted in Berlin is “Heroes”. Tony Visconti, in his book, A New Career In A New Town, writes, “The music and lyrics on the album were informed by cultural and physical differences between East and West, the Russian Red Guards that could see into the studio, and the sheer scale of Berlin’s recent history all contributed to a darker, more claustrophobic atmosphere than that on Low.” The defining track on the album was lead single, “Heroes”, it was to to become a anthem for the divided city. It’s constant fascination lies in it’s open interpretation, but the lyrics I remember
Standing by the wall
And the guns, shot above our heads
And we kissed, as though nothing could fall firmly rooted it in Berlin and the insane situation in which people had to live. Visconti writes, “The couple’s kiss in the shadows of the Berlin Wall famously inspired the lyrics of the title track. After a few days of lead vocals David decided to have a go at “Heroes”. He had to write the lyrics first and it seemed to be taking a long time. Antonia was visiting and our conversation, albeit a quiet one, was distracting him. He asked us to literally ‘take a walk’ so he could finish the lyrics. The area around the studio only had a few shops and a coffee house and it was late evening. It was kind of bleak. The control room window faced a forsaken empty lot sometimes used as a gypsy encampment, with the ubiquitous Wall looming in the distance. Antonia and I had a coffee and walked around a bit but didn’t go very far as it felt unsafe. We stopped beneath the control room window to look at the Wall. We had a little chat about it that somehow turned into a little snog. We chatted some more and then returned to the studio.” Heroes became a Berlin anthem. Bowie returned to the city almost thirty years after writing it, MacClean eloquently describes that night , “In June 1987, his driver drove him past the old Hauptstasse apartment, by the Brucke Musuem and Hansa, to a stage in front of the Reichstag. As night fell, her performed to 70,000 fans, their candles and sparklers glittering around the Platz der Republik. Towards the end of the show, he read a message in German, ‘We send our wishes to all our Friends who are on the other side of the Wall’ . Then he sang ‘Heroes’. On the other side of the hateful divide, hundreds of young East Berliners strained to hear the echoes of the concert. They caught sight of stage lights flashing off blank, bullet marked walls. They heard Bowie greet them. They listened to his song. Their song. Berlin’s song. As ‘Heroes’ reached its climax some of the East German crowd pushed towards the Brandenburg gate, whistling and chanting, ‘Down with the Wall’. They threw insults and bottles and the Volkspolizei, rising together against the thugs in a rare moment of protest. On stage Bowie hard the tears from the other side. He was in tears.” “It was one of the most emotional performances I have ever done, he said later, It was breaking my hear…that’s the town where it was written, and that’s the particular situation that it was written about. It was just extraordinary. So, where is Bowie in Berlin? On the physical level, there is Hauptstrasse 155, you can stand across the road and look over at it, and imagine back, to young Bowie and Pop, barely in their 30s, strutting in their East Berlin duds down to Neues Ufer for a beer, which you can do too. There is Hansa, which for a princely sum, you can get a tour of; there is the Brucke museum where you can walk in the footsteps of Bowie gazing at the works of Kirchner, Kollwitz and Heckel. But much of Berlin is steeped with Bowie, or Bowie is steeped in Berlin; stick on your headphones, listen to the album Heroes and wander Neukolln the open streets and through the crowds spilling out of the shopfronts — chatting, laughing, eating, drinking, smoking and cavorting, Explore the tree lined avenues of Schoneberg, diving in and out of the book, antique and junk stores listening to Sound and Vision. Embrace the sonic experimentation of Eno on the second half of Low, and wander about the Wall at Nordbahnhof and through the quiet cobblestreets of Prenzlaeur Berg with Warszawa, Art Decade, Weeping Wall and Subterraneans. Go to Potsdamer Platz and listen to Heroes and Where are We Now?. Ride the U-Bahn listening to Lust for Life, The Passenger, Success and Tonight; and you’ll find Bowie permeates the city in that willow the wisp enchanting way of his."

Medium.com,Life,Skiing in the Summer? It’s Possible,Travel,https://medium.com/@drkarimhussain/skiing-in-the-summer-its-possible-b5e606f42368?source=topic_page---------493------------------1," There are many people who look forward to the winter season for the snow sports opportunities that this time of year provides. For such people, there are few things more satisfying than hitting the slopes and cruising down on fresh powder. As such, the start of the summer season might seem to put a damper on these dreams, but skis and boards don’t have to be packed away until the next winter season. Skiing in the summer is possible in various locations around the world. In the Southern Hemisphere, for example, the winter is in full swing from June to October. Up north, snow can still be found on the highest peaks in Europe and North America. Whether you’re an ardent skier or just someone who loves the sport and can’t imagine taking time away from it, the following locations are bound to provide what you’re looking for. Whistler, Canada Located a couple of hours north of Vancouver, Whistler is a skier’s paradise. The area records more than 33 metres of snow annually, enough to ensure that enthusiasts can enjoy themselves fully. Getting up the high slopes requires the use of lifts, and the slopes are soft and meandering. Generally, the ski terrain has a mixture of long trails through trees and steep slopes for the daredevils. Around it is a mountain atmosphere that feels authentic and exhilarating. Zermatt, Switzerland Zermatt is popular with skiers all year round, thanks to ample snow on the Theodul Glacier, which provides the highest skiing attraction in Europe. In addition to its snow-sure trails, Zermatt also offers tremendous views of the iconic Matterhorn mountain. During the summer, skiers are encouraged to hit the slopes early to enjoy the best conditions. There are summer ski school options available for beginners, and numerous examples of proper form as various ski teams like to practice on the mountain. Zermatt also borders the Italian town of Cervinia, with the two sharing a ski area that’s open to people throughout the year. The ski slopes on the Italian town’s side are open during the summer months of June to September, with the Matterhorn in the background. Cervinia is just one of various Italian locations that offer summer skiing, an attraction to ski lovers such as Dr Karim Hussain, a Consultant Oral and Maxillofacial / Head and Neck Surgeon at King’s College Hospital in London. Les Deux Alpes, France Les Deux Alpes is one of the largest summer ski areas in Europe, and while it doesn’t take visitors all year round, the Mont-de-Lans Glacier is open from June to late August. Ski camps are available through the summer, and there are a variety of attractions that suit both beginner and experienced skiers. The area also has a lively, modern town that has shops, bars and accommodation catering to every budget level. Visitors who get a six-day ski pass can access various skiing areas during their stay. Enjoying the Snow Many of the ski resorts that offer summer skiing are located on glaciers that benefit from low temperatures at night, which ensures the snow is compact for the next day. While skiers are unlikely to encounter fresh powder, the summer can lead to smooth conditions that make it easy to glide along. Skiing resorts worth their salt usually have a terrain park, which can compensate for a smaller ski area with additions such as pipes, rails and skicross tracks for skiers of all levels. These terrain parks are suitable for individuals looking to perfect their skills before heading out to the slopes. Since many slopes operate from early morning to early afternoon, individuals often have to find other activities to keep them busy after the slopes close. There’s no harm in relaxing and taking in the mountain scenery or lacing up your hiking boots to interact closely with nature."

Medium.com,Life,RV Living Lesson #1 — Setting the Pace,Travel,https://medium.com/@hbrahms/rv-living-lesson-1-setting-the-pace-d7dc08c26d5a?source=topic_page---------496------------------1," On our 3,227-mile journey we quickly learned about setting the pace. We were using a maps app to calculate distances and travel times. One thing was soon apparent…the drive times were way off. Our times were almost double what the GPS programs were telling us. The map programs are designed for those driving cars at the posted speeds with no stops. We learned from other RV’ers there are programs out there designed specifically for RV’s. You can enter in the size (height, width, weight) of your rig and your average speed when driving. One person advised us he uses 40 miles per hour to allow for stops along way. We plugged in the suggested speed and our drive times matched what we were traveling. Now we had a true indication of how long our trip would be with breaks and sights included. Our goal was to arrive at the next campground during daylight so we could get setup before sunset. We came close to arriving in the dark on the Las Vegas to Moab, UT leg. The journey 467 miles and according to the regular map program would be 7-hours driving. Yeah, not even close! It took us 11 and half hours to drive the 467 miles. We didn’t know most of the drive would be climbing or descending canyons on twisty steep roads. The views were incredible, but we had no time to stop and take in the vistas laid out before us. Our breaks were long enough to stretch the legs, use the facilities, grab a snack, then back on the road. By the time we got to Moab the sun was lighting the sky on fire as it descended below the horizon. We managed to get setup before total darkness enveloped the campground. LIFE LESSON LEARNED: At times, we are so consumed with stuff. We race from one thing to another and miss sights along the way. When we slow down and really look at ‘busy’ we often find it full of fluff. There are ways you can live in your calendar and be extremely productive in a few hours per week. This frees up time for family, friends, staycations, vacations, hobbies and interests. When was the last time you stopped and just breathed? STOP! Do it now…inhale for the count of 7. Hold for count of 4. Slowly exhale to the count of 11. Repeat. When was the last time you took a vacation? Grab your calendar and block time in your calendar within the next 3–6 months for a vacation. When was the last time you took your loved one on a date? Go find out what night they are available and get it scheduled. Don’t forget to book babysitters, restaurant, tickets, etc.. When was the last time you went out for a day with family or friends and just enjoyed the time together? Organise a get together for a meal, BBQ, day at the beach or park, apple picking, game night…Oh I’m sure you can come up with something fun everyone will enjoy. Do not waste time being busy with fluff; after all, we only get one shot at life and it is short. Slow down, enjoy the vistas and experiences life offers."
Medium.com,Life,How Two Weeks On Vancouver Island Soothed My British Soul,Travel,https://medium.com/@sjmyles79/how-two-weeks-on-vancouver-island-soothed-my-british-soul-cbd4b01cad50?source=topic_page---------497------------------1," D
ue to a variety of circumstances, I had not travelled beyond the shores of Great Britain for a number of years. We decided that the summer of 2019 would be the time to shake that up, though, and headed to Vancouver Island, British Columbia, for a an epic two-week adventure. This was not my first visit to the region. We had undertaken a tour of the Pacific Northwest in 2000, which included driving across British Columbia — from Calgary to Vancouver. This time, however, we were heading further west to visit Victoria, Ucluelet, Tofino, and Nanaimo, before wrapping things up with two days in Downtown Vancouver. The trip was beyond our wildest dreams, and we made memories to last a lifetime. Sunsets over the Pacific Ocean, hikes along the Wild Pacific Trail, listening to the Netherlands Centennial Carillon in Victoria Inner Harbour, spotting humpback whales in Barkley Sound, spotting orcas from float plane over Clayoquot Sound, spotting black bears around Ucluelet Harbour, crossing the Capilano Suspension Bridge in Vancouver… we certainly made the most of our time. But, when it was all over and we had settled back into our quiet North Yorkshire home in the U.K, I was struck by the overwhelming sense of being plunged back into conflict; of heading back into a battle, of sorts. I felt as though I was returning from a much-needed fortnight of respite — but not the kind of respite one gains from a regular break from the usual daily grind. This was far deeper than that. I felt as though my very soul had been soothed by my Vancouver Island trip, and this prompted me to ask the question: Why was this sensation so striking? The answer was simple: Reconciliation and the acknowledgement of injustice. While our own nation — the Britain formerly known as ‘Great’ — has been tearing itself to shreds with excessive austerity measures for a decade and with Brexit for three years, British Columbia — and specifically the cities and communities of Vancouver Island — has been taking a different approach to both social and environmental issues. As visitors, we were immersed in it from the moment we stepped off our Airbus 330 and into Vancouver International Airport: the simple act of acknowledging injustice, making a public commitment to inclusion, and demonstrating a desire to move forward in a better way, together. In the U.K, ten years of Conservative government policy has caused the infamous British class divide to widen exponentially — with the rich getting richer, the poor getting poorer, and those in-between being pushed further down the economic ladder. Now, the National Health Service is in crisis, the education system is in crisis, there is a housing crisis, and teenagers are stabbing each other to death as a result of extreme cuts to the police, youth, social, and mental health services. And then, there is Brexit — the burdensome weight that has been dragging us down since the 2016 referendum. It was a strategy implemented by then Prime Minister David Cameron as a way of addressing internal party divisions, which was then seized upon by right-wing elements who went on to win the referendum by a narrow margin with methods that constituted electoral law-breaking. The country has unravelled so much since that point that the Conservative Party just installed many of those very same law-breakers as Government, while the populace is riven with anger and frustration. All of these issues have combined to create an oppressive country-wide atmosphere of discord and antagonism but, crucially, with nobody taking responsibility, the nation is effectively under a constant stream of gas-lighting from its government, in much the same way as the United States of America is, under the Presidency of Donald Trump. The facts of the injustices, law-breaking, and abuses of power are documented, and yet, the culprits are still installed in the highest office in the land, from which privileged position they tell us not to believe our own eyes and ears. Any respite from such a situation can only serve to pull the bigger picture into sharp relief, so it is no surprise, in retrospect, that I should be stunned at the incredible social contrast. Just look at the airports. Some argue that airports are just travel hubs, and are largely inter-changeable, but I argue that this attitude does regions around the world no favours — especially Manchester in the U.K. Manchester is a major city in the north of England and Greater Manchester is actually the second most populous urban area of the United Kingdom. It also has a rich and fascinating history, having thrived during the Industrial Revolution. Everything from manufacturing and engineering, to political, philosophical, and economic theory was developed and put to use in the region, creating an economic and academic boom. This success was irreparably damaged by the Great Depression of the 1930s, World War II, the Thatcher Government, and terrorism - but the Manchester of today is still often considered to be the second city of the United Kingdom. You would not know that from its airport, though, Terminal 1 of which is like a neglected municipal facility from the 1970s. There is nothing of the rich culture of Manchester in it, and at a time when the Conservative Government is waving its ‘Northern Powerhouse’ plan around like a vote-winner, this shows a disgraceful lack of investment. With Brexit looming large, and this run-down, grim facility being the first thing overseas visitors see when they step off the plane, it begs the question: Why would anyone else invest in Manchester when the U.K’s own government doesn’t seem to bother? Vancouver International Airport is a shining example of the difference regional investment can make. The city received a significant economic boost as a result of hosting the 2010 Winter Olympics, and the airport is designed to welcome overseas visitors to this city that has a very specific history and culture. For example, upon descent into the Vancouver International Airport Customs Hall, travellers pass the giant Musqueam Welcome Figures. Created by artist Susan Point, these are a traditional Coast Salish welcome, and are inspired by historical Coast Salish house posts. Vancouver International Airport is filled with such art installations reflecting First Nations traditions and history, as well as the region’s unique relationship with its wildlife and habitats. It all combines to communicate a philosophy of reconciliation and co-existence, and this continued work now results of The Musqueam Indian Band — YVR Airport Sustainability & Friendship Agreement of 2017. This agreement reflects the fact that the airport stands on land that is Musqueam traditional territory, and that both parties are committed to working together in friendship for the benefit of the community. This philosophy continues over on Vancouver Island, and is perhaps best encapsulated by the Royal BC Museum in Victoria, which dedicates an entire floor to the anthropology of the region, in addition to its natural history floor. These exhibits include First Nations own voices in their documentation of the true past of British Columbia — including the arrival of colonisers from Europe, such as George Vancouver from England. Facts are laid bare — from the devastating effect of European bacteria being introduced into indigenous communities, to the lasting impact of First Nations children being taken and ‘re-educated’ in Residential Schools to assimilate them into the culture of the colonisers. There is no apparent desire to shy away from these past crimes in the Royal BC Museum, or indeed Vancouver Island itself, and it is galling to a British tourist that we would have to travel over 4,000 miles to experience an objective presentation of this part of our own history. The impact of British colonialism in Canada and around the world is not taught in British schools, and it is not emphasised in our museums. There is simply no meaningful public acknowledgement or acceptance of such past injustice — the current treatment of the Windrush Generation being a particularly egregious case in point. While the U.K is busy imploding and isolating itself from its neighbours, the federal and provincial governments of Vancouver Island have signed a Treaty agreement in principle with the Ditidaht and Pacheedaht First Nations. Once ratified by all parties, this would provide up to $60 million in cash transfers, 8000 hectares of Crown, reserve and National Park land, as well as rights of self-governance after 20 years of negotiations. This point has been reached as a result of a national push toward reconciliation, helped along by the Truth and Reconciliation Commission of Canada — established to acknowledge injustices committed through colonialism (especially with Residential Schools) and to determine actions to do better. The emphasis is on moving toward a respectful partnership between all peoples. There have been, and are, many Truth and Reconciliation Commissions focused on various issues throughout the world — from Algeria to Uruguay. Even the United States of America has had two. The United Kingdom does not appear on any list of official Truth and Reconciliation Commissions, though. Indeed, for a country whose people are stereotyped as being overly polite and inclined to say “sorry” for no reason, we are very far away from truth and reconciliation. This is not to say that Canada is perfect. Injustice and racism exists, and specifically, so many indigenous women have been murdered or declared missing that this particular crisis has its own acronym (MMIW), and had its own national enquiry. Poverty levels on reservations are notably high, and several First Nations do not have access to clean drinking water. The Neskantaga First Nation, for example, has been under a ‘boil water’ advisory for 25 years. These are unacceptable human rights violations that result from colonialism, and they need to be addressed and resolved — but, there is value in the willingness of those in authority to admit to the problems in the first place, which the national public emphasis on reconciliation demonstrates. The existence of these injustices is no longer denied by authorities. There is evidence of progress in many areas. It is moving far too slowly, but moving too slowly is better than not moving at all — which is the stagnant situation afflicting the United Kingdom. Acknowledgement of injustice — as demonstrated by British Columbia — paves the way to a future of reconciliation, which is a philosophy that extends to the relationship between humans and the Canadian landscape. While West Coast economies now thrive on tourism — notably ‘adventure guides’ and tour operators — each undertakes their business with an eye on the past. The conservation of whales, bears, wolves, and cougars on Vancouver Island (and across British Columbia as a whole) is at the forefront of activities — from the way in which vessels operate in the waters around the coastline, to the design of public trash cans on the street. All are well aware of the hunting that was once prevalent, and the efforts to now protect these animals and their habitats. Most importantly of all, this national embrace of reconciliation is itself a celebration and honouring of First Nations cultures — upholding the idea of the connectedness of all things. There is still a long way to go to achieve true reconciliation on Vancouver Island and in Canada as a whole, but the willingness to try breeds hope for the future — and this is something that the United Kingdom has been lacking for a very long time. For us as British visitors, this Vancouver Island trip wasn’t just an experience of a lifetime, it was also a much-needed respite from a culture that absolutely refuses to acknowledge injustice within itself. I just wasn’t prepared to be confronted with that stark truth. Thank you, Vancouver Island, and please keep showing us how to do better."
Medium.com,Life,Why we should tap into our inner Copenhagenista,Travel,https://medium.com/@sjuggs15/why-we-should-tap-into-our-inner-copenhagenista-95b8954cd87b?source=topic_page---------498------------------1," As a trend, hygge has had its moment. Three seasons ago and ‘getting hygge’ was the thing. We were all buying our thickly-woven woollen scarves and our deep pile socks that we literally sank into. Candles, incense and diffusers rocketed off the shelves of lifestyle shops and bowls capable of holding oodles of steaming stew were prevalent in every kitchen. Of course the phase passed. We all got a bit too hot for all that wool, if allergies didn’t kick in first. Stew is all very well but it takes ages to cook and all those dripping candles left wax on every surface. But, while hygge itself may have gone out of fashion, this freelance workaholic thinks that Denmark generally, and Copenhagen in particular, has got a lot of things very right. A recent visit to the coastal city really did provide, among other things, plenty of food for thought — but more of that later. Copenhagen, the capital city of Denmark, sits on two islands — Zealand and Amager — and it is separated from Sweden by the Oresund Bridge. The city itself is divided into five districts or ‘bro’s’– Central, Osterbro, Norrebro, Vesterbro and Amagerbro, with the wider Copenhagen area extending into a number of residential districts. The population of Copenhagen is touching 750,000 which makes it the ninth most populated mainland European city. But it doesn’t feel that way. The first thing you notice about Copenhagen is how, for a capital city, it has an incredibly slow pace. Where sauntering along in many capital cities leads to being mown down by some snappily-dressed executive who uses his or her briefcase as a battering ram, in Copenhagen that is not the case. It might be something to do with the cobbles. Most of the streets in the city centre are cobbled so hurrying means to dice with a badly sprained ankle. The road surface just doesn’t countenance rushing. There is also the fact that there are many, many cellar steps to fall down. Parts of the city centre date back to medieval times and the buildings reflect the style of the time. There are tall, narrow town houses with steps outside the front of the house leading to the cellar. Very few of these cellar openings have warning signs, you just have to be watchful. Among the waterways of Christianshavn, boat moorings present a similar obstacle, with a unedifying dunking in the canal the sanction for not being careful where you are walking. That’s not to say Copenhagenistas are off the pace. Far from it. In style, clothing, fashion, ethics even, there is plenty of evidence that Denmark’s urban population are leaders in the field of modern living. For a start there is the look. The best way of describing Copenhagen fashion is classically understated. Caps and hats worn by both genders are functional and smart. They do not look pretentious but equally they do not look overly sensible. Beards are worn with style, not as an obvious hipster statement. Layering is the only way to dress because Copenhagen’s weather changes hourly. This is where an innate sense of style means a mixture of cottons, linens and woollens just looks right. Copenhagen feels like a place where the planet is in careful and caring hands. Organic produce is everywhere and that extends to the clothing. Organic clothing is the norm not the unusual. Recycled materials are reborn as underwear, shoes and belts; there are loads of second hand clothes stores. The majority of bicycles whizzing around the city streets are vintage, displaying a care for possessions that is missing in many other western societies where goods are scrapped all too quickly. When it comes to bicycles, Denmark actually outperforms that other bastion of bikes — the Netherlands. There are more bikes per capita than people and 75 per cent of the population cycle throughout the year. There are 250 miles (400km) of cycle ways within the city and 1.27km are covered everyday as the population makes their way to school, university, work or leisure on two-wheels. As a result the population looks and acts healthy. Whether they are going to work or meeting friends for a night out, cycling — and increasingly using scooters — are the main forms of travel in the city. There is also a huge amount of joggers and runners, while on the canals and open sea rowers and canoeists are thrashing up and down the waterways. And when it comes to swimming Denmark, along with its other Scandinavian neighbours, Sweden, is a world leader. Along its canals and waterways are places where people indulge in open air swimming, even in the depths of a sub-zero winter. It was noticeable that the air in the capital city was missing that metallic smell and taste that is so prevalent in most large cities in Europe, America and Asia. The main pollutant was the noise of the bicycle bells as the Danes (politely) signalled that they were riding towards you. To emphasise just how much cycling means to the Danes, there is a global term ‘Copenhagenization,’ which means to design cities and urban areas around bike accessibility and pedestrians. In the 1960s, the Danish government, working with urban designers, decided that their policy would be to get vehicles out of city centres as far as possible and so Copenhagenization was born. If this all sounds a little like a eulogy to all things Danish, it is because it is a little difficult to knock something that is so good. Which leads neatly onto the food scene. The heart of the Danish food scene is provenance and quality of the produce. Whether it is a traditional smorrebrod (open faced sandwich); a fish dish, using a wide range of fish and shellfish plucked straight from the ocean; a piece of well-hung Danish beef or an organically-reared piece of pork; or a cinnamon-packed snegl; there is huge pride in the food being served. Michelin starred restaurants abound in the city, including the world famous Nomu, but the locals know that they don’t need to dig too deep into their pockets to eat well. This is the city where food is seasonal and locally grown, eating healthy fruits, vegetables and salads is an easy option, gluten free options are everywhere and organic is the default status. As a small illustration: at coastal trendy spot Toldboden, one of the most popular lunchtime snacks is a plate of raw seasonal vegetables, with chips — it is surprisingly moreish, even for an inveterate meat eater. If we are going to talk about what makes Copenhagen a favourite place to be, then it is impossible to not talk about the coffee culture. Yes, there was a Stabucks in the city but I only saw hesitant tourists stepping into it, almost straight off the train. Once their feet were grounded and they realised that Danes are exceptionally good at speaking English, then the independent coffee shops were on everyone’s itinerary. King of the Coppi is Coffee Collectif, but you can pretty much guarantee a cool and high quality coffee experience in every district and on every corner. “Take out a mortgage,” I was advised before leaving for my city break in Copenhagen. True, it is expensive but only by hick-town standards. You will easily match the prices for beer, food and hotels in major European cities. A glass of Royal Classic beer set us back £8/$10; a three course meal in a well-placed restaurant in the Meat Packers area cost between £70-£100/person ($90-$125), but that is not above the expected spend in London or New York. And it is definitely easy to eat cheaper and equally well. Much of Denmark’s reputation for being costly can be attributed to high taxes. At 25 per cent, they are high compared to many countries but then their social care, their education and their health service is excellent. On a more prosaic scale, streets are clean, bins are emptied and parks and gardens are well-tended. Services for the people, paid for by the people. The final word has to be about the strange Copenhagen habit of smiling at people. After three days of being continuously smiled at, I tried it for myself … it felt nice."
Medium.com,Life,Chanting With Teacher Yang,Travel,https://psiloveyou.xyz/chanting-with-teacher-yang-fe7557688cd9?source=topic_page---------499------------------1," Yang Laoshi was the pronunciation teacher during my first semester of Mandarin study. She was from some rural county in Shandong province and she had a bizarre accent. Lingling, the desk clerk at the foreign student’s dormitory, laughed when I mentioned that. “Nongcun ren,” she said, her facial expression indicating that the English translation should be “hillbilly.” Yang Laoshi certainly looked the part. She was tall, as were many of the people from Shandong, and she had a blocky frame with big, square hands. It was easy to imagine her driving one of the rusty Soviet-era tractors that could still be seen working the fields in the countryside. Her short no-nonsense hair style and coarse gray jumper looked to be from the same period. She spoke rapidly at all times and most of the other students in the class could barely understand her. I couldn’t even tell that she was speaking Mandarin. When I heard her questioning lilt and the stabbing “Ke Meilin” at the end, I would snap to attention, a jolt of fear twisting my stomach. Ke Meilin was my Chinese name, and I recognized the tone of mockery in her question. She knew I couldn’t understand her and she would intentionally call on me when the question was especially convoluted because it was sure to get a hearty laugh from the rest of the class. “Bu zhi dao,” I would always whisper, looking down at the page. I was in way over my head and Yang Laoshi loved to rub my nose in it. I told myself her cruelty was a result of soul-crushing experiences in the Cultural Revolution, but the humiliation stung. Every so often, I would experience a few moments of complete bafflement when she said something that sounded especially strange and then looked at me intently. I could feel the confused “What??” that formed in my eyebrows at these times. She had not asked a question, but she clearly expected something from me. Finally, she would get an embarrassed look and quickly turn back to face the chalkboard. One day I whispered to my desk mate Mieko, “Do you know what she said?” Mieko was in her early 40s, the second-oldest student in the class, just a few years younger than me. She spoke some English. “I think she is trying to practice English on you,” she whispered back. Ahhh…so that was it. From then on, her chagrin at my lack of understanding was a form of sweet revenge. According to Lingling, Yang Laoshi had previously taught English at the university. No wonder the Chinese students struggled with their English pronunciation. I never understood a single English word she said. Among her teaching techniques was one of the classic methods of instruction used in China at all education levels: group recitation. The class stands up and repeats in unison after the teacher with a loud, booming voice. I had seen elementary school classes doing this outside in a courtyard, maybe 70 kids (typical class size in China), and it was like being in a stadium with thousands of screaming fans. Our class had only 20 members, but it was still deafening, and Yang Laoshi always wanted us to yell louder. I resisted this for a long time; I hadn’t come halfway around the world to be turned into a brainwashed parrot. I kept my lips moving, but I didn’t actually participate. One day a month or two into the semester, I’m not sure why, I actually joined in the recitation. They were simple sentences and I repeated them along with the class over and over, each time louder. Finally we were shouting. It seemed like the windows were rattling. And then my body was vibrating. I felt myself sinking into the sound, the boundaries of my mind melting. I was one with the vibration, no longer thinking, no longer Ke Meilin, no longer an “I”. There was only “We”, one sound-producing organism. I was not watching this happen. I was simply NOT. My “I-ness” was joined into this group until it no longer existed. It was hallucinogenic, hypnotic, like I had fallen under a spell that we were chanting. When we stopped, I came back into my individual self. It was like being abruptly thrown into a room alone, the door slammed shut. I had never felt that kind of group unity before, that sense of hive mind. From then on I joined the daily recitations. The sentences lodged in my mind, not as strings of words, but as whole chunks of meaning. My pronunciation improved rapidly. I understood the Mandarin tones in a way I hadn’t previously grasped and it was almost effortless. I finally felt like I was making progress on my studies, and Yang Laoshi stopped singling me out for torment. Group exercise and rote memorization are routinely practiced in Chinese education. Chinese youth spend hours of their lives engaged in such activity, from preschool on and even into their working lives. In the morning, it is common to see groups of young employees in front of businesses starting the work day with a group chant of some company slogan or jingle. As a Westerner, I tend to dismiss rote learning and group think as inhibiting creativity and innovation, a form of mind control. Perhaps that is true. But the sense of unity and connection just that little taste engendered in me was powerful, and it felt good and energizing both physically and psychologically. One of the strengths of the Chinese nation is their sense of group identity, the strong sense of “we”. Of course it takes much more to build that, but perhaps in our chronically alienated and fragmented Western society, we could use a push in that direction."
Medium.com,Life,Sydney’s Very Own Grand Canyon,Travel,https://medium.com/@TheOutOutdoors/sydneys-very-own-grand-canyon-25e100d74db?source=topic_page---------500------------------1," Deep in the heart of the Blue Mountains lays a hidden gem with its own beaten track: The Grand Canyon. Mind you, it’s a lot greener than the one in the US. Starting at the top near Evans Lookout, you walk down a copious amount of stairs to the valley floor. Each step brings a depleting temperature, matching the dense and moisturous surroundings. There’s something powerful about walking down this way, watching fellow trekkers push on back to the top. You can feel their hearts pumping as they attempt to catch all the oxygen around them. You might even need to give them encouragement; “only 10 minutes to go!” As you go deeper, immersing yourself in shadows of the rising cliffs on either side, you witness a new sense of calm. The sounds of running water and nothing else permeates the air. A new wonder begins to emerge. Turn around and glimpse the rising stairs that you have just descended, the sun shining in the distance. Reaching the valley floor is just the first step in a long journey. You learn to find yourself amongst the sprouting bushes and trickles of creek. You weave through the cooler temperatures, across small bridges and over tight steps. You arch your head to see the canopy above, as well as where the cliff edge starts. But you can’t be here forever. Eventually you will need to bring yourself back up again. The halfway point is not properly marked, but you know it when you see it. Mostly because of the rising steps into the sharp afternoon sunlight. It’s like taking your first step in anything scary. It’s a short rise, but it builds the heart rate. It tells you that the finish line is a long way off, but you need this energetic kick. You rise just above the valley floor, still hearing the sounds of trickling water while marvelling at the fallen trees and branches. You take in the sun, somewhat wishing it would hide away. But it’s okay, it’s keeping you warm. “Just keep on,” you tell yourself. “It’s nearly over.” But in order to reach nirvana, you’ve got to push yourself up the steps. Attaining happiness is never easy. You start rising, closer and closer to the beating sun. At first you feel good, but then the pain hits. Your heart rate pounds against your chest as you collect all that oxygen. It just keeps rising and you wonder how much further. You mutter a few “oh gods” between those heavy breaths. Where is the end to all this hell? How much further? All these questions come and with each one you reply with “I just gotta do it!” Another turn, more steps. Another turn, and yet more steps. Your legs ache, screaming for relief. So does your mind. But you can’t give up. Gotta keep going! And then you see it. The glossy shimmer of a car. It’s hope. Another turn and you reach the end. You did it. The Grand Canyon is located in Blackheath in the Blue Mountains. Be sure to pack a bottle of water and food."
Medium.com,Life,Need an Epiphany? Travel Alone.,Travel,https://medium.com/@chryssymoor/need-an-epiphany-travel-alone-a17135eb5a70?source=topic_page---------501------------------1," When all is still, I take it as a sign. It’s time to look inward. It’s time reset that gut. A few years ago, I was contemplating divorce. Hard. I booked a work conference without my husband. It was the first time I traveled solo. Sometimes we aren’t very comfortable with ourselves, and I wasn’t then. I wanted to text people I knew instead of talk to the strangers around me or get to know myself. But still, I managed to spend a day with me. In a high floor hotel room in Denver, I weighed the pros and cons of leaving my husband. This is where and when I decided to get a divorce. I remember writing in this room. Looking out the window at the far off mountains. Making a pros and cons list. Thinking about a male friend who paid more attention to me and was more interested in me than my husband was. I remember thinking I could go downstairs in this big hotel and fuck a stranger if I so chose. I’d been faithful to my husband since turning down one of his fraternity brothers the first week we dated, way back in college. And while I didn’t act on my Denver impulse, I knew that at this stage, I was done with this marriage. I remember ripping the notes I’d written to shreds. I didn’t want to remember this. I remember crying. The time and space, the pure attention, I gave myself and my feelings while traveling alone in Denver set the next couple years of pain and progress in motion. After I’d told my husband it was time to separate, I had the pull to be alone again. Now that I’d given myself a little breathing room, I realized I needed more. Both parents had died. I’d just recovered from several surgeries. I had no idea how to be alone, how to manage my own life, how to be a mom without a sidekick. I took off on a solo hike through Spain. It was the greatest gift I ever granted myself. I put hundreds of miles on my feet and lifted big weights from my soul. I struggled and cried and was hurt there. And I would do it again 1000 times. Again, I changed the trajectory of my life. Again, I’d done it by taking a step back from the day to day. After Spain, I learned to listen. To trust my gut. To have faith, or my version of it. I know myself better. I am an emotional creature who loves deeply. I am perceptive and intuitive as well as reliant on science and data. I can be both. After my divorce, I continued to periodically travel alone. I learned I can enjoy it. Sometimes I am still apprehensive. Sometimes I worry no one will talk to me, or I’ll get severely lost (which, honestly, generally happens), or I will just be uncomfortable. And sometimes I am. But just for a moment. Taking a step outside my regular life to look from a new angle or to quietly consider where I am has never turned out negatively. Don’t get me wrong, I’ve set myself up for major pain this way. But I’ve also set myself up for major growth. Learning alone, struggling through those moments of discomfort, have led me to my highest joys. A few months ago, I traveled alone to Seattle. It was just to be a quick, fun trip. It was. But I also met a couple cool friends from various places on the globe. I spent some of my time there realizing I perhaps actually liked the guy I’d been seeing for a couple weeks back home. I think our funny banter while I was away was more establishing for us than the few times we’d hung out before I left. Right now, today, I am alone in California. And right now, today, I almost chickened out and said no to one of the best solo days I’ve ever had. This morning as I got ready, I thought of 100 reasons not to do the day hike I’d planned. Once I was out on the cliff, I thought it looked hard and I should turn around. Later, on the edge of some slippery rocks as the sun beat down, I thought the terrain ahead looked rough. Three times I was scared. Three times, I continued on. All three times, the road ahead was simpler and more enjoyable than I thought it’d be. Sometimes I still I want my phone to buzz when I’m alone. I want someone — near or far — to distract or entertain me. I want someone to take me out of the rough stuff I’m quietly wading through. But now, when all is still, I take it as a sign. It’s time to listen inwardly. It’s time to reset that gut. As I’m here in my hotel now, I’m thinking about my career, thinking about my future, asking myself where I will go. Asking myself who might stand beside me on my journey. And the answers haven’t shot out at me just yet. But history indicates, if I give myself some time and space — some new experience and new perspective — it will."
Medium.com,Life,Racism Without Borders: My Experience Traveling and Working Abroad as a Woman of Color,Travel,https://medium.com/@sarahlstewart18/racism-without-borders-my-experience-traveling-and-working-abroad-as-a-woman-of-color-429a865c0d50?source=topic_page---------502------------------1," 4 years. 45 flights. 33 cities. 15 countries. 11 trains. Numerous buses. Metro rides galore. Infinite microaggressions. This is life as a traveling woman of color. It’s beautiful, it’s ugly, and it’s changed my life forever. The ability to travel financially, career-wise, physically, and emotionally is a privilege. I am so grateful that such a wonderful, enriching opportunity is available to me. But I won’t sugar-coat the tough parts of travel, and I want to be candid about my experiences. This is my experience with unwanted attention, and advice I have for other women of color that are interested in traveling. Before I begin, it’s appropriate to share how I identify racially, and how this has affected my life. I am a biracial woman, of black and white descent. I am from the southeastern United States, which deeply affected how I experienced and understood my own racial identity growing up. Often used to being a minority, I didn’t know how to be in spaces of color. At the same time, I wasn’t prepared mentally and emotionally for how racism exists in countries outside of the United States, because this can vary greatly by culture. It wasn’t until some negative, even dangerous experiences did I begin to fully understand the world we live in. Just like anyone, I’m still learning. But I’ve found that traveling is one thing, traveling as a woman is another, and traveling as a woman of color is a distinct experience at the seldom-considered intersection of race and gender. I remember the first time my racial difference was blatantly pointed out in an environment outside of the United States. And it was done so in a way to explicitly “other” me, meaning it was intended to remind me I was a brown person — and to never let me forget it. Moreover, it was clear that this “otherness” was indeed not a good thing. After I graduated from college, I found a job that matched my skills and career goals. It was perfect, the job that I was dreaming of. After a months-long application and vetting process, I was cleared to work with an NGO in an Eastern European country. I was beyond thrilled, grateful, and ready for my next steps. Before moving to the permanent community within which I would live, my employer delivered a rigorous 3-month training program. As a worker in the Economic Development sector, I was sent to a small city. From the moment I met my host family, it was bliss. I was so fortunate to experience the warmth, love, and hospitality in their home. I would live with them again in a heartbeat. However, outside the walls of their apartment, I faced a daily battle. Not only were the recently arrived trainees like myself jet-lagged and exhausted with our 12-hour days, I was processing where the intersections of my race, gender, marital status, and age placed me within this society. I would be remiss to ignore my nationality, or passport privilege, amongst a culture that is fighting for freedom of movement. But, aside from that, I was afforded little to no respect professionally, socially, and all the other -lys. I also experienced more than my fair share of eroticization on behalf of male host country nationals. As a result, my body was often hyper-sexualized and people partook at their pleasure. I unwillingly served as the physical manifestation of their sexual fantasies about the stereotypical “slutty American girl with ‘exotic’ skin.” It was dehumanizing, violating, and emotionally exhausting, to say the least. The microaggressions were also a battle for me. Sure, I experienced some in the States. But, I stood out much more in this region on the basis of my skin color, and that made my experience unique relative to my travels in other areas of the world. In the city where I completed my training, there is a form of public transit called a trolleybus. I love them. They were affordable on my budget, and are essentially buses attached to electrical wiring that provide reliable service. I took one to my language trainer’s apartment every day. On each bus is a conductor, who is responsible for collecting fares and distributing receipts. If asked, you are expected to show your receipt and prove you paid your fare. After a couple of weeks, I realized that the trolleybus conductors wanted to see my receipt at every single stop. Even if it was next to empty. Even if everyone stared at me when I got on, because I was the only passenger with visibly darker skin. I was always asked to show my receipt, without fail. I even saw many locals get on without paying, but they were never prompted. In these moments, the trolleybus conductor wasn’t asking everyone for their receipts. If so, I would have understood. But they didn’t. One specific day, we had a Saturday technical training quite a distance from where my small group lived. We took a trolley car together, and a few of us sat together. I was near two friends, both of whom can pass as white. The conductor came to us, wanting to see receipts. Considering I was well-used to this, mine was in a special pocket of my purse and ready within seconds. While my friends were still looking for theirs, the conductor looked at mine and left. My friends saw the whole thing. The looks on their faces were priceless. That was the moment I knew for certain that I wasn’t imagining things. I wasn’t crazy. And most importantly, I wasn’t the one “making everything about race.” These conductors only wanted to see my receipt, because my skin color alerted them to assume that I was stealing. While I am candid about my experiences during this stage of my career, I loved and miss many aspects of my life there. My experience is not representative of every single person in this nation, but rather a series of moments where I was markedly different, and in a bad way. This difference is not an invisible diversity, not one that I can cover up, and not one I want to hide even if I could. All of that being said, plenty of people in America experience microaggressions and blatant racism every day. Unfortunately, I expect this to continue happening to me and other travelers of color I know throughout the world. Now that I’ve shared some of my own story, what do I want to say to other women of color that travel, or want to start? You are not imagining things. You deserve the travel experience just as much as any other traveler that is not a person of color. You will face barriers to travel for your gender and your race. While everyone’s experience is important, not everyone will face those barriers like you will. I won’t tell you not to travel solo, because I have before. I’ve also been with friends when I was discriminated against. If you’re going to be singled out, it can happen regardless of your surroundings, your behavior, and your clothing. Don’t let these situations control you, but don’t suppress them or minimize their effects. It is not even remotely your job to educate others, regardless of their race, ethnicity, or nationality, about your experience and how to be an ally. If you want to, then do so. But if you need to take a step back and focus on your own process, then don’t feel guilty about it. Not for one second. And, above all, buy the plane ticket."
Medium.com,Life,Dinner(s) at Le Felteu,Travel,https://medium.com/writerontherun/dinner-s-at-le-felteu-e2ad4b288e2c?source=topic_page---------503------------------1," Many years ago, while researching a trip to Paris, my husband came across a recommendation for Le Felteu bistro. It was a little tricky to find, the article warned, but well worth the trouble. And so, armed with a sturdy map and much determination, we set off. It was down a very quiet side street and didn’t look like much from the outside. It didn’t look like much from the inside, either, with its Formica tables and peeling wallpaper. But Alan trusted his source, so we sat down. We were the first diners in the place, not realizing that everyone in Paris eats a good couple of hours later than they do in Canada. This did not win us any points with Gerry, the leather-clad owner. Nor did the fact that we were speaking English to each other. We did our best speaking French to him, but for someone fluent in the language, it must have been painful. As we were settling with our first glass of very good wine (and we’d gone up a tiny notch in Gerry’s estimation by taking the advice of the chalkboard menu and ordering the vin de la semaine) a table of American and Dutch tourists arrived. When it came time to order, they tried to ask for substitutions on the menu. In English. Gerry explained, in French, that substitutions were not possible, that the chef had planned the menu carefully and well. It was a small dining room, and one of the women at the table heard us speaking English. “Can you ask him if I could have the chicken with the béarnaise sauce?” she called over to me. By this point, I was pretty happy and relaxed with the good wine and some fresh baguette. “You did ask him,” I told her. “He said no.” She looked disappointed. “Just order what’s on the menu,” I advised. “You won’t be unhappy.” It was then we realized that, while Gerry spoke not a word of it, he understood English perfectly well. He became a little more attentive to us, and a little more gracious. And the food was excellent. So good, in fact, that a couple of nights later, we brought the rest of the group we were traveling with back to Le Felteu. “You’ll love it,” we promised. “Just don’t look at the wallpaper.” On the way, I insisted that they practice saying hello in French. “Bon soir!” I coached. “Say it with me!” And reluctantly, they did. When we got in, Alan and I said a cheery “Bon soir!” and then I nudged each of them in turn to repeat it. Alan’s Dad was one of the group with us and not an adventurous eater. We explained what everything was, as best we could. None of it seemed to appeal. “How about the Rognons de Veau?” Alan asked. “Veau is veal.” “Sure,” said Dad. “I like veal.” Gerry took our orders to the kitchen. And returned to the dining room, followed by the chef. “Rognons de Veau?” he asked. Were we sure? Not understanding his concern, we nodded. Dad had his heart set on veal, and that was what he was going to get. Once again, the food was gorgeous. I had the duck confit and floated on a cloud of tasty loveliness. “This is the strangest veal I’ve ever had,” Dad muttered. I took a look. It looked like mushrooms and bits of meat in a thick gravy. “Don’t you like it?” I asked, concerned. “We could trade if you like?” Dad was recently widowed. We wanted him to have a good time. “No, it’s OK. It’s just not what I was expecting…”"

T
ravel porn is a thing, and it is a problem. Porn by its very definition is the exploitation of one thing for the benefit of another, whether it’s food, flesh…or travel. If you travel to the Great Wall of China, the Grand Canyon, or the Serengeti, solely to say you’ve been there — or worse, to snap a pic and share it on social to get the sweet dopamine rush of “Likes” — you’re not experiencing the place at all. You’re using it. Exploiting it. Yep, just like porn. No, this isn’t the petty preaching of some shut-in who’d rather drink beer from his couch like Karl Pilkington from An Idiot Abroad. Truth is, I speak from experience. During a recent trip abroad, I went shark diving. It was in a cage, in an aquarium, in an activity safe enough that you only have to be 10 years old to do it. But I had to appear like I was some Indiana Jones-like adventurer risking life and limb to swim among the ocean’s fiercest predators (and not a grown man from the Midwest wading in a fish tank). I found myself thinking non-stop what I would post before I even did it — before I even left home! It had to be clever and nonchalant, like this was just another day in the life of the globetrotting daredevil I wanted to look like. Was I doing this solely for social media glorification? Not exclusively, but more than I would have liked. It made the moment shallower than the 20-foot tank I was in. And when the post didn’t get enough “Likes” (what is “enough”, even?), it forced me to take a step back and reassess: why am I doing this? Why do I travel anywhere and do anything? For the experience? Or for what I think it says about me? Look at it like this: if I were to snap a pic of my seven-figure check, or my 10,000-square foot mansion in the palisades (neither of which I have), people wouldn’t be impressed by how interesting I am; they’d see me as a shallow show-off. How is showing off a status symbol like money or mansions any different than doing the same thing with a travel experience? Is taking a pic and sharing it automatically a bad thing? Absolutely not. Ultimately it comes down to what’s in your head and your heart, and only you can know that. But if you risk death and dismemberment to get the cliche “arms spread pose” picture on a cliff side in Tibet, you’re not doing it for the right reasons. Or if you’re staging what should be a meaningful moment in Manila solely for the shallow hit you get from social media. Or if you go to Thailand, and continue to post pictures weeks, months, even years later, each time with #takemeback, as if this normal, humdrum life (which the rest of us are living too, btw) can’t compare to your past experience. So you might be saying: “Hey jerk, who are you to be saying there’s a right reason to travel?” Fair enough. I am well within my right to spend hundreds, if not thousands, of dollars to travel to a far away place for a selfie-photo shoot…but that doesn’t make me a more interesting person. It makes me the modern equivalent of the guy in the 1960s who made his next-door neighbors sit through his slideshow of his family trip to Yosemite. All I’m missing is an avocado green polo and polyester pants (both of which I already own…don’t judge). It’s even worse when you travel to a sacred space. Whether it’s the Wailing Wall in Jerusalem, the Sistine Chapel in Rome, or any number of places adored and glorified by others, it’s disrespectful to use a sacred space to boost your social status and spiritual credibility. The place may mean nothing to you, but it means life and death, and whatever comes after, to the people who worship there. And you’re not fooling anyone. Put simply, don’t steal enjoyment from others. Don’t barge in front of an elderly man who has waited his entire life to return to Normandy just so you can get a pic of your 5-year old pretending he’s storming the beaches, with the hashtag #neverforget. Take pics, share them even, but be present in the moment, not glued to your phone making sure you get just the right amount of “Likes.” And when you come home, don’t rub your adventures in other people’s faces. But really, all the tangible things come down to mindset. With the cost of airfare going down, and this generation’s noble desire to buy experiences, not things, international travel is more common than ever. But “buying experiences, not things” only benefits you personally and spiritually if it’s done for the right reasons. If I travel to distant lands simply to appear more cultured and interesting, I’m no better than the dude who neglects his faith and family to satisfy his obsession with sports cars. Both of us are being possessed by our possessions, whether that possession is experiential or material. You wouldn’t show off for others or worse, get a tinge of jealousy when you find out they’re going to a place you’ve already visited, as if experiencing a culture, country or continent belongs to you and you alone. So go West, young man. Or East, North or South. But keep yourself rooted in the moment. Take plenty of pictures, but be present. Respect the places and people around you. Genuinely experience the cultures with an open mind and heart, don’t pretend like other people’s lives are a play for you act in. And when you return, be mindful of the privilege of travel, one many people don’t get to experience. Don’t rub it in your friends’ faces, but instead help them find ways to visit the places they want to go. This will not only make you a more interesting person, but a more kind and compassionate one too."

here’s so much to do and see in this city bursting full of culture. Known for its superlative art, talented entertainers, and ever-growing nightlife scene, Johannesburg has become a go-to destination for people looking to experience a piece of African life on the continent. If you have ever heard of the Zulu tribe, if you remember the dance (called “gwara gwara”) that Rihanna performed during her Grammy’s performance, or if you’ve listened to the late, great jazz trumpeter Hugh Masekela, then you may know more about Johannesburg than you thought. When it comes to eating, the city has a cornucopia of flavors and food fixtures that highlight the diversity of traditional South African cuisine. The city’s cuisine is influenced by a variety of tribes, including Zulu, Xhosa, Sotho, Tswana, and others — but there are also influences from Indian, Dutch, French, and Malaysian cuisine, due to the country’s history with settlement and colonization. You can find anything from samp (dehulled kernels of maize) and pap (porridge/polenta made from coarsely ground maize), to bunny chow (a hollowed-out loaf of white bread filled with curry) and samoosas. Traditionally, South African food culture centers on meats prepared in various ways, including grilling and barbecuing (known as braai or shisa nyama); seasoned sausages known as boerewors; and dried and cured meat similar to beef jerky known as biltong. But more recently there has been a blossoming demand for more vegan options in restaurants, and even entire establishments that offer meat- and dairy-free menus. The call has been answered. You’ll just need the time and resources to get around town. If you’re not renting a car, the easiest and most convenient way to get around Jozi is with Uber. Unless you are visiting with someone local who is familiar with the specific hand gestures necessary to catch one of the taxi buses, you shouldn’t plan on getting around that way, and using the Gauteng train without additional wheels can be difficult. There are lots of cool things to do in the city that are spread around in different areas, and it’s worth the travel to and fro. In an Uber, you’ll be able to sit back and see the different suburbs, check out the homes and architecture (thatch roofing is incredibly popular), and buy anything from fruits and veggies to sunglasses or soda from vendors on the road as you wait at the robots (traffic lights). These are just a few suggestions to get you started while you enjoy your holiday. Johannesburg is full of suburbs that each have their own unique flavor, and weekends in Joburg are always jam-packed with event options. Everywhere you go will be full of life — you’ll be able to eat, drink, and be merry here in Jozi without giving it too much thought. Jackson’s Real Food Market Eatery is all about organic, local food and produce grown by small farms, and they offer breakfast all day long, which is helpful if you’re getting a late start. You can choose any of their vegan options such as scrambled tofu, organic acai bowls, or a vegan toastie with smashed avo. Or keep it light with a nourishing smoothie or a health shot. Between meals you can stop by Nelson Mandela Square to shop at the boutiques, see the larger-than-life bronze statue of Nelson Mandela, get lost perusing the 92,000 books in the Sandton Library, or catch a show at the Theatre in the Square. For a quick and easy lunch, the quaint cafe located inside of Fruits and Roots Organic Health Store is a good choice, especially if you are undecided about what you want to eat or if you are with a group of people with varying tastes. In addition to a vegan and vegetarian buffet, the restaurant has a menu full of sandwiches, salads, wraps, soups, juices, and smoothies. Later, you can grab a bite at Qunu, the posh restaurant inside the Saxon Hotel. The restaurant is named after Mandela’s rural village, and they pride themselves on paying homage to authentic South African food. You can try their mushroom and hemp entree with rooibos gel (made from the leaves of the indigenous South African plant of the same name); the eggless baobab mayo with veggies; or the pear, banana, and sorghum dish. They offer a vegetarian- and vegan-friendly menu as well as an omnivorous menu if you are in shared company. After a night out on the town, breakfast needs to be something hearty and filling like the food from The Fussy Vegan. They have a breakfast burrito with tofu and seitan bacon, toasties, subs, and burgers — perfect for a late breakfast. They also offer bowls of mac and cheese, and a creamy lasagna made with shiitake mushrooms and lentils layered with corn pasta and cashew cream. Free Food is a tiny, menu-written-on-a-chalkboard kind of spot that’s tucked away in a shopping center just a few minutes from Melrose Arch, a cosmopolitan shopping and entertainment complex. The cute cafe is a casual space where you can grab your food and go or chill at the family-style communal table and chat with others enjoying their meals. All of the food here is vegan and gluten-free, so people with additional dietary needs can rest easy during lunchtime. The mains are mostly Asian-inspired dishes like curries and Thai stir fry but there are also soups, salads, pizzas, and wraps if you’re in the mood for something simple. After lunch, you can head over to Rosebank. It’s a vibrant business, arts, and entertainment hub with a posh yet approachable vibe. This is where you’ll see high-end boutiques and laid-back weekend markets, chic rooftop venues and casual cafes, world-class art galleries and popping nightclubs. If you’re in the mood to soak up some art, you can check out the Rosebank Art Gallery row, including Circa Gallery and Everard Read Gallery, Africa’s oldest commercial art gallery. If you’re more in the mood to shop, you can drop by Rosebank Mall where you can find African crafts and local designers’ wares, or hop on a tour bus that will take you around the city. While you’re in Rosebank, you can stop by Lexi’s Healthy Eatery — which is not only vegan, but also gluten and refined-sugar-free. It’s a bright, welcoming place right in the middle of the hustle and bustle of the mall with a gorgeous mural on the wall, plush seating, and a simple but sumptuous dinner menu. Choose from things like cauli-steak, coconut crusted tofu, black rice porcini risotto, and burgers like their sweet potato and chickpea patty with activated charcoal, or the green burger made with peas, spinach, and hemp hearts. Fresh Earth Cafe is good for standard, straightforward brunch-type fare from smoothies, salads, and sarmies (South African slang for sandwiches), to wraps and hummus bowls. They also have a daily buffet and fresh kombucha brewed in-house on tap. For lunch, you can head to Greenside to get a taste of South Africa’s infamous bunny chow, vegan-style, at Conscious 108, nestled in the middle of a tree-lined neighborhood with shops and cafes. The small restaurant has a rustic feel, with wooden tables and decor paired with hanging light fixtures, but boasts a modern menu including options like buddha bowls, bakes, and all types of burgers from soy patties to beans to beetroot. If you happen to be in this area on the last Sunday of the month, you can stop by the Vegan Hippie Connection Market for more vegan-friendly goods. You’re also not far from the Emmarentia Dam and the Johannesburg Botanical Gardens, with seven distinct gardens including the Arboretum, which is composed exclusively of trees. Afterwards, you can stop by Greenside Cafe where you can happily enjoy anything from their 100% vegan menu. It’s a moderate-sized, minimalist situation with indoor and streetside patio seating, simple white tables and chairs, and a bright green backdrop courtesy of its namesake. In addition to vegan and veggie fare, they also have some live food options including wraps and desserts like raw maple cheesecake and ice cream made with coconut cream, cashews, and vanilla."

Medium.com,Life,Insepara,Travel,https://medium.com/@kvkwinn/insepara-116e34b1395e?source=topic_page---------508------------------1," It was just about one year ago. I made a promise to myself that I would no longer rush, or hurry, or go at anyone else’s pace. (It wasn’t my idea). I was in Delhi, crossing an impossible road, from one unmarked location to a place that appears on no map. The Western mind cannot conceive of India, as she is simultaneous — all possibilities unfolding at once, in every direction. It is the proof of particle theory and wave theory, laughing jovially at rudimentary physics that drives a scalpel between the matter of the thing and the energy of the thing. As though the two were distinct, the heart from the heartbeat. Unseverable. She grants you exactly the space you need, and no more, lest you become lonely or forget that you’re an integral part of the fabric. Our accidental tour guide, hired for his English proficiency and not his navigation skills, did his best to play the part, extolling the 33 million gods and goddesses that are part of the Hindu faith, and explaining the unexplainable over a bridge of language and mindset, as we traversed corners of his city he’d never seen. We disembarked in the in-between and walked to the road, which was a mass of traffic heading generally in one direction, followed by a mass of traffic heading generally in the other. And traffic does not describe the interwoven vehicles of mammalian feet and wheels, all predominantly precarious, tied with twine and bits, faith and otherworldly physics.

There was no crosswalk, no signal, no indication that the current might slow in this river of gods and goddesses and let us pass. “Walk confidently at your own pace — do not speed up or slow down — and they will miss you,” advised our guide, revealing himself as a Teacher, his translation slicing through the cultural divide and searing itself into my psyche. I didn’t question the torrent of double-decker busses, the carts and tuk-tuks, the bicycles and horses and camels, the errant bovids and monkeys. I simply did as he said. Walk confidently at my own pace. Between my life as I had known it, and the next step of my personal evolution. Between a ramshackle parking lot and a crumbling temple, gravity welcoming me in the right direction and protecting me from impact.

Science and faith, inextricably connected."
Medium.com,Life,‘Flygskam’: The New Swedish Word To Describe The Guilt of Air Travel,Travel,https://medium.com/@tabitha.whiting/flygskam-the-new-swedish-word-to-describe-the-guilt-of-air-travel-252b63398256?source=topic_page---------509------------------1," The word ‘flygskam’ is a recent Swedish neologism. It’s made up of two words: ‘flyg’ which means ‘flight’ and ‘skam’ which means ‘shame’. It encapsulates the feeling of guilt, or shame, which can come from knowing the environmental impact of travelling by plane. And flygskam is now becoming a global movement, with people pledging to fly less and opting to travel by train instead of plane, using #flyingless or #stayinggrounded to highlight their commitment to plane-free travel. It’s somewhat ironic that this movement originated in Sweden, a country whose people fly seven times more than the average global citizen. Indeed, whilst Sweden’s total CO2 emissions have reduced by 24% since 1990, air traffic has grown 61% in the same time. But it seems that now people are starting to catch on to the environmental impact of flying. The origin of the flying less movement is often attributed to Swedish biathlete Björn Ferry. He estimated that during his sporting career he was travelling 180 days of the year, totalling around 25,000 miles per year by plane and another 25,000 by car or minibus — and around 16 tons of CO2 emissions per year. He’s an extreme case, but after realising his impact he publicly committed to ditching air travel completely. Of course, recently we’ve also seen 16 year old climate activist Greta Thunberg choosing to travel to events and conferences by train. And most recently taking two weeks to travel from England to the UN Climate Action summit in New York, by the Malizia II, a solar-powered yacht. Over the last two decades planes have become much more energy efficient. Fuel consumption has gone from 6.3 litres per person per 100 kilometres to around 3.7 litres per person per 100 kilometres. That’s a significant difference. Saying that, though, flying is still by far the most damaging form of travel. A return flight from London to New York alone produces nearly two tons of CO2 equivalent emissions. In 2014 the transportation working group for the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) published a report which estimated that the direct greenhouse gas emissions from aviation made up 10.62% of total global transportation emissions in 2010. Plus, research suggests that the emissions from air travel may be even more damaging, with the height increasing their impact. The contrails can form clouds that trap thermal radiation, and at that height, other emissions, such as nitrogen oxides, also contribute to warming. Because of this, some have estimated the total warming caused by planes to be at least double the amount caused by the emissions alone. So, yes, air travel really is that bad. In 2017 bookings for air travel in Sweden fell by 3%. In the same year, 50% more interrailling tickets were purchased than in 2016. It can often feel that as individuals our actions have little consequence. But this is proof of what can happen when individual action becomes group action. However, it can be easy to view this in isolation. Although the flying less movement is gathering momentum, we are still seeing expansions in the aviation industry. In the UK, for instance, plans for a third runway at Heathrow Airport are still underway. The airport is already the single biggest source of CO2 emissions in the entirety of the UK, and estimations suggest that the new runway would cause emissions from aviation in the UK to rise by a staggering 4.9 million tonnes by 2030. It’s also important to note that flying is still an incredibly privileged mode of transport. The vast majority of people worldwide do not travel regularly, if ever. A 2012 Gallup poll of people living in America found that in the last 12 months 48% of people had taken no flights, 27% had taken one or two flights, and 25% of people had taken three or more flights. Writer and journalist George Monbiot pointed this out in his 2006 book Heat: How We Can Stop the Planet Burning, in which he argued that to ‘address climate change’ most aeroplanes would need to be grounded. He went on to say that this was not a ‘popular message’ but that we needed to remember that: “But I urge you to remember that these privations affect only a tiny proportion of the world’s people. The reason they seem so harsh is that this tiny proportion almost certainly includes you.” — George Monbiot For most people, flying simply isn’t an option. It’s worth remembering that next time you complain that travelling by train would take a little longer, or cost a little more. As I noted previously, the word ‘flygskam’ translates literally as ‘flight shame’. It’s a movement built out of individuals feeling guilt for their own personal contributions to the climate crisis. I’ve written before about why we need to stop shaming one another when it comes to sustainability. But, in this case, is shame and guilt a positive emotion for promoting action against the climate crisis? Personally, I don’t think guilt or shame is ever a positive emotion. Even if it’s initially motivating, it can quickly become a debilitating emotion, leaving us focused on despair rather than continuing to push for environmental change. It’s clear, though, that flygskam is starting to make a difference. And although choosing not to fly is an individual decision, it’s also becoming a group movement. It’s hard to be too critical of that. However, I do think that we need to keep the focus on the aviation industry as a whole, rather than on shaming individual passengers. In the UK, for instance, the aviation industry is effectively subsidised by the government. It does not pay fuel duty or VAT on the fuel for its planes, with estimates suggesting that this represents a saving of around £10 billion per year. No wonder there is such an abundance of budget flights — making trains seem an incredibly expensive option. Of course, reducing customer demand is one way of boycotting the aviation industry. If we pledge to fly less, and choose to give our money to train companies instead, then there will be less demand for flights and so the number of flights will have to be reduced. The flygskam movement is successfully doing this — and so it’s hard to be too critical about it. But let’s keep the focus on reducing plane travel as a whole, rather than feeling guilt on a personal level."
Medium.com,Life,How to: Decide between a Singapore Tourist Pass and Ez-link Card,Travel,https://medium.com/metroresidences-expat-life/how-to-decide-between-a-singapore-tourist-pass-and-ez-link-card-dc2c026e0cbd?source=topic_page---------510------------------1," The Singapore public transport system is pretty decent if I do say so myself. What makes it easier is accessing a bus, MRT or LRT with the use of a handy card. The two main heavy-hitters in this category are the Singapore Tourist Pass (STP) and the EZ-link Card. So here you are fresh of the aviation-boat at Changi Airport. Which card do you get to start your Singaporean journey? Don’t fret, let’s break it down for you. Singapore Tourist Pass
Essentially these two cards are travel cards owned by EZ-link Pte Ltd. The Singapore Tourist Pass (STP) is a contactless pass that offers tourist and travellers unlimited travel all-day. With it, one will be able to hop on any of Singapore’s main transport services including; Singapore buses, the Mass Rapid Transit (MRT) and the Light Rail Transit (LRT). However, you won’t be able to use the STP on bus services such as the Fast Forward, NightRider, Express Service, Night Owl etc. EZ-link Card
Every Singaporeans staple wallet-mate; the Ez-link card is a smart contactless transportation card. Similar to the STP, with this card, you will be able to ride the buses, MRT and LRT (and all related bus services that you can’t with the STP). Unlike its one-trick pony predecessor, this smart card can also be used to pay taxi fares and even selected shopping and dining options. Check out Co-living in Singapore; fully furnished, flexible lease and hassle-free options! Image credit Pros
Let's start off with the good. When you get an EZ-Link card, you won't just be able to use it for transportation. As I mentioned earlier, this card can be used to pay a lot of other services. In place of a cash card, the EZ-link card can be used on In-Vehicle Units to pay ERP tolls along the road. Certain vending machines in Singapore have included accepting EZ-Link card payments too. Fast food restaurants such as McDonald’s have also accepted EZ-link payments. The card comes in many different designs and colours, sometimes serving as a collector's item because of this novelty. Cons
The EZ-link card is a prepaid card. This means that you have to add value to the card whenever credit runs low. However, it’s pretty easy to do. Just lookout for the general ticketing machines at any MRT station and any bus interchange to add value to your card. Another less than desirable feature of this is that the cards cost $5 and this is not refundable. So if you’re considering getting some of what you paid for back after you’re done with your trip, you might not want to go for the EZ-link card. Image credit Pros
Unlimited rides and a few options of day-passes; that’s the main selling point. The Singapore Tourist Pass is catered towards travellers coming over for a quick holiday. So you can ride any number of rides on buses, MRT and LRT. The 3-day pass option also comes with a bundle package which includes exclusive perks and discounts offered by Changi Recommends. STP’s $10 deposit is fully refundable after your days are up. So you won’t have to worry when your trip is over. Cons
The main con is that deposit. Even though it will be fully refunded, having to cough out that additional $10 as deposit means that losing said card translates losing $10 on top of it. Due to the fact that there is a limited number of options to choose from, a purchase of this card will only see you get to use it for only a certain number of days. Anything over 4 days would mean STP would need to be purchased. Looking to visit Singapore? We’ve got some serviced apartment options overlooking the Singapore river, just for you! A recommendation here would depend on the type of traveller you are. If you’re here on a very short trip involving days less than a week then I would suggest getting the STP. While the unlimited rides are a huge deciding factor, the flexibility of this card works best for tourists or those on a short trip. The pass comes in a few bundles — they are split into three options; 1 Day Pass, 2 Day Pass and 3 Day Pass. Type of PassPriceDurationNo. of RidesDepositSingapore Tourist Pass$10/$16/$201–3 DaysUnlimited$10SG Tourist Pass$253 DaysUnlimited$0Singapore Tourist Pass Plus$383 DaysUnlimited$0 Now, if you are heading over to Singapore for an extended period of time, then definitely get an EZ-Link card. You can top it up whenever you need and you could even use it to make easier payments other shopping and food outlets. Image credit EZ-links can be purchased at any Transitlink Ticket Office found in MRT stations and bus interchanges. You could also approach the Passenger Service Centres at the same stations and interchanges or 7-Eleven stores. The Singapore Tourism Pass can be purchased at any Transitlink Ticket Offices as well or the many Singapore Tourist Pass Kiosks.

Medium.com,Life,A Leap Into The Unknown,Travel,https://psiloveyou.xyz/a-leap-into-the-unknown-b76d3420d075?source=topic_page---------512------------------1," It was January, 2017. After spending the majority of the previous year chasing the sun in Latin America, my body was happy to give it a break and watch the cold rain fall heavy from inside a cozy house in North London. My mind, however, had already crossed the ocean back. There I was, in a relationship of 3 years that barely felt like it could survive another month, and a job offer to start a life anew in Mexico. I took it. I got to Guadalajara with two suitcases filled with clothes I never got a chance to wear, because despite Google’s assurance that the temperatures could easily get down to 2° Celsius during the night, I never needed more than a light cardigan to go outside. Stupid Google. Stupid weather. Stupid Mexico! With a heart overflowing with resentment and pain, I turned Mexico into the scapegoat of all my problems. I was unhappy, I felt empty and worst of all, I missed myself dearly. How it happened, I’m still not quite sure, but during those years in my broken relationship I had stopped doing so many of the things I enjoyed. Where were my science books and fantasy novels? Why were my old hiking shoes still looking brand new? Why living in new places had lost its appeal to me? It had to change! Or at least, that is how cool I wish I had been, but in reality, change came slowly. I stopped sleeping in my Uber trips and started cycling the flat streets of Guadalajara. Venturing into its colorful pueblos I came across all sorts of dubious looking yet delicious street food. How else would I ever know Jamaica is also the name of an edible flower that makes for delicious vegetarian quesadillas? I made my way to the West and fell in love with the Pacific Ocean — walking into Sayulita’s clear waters, surrounded by flickering speckles of golden sand, I couldn’t ask for more. Yet, I was gifted more, and bathed in the brightest orange skies a sunset can paint. It was September, 2018. I remember laying down in the shades of a palm tree, listening to the calm sea waves breaking on the shore, re-reading an old book and realizing that, after so long, I was finally feeling happy and whole again. Had my story finished there, we could all shed a tear over my happy ending, but Mexico was not done with me yet. The plot twist came in the form of a new love. I’ve had a hard day at work, I threw up all my lunch, it was late, I was hungry, too tired to cycle and Ubers were on a strike. My seemingly best option was to ask for a ride to this colleague with whom most conversations so far had ended in bickering and diplomatic offensive remarks about each other. Again, I took it. On the valid argument that it’d be the quickest way to have food, he convinced me to join him for some snacks and drinks… I guess it was a dry evening — it’s always dry in Guadalajara — filled with traffic noise and some reggeaton tunes playing around. I can’t tell for sure, though — my attention, for hours, got swept by the puzzling person in front of me. Inadvertently, that was the beginning of my intensive lesson on what falling in love really feels like, what it entails and the blissful moments it can create. Fast forward 5 months and here I am staring into the Pacific Ocean again. Our work contract has ended. He’s going back to the US. I’ll head to South Asia. It’s our farewell trip. When I first put a backpack on my shoulders to go see the world, I lost myself into a relationship that took with it the beauty of the places I visited and stained my experiences to the point I didn’t feel comfortable sharing them with anybody. Mexico became my hideout, one that I hated at first, but that with its kindness, authenticity and surprises paved a sanctuary of peace into my mind. Once again, I’m leaving with an aching heart. This time, however, I’m proud of my feelings."
Medium.com,Life,Chicago,Travel,https://medium.com/@secretcoran/chicago-550f1ac66e74?source=topic_page---------513------------------1," Of
all the bucket list large cities in America, Chicago is my favorite. The Windy City sits on the beautiful beaches of Lake Michigan, just south of the Wisconsin/Illinois state line. It boasts beer, music, art, architecture, and an unbelievable array of world class cuisine. Chicago has the New York vibe for less money without the trash, scaffolding, and traffic. Making it the perfect place for a quick big city getaway. Chicago has a unique architectural feel. It was founded a little over 200 years after New York in 1833. So the city is relatively young compared to many other major US population centers. That means the design elements of the buildings that make up the downtown Chicago area are much different than the older buildings in other cities. Chicago is sometimes called a “concrete jungle”, and that’s precisely how many of it’s towers were erected. With concrete structures. The elevated train, the Gothic stone tracings, and heavy white walls lining the city streets give Chicago a distinct Gotham feel. (Many of the Batman movies were filmed on location in Chicago.) One of the most pleasurable things to do in the Windy City is to enjoy the uniquely beautiful views. Chicago features 4 of America’s top 10 tallest buildings; (Willis Tower, Trump International Hotel, the Hancock Building, and the Aon Center) so you can be sure there is no shortage of beautiful viewing areas. Check into your hotel, then start your first evening in Chicago with a toast, watching the sunset from the 16th floor of the Trump International Hotel overlooking the Chicago River-walk. There isn’t a bad seat in the house, the Terrace 16 restaurant has an outdoor lounge area with plush couches, fireplaces, and a clear railing, allowing unobstructed views on three sides of the building. (Don’t forget a sweater, it does indeed get very windy.) After you’ve properly toasted to your trip, have a walk around the Riverfront area to Giordano’s Pizza in downtown. A Chicago style pizza is something you can’t skip, and Giordano’s is a hands down favorite for locals and tourists alike. Once you’ve had your fill of pizza. (A small can feed four adults.) Try a night cap at a Chicago speakeasy bar. (Chicago has many hidden bars, some of which were in operation during prohibition.) The Watershed is located in a tiny basement in downtown with a small, unique, yet opulent atmosphere, and fantastic service. When dinner, drinks, and desserts have been had; it’s time to call it an evening and get rested up for your second day of adventures in the Windy City. Chicago features some of the most amazing art you’ll see, paintings, theatre, sculptures, and architecture; this city has it all. Start your second day with brunch in downtown at The Gage, an upscale bistro that serves one the best cheeseburger you’ll ever taste. After brunch, cross the street to Millennium Park. There’s always plenty to see and do in this public square. Take pictures in front of Cloud Gate, (Also popularly referred to as “The Bean”.) admire the sculptures and fountains, eat a Chicago style hot dog, the park features flower gardens, music, and a host of events. Once you’ve seen it all, head inside The Chicago Art Institute for a live look at dozens of world famous paintings. At $25 per ticket, The Art Institute may not be the cheapest stop on your trip, but it’s still worth every penny. A large collection of Degas, O’Keefe, Da Vinci, van Gogh, Monet, Sauret, and others adorn the walls in the maze of museum. Lose yourself in the history and beauty. (But also get a map at the information desk, because you really can get lost.) Once you’ve had your fill, head back to your hotel to rest, refresh, and spruce up for an evening of fine dining and theatre. Get fancied up for dinner at Joe’s Seafood: Prime Steak and Stone Crab. The food is something you can’t experience anywhere else. The tuxedo clad service impeccable. (You’ll want to make reservations well in advance.) Finish your evening with a show you unlike any other. Chicago has a theatre scene that rivals New York’s Broadway. Get tickets in advance if you like for any shows on the calendar, or try Lucky Seat the day before and gain entry for half the price (or less). “Beach” may not be what first comes to mind when you think, “Chicago”. But don’t sell your trip short. Chicago has beautiful beachfront areas on Lake Michigan. Start your day on Montrose Beach. Play in the sand, soak up the sun rays, rent a paddle board and enjoy your morning on the water, with the Windy City skyline as your backdrop. After you’ve worked up a proper appetite, grab lunch at The Dock, a beach front outdoor dive bar that sits in between the city, the beach, and Montrose Harbor. When lunch is finished, call an Uber to deliver you to Navy Pier. Take an architectural cruise, have a ride of the iconic Ferris wheel, shop the local vendors, and be sure to have a cocktail at Offshore Rooftop Bar, with see through banisters, couches, fireplaces, and outdoor family style games, it’s the perfect place to relax and recount the amazing experiences you’ve had over the past three days. Stay long enough to appreciate the sunset, but before leaving for your flight home, make in one last stop, visiting the Hancock Building’s Signature Lounge for coffee, cheesecake and a breathtaking view of the cityscape from above at night. Before you depart for O’Hare, be sure to visit the restroom. The women’s lavatory has an entirely glass back wall, boasting one of the best views in the building. Watch the planes in formation, waiting their turn to land at O’Hare, the Ferris Wheel on the pier turning, and Willis Tower blowing slightly in the wind. The Hancock building is the perfect cap to a delightful getaway in one of America’s brightest big cities. Have a location you’d like us to travel to?

Medium.com,Life,How Argentina’s SinFiltro Uses 90s Cartoons to Reimagine His City,Travel,https://medium.com/@agchazaro/how-argentinas-sinfiltro-uses-90s-cartoons-to-reimagine-his-city-a25d1643b4f6?source=topic_page---------514------------------1," An interview with the millennial artist who spraypaints popular characters from childhood around his hometown and brings attention to the underground street art scene in Argentina’s wine country. Imagine Napa Valley’s wine capital, except more affordable, Spanish-speaking, and in South America. That’s Mendoza, Argentina. Known for cleanliness and tranquility— a far-cry from the bustling streets of Buenos Aires — it typically attracts wealthier, refined crowds from various parts of the world who spend a few days sipping Malbecs before moving on to bigger destinations in the region. Like many, my wife and I were visiting as part of a longer trip, with plans to organize a series of wine tours and do nothing else there because, well, that’s apparently what you do. Everything we researched pointed towards the beautiful valleys beneath the Andes, filled with quaint wine bodegas and fine cuisine, reachable with an easy 20- to 60-minute cruise outside the province’s urban hub. We began by exploring downtown in search of the visitor’s center for information about tour options. But less than two blocks from our Airbnb, across a busy avenue, we spotted an unexpected sight adorning the side of a newsstand. It was simple yet bold: a colorful, life-sized rendition of Reggie Rocket from Rocket Power, sipping a purple beverage. It was as if the artist had taken a nostalgic memory of the universally-watched cartoon from our American childhood and reinvented her to fit a contemporary Argentinian context of cool. Captivated, we crossed the street, took some photos, then continued with our conventional tourism. Three blocks later we were again sidetracked — this time with a depiction of Gerald from Hey Arnold, detailed exactly from the famous cartoon as if the original creators had been there to paint him, except he was noticeably counting a stack of U.S. dollars. At that point, we decided to ditch our plans and became obsessed with knowing more about these cartoons. We wandered the side streets that day, coming across at least 5 of our Nickelodeon and Cartoon Network favorites, usually with some inventive twist. We’d see Arnold with his big football head, painted like he was inside an Instagram post with a ridiculous number of likes. A few steps later we’d see Reptar, holding a bouquet of flowers in his hands as if he had just exited the nearby shop and was in a rush to meet someone, perhaps at the park around the corner. The artist had mixed Latin America’s setting with U.S. popular culture to bring his art to life; it all felt as if the characters were our new neighbors. We noticed a tag on each piece — SinFiltro (“NoFilter”) — and descended into the barely-known world of Mendoza’s vibrant street art. ***** Birra House is a hangout on the main Arístides Villanueva strip where younger locals gather to escape the sleepiness of a mostly suburban, if not rural, surrounding. Music blasts from inside while sidewalk patios fill up with alternative and creative Mendocino students from the nearby university. Because SinFiltro includes his Instagram handle with each painting, it was easy to pinpoint him, and after sending a message that explained our interest, he told us to meet there. Before we knew it, we were drinking beers (turns out they drink more than wine), eating Argentinian-style pizzas, and learning about the history of the region’s street art from him and a squad of his childhood friends and family — some artists, some just there to hang out. According to him and his crew — a collective of five graffiti artists known as the Asfalticos (“Asphalt Boys”), and who had been commissioned to paint the interior of the popular venue we were at — Mendoza’s street art scene had exploded a few years prior and was on the rise. It all began underground, literally: “Mendoza is perfect for graffiti because we have lots of ditches where we can paint for hours, uninterrupted by police,” SinFiltro proudly told me in Spanish. “That’s how I started, in 2011.” Surely, I’d noticed the city had an abundance of small concrete ditches, known as “zanjas.” Think of the L.A. River, but much tinier, and running along major avenues and sidewalks. According to members of the Asfalticos, these ditches are not common in Argentina’s cities and provided a unique opportunity to refine their passion to paint outdoors and network with other artists. “A few years ago, we just started organizing barbeque hangouts for the neighborhoods. We would invite a few people but hundreds would find out and show up. We just painted for the entire day down there. Everyone was welcome — our younger siblings, grandparents, artists from other cities, just hanging out, eating food, having fun, understand?” A college-trained art student, SinFiltro honed his craft over many years in these street ditches, showing me photos on his phone of his earliest work. He had clearly changed his style over the years, but one element remained — he had a knack for obsessive themes. One year he was captivated by cartoon pigs, using this as a signature he’d tag everywhere (and which he still uses as his moniker you can find in many places). Then he became interested with Sphinx cats, throwing those up around the city, too. Eventually, in 2018, he landed on the concept of reinventing his childhood memories by painting those recognizable characters that had grabbed our attention, and which now dominated the downtown area’s most visible spaces for street art. “I started with the unimportant characters at first. You know, characters who had only appeared in one or two episodes, like the Pigeon Man [from Hey Arnold],” he explained. When I asked him why, he told me that he wanted to bring attention to those who were forgotten and overlooked — the supporting cast rather than the stars of the show. I found this to be a metaphor for him, his city, and perhaps for graffiti writers everywhere; as an unknown artist he painted tunnels in the night, while by day he worked a regular job in an area that bustled with vineyard tourism, where unknowing outsiders came to enjoy the riches of the Argentinian countryside then returned to wherever they came from, perhaps never even noticing the talent of artists like him and his crewmates during their stay. But locals, especially those in the know, seemed to love him. He had an air of stardom, with people greeting him excitedly, and his phone blowing up with texts throughout the night. It was impossible to escape the influence he had on the local scene (a few feet from where we sat, one of his tags — this time from Pink Panther — stared at us). Despite his success, he remained extremely humble and fully attentive to our conversation. As he talked, a friend from his group would occasionally interject with comments like “he has the most Instagram followers around here” (which I believed, since he has upwards of 11k followers) and “he’s bringing recognition to our city.” Still, SinFiltro struck me as having more purpose than simply painting for fame. In fact, he didn’t seem to be motivated by that. His name, for example, had nothing to do with filters that we typically associate with social media use. Instead, he clarified: “My name is SinFiltro because my art doesn’t have the filter of museums or institutions, understand? You don’t choose to visit my art, my art visits you. It’s art for maybe those who can’t afford to visit a fancy museum or don’t have time to appreciate art. My gallery is unfiltered by the streets.” He admitted he wasn’t directly making art to change anyone’s perception of the world, but he had definitely altered my perception of Mendoza in the short time I had known him and his work. As a recently arrived foreigner, I told him, seeing his cartoons made me feel a sense of comfort and connection to a place I knew nothing about, helping ease my arrival to a new country. His street art was universal, inviting, and encouraged outsiders like me to explore aspects of a city that would easily be ignored. He was happy to hear this, and generously passed me another beer. ***** Argentina, like the majority of countries around the world, is filled with a mostly monolithic population. Unlike a few neighboring countries (Peru, Ecuador, Brazil, etc.) there are very few dark-skinned Afro-Latinos in the land of the Gauchos, and diversity lacks. During our talk, I learned that Mendoza — and the whole of Argentina, like everywhere else — suffers from racism and segregation. However, his friends explained to me that this is slowly changing, that their younger siblings attend school with Indians, Chinese, and immigrants from other Latin American countries. This is an aspect of Mendoza that SinFiltro is aware of, and he paints to fill these gaps and reimagine his city, using 90s nostalgia and a desire for a more inclusive community to promote what he hopes the future may hold. “I always loved watching shows like Hey Arnold because it was so diverse. It had Asian characters, disabled characters, poor characters, black characters, and they all lived together. I used to imagine: what if my neighborhood was like that? I had this image of American cities like the Bronx and Brooklyn where it was just this cosmopolitan city living,” he said, fresh spraypaint drying on his fingernails as if he had just finished a tag before meeting us. “I kind of want to recreate this in Mendoza, so that’s why I paint all types of characters from those cartoons. It’s like they are from everywhere but now they’re here in my city, walking around like real people.” In a way, SinFiltro’s art is both a look at the past and a look at the future, while existing in the swirl of the modern day — and perhaps this is what most elevates his artform into something more than simple graffiti. He is engaged with the fabrics of his community (he emphasized that he always asks for permission before painting because it’s too expensive to get caught by the police), transforming how he wants his city to be seen with simple cartoon characters that challenge how his city currently is. He is more than a street painter, he is a visionary for a different world that combines the best elements of ourselves. He even started combining traits from unsimilar cartoons to make new hybrids (for example, he recently painted Rocko from Rocko’s Modern Life with Goku’s hairstyle from Dragon Ball-Z), furthering the potential for imagining a new sort of future based on what is familiar to us. And what’s more, he kept exclaiming that it’s not just him: “I’m not even the best here, trust me. There are guys who paint way better than I can. I’m just lucky that my style has communicated to more people. Mendoza is full of talented artists and we’re ready to become a capital of street art in this part of the world, to be considered with places like São Paolo, so that people see Mendoza as a place to visit for the free outdoor art.” Indeed, the artists in Mendoza are dope are deserving of more recognition — not simply as a creative community with technical skills, but as a welcoming tribe who brought us into their circle and treated us like longtime friends. Besides SinFiltro (@resinfiltro), the Asfalticos crew consists of Rojopavez (@rojopavez), Estevanwarro (@latigo), Tano Mota (@tano_aftc), and Nash (@nashfernandez) — all of whom contributed to the way I understood Mendoza’s street art and history. Follow their artwork; and if you make it to Mendoza — which you should because it turns out the wineries are worth the hype, even for those of us visiting from Northern California — be sure to go off the vineyard paths to discover what the asphalt also has to offer.

And I was sorry that I had never felt this particular loneliness before — that I had never felt myself so far outside of someone else’s dream. Now I felt the deeper weight of my generational chains — my body confined, by history and policy, to certain zones. In his memoir Between the World and Me, Ta-Nehisi Coates writes the excerpt above on his time in Paris, in feeling foreign in a world that wasn’t his, outside of the American narrative he fit into. My first two weeks in Vietnam, I felt alone, disconnected and on the brink of some sort of collapse. I realize now that culture shock is real and that the mind — at least my mind — is desperate for familiarity. When I probe further into this, I realize that my need to belong — to disappear into the crowd — comes from my childhood experience of being different. Everywhere I went in Chattanooga, Tennessee I was different. In elementary school, I remember only two other children of color in school with me, both black. In high school, there were maybe six of us total, in a class of 100. While my eating disorder and alcoholism were born of many things, one principal struggle these afflictions relieved me of was my desire to fit in, to carve out a place for myself in this all-white world. My eyes have always been too small, my hair too black, my skin too yellow. And while I couldn’t change my race, I could modify my body size with and without food and alter my personality with substances. Through these mediums, I became an artist experimenting with my tools, going deeper and deeper into changing myself. Ultimately, it worked, in a way. I became the party girl, the skinny girl, the anti-authoritarian girl. I proudly wore the badge of the token asian and made fun of other Asian people to beat my friends to the punch. I assimilated in the way that many POC do, without question, without hesitation, in an unwavering quest to fit in."

Considered unclean by the conservative Islamic government, nary a canine may be found in this cluster of a thousand or more islands on the Indian Ocean a few inches to the left of Sri Lanka on the map. Having read this on the plane before my first visit, I was a wee bit startled to be greeted at the airport door by a snarling, sniffing German Shepherd leashed to a similarly snarling and well-armed customs cop. At this point, travelers carrying any substances stronger than breath mints might have cause for alarm, for the Maldives holds drugs and alcohol in esteem somewhat equal to Man’s Best Friend. The selection at the new duty-free liquor store at my point of departure was excellent, however, so I had issues. Fortunately, a diplomatic passport softening in my sweaty palm mitigated the obligatory baggage X-ray, and certain public embarrassment.

Fortunately for we who fancy a drop, such smuggling is not strictly necessary once the sanctuary of a resort is reached. Only problem is you have to get to there first. Even if I could have afforded one of those cool pontoon planes, first I had to get across the bay from the tiny airport island to the not-quite-so-tiny capital island and a hotel room. Only problems were that a) it was two in the morning and b) it was raining in sheets. No choice, then, than to board a dhoni, the local vessel of choice, for a ride of a mile across a choppy channel to a bed that would afford us a few hours sleep till the 9 o’clock boat to our holiday paradise. The dhoni is an interesting boat. Its deep keel is decorated with a high curving bowsprit with a matching design to stern, giving it the distinct look of a Viking ship about 40 feet long, with benches lining each gunwale. If Leif Erickson could make it to America, I thought, this should get us across the harbor, inclement weather notwithstanding. Piloting the vessel, the crew smoked and chatted as the skipper effortlessly navigated with the huge tiller with his knee. His complete ease and confidence made me, who grew up around boats constantly, realize that save for eating, sleeping, and making little Maldivians, these people live on the water. In a country consisting exclusively of tiny atolls, these islanders are at once freed and imprisoned by the sea. Taxi drivers the world over tend to talk their fares’ ears off about politics and current events, but on my ride to the hotel, our cabbie’s complete silence supplied a poignant overview of the local political situation. Despite the late hour, he went to extreme lengths to avoid any figure of authority, which became almost comic considering the ubiquitous roadblocks. Rather than approach one, the driver made quick turn into small alleys, shooting frequent furtive glances behind. Passing a vehicle with “Maldives Civil Order Patrol” stenciled on the side nearly induced the poor bugger into apoplexy, prompting such extensive detouring that the prospect of actually arriving at the hotel seemed dim at best. Grey spitting skies greeted us next morning we boarded a larger dhoni, this time fiberglass, with a similar bench setup on the cabin. After ninety soggy minutes we arrived at our circular paradise. As I penciled my wife and I in as Fully Independent Travelers), or, somewhat appropriately, FITs. We FITs were set apart from the various tour groups who make up nearly all of the resort’s clientele. Disapproving stares abounded. The obligatory too-sweet welcoming drink accompanied by some inquisition about just what we thought we were doing there outside of a tour group. Finally we were led us to a waterfront bungalow, on a sandy lagoon rather than the sea proper, but nonetheless idyllic enough. I’ve never been gushy for beautiful beaches, this one really was breathtaking. The water is ice-blue and so transparent that even from the dock, hundreds of fish are clearly visible; all their colors, stripes, and patterns. The soft, creamy sand rose to give way to a verdant canopy of coconut palms. Giant bats glided majestically about as thousands of songbirds in the trees chirped a cacophonous symphony. All this beauty gives one an appetite. At lunch, the hotel management was quick set about quashing any feeling of FIT empowerment we may have been entertaining. “Where shall we sit?” we asked the host somewhat naively as we entered the barn-like dining room. “How about over th . . .” “Nationality?” he interrupted. “What does that have to do with where we sit?” Ignoring the question, he turned his back and started walking. It was follow or go hungry. “Okay . . . American,” I said trotting briskly after him. “. . . but what’s that’s got to do with anything . . .” but it was too late. Catching up, we passed one group chattering in Japanese, another in German, and finally to some east Londoners gabbing in a thick brogue. We looked at each other in mutual comprehension. Anglophone section. Indeed, guests were feasting happily all around us, unfazed at being herded into such linguistic pens. Intermittent clear weather allowed for daily complementary dhoni-rides to the house reef to snorkel. Compared to the small reefs we had previously combed, these formations teemed with life and dazzling blues. One can’t help reflecting: why are tropical fish so damn colorful? Blue with yellow stripes; red with black tails and fins; pink with polka dots; it goes on and on. It’s a deeply religious question, if you think about it. According to a Swedish folk tale, God was bone tired by the sixth day of Creation. He called in a group of overeager angels and delegated a bit of authority: “I’m having a nap. You do the fish.” On the reef, huge schools of a single species would suddenly surround you. Others ate off the reef with a distinctly audible crunch. I pondered how fish can taste so good on a diet consisting strictly of reef algae. Carnivores like barracuda eat smaller fish, but what do the smaller fish eat? In the end, every food chain stops at scum. Or so it seems. I particularly enjoyed the edge of the reef, where the depth dropped perhaps 20 or 30 meters. The water darkened, and felt a lot like the middle of the ocean. I looked out for something large and predatory, and was rewarded with two manta rays about six feet in diameter, their big concave mouths open as they trolled for an afternoon snack. The majesty of their glide was awe inspiring; that one passed me then looped around and came back at me slightly unnerving. While they were too funny looking to be truly threatening, that spiked tail seemed awfully large. Time to get back in the boat. As I sat dripping in the dhoni, I noticed the other snorkelers were divided into two groups. On one side were tattooed Germans, and on the other diminutive Japanese. Axis alliance redux. After drying off and stowing my gear, I noticed them all looking out and gesturing at a lime-green snorkel far off on the reef. It dawned on me everybody was long ready to head back in, and that there was only one snorkeler still in the water. “I think that’s my wife out there,” I said sheepishly. But it was no surprise to me. The woman could out-snorkel Jacques Cousteau, (not that old Jacques would ever mingle with this lot). I figured I had to do something. “Yo, honey! . . . Time to go!” I yelled. But Madame Cousteau would not be rushed. “Did you see those beautiful, bottle-nosed razor-finned parrot fish?” she beamed as a puddle formed around her on the deck. All that time and expense buying poring over tropical fish books would not be for naught. “I saw lots of, uh, red ones and some blue ones.” At dinner, we were led back to our usual table. “You mean we have to sit here again?” I asked incredulously. “House rules,” he replied. Always the rebel, I changed places, moving the setting to the left. After dinner, I observed our waiter a few tables down flirting in fluent German, a tad inappropriately, with a young fraulein, I wondered about his language skills. English, German, Italian, Japanese, and a little Spanish,” he ticked off. “No French?” I said. Not missing a beat, he parried with “Comment allez-vous messieur-dames?” Pas mal, I thought. That little riff wasn’t even worthy of his list. Later, it poured rain again. Surrounded by the tourists who had flown a dozen hours to get here, we marveled at what a gamble it is, notwithstanding cheap package tours, to vacation in Maldives. No sun, no fun. And during this time of year, a considerable amount of rain falls on the islands. Small wonder then, that the bar was full at 10 on the drizzly morning we arrived. Speaking of the bar, the bill for the holiday was all-inclusive. All-you-can eat is one thing, but all-you-can-drink is a different proposition altogether. From a small but decent quality selection, the sky was the limit. Save for the condition of your head the next day, and your moral fortitude, there are no restrictions. As a responsible drinker, I had no such problem. A waiter did, however, come up to the bar once as I was waiting there for a round, and ask for two doubles. “Doubles?” I said. “You can do that? Bartender, I want to change my order!” Eventually, we got some quality beach time on the lagoon in front of our bungalow. Kicking around the lagoon on air mattresses, we had to keep changing position to keep our books dry. Glancing over to the next bungalow, a fellow guest I recognized by her large cobra snake tattoo all the way around her arm was lying on her stomach in what appeared to be an extreme state of undress. My wife paddled over and whispered “Did you notice that woman on the beach over is completely naked?” Like any married man, I naturally responded: “Of course not.” In any case, a small crowd began to gather on the dock, observing her as if she was a razor-backed parrot fish. But before they could break out their Nikons, she scurried away and returned in scant swimwear. We discussed none of this as we sat across the very woman on our next snorkeling expedition, this time in a much smaller boat that put our little multicultural group into much closer quarters. Basically, everyone was German but us, and that fact didn’t even occur to the rest of them (you would think our lack of tattoos would have given us away!). After I’d followed a gigantic something-or-other fish around for a while and adjusted my mask enough times I got back on the boat, and a young woman who’d finished first said absently something containing the words; “Gut, nein?” I was shocked at being mistaken for a German by another German from two feet away. She flushed when I told her I couldn’t get beyond counting to ten and ordering a beer in Deutsch, and apologized in heavily accented English. As the afternoon sun danced over the lapping water, I looked again at this girl, I thought of all our cultural differences and all the wars our countries have fought and such. Wherever I’ve lived, people all seem to be, say, 95 percent alike, yet that five percent renders the our planet perpetually susceptible to periodic cataclysm. Strange world we live in, and beautiful too. You don’t need to visit the Maldives to know that, but it helps."

have always been fascinated by Japan. I suppose that statement almost has to be true for most people, especially Westerners for whom any form of “Eastern” culture is considered exotic and mysterious. But just the other day, I was reflecting on the fact that my generation (I’m reaching the ceiling of what is considered a “millennial” — that is, anyone born between 1981 and 1996) is probably the first to have genuinely grown up with Japanese pop culture. Many will vividly remember the “invasion” of Japanese animation in the ’80s; for me, morning television in the late ’80s was perhaps a 70/30 split of Japanese and Western content (with the lion’s share of cartoons in Australia at the time being sourced from Japan). As well as kids’ cartoons, video games were a huge part of my childhood; Nintendo was for me what Disney was for my parents. I was born in 1983, the same year that Mario Bros. debuted, and the Nintendo Entertainment System arrived in Australia right around the time I was old enough to play video games. It’s only now — at the age of 35 — that I’ve actually been able to travel to Japan and experience it for myself. For gamers, Japan — especially specific parts of the country like Tokyo’s famous Akihabara district — are something of a Mecca. As I write this, I’m almost halfway through my trip. My intention was always to write about the weird and wonderful gaming experiences I’m hoping to have here, but in truth, I think such wonders are going largely bookend the latter half of my travels (as I will be spending just over a week in Tokyo with the intention to hang around Akihabara and other gaming-related districts as much as possible). That said, my experience so far has been pretty interesting, and I thought it worth writing about. If you’ve been to Japan, then it’s unlikely I’m going to be dropping any new pearls of wisdom. But if you haven’t been — and especially if you’re a gamer (which, by virtue of being a visitor at our fine publication, I’ll assume you are) — then you may find something of interest here."

I used the miles because I didn’t immediately jump on the Vegas bandwagon when my friends were originally buying their cheap tickets, so by the time I finally got around to getting them it was too late and I was looking at a $400 flight. I’m the first to admit that I will drop a substantial amount of cash in order to avoid telling a friend I procrastinated on plans, but even I couldn’t cave to paying double their ticket just because I’m an idiot. So instead I redeemed the miles, filled the Venmo request for our Airbnb, and excitedly texted my friends that I was in. I don’t know why I’m saying this as if I’m confessing something, but I need you to know that I went to Vegas on a whim because the thought of missing out was too much for me to handle. Las Vegas was never a place that called to me. The only time I ever thought about going to Vegas was after seeing that Morgan Freeman movie where a bunch of old dudes go to Vegas for one last hurrah… do you know what movie I’m talking about? I want to say Robert De Niro was in it too… I’ll google it, hold on. Last Vegas! Yes, my friend, Layne, and I saw Last Vegas and decided we should go someday. But since Layne was still in Texas, it had not come up and this birthday seemed like my big opportunity. Getting off the plane in Vegas, I really wonder what we were thinking when booking this trip. We left the airport, requesting a Lyft to take us to “THE STRIP” which was a phrase I had heard my parents say, but couldn’t really picture. Our Lyft driver was so alarmed by our lack of planning that she drove us to a convenience store herself telling us to buy alcohol and stay together like a pack. From there we walked to the Airbnb, only stopping for what I thought would be the first of many frozen margaritas. I was wrong. What became immediately obvious is that no one in our group would make any firm decision, including when and where to start drinking. And if you aren’t drinking continuously in Vegas, I learned, you’re going to see how dark the city really is. Here is what may happen in Vegas if you aren’t down to really day drink: These are only things that might happen though… if I were to guess. You might realize that Vegas is a dark place where you either fall slave to capitalist culture, spending money to forget that you are sheep being herded around this weird town. OR you will have a fun sober time. I really couldn’t say."

Medium.com,Life,My first Muslim Country,Travel,https://medium.com/@oscardz/my-first-muslim-country-1983b20cdadf?source=topic_page---------522------------------1," Religious disclaimer: I am not trying to offend anyone’s religious beliefs and hope that you see that the focus is on the culture. If you are upset by anything written here, well, feel free to vent your insecurities in the comment section below. For the sake of this blog post, Turkey is a Muslim country. The trip was to Istanbul for one week. Half the time it was business (fancy hotel), and the other half leisure (Airbnb in the Favelas of Istanbul). As a naive millennial, I arrived at the airport thinking that I could just order an Uber and go to my hotel. There were two pretty big problems with this: I had no internet service in Turkey and Uber is kind of illegal (taxi drivers beat and sometimes shoot uber drivers). So, I was a sitting duck for the airport taxi companies. A “friendly” guy came over to me asking if I wanted a taxi — and after my disappointment of not being able to get my Uber– I said “yes”. After asking me all the information he told me that it will be 500 Turkish liras (80 euros). Initially, I thought that it was a bit pricey, but it was already late, and I had no idea how far away it was from the airport. After he got the money, his mood flipped and he made me follow him down the street to meet the driver. The “friendly guy” left without a word, I thought a “goodbye” would be included in those 80 euros. The driver smiled and took me to an empty parking lot next to the airport, this was the first scary moment of the trip. At that moment, I forgot about the 80 euros and start being more cautious about who was around and a proper distance between the driver and me while we were walking in the parking lot. Finally, we arrived at the car, it was a bloody 10-seater van. At this point, there was not much I could do, the driver didn’t speak English, and we were far away from the bastard that got me the service. Later on, I found out that my colleague that arrived a couple of hours before me and had paid only 20 euros for their taxi (I guess because it wasn’t a bloody bus). If you ever go to Istanbul, use this app for taxis. I have been in cities with heavy traffic, but this is one takes the piss. I experienced peak rush hour, and the funny thing was that there were no car accidents, it was just normal traffic. We were always moving but very slowly. Most of the time we were moving at a walking pace (according to Google Maps it would take 4 hours if I walked). After this upset start, I became nostalgic because it reminded me of my home. Scammed and wasting hours in traffic, that is pretty much a normal day in Mexico City. The first cultural shock came when I went to the toilet in the hotel: It’s the first time that I have ever seen anything like this. I had mixed feelings of horror and curiosity. I don’t want to spoil it for you, so would just recommend you to experience it yourself, with an open mind. The first night, I reunited with my work colleagues and my Turkish colleague took us for dinner. They told us that it will be better to order a lot of food to share and we can try out different stuff. When she was talking to the waiter in Turkish I only got the word “kebab”. I was a little disappointed because, even though I love a good kebab, they are available on every corner at home. Well, I spoke too soon, the food that came out looked like this: I had the impression that kebab was a fast-food, the holy grail for drunk people after a night out. I thought that the focus of the kebab was the bread with veggies, some meat, and a lot of nondescript white sauce, but I have been shown a different way. The important thing here is the meat, the other extras can but doesn’t have to be on the plate. This reminded me of the misinterpretation of Mexican food with Tex-Mex (which most Americans and European believe to be Mexican food). Just a tip: if your burrito has rice, it is not a burrito. For the second part of my trip, I stayed with Ufuk (I was afraid to pronounce his name), from Airbnb. The location was walking distance to the center, but the zone was a little bit shabby. The streets were so narrow that the taxi couldn’t continue, so I had to walk the last few blocks. I thought I had a wrong address because the host had awesome reviews. When I arrived at the address I text Ufuk that I was there and he came out to pick me up. He took me inside and showed me the place. His flat was full of random things from all his trips. While I was unpacking he was playing some Mexican music to make me feel like home. He offered me food, drinks, maps, and offered to take me on a personal tour of the city. Ufuk didn’t speak English but this was not a limitation to be serviceable and friendly. When we were not able to communicate with signs or broken English, he always took me to his computer to translate the idea. I am a frequent user of Airbnb and I can say that Ufuk is one of the few hosts that really love people staying in their place. The bad experiences didn’t ruin the trip. The problems with traffic, scam experiences, and dirty streets is something that you can find in any big city. Turkey is on the Mediterranean and you can see their warmness of this kind of culture around the streets. You can walk through the city and people will smile at you, not like many of the other European countries that are more reserved. This can be a little tricky because when they offer to help you it will be either scammers or people that truly want to help you and even go the extra mile to solve your problem. My Turkish colleague and I visited the Galata Mevlevi Museum, which is a museum from Sufism, one of the branches of Islam. It is a very interesting side of Islam, check it out. Fooling around in the museum we met the manager of the place. The guy was very curious as to why a Mexican would want to visit there, so he was asking a lot of questions, but he didn’t speak English so my friend had to translate. We mentioned the story of the taxi scam and he felt very ashamed with the situation that happened and seemed to take it personally. He took us to his office and made some calls to report the situation and try to get my money back. We stayed there for an hour because it was the weekend and he couldn’t reach the people at the tourist office. On one hand, I appreciate his effort to try to help me out, but on the other hand, it was taking a lot of time and we wanted to continue to sightsee. He was so focused on helping us that he didn’t realise that we wanted to leave. It was only when my colleague politely interrupted him still appreciating his help and told him that we needed to go that he realized. He apologized for the inconvenience and said that he would try to make the report the next business day. This is a clear example of the warmness of the people from Turkey. When they want to help, they will put in extra effort, but sometimes it can be too much. During my leisure time, I decided to take a boat trip to the Prince’s Islands. The Prince Islands are an archipelago off the coast of Istanbul, in the Sea of Marmara. The boat takes you to the 3 main islands. The islands are very nice, but honestly, the deal-breaker that made me decide to take the boat trip was because they take you to an island that is on the Asia side. That was my first Asian experience, it lasted 3 hours, but still, it was worth it. I arrived at the harbor early. The boat had an open space with big tables where you can sit down and even order some food or drinks. I sat at one of the tables on my own and then a group of 4 girls in hijab and a middle-aged man came and sat down with me at the same table. I haven’t interacted with many Muslim people before, so I was very curious about their religion and culture. Having a group of Muslims next to me was too strong temptation to miss out on asking some questions and I am the kind of person that prefers to risk an awkward moment than to suffer in silence. I don’t remember what I said in the beginning but we started talking. They were 4 sisters in their 20s originally from Somalia and now living in Qatar and the guy was their local tour guide. Qatar and Somalia (at that time, I wouldn’t be able to point out Somalia on a map), are so exotic to me that I became more curious. We talked during the whole boat trip and they were also surprised that I was Mexican, they also saw it as something exotic. During the conversation, I felt the tour guide was pretty protective. He was respected like he was their father. The guy was talking and the girls were listening and not contradicting any argument, they were a little over-respectful. The girls were even calling him “Baba”, which could translate as “Daddy” (not in a perverted way). Most of the conversation was me asking how things are done in Muslim culture. Do women have the same rights as men? How do they, as women, feel about the different roles of men and women? They saw that my questions were genuine and curious, rather than confrontational, so the conversation was always friendly. Baba was saying that God made men and women for different roles, so that is why they have different “responsibilities” (I think he meant rights). He said that there were bad men in the world and only men knew men, so that’s why the Muslim father always overprotects their daughters and when they get married the responsibility lies on the husband. He was saying that women were precious and we should take care of them because they are innocent and naive, he said this as praise to women, but for me was more of an insult. The girls were quietly listening and complying, even though maybe the didn’t fully agree. From what I read about Muslim culture, there is not a dating step to meet your love partner. If both families approve the relationship, there is a wedding, sometimes even without the consent of the people getting married. The girls said that it is true but there are ways to meet a person. She told me that they can go out with someone that they liked, but always with a male member of their family. The conversation was going well so I started asking more controversial questions. Muslim can have up to 4 wives, so I asked Baba why women cannot have more husbands. He told me that there are more women in the world than men (not true), and the problem will be that women will stay without a man and they will do adultery. To avoid infidelities they let the man have more than one wife. I was holding the laugh when I heard his reasoning and the girls stayed quiet, probably they also thought that it was bullshit. In the end, he said that it’s possible to have more wives, but not everybody does it, you need to prove that you can support them financially. Then I asked the girls if they will let their future husband have another wife. They said “No way!”. They see it as something that is inside the Quran, but they won’t let it happen to them. This was the first time when I saw more assertiveness in their words rather than submissiveness. Probably there are many things that they don’t agree with when it comes to religion, but they will only follow what they are used to and what they can handle. The main point is that it’s not the religion that you follow, it’s more about how the people around you influence you with that. In the island, Baba took us to a local restaurant. The girls were telling me more about their lives in Qatar. JFYI you don’t pay income tax in Qatar. The 4 sisters had jobs and were earning good money, so they travel quite often. When we finished the food, the waiter came and gave the bill to Baba. I gave my part of the money to Baba and he paid the rest. The girls didn’t even make an effort to pay their share to Baba. This was very confusing to me, Baba was supposed to be the tour guide and he invited them for food, most of the times it is the other way round. When we left the restaurant I asked one of the girls and she told me that Baba normally pays everything, and in the end, he tells them how much it was. They were so used to have the man pay for everything because they feel that is the role of the man, even though it was their money. I am almost sure that Baba wouldn’t let them pay either, because he would feel a lesser man. That was so stupid for me because they were the ones that were actually paying, but because of gender roles, the just couldn’t. Plus, I was easily imagining Baba charging them more at the end of the day. The Muslim culture has different beliefs and traditions to what I am used to. I am not trying to sound like an expert of Muslims (I was there for only one week!), but in my personal experience, in terms of behaviour and warmness of the people in Turkey can be compared to Latin American society. There tend to be clashes and disputes between Muslim and Western societies. The main reason is that the cultures are very different and even sometimes contradictory (feminism). This creates tension between them. The Muslim people are most of the time more affected because they are seen as the “intruders” to the western countries, and that’s a global trend, people from developing countries move to developed countries for better education, opportunities, and safety. Muslims are not aliens, they are warm-hearted people with different beliefs and experiences. I honestly don’t like a lot of their beliefs, but c’mon, Christians have weird beliefs too. In Mexico, girls put the statue of Saint Anthony upside down to get a husband. Thanks to globalization, there are a lot of examples of societies coming together with different religions and the key to making the world work for everyone is to not be an asshole.

Medium.com,Life,Traveling can make you a better designer.,Travel,https://medium.com/@av_kurian_/traveling-can-make-you-a-better-designer-fc4a0d1610ea?source=topic_page---------525------------------1," Everyone needs to recharge and jet-setting has a big impact on your creative flow. Psychological studies have shown that an individual’s level of creativity (and the open-mindedness that facilitates it) can be directly influenced by the amount of traveling that they do. But perhaps more surprisingly, the creative benefit that individual gains from traveling can be drastically impacted by how immersed they become into the culture that they’re visiting. Designers should not just aspire to travel, but also to immerse themselves into the different cultures, languages, and experiences that they encounter while abroad. When I started traveling, I quickly noticed that different cultures would tend to solve problems in different ways, and many would appreciate forms of aesthetics that were vastly different from what I was used to. Cars, toilets, door handles and locks, advertisements, interior decorations, power outlets. No matter where you go in the world, the execution of these common designs will many times, be fundamentally different from place to place. I’ve encountered solutions to problems that I had never previously known to exist, aesthetic trends or fixations that I was never previously aware of, and even correlations between the popularity of certain dog breeds and certain parts of the world. All of these realizations have been the product of my travels, and they’ve brought me to a point where whenever I visit a new place, I now expect that I will leave that place with an altered perspective on design and aesthetics. A type of perspective that can only be acquired through experiencing a different culture. But perhaps even more shocking are the things that remain the same everywhere. The objects that are so well made and so universal, that no matter where you go, they will be consistent. These are the designs that I fixate on the most. Stop signs and road markings, teapots, clocks, bicycles, razors, scissors. What about these designs allowed them to be adopted by the world? And what about the more abstract things that tend to be the backdrop for everything that follows? The things that are different, but also kind of the same. Like sentence structure, cultural norms, or greetings. “Thank you” and “Nandi Namaskaram”. Joining hands. “How are you?” and “Enna und?”. They’re used in the same way, but when you dig deep into their meanings, you realize that they have different roots and implications. These subtle nuances shape the ways in which we think and the contexts that our cultures operate within. Design is a discipline which is all about collaborating with others. You do (hopefully) a lot of user testing, present your designs to managers and ultimately you work together with other designers. That’s all great, especially the latter. It helps you to come up with new ideas, but especially for introvert persons, this can be a lot of stress, not necessarily a stress you notice actively, but it’s there. Therefore traveling alone a great way to relax and to enjoy the silence of your room or the sounds of nature. This will ultimately allow you to come back with full energy and be even more motivated and prepared to work with others. Furthermore, this time you have alone will help you to clear your mind and make it free for new thoughts! Inspiration for your design work can be found everywhere, you maybe find it in art, running or drinking a coffee while the sun is rising. And sometimes, it’s best to leave your design job behind you and just go outside, travel, meet people. Maybe you can visit a museum during your vacation or whatever is interesting for you. It’ll help you to find new ideas, especially when you don’t force yourself to come up with new ones. Inspiration strikes when it wants. Traveling without friends can help to meet people you would’ve never met if you would travel with a group of people you already know. It’s always great to start a conversation with persons that aren’t in your business and get to know them, find out about their thoughts and opinions, maybe it can help you to understand the user better and think more out of the box. On a short ride to Bidar, I meet an entrepreneur who had quite interesting thoughts about people studying at universities and software developers… he helped me to understand what some people appreciate when they work with others or what they expect from a product. No matter which of these options you choose just makes sure that you actually choose one. It can be far too easy to get caught up in a routine and forget to disrupt yourself every now and then. But this kind of disruption, this feeling of being comfortable with being uncomfortable, is exactly what sparks personal and professional growth. “The world breaks everyone, and afterward, some are strong at the broken places.” — Ernest Hemingway"

Toyama is in the Chubu Region of Japan, in the central part of Japan’s main island of Honshu, with the western border taken up by the coast of the Sea of Japan. We can thank the sea, and especially Toyama Bay, for the abundant fresh seafood found around the prefecture! But the Unazuki Onsen area also provides Kurobe with gloriously steamy hot springs, bursting forth from the mountain crags. All this geological variation makes for deep ravines, and the rivers running through those are a great place to try canyoning. Take the Kurobe Gorge Railway’s Torokko Train around the area to explore, and we’re pretty sure you’ll be pleasantly surprised by how much fun this unassuming region can be."

Today, for example, I couldn’t find a pre-paid SIM card in Norway — one of the most developed countries in the world. So, I decided to share this guide to help my fellow travelers avoid the frustration of looking for internet when you could be enjoying your trip instead. Now, some will say that suffering from slow WiFi is a first world problem. That may be true — there are worse things that could happen. But when you work online or you need to be accessible to your company, family, or co-workers while traveling, finding good WiFi is a serious concern. So, here are some strategies for staying connected wherever you go. Bonus: At the end of this article, I’ll share a packing list of all the devices I travel with."

Medium.com,Life,How to move across the country without losing your mind,Travel,https://medium.com/@hvnwntw8/how-to-move-across-the-country-without-losing-your-mind-60e98f368fa9?source=topic_page---------532------------------1," Moving is never a fun task, let alone when it is across the country. Nevermind what the impact of uprooting your entire life may bring, there are countless factors that may cause negative consequences and anguish along the way. You may encounter lost prized items, damage to your furniture, financial distress, being scammed, and/or trouble transitioning to your new environment. After having endured several moves with 3 being long-distance, here are some tips I have developed which may ease your worries. It is never too early to start planning a move. If you know you are moving a year in advance, then start planning a year in advance. This may be as simple as gathering quotes from moving companies so that you are sure to save up enough money when the time comes. This kind of forethought can help to ease financial worry leading up to your move. Almost anyone who moves is going to end up contracting services to various businesses. These services may include manual labor, shipping fees, professional packers, and cleaning companies. Each business is going to come with its’ own risks versus benefits. It is important to examine each. When investigating your options for professional moving services, be wary in considering the cheapest options. It is typical for the moving service industry to provide quotes based upon the quantity, size, value, and weight of your belongings. Because these values are fixed, it is typical for fair-market prices to be within the same ballpark. When a company provides you with a significantly lower quote, there is a chance that the salesperson providing you with the quote is giving you an inaccurate price. Moving companies often devise lengthy contracts in order to protect their business from risks and loses. As with any industry, protecting yourself against liability is good business practice. The issue for consumers arrises when items are placed into the contract that significantly increases the risk of signing into the agreement. For example, a moving company may provide you with a non-binding quotation based upon the weight of your goods. Within the contract, there is typically a clause that provides a prorated cost based upon the weight of your goods. The salesperson acting on behalf of the moving company (whether a direct employee or referral service) may provide you with a low-balled estimate in order to gain commission. This perverse incentive may cause the consumer to be surprised when their final bill is $2,000 more than their estimated quote. Some individuals may elect to obtain moving insurance in order to hedge potential incurred expenses related to items being lost or damaged. An additional or alternative method would be to keep a detailed inventory of your items being transported. Using a spreadsheet is a helpful way to keep this information organized. Some prefer using something like Google Sheets. Personally, I use an application called Airtable. In addition to the name of your items, it is useful to include other information such as the estimated value, a unique identifier, receipts for big-ticket items, and time-stamped pictures of the items for proof of condition. Airtable has unique functions to assist in storing this information, such as the ability to generate unique identifiers, store images, upload attachments, and even create barcodes. During my most recent move, I created labels for each box including the above information, as well as warning labels for heavy or fragile items. Each label contained a barcode which I scanned upon sealing of the boxes, when the boxes were delivered, and finally when the boxes were opened. Each time I scanned the barcode, Airtable recorded the time and the date. When the movers collect your belongings, as well as when they are delivered, you can print out a copy of the spreadsheet and have the company sign to verify that the document is accurate. Not all moving companies will honor this, so it is advised to ask this upfront prior to booking the move. For some, it makes sense to have your car transported by an automobile shipping contractor to your new address. Do your due diligence as you would with any company. It is important to note that companies may not be held liable for any items that are stolen from inside of your vehicle during transit. Again, check the contract but to be safe empty out all items you would not want someone else to steal. There are plenty of moving parts (no pun intended) when it comes to moving, especially across the country. Hopefully, you will find a few of these tips helpful for your upcoming move. Feel free to ask questions!"

Medium.com,Life,"Retro computers, vegetarianism and booze in Japan",Travel,https://medium.com/@me_26124/retro-computers-vegetarianism-and-booze-in-japan-97dcc1c29f20?source=topic_page---------536------------------1," 10–09–2019 It may come as no surprise that I’m a bit of a fan of Japan. It’s a country with an interesting relationship to technology and the future. You can find Japanese culture in various spaces in the UK and I believe the two countries have a bit more in common than you might think. I’ve been fortunate enough to visit Japan again after 14 years, only this time I’ve learned a few things about retro consoles and computers, finding vegetarian food and how to get around. I hope some folks find this helpful. Just to frame things, we did a lot of travel on this trip, starting in Tokyo, heading towards the islands of Naoshima, Miyajima, moving back inland towards Hiroshima, Nara, finishing in the Kansai region with Kyoto and Osaka. It’s a pretty classic trip. Tokyo is a big draw for a lot of folks, but Kyoto and Osaka have a lot to offer too. On this trip I was really keen to find as much retro computing and gaming related tat as I could. I was especially interested in any computers that compare to the Commodore Amiga, ZX Spectrum and similar. I recommend the IPSJ Computing Museum as a good place to start. It’s a bit oldschool in it’s design, but the information they hold is comprehensive. I was also pretty keen on the older consoles and games, with a mission to find the most Japanese of items. Things that were never released outside of Japan, or Japanese versions of popular machines. My number one tip — Ojamakan is your friend. My second tip — Super potato is super rip-off. Ojamakan is a new, small chain of shops. They have shops in Gifu, Osaka, Kyoto, Kobe and maybe a couple of other places. They tend to be in the less travelled areas of these towns. Certainly the one in Osaka took a while to get to witha few buses and a lot of walking. However, you won’t be disappointed! If you want the largest selection of NES, SNES, Megadrive, PlayStation, Dreamcast and many other games, look no further than this place! Ojamakan is pretty cheap in comparison to other places. They stock newer items such as PS4 games and hardware but do a pretty good line in retro stuff. They also stock non-working gear for repair and tested second-hand devices with a 1 to 3 month guarantee. Ojamakan is really the place to go. Super potato, on the other-hand, was a big let down. If you have all the money in the world then do go. You’ll find what you are looking for, but be prepared to pay over the odds. For example, I found a Gameboy Colour for about £60 in one store. On ebay, in the UK, you’ll pay £30. Wonderswans and NeoGeo Pockets were double what they were in Ojamakan. Honestly, I can’t really recommend Super Potato unless you really, really want a particular thing and are prepared to pay whatever it takes. I can’t fault their selection. It’s clear they’ve gotten wise to the tourist trade, bought up all they can, then selling it at massive market to these who’ve only heard of Super Potato. Book-off is a large chain of secondhand stores, dealing with books. However, they do sell retro games and hardware. Typically, their oldest hardware runs to the Gameboy advance or SNES (in some cases) but you can find games for devices as old as the PC Engine. It really depends. It’s clear games aren’t their main ticket, but the prices they charge are pretty low. Lower in some cases, than Ojamakan. I found some real gems in several Book-off branches, so if you are serious, check out every single one you come across. Like charity shops in the UK, it’s hit and miss but still worth a look. Other, one off stores are worth a look. A-too in Kyoto is a good example, with prices a little high in some areas but not in others. Game Tanteidan in Osaka is another. For some reason, Kyoto seemed better than Osaka (oddly) for retro games and kit. Not sure why. I suspect Osaka has just gotten wise to the tourist lust for such things. Sadly, aside from the MSX and a few other personal computers, I didn’t find anything similar to the UK personal computers of the 80s and 90s. It’s a real shame. I suspect the computers I did see in places like Super Potato were there because they took cartridge games as well as disks; half computer and half gaming console. It seems the place to get retro computers is on Yahoo auctions. Yep! It’s not eBay over in Japan. Yahoo auctions holds dominion! Seems odd to me but there you go. I noticed that one could get hold of a Sharp x68000 fairly easily. I say fairly easily, you need a Yahoo Japan account and some method of payment. I never got that far but I understand that not everyone accepts PayPal. What I did notice is there seems to be quite the cottage industry of proxy bidding and posting. You pay a Japanese person (sometimes using services a bit like Task Rabbit) to order and post on your behalf. You have to really want your x68000 if you go down that route, and I wasn’t keen enough. One thing I did try and order was a HyperkeyboardPi. A lovely little idea by a chap going by the handle of Jinson on Twitter. I navigated the various forms on his agent’s site, only to be told the next day that they wouldn’t deliver to my hotel. Really quite annoying. Not only that but after they refunded me, they charged me again, starting a serious of email back-and-forwards and several messages to Monzo. Fortunately we got it all sorted out. Jinson was pretty good about the whole thing on Twitter which was nice. So if you want anything specific from Japan there seems to be little advantage to actually being in the country. You’ll just need to take the hit on proxies and international shipping. As a tourist, you have access to a few options for travel, some of which require ordering before you enter Japan. The most well known perhaps is the Japan Rail Pass that gets you unlimited travel around the country for a number of days, depending on how much you pay. Do check how many trains you’ll be taking as it’s not always the cheapest deal. You need to purchase the pass from a travel agent. I got mine from the Japan Centre in London. What you actually get is a coupon that you take to a train station when you get to Japan. There, they will check your passport and exchange the coupon for a pass. Make sure you have a stamp in your passport to show you are a tourist. Other passes and cards exist such as the Amazing Osaka Pass, Kansai one pass and many more, depending on where in Japan you are spending your time. Planning the train travel is a bit more tricky. There are many train operators and options. The Shinkansen has a few different trains, such as the Nozomi, Sakura, Hikari and others. Some passes are valid on certain Shinkansen and not others. In addition, there are many local trains to various out-of-the-way places, different metro systems in each city and so forth. The app is pretty good for planning train travel. Despite it’s 3.5 star rating (at time of rating) it was very handy. Combined with Google, you won’t go wrong. Inside the larger cities, you’ve got the usual bus and metro options. With buses, get on through the middle door and exit at the front. You must use exact change in the hopper or one of the various travel cards. Typically, all the stops are announced well in advance by the driver and on the board at the front so it’s pretty hard to get lost. The metro system in places like Tokyo, Osaka and Kyoto are pretty extensive. Sometimes, the metro system will be underground, other-times, it’ll be a local train. This can be problematic if you have something like a metro one day ticket or similar as not all operators accept all cards. However, like many places around the world, RFID style travel cards exist. Suica and Icoca are the two main ones for Tokyo and Kansai respectively. Definitely get one of these. Travel isn’t that cheap sadly. I found it was mostly 210 Yen per trip with no upper limit, so plan ahead. If you get caught out though, there are fare adjustment machines available in every station. Speaking of Google and travel, the internet is an absolute must! Japan has internet in most places you’d expect. Every hotel and Ryokan we stayed in had internet. Some cities have areas with free wifi, as do the airports. The real trick however, is the portable internet. One option is the portable 4G hotspot device, the Ninja Wifi. It provides a 4G hotspot so if you are travelling with multiple devices it’s all taken care of. However, it is also very expensive and you need to return the unit at the end of the trip. This isn’t really an option if you fly into one airport and out of another. A better option, I think, is a data sim. Much cheaper and available from Klook. You order online and pick them up on arrival at Narita airport or wherever you fly into. I had a lot of trouble with my Fairphone, mostly because Japan doesn’t use the same bands as the UK. However, we have a spare iPhone 5 kicking around that works fine in Japan. So all you need to do is slap in the SIM, turn on personal hotspot and boom! — you’ve got your portable internet. Google does a pretty good job of directions in Japan I found, as much as I hate to admit it. Figuring out which platform your train is on, which exit to take from a station and many more little time saving options is made quite easy with Google on your phone. I’d also recommend Maps.me — although slower, it will work offline with dropped pins so you can plan out your day in advance. Japan is still, strangely, cash based. I found that few places wanted to take cards. In the UK we are quite used to contactless, let alone chip and pin. We had three cards we wanted to try: Revolut, Monzo and your standard Visa credit and debit cards. I found that Monzo didn’t work very often at all. Their support when things went wrong however, wasn’t too bad at all. A couple of times, I had to use the mag-stripe and sign. Very odd. Revolut fairs a little better. Most normal cards work but you do get a worse rate on the exchange to Yen. The 7/11 chain of shops tend to have ATM machines that work with international cards. They have an English language setting but they only seem to dispense a minimum of about £100 (10,000 Yen) in 1000 Yen notes, so plan accordingly. It’s a bit annoying but it’s the best we could find. My suspicion is that Japan just has it’s own payment systems, based around RFID cards and the like. Travel cards like Suica and Icoca can be used in shops and vending machines. I’m not a veggie but my wife is. You’d think Japan would be an easy place to cut out the meat but that’s really not the case at all. Fish stock is used in various places, bonito flakes in others. It can be very tricky. Vegetarianism just doesn’t seem to be as big a thing in Japan as it is in the UK. However, things have improved a fair bit and many of the classic dishes such as ramen and the amazing okonomiyaki can be found in their veggie forms these days if you do a bit of research. If you need a quick snack I heartily recommend onigiri. You can find these in Lawsons, 7/11 or even on station platforms. Cheap and cheerful, these triangles of rice surrounded by seaweed, contain various fillings, many of which are meaty but some are not. It’s a good lunch option when you are on the go. Sushi is another option and there are many that are suitable for vegetarians. Conveyor belt sushi, whilst different from the sushi restaurant, seemed to offer several things such as egg, sweet potato, aubergine and the like, so you can enjoy the fun and not have fish. Lots of restaurants offer vegetarian versions of their dishes. The iPhone / Android app Happy Cow is quite useful. Get the paid version and you’ll get access to a lot of good vegetarian suggestions. I’d also suggest Google searches and a good guidebook. Quite often there will be a good suggestion. In Osaka, you should totally check out Okonomiyaki if you get the chance. It’s the best! If Japan does mark allergens, I couldn’t read them. There isn’t the friendly graphic logo with accompanying text saying “suitable for vegetarians”. I think this is something we can be proud of in the UK. A small but important thing. However, plenty of food in Japan has English text next to the Japanese. Being coeliac, I suspect, is very hard in Japan, if you plan to eat Japanese food. Soy sauce and flour do get stuck in many things. It’s not something I’ve researched personally, but from what little I’ve seen, do be very careful if this affects you. Going vegan is a lot harder, but there is one saving grace. Buddhist cuisine in Japan is vegan all the way and quite interestingly flavoured and prepared. It’s called Shojin Ryori and you can get it in various temple style ryokans. Definitely seek it out if you fancy some tasty vegan food. For these who like a tipple, sake is perhaps the most well known of Japanese drinks. It’s fairly cheap and you can buy it in most places, including 7/11. From a small jar, up-to massive cartons, it’s a nice drink and it’s cheaper than beer. Speaking of beer, Japan has a few cheap lagers such as Suntory, Kirin, Sapporo and the like. They’re fine — nothing special but nothing terrible either. You can find all that in most convenience stores and often on draft. Sadly, Japan has adopted the American pint so don’t expect a lot of beer for your 600 yen! Indeed, beer is expensive and craft beer doubly so. Japan makes some really tasty beer though. Places like the Kyoto beer lab make a fine pint, but expect to pay around 1000 yen for the privilege. Oddly, whisky highballs seem to be quite popular, and often cheaper than beer. So if you like a whisky and soda, give that a shot instead. Other strange drinks exist including a weird preserved plum thing I had once. Japan still loves it’s cigarettes it seems. Really not sure why. Although many places are designated non-smoking it’s still quite prevalent, much more so than the UK. Inside some arcades and bars, you’ll see folks lit up. Certain areas within arcades and restaurants will be marked as smoking spots. A quick note about vending machines. Japan is a pretty hot country, least from Honshu down, so vending machines selling cold coffee, soft drinks and the like can be a godsend. However, don’t get your hopes up if you expect to see beer vending machines on the street. It’s pretty rare these days and even if you do, they tend to have age restriction locks, using the Japanese driving licence. A better bet is inside hotels. Typically cheap Asahi and the like can be found in these, around 220 Yen. Gacha machines are odd things. They dispense cheap plastic tat in a small plastic ball-like package. You can occasionally find cute or silly things in them and they are everywhere. Japan does seem to have a love for the plastic tat. I can’t say I approve of that (waste of plastic be damned) but it’s worth engaging with at least a little as it’s a peculiar little cultural item. I used to study Japanese a while back, and it does help when getting around. Simple phrases like “this please” or “where is the toilet?” are always handy. I’ve found duolingo, akebi and Google Translate to be very useful apps to have on your phone. However, you can get by without knowing any Japanese these days. Many signs have English subtitles. Many announcements, such as these on trains, are in many languages. One thing that I found different on this trip is that folks seemed to be happy to talk back to me in Japanese if I gave it a bit of a go. Most Japanese who work in places like restaurants and hotels speak pretty good English we found. Nevertheless, I think it’s good to try at least bit, even if all you say is oishii!. Japan is quite famous for it’s arcades too. In the UK, arcades are effectively dead, replaced by the (possibly better?) barcade style setups. I suspect, because personal space in Japan is at a premium, conveniences are pretty good — they have to be. In the UK, we’d invite people over to play on a console, whereas in Japan, folks would go out to an arcade. A friend sent me this map of arcades around the world where Street Fighter 2 can be played. It’s not a bad benchmark actually. It’s a classic game and quite good fun. I explored a few arcades in Osaka and Kyoto and I found some of the cabinets to be pretty extreme and interesting. There’s usually a mixture of retro cabs, new fancy sit-down full immersion affairs, driving games, rhythm games and strange games played with both controls and actual collectable cards. Overall though, I was somewhat less impressed this time around. You can’t take alcohol into arcades, few if any offer food like they used to and although some of the games are quite impressive, I feel like we are spoiled these days with things like VR, all the indie games on the Switch and experimental PC gaming. For me, I found the arcades didn’t hold my interest quite as much as they used to. Japan does have a few game-bars though. Similar to a barcade but smaller, and featuring home consoles as oppose to cabs. Most seem to be run by American immigrants from what I can tell. Space Station Osaka isn’t a bad one at all. Sadly, like most bars, it only takes cash. In addition, I went in twice and it was mostly full of tourists like me as oppose to Japanese folks which seemed a shame. Still, it’s worth going in one or two, especially if you fancy a beer whilst playing ChuChu Rocket in two player! So many resources, webpages, books, youtube videos and what not exist out there for Japan, I could never list them all, even just the really good ones. But here are few that helped us: Japan is a great place to visit. I think it has a lot of similarities to the UK which aren’t obvious at first glance. I’d recommend visiting to anyone, but especially the computer nerds and cyberpunks out there."
Medium.com,Life,A 5-Minute Ride Proves the Future of Air Travel Is Already Here,Travel,https://onezero.medium.com/a-5-minute-ride-proves-the-future-of-air-travel-is-already-here-f9df7713a4d9?source=topic_page---------537------------------1," he Urban Air Mobility vehicle is already waiting as I step from the New York City curbside into the waiting lounge. The room is sleek, equipped with couches and an open bar, but there’s no time for me to luxuriate. An attendant dressed in black ushers me through a door and out onto a platform that projects over the Hudson River. Another attendant helps me and a second passenger strap in — and then we’re off. Amid a thrumming downwash of air, we levitate, and the bustle of the city falls away beneath us. Through the bubble windows I look down on sailboats, brownstone courtyards, bustling avenues. We’re zooming along at 95 miles per hour, just 800 feet off the ground, low enough that all the everyday details stand out, so that everything seems more like flying in a dream than the normal experience of aviation. And, like a good dream, it’s over too soon: the sensation of dropping, the ground growing closer. We touch down on a landing pad, the doors pop open, and another attendant helps us out. We’ve traveled 13 miles across the congested city — a distance that would have taken an hour by limo and even longer by train — in just five minutes. This is the kind of travel that science fiction has long promised: levitating vehicles that whisk impatient humans from here to there with ease. But mine was not an imaginary voyage. Short hop vertical travel is here for real, and while coming advances in technology will certainly transform it (some 135 companies are currently competing to field the world’s first viable electronic vertical takeoff and landing aircraft, or eVTOL), current technology can already provide the necessary capabilities. In this case, my journey was carried out in a Bell 407GX helicopter chartered by Blade Urban Air Mobility, a company that operates 22 core routes from 11 bases around the country and plans to start service in India this fall. To call Blade’s helicopters “urban air mobility” is not simply a question of pasting a new label on an old technology. Blade is pioneering a transportation network that moves people through the air in a new way, and it’s serving as the prototype for how eVTOL systems will work in the future. That’s a unique and valuable skill set for the manufacturers who someday want to build the underlying infrastructure, which is why major companies Airbus, Bell, and Lockheed Martin’s Sikorsky division have all partnered with Blade. “We’re learning from Blade in order to help establish what our product needs to look like as we move into eVTOL aircraft,” says Susan Griffin, executive vice president of commercial business at Bell Textron, who believes production eVTOL aircraft could be on the scene as early as the “mid-2020s.” Blade was founded in 2015 as a way for well-heeled Manhattanites to zip out to the Hamptons and back. But like Uber, what set the company apart was less what they were doing than how they were doing it. Instead of owning aircraft and chartering them out to customers by the hour, like incumbent operators, they were chartering the aircraft and selling off the seats individually. This meant that they could put more butts in each aircraft, but required the company to figure out how to sell all those seats to a new kind of customer, many of whom had never been on a helicopter before. One successful anxiety-easing tactic: offering passengers wine before and during each flight. To do this, Blade designed an appealing brand, created a sexy marketing campaign, and launched an app to let customers book from their smartphones. But other challenges remained. Unlike traditional helicopter operators, which charter whole helicopters at a time, Blade has to deal with each passenger as an individual customer. The interior of a helicopter is a fairly cramped space, and while members of a charter group usually know each other and are comfortable being in close contact, random strangers are often not. “Most people, depending on their height, are actually intertwining their legs with the person in front of them,” says Simon McLaren, Blade’s director of communications. “That’s highly personal.” One successful anxiety-easing tactic: offering passengers wine before and during each flight. Blade’s business model seems to be working. In the four years since its first flight, the company has expanded prolifically, at least geographically speaking (the company didn’t share passenger numbers). It now operates in seven states, with offerings that include seaplanes and jets as well as helicopters. At its core, however, the company remains focused on short-hop vertical transport. “Our most important product is flying people in and out of city centers, which we do more of than any other company in the country,” McLaren says. This is precisely the transportation segment that the coming wave of eVTOL aircraft will be best suited to serve. “When we talk about eVTOL, we don’t expect these things to be flying everywhere,” says Bell’s Griffin. “We’re looking at an infrastructure within cities.” Whether piloted by humans or autonomous, flying taxis will likely remain a luxury service into the foreseeable future. While the coming generation of eVTOLs will save money by flying without a pilot, they will be smaller than today’s helicopters so will carry fewer passengers per trip. “We do not believe it’s going to be inexpensive for a long time,” McLaren says. “Flying cars” of various stripes have been rolled out from time to time over the last half-century, but none has ever made it past the prototype stage. While a production-ready model remains elusive, however, recent years have seen a tremendous upsurge in investment. Bell’s entrant in the eVTOL horse race is Nexus, a four-passenger air taxi that will fly on six 8-foot-wide ducted-fan rotors when it starts operation in 2023. Airbus, meanwhile, has multiple eVTOLS under development, including the single-passenger Vahana, an electric self-piloting vehicle that flew to 16 feet last January, and City Airbus, a four-passenger “urban air taxi” technology demonstrator with four 9-foot rotor blades that made its first tethered takeoff in Germany in May. Sikorsky is preparing for the eVTOL era by developing Matrix, a technology that allows existing helicopters to be adapted to autonomous control. Each of the manufacturers Blade has partnered with is working with the company in a different way. In 2018, Airbus inked a strategic partnership agreement with Blade that would give the aerospace giant access to Blade’s expertise in setting up on-demand flights. “By partnering with Blade, we are setting a strong foundation for the next step, which will be the successful deployment of electric vertical take-off and landing [eVTOL] systems,” said Airbus official Matthieu Louvot in a press statement issued at the time. A year later, Sikorsky inked a deal to provide helicopters to Blade through its New York subsidiary, AAG, and to establish a working group to explore how Sikorsky could take advantage of Blade’s consumer, cockpit and operator technology. “We do not believe it’s going to be inexpensive for a long time.” Bell, meanwhile, is “working with them to understand what the passenger experience is and where we could develop products to better meet their needs,” says Griffin. Says McLaren: “we probably have given Bell over 150 ideas of things we felt that they should do to help make the experience more consumer-friendly.” But vehicle design is only half of the equation. Assuming that engineers do manage to work out the considerable technical challenges inherent in the eVTOL concept, operators will still face a whole other layer of difficulty: anti-noise activists. Here, too, Blade has a head start. Its first base of operation, East Hampton, happens to be home to a vigorous and outspoken citizen’s group, the Quiet Skies Coalition. Patricia Currie, a Sag Harbor resident active in the group, has little use for the noisy helicopters that buzz over her house for the summer, or for the privileged people who ride them. “The 4 o’clock bell goes and they hop on the helicopter,” she says. “It’s a quick ride to partyland.” Her group asked the town to impose restrictions on when the airport could be used, to at least cut down on noise at night. But when the town tried, the move was shut down by a court ruling. Now Currie and her allies want to shut down the airport for good when its current obligations to the FAA run out in 2021. “That day I’m going to go with a bunch of people and flowers and put a lock on the gate,” she promises. Keen to mollify its opposition, Blade uses quieter models of helicopter on its East Hampton flights and voluntarily restricts its operations to after 7.15am. “Our job is to be a good citizen,” McLaren says. “We realize that using the airport is a privilege, and to try to work with the local community to come up with solutions so the airport stays open.” In the meantime, it’s preparing for the worst-case scenario by spreading its traffic to alternate airports nearby. Whether Blade wins or loses the battle for East Hampton Airport, the company will have gained years worth of experience in dealing with obstreperous neighbors — a potentially invaluable skill set, once passenger-carrying drones start buzzing hither and yon around metropolises worldwide. “Noise abatement is obviously a significant challenge,” says Griffin. For its part, Blade is betting that once it arrives, air taxi technology will be such an improvement over today’s helicopters that it will be a win both for passengers and for those on the ground who dread losing their peace and quiet to 24/7 droning. “We believe eVTOL is going to be quiet,” McLaren says. “We would like to show people a path to quieter air transportation, which we know is going to be a reality. It’s not an if, it’s a when.”"

Or if they do, it’s to places like Vegas, Miami, or the Caribbean. But recently it seems like the tide is changing.

Despite these numbers, marketing in the travel arena is still #sowhite, with many promotional materials geared towards seemingly affluent, upper-class White people.

ince college I have always been considered beautiful. This was not the case growing up, though. I was always the short, awkward, stick thin, freckled face girl. I was cute, but never sexy. However, thanks to late puberty and some birth control hormones, I eventually grew into a woman. I got a lot of attention from guys and I learned how to use my looks and body to get what I wanted. I was manipulative and became an incredibly selfish, self-seeking person. It was like a game and I loved having the upper hand. I continued on in this manner for many years, rarely finding the pursuit of complete validation and a consensus of my attractiveness fulfilling. Because guess what? Beauty is not “one size fits all.” I was never able to prove myself as the universally sexy Marilyn Monroe type (especially since I lacked the blonde hair and large boobs). The feeling of needing to prove myself and receive acceptance through my exterior beauty took a toll on my self-esteem and self-worth. I thought that if I wasn’t considered beautiful or sexy or attractive to everyone then I wasn’t good enough. I spent much of my early 20s trying very hard to be beautiful and desirable. I wasn’t able to go out in public without putting makeup on first— something that has completely changed, as it is a rare day you’ll find me with any makeup on. (It just takes so much effort to take off…) I thought I had to be a prized trophy. Not being noticed was as good as being dead. Being invisible was obliteration. I had to stand out. I used provocative clothing and my lustrous locks to be apart from the rest. My hair was thick, wavy, and over two feet long. I was known as “The Girl With The Hair.” It was my pride and joy. My hair became my identity. I once had a traumatic event at a pool party when I allowed a “friend” to trim my hair. Apparently, he thought it would look better shorter and decided to cut off much more than we had agreed upon. I heard the scissors slice through my hair and instantly knew something was wrong; I turned around and saw over half of my identity laying flaccid in his hand. I ran inside, crawled onto the floor of a dark closet, shut the door and cried on the phone to my best friend for an hour. I felt violated. It took me time and space to recover from that incident. But I never forgot it."
Medium.com,Life,Why would anyone want to sit on a plane for over 18 hours?,Travel,https://medium.com/@BUexperts/why-would-anyone-want-to-sit-on-a-plane-for-over-18-hours-c261990074a9?source=topic_page---------542------------------1," By Jay Zagorsky for The Conversation Recently Qantas announced plans to conduct test flights from New York and London to Sydney and two other Australian cities. If commercialized, these routes would become the longest in the world at about 19 hours. Qantas said it will conduct test flights with only employees on board to ensure the flights are safe and comfortable enough for paying customers. I heard this news after finishing a round-trip on what is currently the world’s longest flight, the 18 hours and 45 minutes Singapore Airlines schedules to get from Newark, New Jersey, to Singapore, a route that began last October. The return trip is slightly quicker. Fortunately for me, there were favorable winds so each way took about 30 minutes less than scheduled. Being aloft twice for the better part of a day gave me plenty of time to ponder the origins and economics of long-distance flights — with plenty of time to spare for binge watching. Pilots and airlines have been pushing the boundaries of flight times since the earliest days of air travel. In fact, 19 hours is rather quick for the industry’s trailblazers. The first plane to make it across the Pacific took off from Oakland, California, in 1928. It took the aircraft, dubbed the “Southern Cross,” three long flights to get to its final destination in Australia: 27 and a half hours to Hawaii, 34 and a half hours to Fiji and a final 21 and a half hours to Brisbane. In all, the pilot and his crew covered about 7,000 miles in 10 days — all without losing any luggage. A few years later, in 1931, two daredevils in search of a US$25,000 prize flew from Tokyo to the state of Washington in the first nonstop flight over the Pacific Ocean. To save weight and fuel, the pilots even threw out their landing gear after takeoff. When they reached the U.S., they crash landed — but survived to claim the prize. The flight took 41 hours and covered more than 5,500 miles. These super-long flights, of course, were taken by daredevil pilots with no passengers. And they were very dangerous. One of the most famous aviation failures involved Amelia Earhart, who disappeared in 1937 while attempting to cross part of the Pacific on a world circling flight. The first service to ferry paying customers across the Pacific was created by Pan Am in October 1936. The trip started from San Francisco and ended in Manila, capital of the Philippines. It took six days and about 60 hours of flying time. The plane flew during the day and made stops in Hawaii, Midway, Wake and Guam at night. The longest leg, from San Francisco to Hawaii, took 18 and a half hours. Pam Am’s planes, called the “Clippers,” didn’t need airports. They were specially designed to take off and land in the water. The planes were also quite luxurious and even had separate areas for eating and sleeping. But all that luxury while spanning the globe was quite expensive. The one-way fare from San Francisco to Manila was $950, or $17,400 in today’s dollars. Fortunately, the cost of flying these long routes — in terms of both money and time — has come down dramatically. These days you can fly direct from San Francisco to Manila in business class for around $3,000, including the return flight. The trip to Manila takes just 14 hours. Today’s flights are also a lot safer. The concern for many passengers is not crashing but instead health risks like deep vein thrombosis, a type of blood clot. Still, even if things have improved, I think most of us agree that flying is not fun. Airlines regularly rank near the bottom among industries in customer satisfaction surveys. So why would we want to increase the amount of time spent 30,000 feet above the ground in a metal tube with wings? For one thing, it means less total travel time. For example, my flight to Singapore would have taken three and a half hours longer with a layover in Hong Kong. But if you’re someone who might prefer a break during a long flight halfway around the world, a more practical benefit is that removing the connection also reduces the chance your luggage is lost, since bags are handled fewer times. Almost half of all bags delayed in 2017 were a result of baggage handlers missing connections. Flying a full plane load of passengers directly also saves airlines money — which often translates into lower prices for consumers too. An extra layover at a major airport can be expensive, with fees for landing, takeoff, parking, noise abatement and security. Airports also charge extra for optional services like cleaning, towing and providing electricity to a plane while it is parked at the gate. One thing that was interesting about the Qantas announcement is all the research it plans to do during its test flights — scheduled for October through December — on the passengers themselves. Scientists and medical experts will monitor sleep patterns, food and beverage consumption, lighting, physical movement and in-flight entertainment to assess their impact on health and well-being — and prevent any blood clots in the legs. Using this data, Qantas hopes to make ultra-long flying a more pleasant experience. After all, the main reason to take a single 19-hour flight is to arrive faster and feeling better than taking multiple flights to the same destination. Whether you love or hate flying, expect longer flights in the future as more efficient planes allow airlines to go ever farther. Given we seem to be wired for binge watching, I don’t think this trend is so bad. I could have actually used a longer flight. My effort to binge the second season of “Star Trek: Discovery” was abruptly interrupted as we descended back into Newark, with just 10 minutes left in the final episode."

The MUJI Adjustable Handle Hard Carry Suitcase is the suitcase you didn’t know you needed (I know, it’s a terribly long name). As a designer, I can be particular sometimes regarding what products I own. A product can be highly functional, but if the design is poor, I’d most likely look for different options. On that note, a well-designed product should inherently mean that it functions well. I’m happy that I’ve finally found a well-designed suitcase: both functional and beautiful."
Medium.com,Life,"Athens Travel Guide…It’s Not Just the Acropolis, Y'all!",Travel,https://medium.com/my-shadow-me-life-lessons-of-a-lost-girl/athens-travel-guide-its-not-just-the-acropolis-yall-d9f1119263fd?source=topic_page---------544------------------1," As a young girl I daydreamed of the Greek gods and the myths that told their history (and not just because of Hercules and Xena, ya’ll…but they definitely fed my addiction) as did many a kid I am sure and so when I decided to travel Europe I could find no better a place to start than Greece, not only for its mythology but dramatic history. And for me, there was no better a place to start than the capital, Athens. This illustrious city has captured many young kids imagination and in truth impacted most modern societies to a phenomenal degree. And if you're going to Greece where better to start than the capital and the city that houses it’s most famous site, but like the title says Athen’s ain’t just about the Acropolis. Let’s talk about my stay… This was my first hostel stay and it was definitely interesting, but we will talk about that in a future post. The hostel itself was very well appointed, only minutes from the Acropolis and almost all of the sites any history nerd (BTW…that’s me) could want to see. The bar itself wasn’t open most the nights I stayed but I was traveling out of season so that was not a shock. The rooftop was open though so you could grab food, some beers and enjoy the star attraction..the view of that very famous temple, the Acropolis. The city lights the columns of the temple up which becomes a beacon to a bygone glory. The hostel offers a free walking tour every morning with a local named George and I highly suggest you take advantage of this offering. The walk takes about 2–2.5 hours and takes you around all the major sight surrounding the Acropolis. George is a great guide that makes history and the walk entertaining and very informative. Make sure you mention at the end that you are hungry because George will take you to a great place, Lionidi, for a Greek meal that was outstanding and well worth the 10 Euros. For the price, the Pella Inn was well worth it. So that’s the rundown of accommodations. Let’s get to the fun stuff the sites that I saw and what I thought of them… I wanted to see everything (as we all do when we start a dream trip) but what I had to learn and learn quickly was that if you rush through everything you end up seeing nothing (or at least remembering little to nothing). I quickly found my pace and set about checking those boxes off my list. Though I did not see everything I did see some amazing sites and my favorite? Nope, not the Acropolis! My favorite wound up being the Ancient Agora and if you head out to Athens please make sure not to skip it I promise you won’t be sorry. Here are my thoughts on each site and a little history to go along with it… Okay so when you think Athen’s I am sure you automatically drift to the Acropolis and as well you should. The history of this ancient temple is intricate and quickly wraps itself in your imagination like a kitten snuggling its mother. This site is a conglomeration of several buildings including the Parthenon. In mythology, this temple was erected to the winner of a duel between Athena, the Goddess of Wisdom and War, and Poseidon, God of the Sea. The two battled each other for the favor of the Athenians and bestowed upon them gifts, Poseidon a well of water and Athena an olive tree. The people feeling that the olive tree was a better gift awarded their fidelity to Athena and built the temple in her honor. Now that was mythology and the actual history of this site is just as interesting, so one tip I have is when you visit a site make sure to learn a little about it so that you can wrap yourself in its mysticism and energy. I absolutely was in awe of this site and though as I stated it ended up not being my favorite it still lived up to what I had expected from it and then some. The ticket for just the Acropolis is 20 Euros but you can get a combination ticket that allows you access to several other sites for 30 Euros. This is a great deal and if you are there to see the sites this is an even better deal, The Ministry of Culture and Sports has all the information on its website, so head over and check out all the sites that you can see with this ticket. The views from the top of this site are nothing short of phenomenal, but be warned (especially all those out there like me that can break something walking on a flat surface) wear shoes with good grip and tread carefully those stones are slippery. This theater built sometime in the early BC’s was dedicated to everyone’s favorite lush, Dionysus, the God of Wine and Plays (that just means this guy knew how to party). Built at the base of the hill that housed the Acropolis it was a center of Athenian life and to this very day is used during the summer months for concerts, operas, and plays. Though I wasn’t able to enter the big theater just below, the one where the shows are done I was able to get an up-close look at the one in the picture above. The admission is covered in the combination Acropolis ticket I talked about above and well worth that extra 10 Euros. The climb down to the base is steep so if you are not in great shape (this girl right here) make sure to take your time and bring a big bottle of water. The weather when I was there was perfectly sunny but not too hot so I highly suggest April for that reason and also because the high season for travel begins in May, so you will beat the crowds. The Romans in all their glory knew that Athens was still a very important city among their vast empire. So in the 400’s BC Hadrian that famous wall builder also built himself a giant reading room. Built-in the classic Roman design it was his mark on a city that he admired. This site is covered in the combination ticket as well and though much smaller a site than the Acropolis and the next entry it is still worth a stroll through to see the impact of the Roman empire on its role model, Greece. Okay, let’s talk about how fantastic and overlooked this site is, but not before I give you just a little history. The agora was the hub of all life in Athens and is located near the Acropolis. This site was where the trade and bartering of goods would go one as well as philosophers spouting their new ideas. The temple of Hephaestus, the god of the hearth and weapon builder of the gods, sits upon a hill within the Agora. Built during the later years of the 5th century this temple is one of the best-preserved Doric temples left. This site is large and takes time to stroll down the paths and through the reconstructed agora. The scenery is beautiful especially when I was there as everything was beginning its bloom. This site is covered as well with that magical combined Acropolis ticket and in my opinion, overshadows it’s more popular sister because of its size and atmosphere. On top of the beautiful landscape, you get another temple and one you can get even closer to than at the Acropolis. Then there is the fact you can roam the corridors of that reconstructed agora and peruse the small museum within its halls. All this makes a very pleasant hour or so of your day. The Roman Agora was yet another contribution of those invaders from the west to their favorite city in the east. At the back of the site sits the Tower of Winds a water clock that still stands in near perfect condition. This site is still under excavation but well worth a walkthrough. The site is included in the combination ticket as well and I highly suggest that you make sure to take time to glance inside the tower of the wind…it’s amazing. The original museum was on top of the Acropolis but with the ever-growing crowds, a new location was soon needed…enter the little museum. As the name suggested it to would see a large traffic problem, but that problem wouldn’t be solved until the early 2000s. This is when the new Acropolis museum was opened. This museum is very well laid out, although walking on glass over the previous floor freaked me out. So I skirted the sides. the outside layout is cool with that same glass idea utilized as well so that you can see the excavation below the museum. For me, it was only when I hit the second floor that this fun little accent became a little disconcerting. Other than that the views are amazing and the collection housed within the museum is equally so. The price to get in is 5 Euros and worth every bit of it, especially if like I said you are a history nerd like me. Well, Shadows, that’s my break down of my stay in Athens. I didn’t get to see everything and that’s okay. All that means is I will have to revisit this city that captivated me in my youth and reignited my love for it with a simple 3 days in April.

Medium.com,Life,Mount Yamnuska,Travel,https://medium.com/swlh/mount-yamnuska-9aaa762e2e6f?source=topic_page---------545------------------1," I recently climbed a mountain in Banff National Park called Yamnuska, which translates to ""wall of stone."" For those of you who haven’t heard of this place before, it’s an intermediate/advanced hike that requires roughly 5 hours and has an elevation of 7,350 feet. There are various points in the hike that require either scrambling or technical climbing. Scrambling is where you literally claw your way up the side of the mountain. On this particular trail, the trail was covered in loose gravel. It was slightly terrifying to find handholds that slipped away entirely as loose gravel scrambled down from the spot you just attempted to grab. On the way down, every step you take causes you to slide down the path a few feet as you dig into the slope, praying that you will eventually stop for long enough to take the next step down. As someone who had never undertook anything as daunting as this expedition before, I struggled at multiple points in the climb. For example, there is a section of the climb where you grab onto a metal chain and edge your way along the side of a cliff. I tried not to look down, as I am terrified of heights. There were a number of takeaways that became reinforced in my mind from this lovely experience: My Canadian friends and my sister that I hiked with were all more experienced than me, and stayed ahead for most of the trail. By observing how they navigated tricky spots, I was able to get past a number of hurdles that I would not be able to get past on my own. One particularly dangerous spot had a nearly vertical drop in between a few footholds. A kind stranger (my angel) noticed me silently panicking and outstretched his arm to me once he had crossed to the other side. We took the long way down, and veered off the poorly-marked trail. After getting hopelessly lost around the 7-hour mark, it was beginning to get dark, and we began to passionately debate which way to go. Fortunately we had cell signal and someone in our group called park emergency services. They were able to direct us back onto the trail. We had ascended the mountain fairly quickly, however that was less than half the battle, and what we weren’t prepared for was how difficult it would be or long it would take to gradually make our way down the mountain. However, we finally made it out alive after a total of nine hours, dehydrated and drained from what seemed like an endless day."
Medium.com,Life,A Pilgrimage to Celtic Roots,Travel,https://medium.com/@anna.rowlands26/a-pilgrimage-to-celtic-roots-8bcf457746fa?source=topic_page---------546------------------1," I am on a pilgrimage. A journey to connect with my heritage and my family history. This pilgrimage has been inspired by my exploration of ritual and ceremony and this, in turn, has been inspired by the fact that I am bringing a new life into the world. A sapling branch is being added to our family tree and I am on my rite of passage towards motherhood. Now is the time to search for my roots. And my roots, it turns out, predominantly reside in Wales. I have lived in the South West for many years, so close to Wales I can almost smell the laverbread. Yet I have never explored my ancestral lineage over the border. Why have I evaded it for so long? I have come to realise recently that I have felt a pervading sense of guilt around having conversations about our family tree, because of the dynamic of our tiny unit. Adoption has been the elephant in the room for my entire life and as such there has been a subtle vortex within which my family just haven’t felt it right or fair to discuss what preceded us. In this freshly-evolving chapter of my life as a mother I feel I have a new-found the right to embrace where I came from. I have something of meaning and importance to focus on that comes from a place of joy and love, and I feel equipped to override the command for total sensitivity around this subject of heritage. I want to shout it loud and proud from the valley tops — I am Celtic! So here I am, me and my womb-cocooned Babe, leaving Bristol on our mini pilgrimage. I depart in our trusty Skoda steed — its’ first big outing since my partner and I purchased it last week, bringing with it new-found freedom. I cross the Prince of Wales bridge, a gateway to what I hope to be a deeper understanding of self, over the border. Entering into Wales I spot my first sight of the fabled red dragon, and I am reminded of the rich Celtic tradition that my lineage weaves into. So many mystical and magical tales of fairies, goddesses and goblins. As I drive I ask myself “what do I want from this journey?” A few responses emerge. I have a desire to know who I am and to know more about my identity as a sentient being living on this planet; to know where I hail from; to get a sense of the lives of my elders; to take up space in my story; and take on the mantle of my Celtic traditions. I am interested in what those traditions mean for me, and perhaps how they have existed and presented in my life already, without me even realising it. I am stepping into a sense of pride around a strong Welsh history, from both my maternal and paternal side. An exchange, the masculine and feminine, the yin and yang; two elements of my spirit represented by a fiercely patriotic country. First stop is Morriston in Swansea, the home of my maternal grandmother, Edna “Tommy” Wilkinson, née Thomas. Tommy was one of many siblings in her family, the children of two brothers whom her mother married. Half siblings and cousins, all at once. They were a typical working class family, living through wartime and existing on relatively little. That same sense of working class grit still exists on the streets of Morriston. I wandered along the high street trying to get a feel for the place (and to frequent one or many of the charity shops I’d spotted on the way in…). Dilapidated hairdressers and chip shops sit amongst brightly lit Wilkos and betting establishments. I picked up some Welsh male choir records and sifted through the clothes and brick-a-brac. You can always get a sense of a place from the wares within the walls of the resident charity shops. I returned to Market Street, my Nana’s street, taking in the row of beige, pebble-dash houses and a huge, derelict shell of an old building, with wide open windows housing multiple pigeon kits. Nana’s house, number 34, was sadly no longer there. But opposite where it used to stand was a church and a small patch of green space with five maple trees standing tall. At first it didn’t seem like much of a place, there was some desolate graffiti on the wall and a few empty beer cans strewn about. But the longer I stayed there, the more magical it felt. Wind rushes rustled the green leaves of the trees and the sunshine filtered through, dappling the grass and a small colony of mushrooms. I sat leaning against one of the old trees, breathing deep, holding my baby and imagining my Nana as a small girl, running and playing amongst the green with her brothers and sisters. As I started my meditation, the wind in the leaves gathered pace and the sound became all-encompassing. It felt like the invisible spirits of my ancestors were present, emanating from the trees, delighting in my deep connection with the space. As I closed my meditation, they rustled loud once more. Communication felt palpable. I took photos, wrote some thoughts down and gathered a stick and some leaves to take with me, to place in my home. I journeyed on, driving through the lush Welsh countryside from Swansea to Borth. This trip took up the rest of the sunlight hours, and the ride was stunning. Tall, pink and purple flowers whispered and floated, hazily leaning out towards the road and passing cars. I arrived in Borth, a small town on the Western coast, after the sun had set. Catching glimpses of the sea on the drive had been breathtaking, and my descent into Borth halted me in my tracks and turned me around to find a parking spot so I could capture a video of the dark sky and the dim lights of the dusky town. After I had parked the car and dumped my bags in my B&B I took a walk on the sea front. The weather forecast for the following day signalled heavy rain so I wanted to make the most of the clear night. The wind was energising after my long drive, and the ocean was wild. I stood within a circle of rocks that I had stumbled upon at the shore, embracing the fresh sea air. I asked the waves to support my own ocean crossing, when it’s time to give birth to my baby, to afford me the strength and vulnerability to fully surrender to the surging waves of labour. A dear friend had informed me that there would be a full moon that evening, but the clouds on the east seemed stormy and brewing. It was late and I was flagging, so I decided to leave the ocean front and head back to my abode for the night. I was almost at the door when I noticed a light behind the clouds. The sea wind had subsided and the night suddenly felt exquisitely serene. I knew that the moon was the source of that mystical illumination behind the clouds, and I willed the darkness to give way. I skulked around in the darkness and then, as if hearing my call, the moon emerged, a glowing goddess hanging effortlessly in the night sky. The full moon! The culmination of a lunar cycle, symbolising changing times, shedding glorious light on the things we no longer need to hold onto. I rested on these thoughts, as the moon gazed down on me and my baby. I felt the urge to let go of the limiting belief that I am not a spiritual being, that this is something that I do not truly understand, or have a right to. I embraced the feeling that my babe and I are indeed divine beings, connected with mother nature in beautiful and mystical ways, ways that I had noticed throughout the day. I believe that our child will arrive on the eve of the full moon in November and this incredible encounter with the goddess moon, who soon after this moment submerged back to her resting place beneath the dark clouds, seemed to communicate an understanding of this wish. Whether she will grant the wish remains to be seen. The following day came around, and with it came the rain. Lots and lots of rain. The type of relentless, intense, soaking rain that one could only expect from the Welsh valleys during UK summer time. The weather was so intensely wet from the minute I woke that I contemplated abandoning the ancestral mission altogether. The prospect of heading back to my cosy house in Bristol was extremely appealing as the wipers thrashed violently against the windscreen. But then, a thought. Could I find some meaning, some symbolism in this weather shift? From the sunshine and blue skies of yesterday, affording me a calm, serene connection with my maternal line in sleepy back roads of a working class town. To last night’s blustery rendezvous with the full moon for me and the Babe. And finally today’s wild, wet storm slanting across the dramatic landscape of hills, lakes and valleys, my paternal line. A serenity in the maternal; divine beauty in the unborn; a wild and raw nature in the paternal. The full spectrum! Representing different parts of my identity and my journey. Yes, everything has a meaning, if you look at it with intention. On my way into the wild Welsh valleys I listened to a podcast about Brigid, goddess of fertility, healing and poetry (amongst many other things) and Imbolc, a festival marking the beginning of Spring. It felt apt exploring the increasingly raw landscapes whilst consuming tales of traditional Celtic deities and celebrations along with songs praising a goddess of new life and arts. An immersive journey indeed. Arriving in the humble village of Abergynolwyn, a beaming smile crossed my face. The ancient, towering hills peered over the tiny village into which generations of the Rowlands family had breathed their lives. The wisdom of the valleys was pervasive, as had been the wisdom of the trees in Morriston. I felt protected by them as I searched for my Grandpa’s childhood home, 22 Llanegryn. I found it. A simple house close to a public house called The Railway, named after the small train that chugs through the valleys. I went into the pub, and discovered that it is 250 years old. Surely this is where my ancestors would have sat of an evening, after a long day at work. Photos from the early 1900s were hanging around the room. Perhaps my grandmothers or fathers were friends with those in the scenes outside the ancient pub…perhaps they were even in the photos themselves. My last stop on this journey was the fabled graveyard where generations of Rowlands family members are buried. I drove around for some time trying to locate it until I found it, tucked away alongside the road leading out of the village, on the edge of a steep hill. Those vast, valley guardians looking down in their protective stance once more. The rain was still hammering and I was acutely aware that I only had one pair of shoes, and they were already very soggy. Screw it — this is what I had come for! This was my time to step out into the unknown and answer the calls of my ancestors! I jumped out of the car and into the graveyard, wasting no time scrambling up and across the grassy verge to find my treasured family name on the headstones. And so, I spent the next ten minutes, in the driving wind and rain, clambering around, frantically reading headstones in a graveyard, six months pregnant, probably looking like I had totally lost the plot. Maybe I had. And maybe getting lost, with my ancient guardians looking down on me, is exactly where I need to be right now."
Medium.com,Life,End Game: 15 Travel Tips for a Great Adventure,Travel,https://medium.com/elephant-daily/end-game-15-travel-tips-for-a-great-adventure-d6399c331cd7?source=topic_page---------547------------------1," The end game of your travel pitfalls has come! Hooray! Seven to fourteen days are too short to fail the trip of your dreams. Therefore, seat back and read on these 15 travel tips that will help you have that great adventure. I
nvestigate your destination airport, learn the routes from the airport to the center of the city, research the bus-stops and prices, and get to know everything that falls between your airport and the hotel or the place you’re going to stay at. Remember: Getting to the destination airport is not your goal, but getting to the hotel or your staying location is. Therefore, make sure you have everything up and running way before you spend all of your money on a taxi. In
the world of credit cards it is a wise decision to have some cash with you in the local currency where you are traveling to. That money can be needed for bus, train, underground, water, or any other emergency when you will not have a chance to make a purchase with a credit card. L
ately I have been traveling to Italy where people talk very little English. That was a problem since I was traveling alone and I needed to get by somehow till I would unite with my Italian-speaking friend. The language itself does not have much similarities with my native language, therefore, I did some research and took a note of those in the memo of my smartphone. Here are some of the phrases I learned: Ciao! or Salve! — Hi! or Goodbye! Buongiorno! — Good morning! or Good day! Bonasera , Bonaserata — Good evening! Bonanotte! — Good night Grazie (mille) — Thank you (very much) Prego — Please or You’re welcome! Skuza — Excuse me Dove …? — Where is …? (If you want to know where the underground is, you would say “Dove metro?” [Pardon me, if this is grammatically wrong, but this was a tip to find my way and everybody understood me]) Allora — So, then, well, indicating Hmm, Ugh, Gee. (This was just for fun though.) Cinque -Five. Also look into other numbers from one to ten. This especially helps during cash transactions and shopping. If you cannot remember these phrases, then write them down and keep those close to you. I use my phone memo as I mentioned before. If
you don’t do your trip homework before the departure day, that’s an end game. Way in advance, research the cities you want to visit in the country, learn what are the important sights that you have to see, read about the cultural specificities, as well as national cuisine. All of these initial research will help you save time on non-vital visits and will provide a productive trip which will turn into a great adventure. Referring back to my trip to Italy, I toured to Verona for one day and number1 visit-places were the mini Coliseum and the statute of Juliette (and her balcony of course). T
he like-minded companion to travel with is as vital as a good playlist or a book when you are on the wheels. Why? Because if they do not have the same travel-mind as yours, you will get bored, stressed, and the journey will turn into a nightmare. I was pretty lucky to choose my best friend to travel with. We both like walking a lot and walking fast, exploring architecture and culture, trying some new food and drinks, spending less money, and getting the most of our short journey. G
reat pictures are the key part of your great adventure especially when you want to collect memories and revisit them later. Having someone to travel with who can take great pictures of you is a blessing. However, if you don’t have someone like this, don’t get too hard on yourself. Adjust your camera on the view and position you want your picture to be taken, and ask someone passing by to take a pic of you. When you show them what you want, they tend to make better pictures. Ask to take at least 5 shots and change your poses meanwhile. You will have good range to choose from in the end. S
ome places, pieces of art, parts of an architecture or even your hotel room stick to your mind and you want to go back to them after your leave. Therefore, take random pictures of things, places or people that matter to you and would draw a smile on your face when you go back to them later. Remember: Never post these pictures on social media because people won’t understand the depth of your emotions attached to them. That would do nothing less than distorting the value those pictures have for you. Of
course, you should try the cuisine and all the gorgeous food that comes up to you when you travel. but remember, the more you walk, the more you will see, and the more you will explore. This is number 1 goal in your travel, isn’t it? No?! You wanted only some rest? Oh, come on. You should visit places, you will have rest on the weekend. S
ince we agreed that you’ll walk a lot, you’ll need a truly comfy pair of shoes. Make sure you have something fancy that gives you good look when taking pictures, but also make sure, that they’re super comfy. Tip #2: wear layers. You never know what might come up — wind, sun, too much sun. The weather forecast doesn’t prepare us for the little shifts during the day. Jacket is a savior. Make sure you can fold it and put into your bag. L
et’s say you have been walking for 20km-s yesterday and you’re going to do the same today and tomorrow. Your night sleep, which I bet can never be 7–8 hours while you’re on a trip, won’t be enough. Therefore, while you’re riding to your destination, try to take naps but make sure not to miss the view outside the window. What to do? Set your alarm clock to wake you up in15–20 minutes. S
ome people tend to buy just souvenirs in order to put it on their fridge, and brag about they travel to this or that country. Don’t do it that simple! Don’t buy the city-center souvenirs, but buy the ones that you have visited and give you special memories about that particular monument or place in a city. T
his one might sound cliche but it requires some initial research. Watch your health as well — be weary of any allergens or other dietary supplements that are not good for you. W
hen I was younger, I used to buy stuff while traveling. The point was just getting something from abroad. It would suffice if that something was a bit fit. Shouldn’t have been perfect. Now that I’m older, I know, you can buy even a few more things while you’re traveling, but make sure that’s something special and you don’t have it back home. Y
our trip can be full of ups and downs. The key is to see the half-filled cup full all the time. See a life-lesson or a happy moment in every incidence that happens to you. This way of looking at things will help you decrease street and collect funny memories from your trip. A
lcohol makes you forget things while your goal during traveling is to remember every single moment. Also, alcohol makes you sick and causes headache. Final verdict: sleep well, walk a lot, stay hydrated, and remain sober while traveling. Ow, and don’t forget your power bank."

isten, the Amazon is burning, the world is full of terrible people, reading the news is a disaster, and Donald Trump is president. What the hell are you waiting for? I think a lot of the time, as humans, overwhelmed with everything that is going on, we tend to hold back on doing the things that we actually want to do, like travel and experience new things. I’m here to tell you to go, book the trip, there is no time like the present, especially if you are young. I have been talking about going to Bali for years; what a dream, a tropical island that costs little to nothing to hang out on, and it’s only a very, very long plane ride away. It’s tangible, it’s a real thing you can do — visit the most beautiful places on earth. Often I won’t book a trip because of the money, I’m an overthinker so I don’t want to just jump the gun. What if I lose my job? What if I die on the plane? What if, what if? What if I never experience anything because I am too busy over analyzing every single decision I make? I’m done overanalyzing and here’s why you should be to: There is so much going on all the time right now and very little room to actually breath and enjoy yourself. Frankly, if we don’t take time to take breaks we’re all going to be miserable, exhausted wrecks. Having a little bit of credit card debt, in order to experience amazing things, is a great trade off. I can tell you right now that going on a dream vacation is not going to be something that you sit and think about way down the line, wondering if you should have just stayed home. The point is, you don’t have forever. You have right now. The older you get, the more attached you are to your creature comforts, the more responsibility you have, the less likely you are to take the trip. So take it now. I just booked my trip to Bali, after debating about it for two years. A little bit of panic set in, and then I realized — who cares?! Is this going to be something I regret doing? Or is travelling going to be something that inspires me, changes my view on life, and allows me to connect with my husband for a little while. We can finally take a break, and you should too. Prices to travel are extremely inexpensive right now, you can go to Paris for $139 dollars. If you don’t want to go to Paris, go somewhere else — but stop holding back because you think that spending the money is a bad idea. I’m telling you, it isn’t. When have you ever regretted a vacation? As human beings, I think that it is time that we let go and allow ourselves to have new, amazing experiences. Pretty soon, it will be too late. Don’t wait, book the damn trip."
Medium.com,Life,Slow travel: Khiva and the origins of the word Algorithm,Travel,https://medium.com/@mauricioruiz_2804/slow-travel-khiva-and-the-origins-of-the-word-algorithm-94d29014e330?source=topic_page---------550------------------1," For a period of my life, back when my voice was high-pitched and I cared about nothing except hard-rock music and whether girls were glancing at me, I had to carry a thick book of algebra to school. Twice a week I was instructed to bring it to math class even if the teacher, a pot-bellied man with tiny spectacles pinned to the tip of his nose and who called each student by a number, rarely opened it. The book was written by Aurelio Baldor, a prominent Cuban mathematician whose work continues to be used in schools in the Spanish-speaking world to this day. On the right hand side of the cover appears the image of a bearded man with large observant eyes and thin feline features, his red and yellow robe matching his neatly tight turban — its fabric seems to have dozens of minuscule folds. Behind him lies a city with buildings the color of sand. On the left hand side a minaret rises, as well as a dome of what could be a mosque or a madrassah (school). It intrigued me, the image of the studious man overlooking the yellowish city on a clear day, his introspective gaze almost an invitation to ask: What problem are you trying to solve? His name was visible on the bottom right, inscribed on a twisting parchment: Al-Juarismi. The details of his life remained obscure to me, however, and after finishing middle school I forgot all about the turbaned man, except on those occasions at the end a family get-together, usually on a Sunday, when I’d see my younger cousins dragging their feet to their desks then plump down on a chair to work on their equations. As I enter the Ota-Darvoza Gate (Father’s Gate) of the walled city of Khiva (Ichon-Kala), in the province of Khorezm in Western Uzbekistan, I have to stop. The sky is pristine, the air dry, but even with a baseball hat and sunglasses on, the heat is pounding. The walls of the fortified town run meters and meters, and in the distance a minaret rises to the sky. Behind a large map of the town, I find the statue of man sitting on a bench, leaning to the side over a manuscript, his face deep in thought. “That’s Al-Khwarizmi,” a young woman with a badge hanging from her neck says to me. “Did you know that the word algorithm is derived from his name?” I assume she’s a tour guide and welcome the information she’s offering. She explains that his name was Muhammad ibn Musa al-Khwarizmi, a scholar born in this region around 780 CE. In one of his treatises, The Compendious Book on Calculation by Completion and Balancing, he postulated a solution of linear and quadratic equations. “He was an astronomer and geographer, a respected man who moved to the court in Baghdad,” she says. “Many believe he’s the founder of algebra.” After she’s left I stand there for a moment. Under the heat I look at the concentrated look on his face, the folds on his turban sculpted in bronze. Leaning over the manuscript, a hand on his chin, he seems to be wrestling with a long-standing mathematical enemy. For a moment I imagine all the intellectual activity that must have occurred in this town centuries back, the thinkers and philosophers that lived and studied here, their desire to understand the world. Besides Al-Khwarizmi, the great mathematician Al-Biruni and the physician Ibn-Sina (Avicenna) studied in Khorezm at the Mamun Academy, named after the two brothers, Hassan and Abbas, who organized assemblies in the XI century to foster the exchange of ideas. By Davide Mauro — Own work, CC BY-SA 4.0 My stay in Khiva was short but I was able to get a feel for the place. At the start of the 20th century there were 65 madrassahs in Khiva, 54 of them within the Ichon-Kala. The Khanate of Khiva lasted until 1920 when the last Khan, Abdullah Khan, abdicated and the Khorezm People’s Soviet Republic was created. This republic lasted until 1923, when the short-lived Khorezm Socialist Soviet Republic (SSR) came into being on October 20th. Seven days later, part of Khorezm was integrated into the Uzbek SSR, while the rest became part of the Autonomous Karakalpak Region and the Turkmen SSR. Due to its well preserved monuments and buildings, the Ichon-Kala of Khiva was included in the list of UNESCO World Cultural Heritage in 1990. There are 51 ancient monumental structures and nearly 250 preserved dwellings including the madrasahs of Alla-Kulli-Khan, Muhammad Aminkhon, Muhammad Rakhimkhon, the Mausoleums of Pahlavon Mahmoud, Sayid Allavuddin, Shergozikhon as well as several caravanserays. From Tashkent one can get to Khiva either flying to Urgench, a city located 40 km west of Khiva, or by train. Train tickets cost anything between 18 to 36 euros, and the trip takes 11 hours with one change in Bukhara. I spend the afternoon getting lost in the web of narrow streets and alleyways, speaking with merchants and craftswomen. All over Khiva I see dozens and dozens of Chugirmachiliks, the fur hats typical of the Khorezm region. It is supposed to keep the head cool in hot summer days, and warm in cold days. Dozens of patterned silk scarfs hang in the wind next to embroidered tablecloths and bed covers. Colorful plates and teapots lie in the sun. Traditional woodcarving has an old and rich history here, and some of the most beautiful examples of it can be seen inside the Juma Mosque (Friday Mosque), perhaps my favorite place in Khiva. The mosque has an inner courtyard with a handful of benches around it. After showing my ticket at the door a feeling of peace washed over me. I stood there for a moment watching a thin veil of light pouring in at an angle and illuminating the floor. Only the murmur of a tour guide speaking to a couple can be heard. Lines and lines of wooden columns — 213 in total — give a feeling of depth and perspective all around. Called karagacha, the elm columns have delicate sinuous patterns carved on them. Only four of the original karagacha remain. Before sunset I decided to climb the 120 steps to the top of the Islam Khoja Minaret, built in 1910 and nearly 60 meters tall. It is a narrow staircase and the steps seem to have been made for giants — they are very high — but the 360 degree view of the town is well worth the effort. As for the local food, I tasted the Shivit Oshi or dill-infused noodles. The melons from Khorezm, in all its varieties (Gurvak, Kari Kiz, Bol Kovun) are juicy and fragrant, while the pears, which are as tiny as a hummingbird, seem to flap their sweet wings of flavor in your mouth. During the trip I had the chance to meet David Hoffmann, an extraordinary food vlogger from Miami, adventurous and full of energy, with whom I shared a plates of rice pilaf, roasted peppers and marinated lamb. Seated at the table, we raised our glasses of vodka and toasted to the scents and flavors of Uzbek hospitality."
Medium.com,Life,Socially Anxious and Alone in the Big Apple,Travel,https://medium.com/@pizzokristen/socially-anxious-and-alone-in-the-big-apple-8ac76ecafad?source=topic_page---------551------------------1," While alone in New York City, in search of someplace to spend the late evening hours, somewhere to laugh or to drink or to dance, I found myself wandering into Oscar Wilde, a Victorian-themed bar. As soon as I grasped the golden mermaid door handles, I knew I was entering the Disney World of bars. From the decor to the writing-themed cocktails on the menu, no detail was left out. Every inch of the walls was covered in picture frames, clocks, and lamps. Dazzling chandeliers hung overhead, statues stood perched on the counters, and even the beer was pulled from gold and marble taps. I geeked out over Oscar Wilde’s quotes, which, like Easter eggs, were found in every nook and cranny, wrapped around the bar under the countertops, framed on the walls, and spoken over a speaker in the exquisitely-decorated ladies’ room. The immersive-ness of the themed experience distracted me from the fact that I was all alone on a Friday night in an immensely crowded bar. It took a good fifteen minutes for me to order because I am not one to aggressively force my way into a sliver of space at the bar or to loudly attempt to grab the attention of a bartender who isn’t aware that I exist. I got a few stares as I weaved through the crowds alone, trying not to spill my nearly overflowing (and certainly overpriced) “Pale Princess” grapefruit gin cocktail. I made it to a separate area full of tables, where I suppose they serve food in the earlier hours of the day. There was a fireplace with teacups on the mantle. I felt like I was in someone’s parlor, which I suppose was the point. My table was my island, away from the crowds. I figured sitting at a table alone looked far less pathetic than standing in the middle of the room by myself. As I sipped my bittersweet drink and texted my best friend, I wished I were back in Ireland, where I spent my spring break. Not only would I have my friend Mykal by my side, who was so sociable she could spark a conversation with even the most intimidating stranger, I would also be in a friendlier place. Everyone in Dublin seemed to acknowledge that they were walking the earth among fellow human beings who had interesting stories, hopes, and dreams. To them, it seemed that people weren’t strangers to be avoided but potential friends to be made. I had received so many compliments on my hair (not of the catcalling variety) and everywhere we went, people made us feel as if we were someone they genuinely cared to know. This bar wasn’t like that. Everyone was here with friends and coworkers. No one was going to save me from my isolation. It wasn’t like in grade school where teachers advised us to approach the lonely kids at recess or in the cafeteria. This was the real adult world. I was twenty-one years old. My social anxiety was something I had to own and get over if I ever wanted anything. So I decided to venture back out into the battlefield (i.e, the middle of the bar). I found a pedestal next to a pillar, serving as a makeshift table without chairs. I figured I wouldn’t be taking up too much space if I set my drink there and just people-watched. I hoped I could assume my usual role of a wallflower, among the gilded accents and paintings. But I also longed to make a connection with someone, anyone. I wished I had Mykal’s smooth conversation skills. She didn’t know how to just flirt — she would make friends with anyone, from the bartenders to women in line waiting to be screened before entering a club. She was the perfect yin to my yang, because she was never afraid of bothering anyone, and I didn’t know how to not be afraid. Not ten minutes later, two men and a woman approached my pedestal and asked if they could set their drinks down. “Of course!” I said as warmly and jubilantly as possible because I feel I always have to overcompensate for what people tell me is a serious case of resting bitch face that makes me unapproachable. I figured they would simply set their glasses down and continue on conversing as a group, but instead, they struck up a conversation with me. As soon as one of the men, a tall, pale, blond, blue-eyed guy of about twenty-five, spoke and I heard what had become a familiar accent, I realized that my wish had, in some way been granted. The comical coincidence of walking into a bar themed around an Irish writer alone thinking, “If only I were in Ireland, then someone would talk to me” and then suddenly finding myself making friends with tourists from Ireland had me feeling quite, well, lucky. It turns out, you don’t have to be a social butterfly to enjoy solo travel in a big city. You just have to be willing to share space with strangers."

rom Glasgow to the Scottish island of Jura it’s half-an-hour by helicopter. Not having one of those at my disposal, though, it takes me most of the day to get there. First, a large bus winding along moody lochs and around mountains to Kennacraig. Then the big CalMac ferry to Port Askaig on Islay — which is little more than a pier, a pub and a hotel. And then another, much smaller ferry that battles swift currents to deposit me at the lonely jetty at Feolin. A bus is meant to take me to my final destination on the island, but I can’t spot it. There’s a minivan with “Corporate Tours” emblazoned on the side that I assume is there to collect tourists. Only once it has departed and there’s no sign of any other vehicle that I realised that must’ve been it. I board the vehicle when it returns an hour later, one of only a handful of passengers — mostly children who attend the high school on Islay. The 25-mile journey northwards gives me a sense of the island: moors and peat bogs, secluded bays, the soaring breast-shaped Pap mountains, an occasional cottage. Finally, about two-thirds up this narrow finger of an island, I reach Ardlussa: a deer-stalking estate and working farm owned by Andy Fletcher and his wife, Claire, with a large, ancient manor at its heart. I’d stumbled across it on the UK website of Worldwide Opportunities on Organic Farms, which connects volunteers with opportunities to work on British farms in exchange for food and lodging. For a long time, the Scottish islands had intrigued me — their remoteness, their austere beauty. For a freelance writer on a tight budget, I figured two weeks working on a farm at the edge of the sea was a great way of getting an authentic taste of island life. And boy, was I right. Every morning, I don Wellington boots and walk the Fletchers’ two dogs. Then, a cup of tea back in the house’s cosy kitchen before the hard graft begins — three hours in the morning and three in the afternoon, with a break for homemade soup and fresh-baked rolls between. There is plenty to be done. It’s spring — calving season — and while the four Fletcher children can be relied on to do odd jobs and assorted feedings, Andy and the assistant estate manager are the farm’s only full-time pair of hands. Occasionally I’m roped in to help herd adorably dim-witted cows into muddy pens or corral sheep into pasture — a team effort. But much of the time, I’m on my own. There is weeding in the greenhouse, where I shovel clods of weed-choked soil onto the wheelbarrow, pushing this to the compost heap when it’s full. In a ramshackle shed nicknamed the Crystal Palace, I heave chunks of pine to the juddering petrol-fuelled wood splitter. There’s the satisfying hiss as the blade slices into the wood, and thuds as the pieces fell to the floor. The scent of pine resin, sharp and sweet, stains the dank air. I’m in forest-fragranced heaven as I pick up the logs and chuck them onto a slowly-expanding pile. One rainy morning, I dig a ditch into the side of a hill, slicing into thick, slurpy mud with a spade so that the water streaming downwards is redirected away from the road below. Another morning, I walk down to a storm-scoured cove and collect clumps of rotting seaweed to be used as a natural fertiliser. While I work, I also pick up sackfuls of rubbish that have washed ashore — a bounty that includes rope, fishing tackle and heaps of plastic. Predictably, it rains a lot. There’s also a brief snowstorm, followed by dazzling sunshine. Slightly shocked, I wear sunglasses and strip down to a T-shirt to perform my most important task: juniper planting. In 2015, along with two other local women, Claire Fletcher co-founded Lussa Gin, an artisanal distillery which operates out of the old stables on the estate. While juniper — the most important of the gin’s 15 botanicals — is currently sourced from elsewhere, it is Fletcher’s hope that in time they’ll be able to use a homegrown crop. In a nutrient-rich former cattle pen, I lay down plastic sheeting which is meant to protect the plants and prevent weeds from growing up. Then, with an increasingly muddy pair of scissors, I stab the sheet, digging with a trowel through the slit, before placing a spindly juniper bushel into the hole I’ve carved. I’m worried that I’m doing it wrong — that the roots will be too squished once I’ve covered them with soil again. Claire seems confident, however, that they’ll survive. “They’re tough — these plants have been around since the Ice Age,” she says reassuringly. Crouched down for hours, planting, is hard work. Occasionally, I stretch my aching back, pausing to admire the mainland’s purple and yellow hills and the milky teal of choppy sea which separates them from me. Spots of rain appear on my waterproofs, while I remain snug and dry underneath. By the late afternoon, I’m fairly exhausted. I soak in the huge bath (an enormous luxury as back home, Cape Town is still fending off the effects of prolonged drought). Even after scrubbing my fingernails, there is still dirt under them. I don’t mind — I wear it as a badge of honour. Claire is an excellent cook. Dinner, shared with the family, is typically something hearty — a Spanish omlette, for example, or chilli con carne, washed down with a nice glass of red. Sometimes I’ll join them afterwards to watch TV by a crackling fire. Then I retire to bed with book. On the weekends, when I’m free to do as I like, I go on long, solitary walks. I make a pilgrimage to Barnhill, an isolated cottage where George Orwell wrote 1984 – not long before dying of tuberculosis. I also tramp across squidgy peat bogs to the windswept western side of the island where a rustic cottage — known as a bothy — offers a free sanctuary for overnighting hikers. I stumble across a wild goat and her kid — two of roughly 500 that dot the island. No one is totally sure how they ended up here — one myth suggests that their ancestors were left here when the Spanish galleons carrying them got shipwrecked on Jura’s rocky shore. I poke my head inside I visit Jura’s only village, Craighouse, where most of the island’s 230 residents live. In addition to its handful of houses, primary school and a community-owned grocer, Craighouse is also home to the Jura Distillery, where the island’s eponymous whisky is made. The Filipino conglomerate which owns it has recently redesigned Jura’s bottle to make it more enticing to the American market, elongating its once distinctive, squat shape. The flavour profile has changed too — across the main range there are now hints of the peatiness so typical of the whiskies on neighbouring Islay. All this change has caused consternation among some of the islanders, who grumble about it being a sell-out. In the village’s only pub, affixed to its only hotel, a local lass is celebrating her birthday. People are friendly, and the drams of whisky I order soon put me at ease. There’s live music and singing, followed by dancing. Amidst the din, a scruffy building contractor from the mainland informs me, with a knowing look, that there are lots of single women on Jura. Clearly, he doesn’t realise that I’m gay, and I don’t feel all that comfortable in enlightening him. I’m less reticent when the island’s bricklayer asks if I have a girlfriend, though. He’s impressed by the frankness of my admission. (I, too, have surprised myself — I blame the whisky.) Clearly attitudes here are changing — but it’s always difficult to gauge exactly by how much. Sunday evening. Back at Ardlussa, the new-leaved trees are silhouetted against pale blue sky. I leave the Fletcher family clustered around the TV, and walk down the lane to take photos. The sea is mirror-calm. My fortnight on Jura has ended far quicker than I wanted it to. I’ve felt at home and content here in a way that feels almost uncanny. Physical labour is tough: frequently tiring and occasionally boring. Still, I’ve found it hugely rewarding. There’s been the sheer bliss of being of spending days outside in the country, by the sea — and far away from the noisy, frantic bustle of urban life and digital distraction. Here, in this decidedly analogue world, I’ve had the satisfaction of seeing physical changes as a result of my efforts — whether its rows and rows of juniper I’ve planted, or a ditch that I’ve dug. Much as I love my writing day-job, I’ve relished being away from a screen, doing a day’s work with my body, not my mind. This way of life is new but, at some deep, wordless level, profoundly familiar. Maybe I’ve been communing with all the generations before me who worked the land — as recently as my late grandfather. When duty called in World War Two, he, a pacifist, took up plough and tractor instead of gun and tank, helping to feed wartime Britain. Me planting juniper might not be as noble. But still — it’s a way of being a bit closer, a bit more connected, to the parts of me that were formed by the past. The parts of me most at home in an outside, rural, analogue world. A Jura resident told me that most people who come to the island are escaping something. Did I come here to run away? No, not really. The past two weeks have felt like I’ve been running towards myself. Towards the kind of life I’d like to live: one with more nature and less screen-time; more meaningful moments grounded in the present, and fewer superficial and superfluous distractions. On my last morning, as I climb aboard the little bus that will take me to the ferry, I feel a wrenching. The ensuing ache lingers for longer, even, than the stubborn dirt under my fingernails."
Medium.com,Life,Seeking Marjorie,Travel,https://medium.com/@stephliv/seeking-marjorie-28399a91ac25?source=topic_page---------553------------------1," Exploring the natural world of one of America’s renowned rural writers A woman in a white-striped blouse sits in an old wooden chair and poses for a photograph: Her hand reaches out to pet a black and white spotted hunting hound. Behind her, palm trees and Southern spruce grow like jungle in Florida’s interior scrub land. Her expression is soft, but there is an intensity isolated to her eyes as if she sees something no one else does. I stood in the parlor of Marjorie Kinnan Rawlings’ home, now a state park and museum, contemplating the photo hanging on the wall. It was a sweltering day, but inside the house was unexpectedly cool thanks to the ‘cracker’ design — high roofs and large windows — popular in the heartland of Florida before centralized air conditioning. I imagined it was a similar day as the one when Rawlings posed for the photograph; the kind of breezeless hot when everything, except for the mosquitos, seems to stand still. Rawlings is a major figure in Florida’s literary tradition, a tradition that includes the likes of William Bartram and John Muir. Her Remington typewriter with its worn keys still sits on a front porch table at her home next to a pack of Lucky Strikes. Cross Creek is a small hamlet just outside of Gainesville surrounded by two lakes, Orange Lake and Lake Lochloosa. Rawlings moved from Rochester, New York to Cross Creek in 1928 when she bought the house and accompanying orange grove. It was between Orange Lake and the town’s namesake slow-moving brown creek that she found inspiration for her greatest works. Rawlings recognized water as the community’s connecting force, as it still is today. Much of Cross Creek looks the same as it did when Rawlings lived and wrote there. Crossing over the creek into the town, one sees a couple of new additions: campgrounds and a restaurant named The Yearling, after Rawlings’ popular novel. Locals pulled into the restaurant parking lot with canoes and airboats attached to pickup trucks at 5 p.m. on a Friday afternoon. A silence stuck to the air as people chattered softly about the day’s catch. “Five bass and three speckled perch,” a white-haired man in overalls said to another wearing khakis and an aged fedora. Nobody was in a hurry to be anywhere else. A hill near the restaurant slopes down to Cross Creek’s edge. At the bottom was several large swamp cypress, Taxodium distichum, their trunks hard and sprawling, like bones from the earth breaking through the surface, then splintering towards the sky. Houses on stilts blend into the trees. It was the originators of this water way of life, the Florida Crackers, that inspired Rawlings. “Not many people know she was a naturalist,” said Rick Mulligan before he toured a small group through Rawlings’ home. “It’s evident in her writings. She noticed details in nature that nobody else did and revealed a mysticism in it all.” Mulligan pulled at his suspenders as he talked about Rawlings’ relationship with the Florida crackers. She often stopped them as they passed on the dirt road in front of her house, returning from Orange Lake with their sacks of fish, he said. She learned how they lived off the land, and how water shaped their lifestyle and their survival. It connected everyone via a water-induced culture, she soon discovered. In Gordon Bigelow’s “Frontier Eden,” he calls living along the banks of Cross Creek “a fringe of life.” The Florida scrub, he writes, is “a vast wall, keeping out the timid and the alien.” Rawlings was anything but timid, living alone in the Florida backwoods alone for decades. She rejected being called an outsider or a “Yankee” by locals. For her, the backwoods were a single system. And once there, she was absorbed into its cosmos, becoming part of an interconnected life force. But Cross Creek belonged to no one, not even herself. She writes in her autobiography: “Cross Creek belongs to the wind and the rain, to the sun and the seasons, to the cosmic secrecy of seed, and beyond all, to time” Past six in the evening, the humidity had not abated. On the bridge, a boy tossed fishing line into murky water below. Looking west down the bank, Cross Creek was running into the setting sun, glistening like river trout. I walked up to the bridge and peered down into the creek, riffling softly beneath the water oaks and brush plants. Those who find themselves in this shrouded place, covered by hydrallia, lily pads and reeds, are usually pilgrims seeking the reality of Rawlings’ paper world. The people who live here on the fringe, however, aren’t a secretive bunch. A woman walking her dog told me to take a boat downstream on Cross Creek to Burnt Island where it’s not unusual to see bald eagles soar through the cypress. I told her I was there visiting sites that inspired Rawlings. “Do you know she’s buried just south, in Island Grove?” she asked. “How far south?” She gave me a long, winding list of instructions mentioning a variety of vague land markers. “And then make a left at the second dirt road past the railroad tracks…” After much searching, I found Antioch Cemetery and Marjorie’s modest grave with a tiny fawn ornament at its head. There was a collection of ink pens left by fellow pilgrims — writers and admirers of her works. The oaks and magnolias whispered and a summer shower rumbled in the distance. Even now, 63 years after her death, Rawlings is connected to the magical silence and the very earth of this place. I left her my pen. By Stephenie Livingston"
Medium.com,Life,How to move your 3 pets across the country: A guide…sort of.,Travel,https://medium.com/@jwalkwriter/how-to-move-your-3-pets-across-the-country-a-guide-sort-of-21fe5d86bd0c?source=topic_page---------554------------------1," Moving two cats and a 5-month-old puppy from Ohio to California (as well as two adults) is not without its challenges. Unlike your household items and furniture, you can’t simply shove them into a shipping container and call it a day. Well, you can, but that would make you a psychopath. You may consider driving. You may find yourself thinking, “It’ll be fun! We’ll buy a Subaru and make a road-trip out of it.” On paper, it’s the storyboard for a great car commercial. In reality, not so much. Though your adorable and vivacious 5-month-old yellow lab loves car rides, both of your cats absolutely hate them. Your curmudgeonly 7-year-old cat feverishly tries to dig his way out of his crate while your 2-year-old tabby floof (technical term) let’s out long, pitiful cries one after another while peering at you through the bars in her crate. All of this crushes your soul and will to live. A 36-hour cross-country trek is looking less and less likely, especially since you can only sedate cats for so long before putting them into a coma. So, air travel it is. After some careful researching, you discover that United Airlines advertises a PetSafe program that guarantees to “…get your cat or dog where they need to be safely and comfortably.” First things first, you must sign a stack of paperwork in blood. While you’re grateful that United takes such thorough precautions to ensure your pets’ safety, you don’t believe for one minute that it has anything to do with your pets’ actual well-being and has everything to do with bad press coverage and being sued. However, you comply because your options are limited. During the entire process of registering your puppy and two cats to be flown with you from Ohio to California, United will send you multiple emails every day reminding you that you have a shit ton of paperwork to submit and that at any time they can cancel your reservation, which is super helpful and not at all stressful. The paperwork they like to remind you daily that you have to submit can, ironically, only be submitted at very specific times. For example, United will badger you every day, sometimes twice a day, demanding that you submit your pets’ health certificates immediately or you’ll be stuck in Ohio forever. However, you can’t actually submit the certificates until you’re at least 10 days out from the flight. So, when you’re still 12 days out, your inbox will continue to scream at you that you haven’t completed an absolutely necessary step that you can’t actually complete due to United’s own time restrictions, and the panic sets in hard and deep. Neat! Next, you must pack up all three animals and take them to the vet. If you’re lucky, your husband will be at work so you get to take care of this all by yourself. You will be scammed into buying the puppy pheromone collar and cat pheromone spray the vet pushes on you since United has a strict policy against sedating your pets. The vet will give you the aforementioned health certificates United has been harassing you for, and after you’ve scanned in and uploaded all three to the PetSafe portal — along with pictures of the travel crates, the crate dimensions, photos of your pets that meet United’s specifications, and a copy of the “I understand I’m not allowed to sue United” paperwork — you’ll receive confirmation that everything is all set and pending approval. However, you’ll also receive another email informing you that you have to email all of the above mentioned paperwork to PetSafe directly. Fearing you will not get approved unless you submit everything again, you begin another process. This is also when the boob sweat begins. You read the instructions carefully and see that the email attachments have to be under 2 MB, which is literally impossible even when you compress everything into their own zip files. Your cleavage is now so sweaty it’s pooling in your bra. You get the attachments as small as you can, hit send, and pour yourself a giant glass of wine even though it’s only 2:30. The next day, PetSafe will call you and ask why you bothered emailing them all of these things when you’ve already uploaded them to the PetSafe portal, to which you will stammer, “I was just doing what the emails told me to do.” The woman on the end of the line will sigh and tell you that you’re fine (no, you’re not), and that you just need to make sure to arrive at the cargo area on time the day of the flight. It’s the morning of travel! After spending the past 13 hours cramming what few things you still own into a shipping container and being awake for 24 hours, you must now transport two exhausted adults, two very full suitcases, one 40-lb puppy, two terrified cats, and all three cumbersome travel crates to the cargo area of the airport. If you do not know someone with a very large truck, you’re options are pretty much restricted to renting a U-Haul or ordering a caravan of taxis. Once at the cargo area, you must now hold your breath as they process all of your paperwork at a glacial pace and check your animals to make sure they look okay to fly. United’s policy stipulates that your pets cannot seem too anxious to fly (pawing at crate, aggressive behavior, excessive barking, etc.) but also can’t appear to be sedated. While the United cargo employee who clearly hates his job begins inspecting your pets, you pray that your puppy won’t be her excited puppy-self and lose her shit when he approaches her crate. You also watch in fear as he checks the cats, who have both managed to shrink themselves down to half their normal size and are cowering in the back corners of their crates with eyes the size of saucers, feeling certain they now appear out of it and will not be approved for flight. Teetering on the cusp of a complete mental breakdown, all three eventually get the green light to fly. Next, they are loaded onto a motorized cart and driven out of sight while you and your husband make your way to the terminal. This is when the vomit-inducing anxiety sets in that you have left behind your fur babies and won’t see them for the next 6 hours, and their safety is now in the hands of complete strangers. Huzzah! As promised by United’s PetSafe program, the pets are loaded onto the plane last, right before takeoff. From your seats, you and your husband can watch as your first cat’s crate is loaded onto the conveyor belt, followed by the second, and lastly followed by your puppy. They are all on board, and you breathe the tiniest sigh of relief. Your 5-hour flight takes off shortly after that, and you try hard not to think about your beloved pets’ wide-eyed faces, feeling certain they are all wondering what they have done wrong to deserve such punishment. You’re not crying, but that’s only because after being awake for 28 hours straight, you simply lack the energy to do so. When you arrive in California, as promised by United’s PetSafe program, the pets are deboarded first. Once again, you watch as the crates are unloaded. First your puppy comes down the conveyor belt and is loaded into the PetSafe van. Then…hold on…what’s he doing. Oh fuck, they’re driving away! “Wait, there are two more,” you and your husband scream, your faces crammed into the tiny oval window. Another employee chases after the van and flags him down, and the driver swings back around. Phew! Next, they unload the first cat’s crate. Then your second cat’s crate begins its decent down the conveyor belt. But wait, the guy unloading the crates has turned his back. He’s not ready for it. No one is watching and her crate is almost at the end of the belt! “Oh my fucking God, they’re gonna drop her!” you both scream…again, and the rest of the plane is now visibly uncomfortable due to your panicked beating of the airplane window. You watch helplessly and in horror as two employees turn around just in time to catch the crate from falling off of the conveyor belt. Checking to make sure you haven’t soiled yourself, you see them load the last crate into the van and watch it drive away. You and your husband collect your carry-on items and last shreds of dignity, and deboard the plane while the rest of the passengers give you a noticeably wide birth. Alas, all four-legged creatures have made it safely and happily to their new home. The humans are a little worse for wear, but that’s pet parenthood for ya. Pro Tip: When flying your pets across the country, get yourself some sedatives and wash them down with an in-flight cocktail. It’s the only way."
Medium.com,Life,Out of Africa,Travel,https://medium.com/@razibul.malik/out-of-africa-c58eacf89329?source=topic_page---------555------------------1," No, not the name of the hit Hollywood movie but the sensation me and my wife felt when we traveled to South Africa earlier this year. The shear excitement of being in the African continent for the first mixed with all safety issues that I’ve gathered from the internet and the friends made the experience even much more intense. If you are trying to visit South Africa for the first time and don’t know what to expect this article is for you! You need a car in South Africa if you’ve planning to see the natural beauties and drive along the beautiful coastline as well as country side. There is no other way around it. Uber is not an option like the US and Europe. Taxi service is not reliable and because of security you can’t/won’t want to look for taxi outside of your comfort zone. So yes, you can probably order a taxi from the hotel but can’t look for taxi because of security reasons in most of the large cities in South Africa. We’re rented a car from FirstCar rental in the Cape Town airport. Interestingly the luxury cars are cheaper than the SUVs, since people like to rent SUVs for the natural experiences in South Africa. We’ve landed in the Johannesburg Airport, flew straight to Cape Town airport. Then we literally drove to all other destinations and back to Johannesburg. The cities we’re traveled are Cape Town, Port Elizabeth area, Drakensburg, Durban, and finally Johannesburg. The concept of hotels is not good in South Africa. You want to look for Guest House (thanks to my friend for this insider tip). First of all, guest houses are owned by families. They are really hospitable and you will have car parking which is included with the stay. They will also have decent internet which is a plus. We’ve found most of the places using booking.com. Pretty good experience throughout the trip. The concept of doing safari is called Game Drive. I couldn’t figure out before going on the trip for how to do safaris. Most of the websites that advertises safaris were exorbitant prices, e.g. $1600/night. Most of the safaris are in the southern and eastern seaboard of South Africa. When you are close to a game reserve, just reserve the spot for Safari, it should be around $100/person which is quite reasonable. We did two safaris: one in natural habitat (recommended) and one in zoo enclosure. The natural habitat is the one that you see in the tv and internet. You get to be real close with the animal. We were about 3 feet away from the Lion, Giraffe, etc. Cape Town is by the far the safest city in South Africa. Most of the travel pictures that are widely circulated are from Cape Town. We started our travel from Cape Town where we rented a guest house. We picked up the car from the Cape Town airport and drove there. The first shock as an US driver was that in South Africa they drive in the left side. Its hard to get adjusted first few days. Driving during the day time is fine without any issue. However, at night try to avoid the dodgy areas. Victoria Waterfront. We went to Victoria waterfront the very next morning. This is where we got out orientation of South Africa. The area is very touristy and really secure. You can walk around to check out a shopping mall, restaurants, etc. We took a boat tour to sail around the bay during sunset which was pretty nice. Table Mountain. If you are in Cape Town you must check out the Table Mountain. This is majestic natural wonder in the heart of South Africa. Be sure to note that the parking is really painful. So try to get there in the morning time to avoid all sorts of traffic. Cape Town is the safest of all the cities we’ve traveled. However, be careful to not going into the areas that are not well lit where you can get mugged. We were lucky to be not any of the situations. If you don’t buy cellular service, be sure to download the Google Maps for offline and follow it whole heartedly. Don’t go off the path, as it might take you to sketchy areas Any search for the things to check out definitely brings out Garden Route. Thats one of the best scenic routes in whole South Africa. Word of caution, don’t try to drive the Garden Route directly from Cape Town to Port Elizabeth. We didn’t have the chance to check out the garden route in its entirety. Thats the goal for next time! We wanted to check out one of the safari areas close to the Garden Route. However, couldn’t find any good priced safari game reserve’s as mentioned earlier, they were exorbitantly expensive. So, We ended up staying in a lodge named Ikwanista. Its a remote lodge completely inside the nature. The private owners have some zebras in their properly. We try to drive there directly from Cape Town and was a mistake. It took around 14 hours and ended up reaching at midnight. Ikwanista. Just relax and not do a thing all day. The nature around the place is just amazing! The breeze that was blowing through the mountains, you could literally hear the wind which I didn’t know is possible. Scotia Safari. In the Paterson city where we stayed, only 10 minutes drive away is the Scotia Lodge. This is a private game reserve that do Safari for visitors. We were lucky to get two seats in the safari the same day. This is a natural safari which means, you get to be 2 feet away from the lions. The stuff in the safari are well-trained and knowledgable. They will try to show you all things that are available in during the safari. The whole game reserve is a lush land encompassing acres of land where the wild animals roam around. The safari started around 2:00 PM and ended around 9:30 PM with dinner included which is of course local authentic South African cuisine. They even have guest houses in the middle of game reserve in open space for visitor who are brave enough to live in them during night. We didn’t know about them and also are not brave enough even if we’ve known about them! We probably saw at least 20 to 25 different animals in their natural habitat from Lion, Giraffe to water animals like Crocodiles. Its an amazing experience. I would definitely recommend anyone visiting South Africa to visit this place, if they are around Port Elizabeth area! There is nothing to worry about during driving. Just stay in your lane. However, don’t try to help anyone if they are laying down in the highway since that’s scam to rob you! From Paterson, we drove all the way north to the Drakensburg, SA. This place is a beautiful mountain range close to Durban but more inland. Its adjacent to Lesotho, the landlocked country inside South Africa. The place we stayed in is named The Cavern. Its an all inclusive lodge for everything you can wish for in a lodge. They provide breakfast, lunch, and dinner. Also available are physical activities like hiking, fishing, horseback riding, etc for those who are interested. We did hiking with a group and just relaxed all the time we were there. The wind blowing through the mountain range is just amazing! While you are hiking you can see the mountain range which is unbeatable. One of the most interesting thing we enjoyed was the Braai! This is the South African classic. Anytime you ask anyone from South Africa what is their favorite food, the very first answer will be Braai! Its kind of like Barbecue, the secret is in the details of marinating the meat. I believe the meat are marinated over 24 hours or so. When they are grilled and served the juicy meat just falls off the hand. It just heavenly delicious! Another thing I’ve noticed was the stars. At night when all the lights are off, you can literally see the stars up close. And for some reason the stars appeared very close to me version other places I’ve star gazed. I literally sat on an bench in front of our bungalow for 1 hour just star gazing which is an impossible thought in the US. The only things to worry about in the Drakensburg area is the natural animals. As most of the places are nature driven, you need to look out for the snakes, insects, etc. From Drakensburg we drove to Durban. We stayed in a British colonial house close to the beach. Unfortunately this is where the uncomfortable experiences begin. Unlike the southern part of the country, in the north, its not that safe because of poverty among other reasons. The only area you can check out is the Ushaka Marine world and Sunset casino beach area. You can get inside the marine world or you can walk around the marine world. We did both. Beside the Ushaka Marine world area, you can walk around by the entrance to check out shops, restaurants, and even walk to the beach. In the beach area you can walk all the way to the north of the beach. Its a single promenade that is 6 miles long. We visited most of the store that are there. One interesting thing noticed was there are many South Asian Indian population in the Durban area. I believe this is where they settled when they migrated to South Africa during colonial times. We were tired from all the walking and ended up getting a massage to relax! We also drive to the Suncoast Casino. This is also by the beach area. Its kind of like shopping mall plus a casino. Not exactly like Las Vegas but close. We played our luck in the hands of god and ended up winning 130 Rand. Not bad for a first timer. There are some nice restaurants. You can also walk to the private beach area that Suncoast owns. The city is not very safe, unless you know what you are doing. Unfortunately, the Ushaka and the Suncoast area are the one where you can visit the area with utmost security. Watch-out for unwanted help from the people. Always keep you windows close while driving. Johannesburg is the worst of the big cities you want to visit in South Africa in terms of safety. This is where we got the experience that’ll be with us from rest of our life. We drove from Durban to Johannesburg. I tried to avoid reaching there at night but it is always what you don’t want! While almost close to the guest house, I was taking a turn there was two car in front of us. Both of the car crossed the red light, so did I. There was a situation where the middle car was thinking Me and the car in front will box the middle car in to hijack, it just literally took off and almost hit the other car while doing so. Fortunately nothing happened. It was 8:30 PM at night. When we reach to our guest house a few minutes later, turns out the gate is locked and we can’t get in. The guest house did mention that they receive guest until 10:00 PM. We tried banging and ringing bell (which doesn’t work) but no body shows up. All sorts of possibility was going through my mind, since this is alley area where anybody can come from behind or front to rob us. We went to the next gated community for some help. The security guys who are inside metal gate wouldn’t even help us, although they have mobile phones and stuff. For the last ditch effort we went back to the guest house, finally the lady showed up. But she wouldn’t even open the gate. She was trying to make sure that we are what we are by chatting with the someone over the phone for also 15 minutes while we wait outside the gate like a animal ready to be preyed upon! Finally she opened up and we got it. This is the sort of security measure they take in order stay safe in Johannesburg! We stayed there for 3 days. There few options to check outs. They are Sandton shopping center, Soweto, Lions park among others. We did both of them and spend as much time as possible there. Sandton shopping center is a lavish three story mall which looks out-of-place considering the security of the city. Inside the mall its just like any other lavish American shopping malls with high end boutique shops, restaurants, and brand names from American and European counterpart. We also did a tour bus ride to visit different places in Joburg (as the locals call it). In the city tour bus they will take you to a township called SoWeTo. This is a famous township and worth the visit! Nobel laureates like Desmond Tutu and Nelson Mandela stayed in this township. The food is also great! There are lots of South African shops that sells authentic jewelry at a reasonable price. We also went to Lion Park. This is also a safari. However, this time we are the caged animals. We get in a big caged buses to tour around the park to see all sort of animals from Lion, Giraffe, etc. The biggest difference between the Lion park and Scotia is that the animals Scotia are in their natural habitat so they are afraid of human thus you can get closer to them. But in Lion park the animals are raised by humans thus they are not scared of humans and will attack them out of curiosity and might ended up killing them. The staff are knowledgeable and will safety of the guests at all time. From Paterson,Its not safe in Johannesburg! South Africa is one of the best places I’ve ever been. Europe is nice but South Africa has its own charm. Its the only country where all three worlds meet. You can see the Developed world with fancy buildings, middle class population, and the poor slums all in the same country. The stark difference coupled with the natural beauty can teach you a lot! I loved being there and will go there again in the future someday!"
Medium.com,Life,Photography Travel Diaries — Alaska,Travel,https://medium.com/@maxsalk/photography-travel-diaries-alaska-c63f290afe2f?source=topic_page---------556------------------1," In my experience, people fall into one of two camps when it comes to Alaska: either they’re ambivalent, or they’re completely obsessed. When I was planning to take a cruise around the coast with my family, I got my fair share of, “Why there?” The reasons are fairly obvious: harsh weather, scarcity of people, remote location, etc. Alaska may not be the most intuitive travel location for most, but there’s a reason for that second group of people. To put it simply, Alaska is amazing. The wild landscape paired with the state’s unique history and way of life brought it to the top of my list before I’d even gone. Once I got there, Alaska kept me pleasantly surprised and a bit humbled to have underestimated what I was getting into. The night the cruise set sail, we encountered our first setback: 15–20 foot waves crashed against the boat, accompanied by gale force winds. The intense conditions lasted through the night and well into the next day and rendered roughly 75% of the passengers and crew sea sick or incapacitated. I was one of the lucky ones — I wasn’t the most comfortable I’d ever been, but I made it through alright. Looking back, it was quite the introduction, and admittedly kind of fun. Our first stop was Juneau. We visited the Mendenhall Glacier, only twelve miles from downtown Juneau. It was unlike any other natural structure I’d ever seen, the older, more opaque ice breaking away to reveal the newer blue ice underneath. It stretched out far across the landscape, though our guide told us about the 1.75 miles the glacier has already retreated since the mid-1900s. Following the glacier, we went whale watching. Even though I was expecting to see whales on our trip, I couldn’t have anticipated what I would feel really being there with them. Like most experiences with nature in the wild, the beginning was strangely easy to miss — someone pointed something out ahead, and after some squinting and rearranging, suddenly, there they were: breaching blue whales at close range. Their size combined with their calm rendered them both peaceful and forceful to watch. Our next stop was Skagway, a very remote place compared to our previous stop in Juneau. We took an old mining train through the mountains near Skagway — the landscapes were beautiful and sweeping, picturesque shot after picturesque shot. The juxtaposition of the abandoned mining infrastructure and the natural beauty was a true time portal. Our guide explained that mining was key to the economic strength of the area and had been for years. It was a notable interaction with the history of the place, to be in the old train on the rickety tracks going through the beautiful natural landscapes. Following our ride on the train, we visited a dog sled camp. Initially, the thought of a “working dog” was a bit foreign to me based on my own relationships with pets back home, but to my surprise, the huskies seemed quite happy. They were in their element, eager to be in these environments, winter or summer, and their chipper demeanor showed the quality of their care. Next was Ketchikan, a very busy destination following the quiet of Skagway. The city is known for its Native American history and totem poles, so we took our time learning some of the history of the area and taking it in. As we spent time downtown, we picked up on local talks about the city trying to expand the port we were docked in to open the community and make it more accessible to visitors as well as those who live there, perhaps drawing more people to Ketchikan. We made our way out of the city on another hike, this time with the goal of seeing some bears. Although we did get to see more of the expansive Alaskan wilderness, we weren’t quite lucky enough to catch any bears on the hike. Our last stop was Vancouver. While we were nearing the coast of British Columbia, our Captain shifted our course. He’d caught sight of dolphins and orcas swimming nearby, and soon they were on either side of our ship. Nearly every passenger of the ship stopped whatever they were doing to look overboard at our visitors. It was quite a remarkable sight to witness — both the wildlife and the way they captured the imagination and attention of everyone onboard. Though our time in every place we visited on the trip was limited, I was sad to leave it, and felt like I’d been there for much longer than I had. Alaska presented not only endless natural beauty, but a kind of beauty I’d never really experienced before."
Medium.com,Life,"Nepal, a land of festivals",Travel,https://medium.com/@shresthashish27/nepal-a-land-of-festivals-ce367a0e0691?source=topic_page---------557------------------1," Nepal is the land of festivals. Odds are you’ll see a minimum of one of these celebrations that are vibrant and colorful. It isn’t easy to predict when they will be held as their dates are decided in advance, but to be sure to catch one August and September are the jam. Listed below are. Yomari punhi(Nov/Dec) is a Newari festival which is very popular in Kathmandu valley. Yomari is one of the local foods of Nepal; it means tasty bread and punhi means full moon in Newari language. Thus, this festival is celebrated making, sharing and eating Yomari. This festival marks the end of the rice harvest. Shivaratri (Feb/March period ). The principal celebration can be understood in Pashupatinath and it is quite a sight. Many Sadhus arrive from all over India and Nepal to observe, many of thousands of miles walking barefoot just to be at Pashupatinath. It’s also the one day if hashish is legal in Nepal, so you can be given a high by walking around these smoky temples! Holi (Feb/march time). In my experience I have to say Holi is Nepal’s most colorful festival, also referred to as Fagu or the Festival of Colours. It falls on the full-moon afternoon in the month of Falgun. In this festival, water is wrapped around to arrive. However, don’t wear clothing which you’re especially fond of in this day as the water is usually colored with Tikka (and crimson seems to be the ideal!). If you want to play with, but keep an eye over as the locals tend to set up camp in their rooftop and bombard you from 43, if you’re brave enough to depart from your hotel you’ll get fun! Bisket Jatra (April-May). Nepali New Year starts in mid-April. The Bisket chariot festival is a great way to find in and is said to be among the events in the valley. To get a feel for this festival the typical place to be is Bhaktapur. Buddha Jayanti (May-June) (Buddha’s Birthday).For this festival, I would suggest heading to Lumbini, the birthplace of Buddha (though if that is a little out of your way Swayambhunath (the Monkey temple), Bodhnath and Patan are also placed on a good show for this particular festival.) The highlight of this ceremony is the Monk dances that are colorful. Gai Jatra (Aug/Sept period ) The Cow festival is one of the most popular in Nepal. Cows are directed through the streets with this day and you will even see young boys! Newars feel that if you die they will be guided by cows to Yama, the god of the underworld. And if you are fortunate enough to be holding onto a cows tail, this travel is going to be made easier. As with most of the festivals, to truly get a feel for it you should head to one of the Durbar Squares, either Patan Kathmandu or Bhaktapur. Teej (Aug-Sept period ) The woman’s festival. To become involved in this festival I would recommend spending the afternoon of Teej. The place will become a sea of saris. This festival combines feasting and fasting! The women pray for marital bliss, well being of their spouses and children and purification of their souls. On one of the days, the girls are expected to bath their husband's toes and then drink the water! Indra Jatra (Aug-Sept time) This festival celebrated by both Hindus and Buddhists marks the end of the monsoon and is just one of fantastic color and excitement. The festival is named after Lord Indra who is known as the god of rainfall and as heaven’s king. This festival includes 8 whole days of singing, dance, and feasting. On the next day of this festival that the Kumari (the family goddess) is accepted around the capital in a chariot. Dashain (Sept/Oct time) This is Nepal’s biggest festival and one of the longest-lasting 15 days. This festival is not much to watch for tourists as it’s a very family orientated, however, if you’re lucky enough to join celebrations with a neighborhood family and really get concerned it is by far the best holiday destination. Different celebrations take place on each day, for example on Maha Ashtami or the great Eight Day’, this is when you may see the sacrifices begin and on Vijaya Dashami, the 10th day, is a family affair and greetings and cards are exchanged. Tihar (Oct-Nov time) Also called Diwali or Deepawali, this is the festival of lights in which the Goddess of prosperity, Goddess Laxmi is worshipped. During this period you will see that the town come alive with candles (which if the electric isn’t working is just magnificent ) and the heavens come alive with fireworks: simply keep an eye out for teens with firecrackers! This is a 5-day celebration honoring crows creatures, dogs, cows and bullocks on Every Day"

In my hands were two of my favorite things, a good book, and truffles from a small chocolatier. I strolled into the Loggia dei Lanzi and sat on a bench surrounded by artists who sketched the statues. A police officer saw my tiny bag of chocolates and approached me, “You can’t eat in here,” I thought he said in Italian. I smiled at him, and put the chocolate I was unwrapping back in the bag. He shook his head, picked up my bag, and I worried that he was going to confiscate my beautiful hand rolled truffles. Instead, he peeked inside, and pointed at me, miming that I must hide that I was eating them while sitting in this area. He winked and returned my chocolates. I pulled open my book, snuck a small bite of the deep rich taste and let it melt over my tongue as I lost myself in the beautiful words written in one of my favorite novels. Another man approached, and he sat near me, but didn’t try to start a conversation. Instead, he took out his sketch pad and pencils. I thought he might be a street artist hoping I would pay him for the portrait. I tried to explain that I didn’t want to buy anything from him. “No, Bella,” he said, “I’m a student of art. I simply want to draw you reading.” Uncomfortable, I tried to stop him again. “When you opened your book and ate that piece of chocolate, you had a look of pure satisfaction. I want to see if I can capture you enjoying this beautiful night.” Realizing, since he could draw me from afar, that I couldn’t make him stop, I gave in and allowed him to continue. A harpist began to play in the Piazza, and the music, the words of my book, the scent of the night air, the taste of my chocolate, the damp moisture of the humidity, all overloaded my senses. I lost myself in the sensations. Soon something I can only explain as the bliss that the spiritual leaders speak about when they find Nirvana in meditation or prayer flowed over me. I didn’t sense it with my mind, instead it was an external awakening to the beauty of this life that made me understand the deep miracle that I get the to experience. The artist finished his sketch and tapped me on the shoulder. Startled, I looked up having forgotten he was there. He handed me a rolled piece of drawing paper. Once again, I assumed he wanted money, and I fished around in my purse to find a few Euros. He put his hand over mine. “No, it was my pleasure. You made me feel something tonight in the way you enjoyed your evening — you needed nothing from anyone else, you just relished in your enjoyment of the moment. This is my gift to you in return. Let it remind you of how you felt.” As he walked away, I unrolled the paper. It was a rough sketch of my face and hair. Artists had drawn me before, and each time I looked at the pictures, I focused on what I deemed my flaws. This time I saw something different. Somehow this man had captured the pure bliss upon my face, the softness of my surrendering breath, and the essence of life in its sensory overload that had filled the moment. Oftentimes, in my racing and rushing to explore everything this life has to offer, to accomplish and improve in all my crafts, my business, and my sports, I pull out that one sketch and remember, it’s not what I accomplish or how many things I check off the list. The true beauty of life, is in the sensory overload of pleasures. I believe I now need to go eat some decadent chocolate."
Medium.com,Life,What’s a Language Good For?,Travel,https://medium.com/one-table-one-world/whats-a-language-good-for-957165bce595?source=topic_page---------560------------------1," Last night, around 10:00pm, my mother called me from across the Atlantic. Could I help her talk to somebody in Spanish? I live in Europe. She lives six hours behind, in the eastern U.S. It was the end of her workday at a borough office neighboring my hometown, and a man had just come in with some questions that absolutely no one present could understand; everyone except for him was a monolingual English speaker. My hometown is demographically fascinating. As in, it was a frequent topic of discussion amongst my demographer professors and colleagues when I was a grad student in a demography program; people were amazed that I came from Hazleton, Pennsylvania. Within barely more than 15 years, Hazleton shifted from 5% Latino to over 50% Latino (see National Geographic source below). … and Hazleton not-infrequently hits the news for how anti-immigrant it can be. (See also: New York Times here and here, NBC News, Huffington Post, ACLU, and the list goes on…) As the BBC says: “Hazleton is the kind of place reporters go when they want to put a human face on big national issues. In Hazleton, the issue is immigration…” Having grown up there, I’ve observed that a lot of tensions revolve around the direct economic competition that many long-term residents feel with new migrants. Hazleton has nearly always been populated by people who covet the “jobs nobody wants.” When coal mining fell out of favor, locals largely just segued into grinding factory work, rather than accessing the advantages that would’ve allowed them to climb the socioeconomic ladder into white-collar futures. Hence, when new migrants arrive seeking to compete for the same low-skilled work, Hazleton’s long-term residents bristle. To complicate matters even further, Hazleton’s rapid shift from majority-white to majority-Latino has left a lot of non-Latinos — especially middle-aged and older — in the professional lurch. Many, if not most, local businesses now require that hires be bilingual, for obvious, practical reasons. Older adults usually can’t learn new languages on a dime, though, so when you add a demand for foreign language fluency to the usual ageism already plaguing the job market, the economic (and therefore quality-of-life) prospects for older blue-collar people plummet further still. As I said, there are lots of tensions. But I’m 35 — and I could likely scrape by in today’s Hazleton if I needed to. Because 20 years ago, I had the foresight to throw myself wholeheartedly into Spanish."
Medium.com,Life,The One Thing No One Packs,Travel,https://medium.com/mindtrip/the-one-thing-no-one-packs-a8af0301e29e?source=topic_page---------561------------------1," Humor me for a moment. Imagine it’s your first day on vacation. Your destination is Paris, the city of lights, of love, and of Eiffel Tower keychains (5 for €1, no less). Where do you go after you drop off your luggage? Now, there’s no need to get too far out of your checked baggage with this mental exercise. If you’re anything like 40 million other people visiting Paris this year (which, let’s face it, you probably are), you’ll probably head to one of these attractions: There’s no shame in admitting this. After all, you’re in Paris for this mental trip remember? When else will you witness such magnificent displays of history, culture, and art? This, by the way, is what everyone else waiting in line with you is thinking. That, and, “who do I have to pay off at this place to get Fast Pass tickets?” Now let’s imagine instead that you choose a different road branching off of the Champs Elysees. A road that leads you to a place that also has lines, but they never last more than 10 minutes. This place is also magical, albeit lacking in art and history: “The supermarket?” “Why,” you ask, “would I ditch the chance at selfies in front of the Eiffel Tower for the laundry detergent aisle of a local supermarket?” Because laundry detergent and pet supplies are where authenticity is found. It’s where you’ll find people that have lived alongside Parisian monuments for decades and never stepped inside. And it’s where no tourist goes first. “When we engage in other cultures, we start to have experience with different people and recognize that most people treat you in similar ways.”
— Adam Galinsky, professor at Columbia Business School In recent years, neuroscientists and psychologists have been studying the effect of travel on the brain. What they’ve found, unsurprisingly, is that travel is good for the brain. However, to be truly beneficial and lasting, a certain type of travel is necessary. “Foreign experiences increase cognitive flexibility… the mind’s ability to jump between different ideas, [which is] a key component of creativity,” reports Adam Galinsky, a professor at Columbia Business School and author of multiple studies on the benefits of traveling. He’s also my inspiration behind what I’m calling the science of supermarket travel: “The key is multicultural engagement, immersion, and adaptation. Someone who lives abroad and doesn’t engage with the local culture will likely get less of a creative boost than someone who travels abroad and really engages in the local environment.” This is why striking up a conversation in the supermarket aisle, or daring to ask a store clerk where you might find the toilet paper, has potentially far greater mental and emotional benefits than acting like you’re holding up the Eiffel Tower. Most people avoid supermarket travel either because it’s too intimidating or not sexy enough. It’s in the discomfort of travel, however, that we truly feed our brain. Everything else we do, no matter how glamorous or eye-catching, is little more than mental junk food. That doesn’t mean the Eiffel Tower or the Louvre, or Versailles can’t be enjoyed. It just means we need to recognize that we’re probably also checking our cognitive flexibility at the bag check. So, next time you travel, whether that be next door or halfway across the world, consider packing your brain along for the journey."
Medium.com,Life,Sixty Days in the Philippines,Travel,https://blog.usejournal.com/sixty-days-in-the-philippines-ad0522b1862c?source=topic_page---------562------------------1," In today’s world, global mobility is becoming more accessible for millions of people. Online careers, remotely operated businesses, and the demand for specialized skill sets in foreign nations open up the possibility that you’re not confined to a single area of the globe on which to live. If you’ve ever found yourself saying, “Man, I gotta get out of here”, or “This can’t be all there is,’’ well, you can, and no, it’s not. In my case, it was the Philippines. So, I packed a bag, hopped a flight leaving Brownsville, Texas, and discovered some things in two months living here. Items to explore: Where to live: I didn’t choose Manila or Cebu; rather, I picked a spot not heralded by tourists. In this case, it was Ormoc City. After a short search while staying in a hotel ($20 a night, with wifi), I rented a two bedroom, two bath condo for $309 a month. Utilities run me about a hundred bucks, including air conditioning, water, etc. It’s on the expensive side (what?? Yeah, really), but it has an American toilet and shower (more on that later) and the aforementioned A/C. Transportation: Ah, it’s a beautiful thing: anywhere in town you want to go, take a pedicab. They’re everywhere and you’ll wait no longer than a few minutes for one, and they cost twenty pesos. Offer fifty for a round trip. For you Americans, that’s forty cents to a dollar. For anywhere else in the province, take a van. They leave every half hour and go everywhere. They average ten bucks. Off the island? If it’s in the surrounding vicinity, take a ferry. They’re ten to twenty dollars (I always book business class for twenty because, again, air conditioning). On the other side of the country? A flight is under a hundred bucks to Manila. Healthcare: I’m not here long-term (I’m heading to China to fulfill a teaching contract), and so the only experience I’ve personally had is with a dentist. I badly needed a filling, and so that was done along with a cleaning. Forty bucks all day long. Paying out of pocket is doable for any minor thing that comes along, but there is health insurance available. Cuisine: For sure, the Philippines’ cuisine and dining out have their idiosyncrasies. “Tissues” are a blanket term for anything involving napkins, toilet paper, or paper towels. Expect to ask for tissues when dining out, and feel lucky if it’s already there. Salt and pepper: another rarity. If you ask for it, prepare for strange looks. “Sir, salt and pepper are already in the dish.” Sigh. The local offerings are outstanding. Relish in the very inexpensive pork adobo, lechon, longganisa, dinuguan, and pancit, among others. However, do yourself a favor: stick with local fare. Don’t attempt to order a cheeseburger. You’ll be disappointed. Seriously. The street food game here is on point. Let’s talk kabobs. Chicken: manok Pork: baboy Liver: atay Intestine: isaw Fruits for sale: The fruits are delicious, varied, and cheap. Here, you’ll find mangos, papaya, durian, rambutan (a favorite), lanzones, santol, star fruit, and many others. Like to cook (like me)? You’re in luck. Ormoc, and many similar-sized towns, have an amazing open market. Here you’ll find fruits, vegetables, spices, seafood, and meats…all at bargain prices, and all fresh. About $20 USD will stock you up for the week. Language: Some common phrases to learn (this is Cebuano, not Tagalog): How are you?: Kumusta? (You’ll find that quite a few phrases are similar to Spanish… ¿Cómo estás?) Where is the bathroom?: Asa ang banyo? (Baño) Thank you: Salamat. Hi, my name is _______. And you?: Ako ngalan si ______. Ikaw? Do you understand?: Kaintindi ka? So the bottom line is to learn a few key phrases. Before departing the U.S., I read where almost everyone speaks English in the Philippines. Well, sort of. Most everyone speaks at least *some* English. It doesn’t hurt to know a little bit of the native language. Something else: In English, we have “Uh huh” for yes. Not here. It’s “Ah Oh”…which sounds like what we say when we make a mistake. The Bathroom and Sanitation: This gets a special category. Here, it’s known as the CR, or “Comfort Room”. My first visit to my girlfriend’s mother’s house introduced me to this. I renamed it the DR. The Desperation Room. You have a toilet that flushes manually, meaning you have to pour water into it from a ladle. There a spigot with a bucket underneath where said water resides. You don’t sit on the toilet; you squat…or hover, if you will. No toilet paper, either. That gets the water, too. And good luck keeping your pants dry during that process. Time for a shower: I had to mentally psyche myself up for this. Back to our friend the bucket and the ladle. And what is this thing called hot water? No, no. It’s ice-cold. Which actually feels refreshing after the first few splashes. Budget: This is a contested topic, and a question that gets asked by would be expats a lot: how much is it to live over there? My answer is $1500 a month. If you have that in retirement, or you can make that remotely, then you’re set. You’ll live comfortably, be able to afford to travel, eat out, pay the bills, and even save a little for possible medical emergencies or anything else that crops up. Anything less than $1500 is a little too close to the wire. The Philippines, for me, serves as a starting point for what I hope to be a few years of exploration, both of the physical and cultural geography of China and Southeast Asia, and of myself. Approaching fifty, many of my peers are set in their beliefs on most levels. Am I? I hope not. Up next: Huaihua, Hunan Province, China. I’m looking forward to teaching my new students. And learning from them."

Medium.com,Life,4 Reasons I Opt Out of Airport Security,Travel,https://medium.com/@jeanell.innerarity/4-reasons-i-opt-out-of-airport-security-ab99c7f8c29c?source=topic_page---------564------------------1," 1.73 milllion passengers fly domestically in the U.S. every day. Sometimes, I’m one of them. Like everyone else, I want flying to be a safe, secure experience. And yet, I opt out of the backscatter x-ray machine in the security line, a machine which the Transportation Security Administration (TSA) claims will make all of our flying experiences safer. The TSA is notoriously inconsistent in their screening process, and I’ve had personal experience to prove it. Once, I went through the entire security checkpoint, x-ray machines and all, with a four-inch partially serrated bucknife in my carryon bag. I didn’t notice it until I got home. It’s my best backcountry camping knife so I was really grateful it flew under the radar, and the TSA should be grateful that it was me they let slide and not someone with malicious intentions. On another occasion, my grandma, at 5’1” and in her 80’s, boasting glaucoma and hearing impairment, attempted to board a plane with a tiny pair of foldable sewing scissors that she’d purchased in Europe 50 years prior. The TSA deemed those scissors a threat and confiscated her prized possession, a fact of which she reminded us for years to follow. Good job keeping the peace, TSA. I’ve read stories of thwarted bombings on one hand, and of someone making it through security with their open-carry handgun, and going back themselves to turn it in, on the other. So you’ll forgive me if I’m skeptical. It’s also different at every airport. At the award-winning Portland International Airport in Oregon, the security personnel consistently ask me if my stainless steel water bottles are empty BEFORE they run them through the scanner, and they give me the chance to dump the liquid if they’re not. At Houston Hobby airport, where I’ve had trouble every time I’ve flown, they once let me all the way through with about an inch of water in a stainless steel bottle. They then informed me that they were unable to pour the water out themselves. They additionally searched my entire bag, and told me if I wanted my water bottle back I’d have to go back to the start of the line, dump it myself, and go through the whole security screening again. This would have wasted a lot of people’s time, caused me to miss my plane, and improved the security of exactly no one, so I lost a nice insulated bottle there. I could go on with similar examples, but let’s cut to the chase: despite the TSA’s inconsistency and inefficiency, I choose to make my own travel experience a little less efficient by opting out of their backscatter x-ray machines. Here are the top four reasons why: 4.
Because I don’t want to be a statistic. This is relatively new and untested technology, and we all know how that sometimes ends. When my mom was a kid, she got to stick her feet in an open x-ray machine at the shoe store and watch her metatarsal and phalanges bones wiggle around, and everyone said that that was perfectly safe. Now when you get an x-ray, they put a lead vest over any part of your body that’s not being x-rayed and the technician walks out of the room. When my dad was a kid, DDT was sprayed on public lands in the name of public safety, and we all know how that ended, too (or if you don’t, the answer is cancer and ecological destruction all the way up the food chain with persistent effects to this day). So what about research on the backscatter x-ray machine? The thing is, there’s just not enough. The European Union removed them from their airports for that reason, but the U.S. ignored the Hippocratic Oath and forged on ahead. Some research indicates that about six additional cancers will occur for every 40 million scans, which medicine deems statistically insignificant, but to those 6 people, who have a lives and families, the statistics were a bad gamble if they could have chosen a pat-down instead. The Radiological Society of North America recommends avoiding the use of the backscatter x-ray machines because a safer alternative, the millimeter wave scanner, is available. For the backscatter machine, they state: “Best-estimate lifetime cancer risks will be somewhat higher for children, for radiosensitive individuals, and, particularly, for aircrew and frequent fliers. Again it is important to emphasize the associated uncertainties in these individual risk estimates, which could result in the actual risks being either less than or greater than the best estimates discussed here.” Essentially, the risk is present at an unknown quantity and so they make a sound medical recommendation to mitigate the risk. I understand that levels of radiation higher than those produced by the backscatter machines are everywhere, including on the flight I board after security, but levels of risk are true in all parts of my life. I eat organic food whenever I can. I don’t stand in front of the microwave. I wear my seat belt when I drive. I engage with the necessities of life, but I also minimize risk in a risky world. I once opted out of the airport scanner and a TSA agent said to me, “It’s just like your cell phone,” to which I replied, “Cell phones give people brain cancer,” another fact which lacks conclusive or comprehensive research. Some studies say yes, some studies say no, but the fact is, we don’t yet know, and anyway I don’t make a practice of standing inside my cell phone. So I’ll hedge my bets on this one. 3.
Because I value making a human connection. The airport security system is inherently designed to be inhuman. Get in line, keep moving, get halfway undressed, surrender your personal effects, submit to radiation, get your bag searched, grab your pile of stuff and get dressed again, keep it moving, keep it moving, keep it moving. Human touch, conversation, and direct interaction slows things down. In the years since I started opting out, I’ve noticed that each person has a different style of pat down. Some TSA workers seem nervous, some seem confident. Some seem professional, some seem like they’re out to lunch. Some work quickly, some work slowly. Some are more thorough than others. Some ask me about my life and some seem to barely notice I’m there. But all of them have to stop for a minute and engage with me as a human, and I have to do the same. We have to have a moment of mutual trust to get through the process successfully. It took me a long time to get up the courage to do this. I was terrified of feeling violated by a stranger. Now I realize the value of touch. On my last flight, the pat-down was conducted by a pregnant woman, one of the most professional and competent TSA agents I’d come across, and I was humbled by her ability to do this busy job on her feet all day at what looked like about six months along. On the same trip, the man who searched my bag was middle-aged and appeared to be in a lot of pain. He was slow in a way that looked like he didn’t have an option. I asked about the pain and he said he had a lot on his mind, that being on his feet made it harder, and that he’d rather be working with children. Even though I couldn’t relieve his overall situation, I let him know that he was seen, and I now feel connected to his story. 2.
Because I want to practice peaceful resistance. The current U.S. president has all the early warning signs of a fascist dictator. Regular civil disobedience is necessary. And difficult. I don’t enjoy making waves any more than I enjoy going to the dentist, but I value my teeth and so I go. I value my liberty and so I disobey when I see signs of my freedoms being taken away. Every time I step out of that security line and wait for a pat-down, I practice thinking for myself, standing for what I believe in, choosing the more challenging route in the name of justice. I know that if I can’t do it here, where the stakes are relatively low, then I’m not likely to be able to do it when the stakes are much higher. My friends opt out for their own reasons. I have a Latino friend who opts out because he feels it’s important for the public to see a brown-skinned man being patted down in public, reminding people that this happens on a regular basis in much less congenial settings. I have a friend with chronic illness who opts out because she already faces such an uphill battle with health that she sees no reason to introduce any unnecessary risk factors. I have a lot of other friends who had no idea you could opt out until I told them. Each of us can choose human connection and interrupt the system, rather than to stand with our hands up and allow an officially sanctioned stranger to see under our clothes while irradiating our cells in the name of safety. #RESIST. 1.
Because I can. Timothy Snyder, in his brilliant book On Tyranny: Twenty Lessons from the Twentieth Century, opens with Lesson #1: “Do not obey in advance.” I recommend reading the whole book, but that one line may be all you need. Every time you go through airport security, there’s a small and inconspicuous sign alerting you to the fact that the scanning machines are optional. Almost nobody takes this option, but I do because I learned early in life about the consequences of obeying in advance. I grew up in a mixed-faith household and was given a Jewish religious identity and education, of which Holocaust education was a significant part. I was steeped in imagery and stories of a whole European society turning a blind eye while Hitler’s Third Reich slowly, systematically took away the rights of Jews, gays, Gypsies, Catholics, people with disabilities, and anyone else who didn’t fit the mold. It wasn’t all at once because people, like a frog in hot water, will balk at that. Hitler knew this. He took it slow. Over the course of ten years, police stopped protecting Jews, then Jews were excluded from military service, then they lost their right to vote, then their passports were specially stamped, and only towards the very end were they required to wear yellow stars on their jackets, identifying themselves in public. By the time they were forced onto trains out of town, many believed they were being taken somewhere better. They got on the trains like sardines in a can, then off the trains into lines to take “showers” to prepare for the new place they hoped they’d live. The showers ended in either the camps, or the ovens. Every time I see people lined up in zigzagging rows, taking off their shoes and voluntarily lifting their arms over their heads to be irradiated while their belongings are scanned and potentially rifled through and confiscated, I remember this lesson from history. These are the same studied systems employed in airport security, which for now are designed to just get you on the plane. But you don’t have to obey in advance. The first time I opted out, they made me wait for an extended time. Then they opened up a metal detector to speed up the line. I watched as twenty people who had been behind me in line sped through the metal detector, yet they didn’t let me through. When I asked why, the reply came: “Because you opted out.” Since then I’ve heard similar punishing statements such as, “It’s your time, you sure you want to do this?” “You might miss your flight,” and, “We have no idea how long this will take.” The best one was after I’d been patted down by a woman who was barely paying attention, looking the other way and having distracted conversations the whole time (Houston Hobby airport again, get it together, ya’ll). I was sent to a man whose job it was to search my bags, and he made a snide comment designed to shame me for opting out. I don’t remember his exact comment, but it was something to the effect of, “The airport should hire more staff to make it easier for you to be special.” This was hot on the heels of the recent government shutdown, when TSA employees went unpaid for weeks. “The government should really pay their staff,” I replied. He smiled and said I should vote. I said I do, and I hope it makes a difference. This article was re-published with permission from http://www.ecospiritualeducation.com"

It was quiet, bar the odd splash in the pool, and there was nothing to do except read. Today I am sat at my desk in London, where it is nowhere near as hot or peaceful, and I’m longing for someone to come round with a tray and an order pad.

Like most people at this time of the year, now that I am back from my holiday it seems hard to imagine that the other place, that very different place, still exists. And, yet in Europe, difference is close; a short train journey can take you from London to Paris in two or so hours and, suddenly, the language, the culture, the way to do everything changes. This contrast, this juxtaposition, of so many different countries close together is what makes Europe so special to me. If I drove across America for two months, I would see many varied landscapes, but the culture, if not the climate, would be mostly the same. And I would encounter, at least officially, only one or two languages. ‘This juxtaposition of so many different countries close together is what makes Europe so special.’ But driving across Europe in order to visit 13 different capitals, I will cross 23 countries and need to use at least that many languages. I know that, mostly, I will be relying on my mother tongue, because in Italy I barely spoke before the waiter or receptionist jumped in to help me with their excellent English. Yet, as someone who loves learning, there is a thrill to formulating new words and sounds, to trying to make yourself understood, even when I fail to do so."
Medium.com,Life,A Simple Guide to Ordering in Japanese Restaurants,Travel,https://medium.com/one-table-one-world/a-simple-guide-to-ordering-in-japanese-restaurants-a456e0065b2d?source=topic_page---------567------------------1," By Arthur Reiji Morris For more in our Japanese Food series, check out Beyond Noodles: A Guide to the Different Types of Restaurants in Japan! Going to restaurants in a country where you don’t speak the native language can sometimes be a daunting experience. This is especially true in Japan, where you can’t always guarantee a given restaurant’s wait staff will have someone who speaks English. (Or even have menus in English, for that matter.) The good news is that, if you know at least some basic Japanese, picking up what you need to order at a restaurant isn’t an ordeal. Use this short guide to get you in the door and get food in your belly. When entering a restaurant in Japan, in the majority of cases you will be approached by a member of staff before you sit down. The first question they will ask is about the number of your group. Use the following structures below, or don’t feel hesitant about just holding up the relevant number of fingers. Q: How many of you are there?
⇒ 何名様ですか？ (nanmei-sama desu ka?) A: One.
⇒ 1人です。 (hitori desu.) Two.
⇒ 2人です。 (futari desu.) A2: Someone will be coming later.
⇒ 後でもう1人が来ます。 (ato de mou hitori ga kimasu.) You can replace the number of people with any of the vocab below. If you’ve reserved a table in advance, then feel free to tell them this along with your name. 予約をしています。NAMEです。 (yoyaku o shiteimasu. NAME desu.) If the restaurant has a smoking area, mostly found in family restaurants but also some restaurants too, they will ask you whether you want to be seated in the smoking area or not. Non-smoking seats usually fill up faster, so for those who don’t mind cigarette smoke and are happy to sit with the smokers, even if you don’t smoke, feel free to let the server know. Q: Would you prefer the smoking or non-smoking area?
⇒ 喫煙席、禁煙席、どちらがよろしいでしょうか？ (kitsuen-seki, kin’en-seki, dochira ga yoroshii deshou ka?) A: Smoking, please.
⇒ 喫煙席で。 (kitsuen-seki de.) Non-smoking, please.
⇒ 禁煙席で。 (kin’en-seki de.) Either is fine.
⇒ どちらでも大丈夫です。 (dochira demo daijoubu desu.) After this the member of staff will lead you to your table. Right this way!
⇒ こちらへどうぞ！ (kochira e douzo!) You’ve made it in — great! Now for the next challenge, the menu. If there is not already a menu on the table, a member of staff will bring one over. However, note that at some eateries the menu is displayed on small placards on the wall. In either case, if you find yourself menu-less, flag down a member of staff and feel free to ask for one. Do you have a(n English) menu?
⇒ (英語の）メニューはありますか？ (eigo no menyuu wa arimasu ka?) Is there a drinks menu?
⇒ ドリンクメニューはありますか？ (dorinku menyuu wa arimasu ka?) There may be cases where there may not be an English menu. But don’t panic. Many Japanese menus come with pictures, so feel free to look for and point out something that looks good. When you’re ready to order you need to grab the attention of a passing waiter, or even the owner stood behind the bar. Although it’s better to catch their eye and raise your hand slightly to gesture you’re ready to order, it’s useful to note that it’s not frowned upon to call “Sumimasen!” (すみません; excuse me!) to a member of the staff to get their attention. (Unlike in the United States and some other countries, you don’t have to wait to get the attention of “your” server.) Japanese customer service is fond of filling in any blank spaces with words, and at this point the waiter will most likely apologize for making you wait and ask if you are ready to order, お待たせいたしました。ご注文をお伺いします。 (omatase itashimashita. gochuumon o oukagai itashimasu). These phrases are mainly for purposes of etiquette, so don’t be too confused at the barrage of statements! There are cases where the waiter may come along before you’ve had a chance to catch their attention, where they may ask you if you’ve made you’ve chosen yet. Q: Have you decided what you would like?
⇒ ご注文はお決まりですか？ (gochuumon wa okimari desu ka?) A: Yes.
⇒ はい。 (hai.) Not yet.
⇒ まだです。 (mada desu.) When you’re ready to order, it’s a simple matter of reading the name of the menu item you would like and adding “kudasai” (ください; please) afterwards. If you’re uncertain of how to pronounce anything, it’s more than okay just to point and say, “this please.” This please.
⇒ これください。 Steak please.
⇒ ステーキください。 If you’re ordering multiples, or simply want to specify you only want one of something, all you need to do is add the number in between the dish name and the “kudasai.” Three colas please.
⇒ コーラを3つください。 (coora o mittsu kudasai.) Two curries please.
⇒ カレーを2つください。 (karee o futatsu kudasai.) When you’re done tell the waiter 以上です (ijou desu) to let them know that’s everything. There may be a few other questions you may want to ask. You may want extra napkins (ナプキン; napukin), ketchup (ケチャップ; kechappu), chopsticks (お箸; ohashi) or a knife and fork (ナイフとフォーク; naifu to fooku). There’s a handy one-size-fits-all expression for this. Can I have XX, please?
⇒ XXをもらってもいいですか？ (XX o morattemo ii desu ka?) If you’re in need of the bathroom, feel free to ask お手洗いはどこですか？ (otearai wa doko desu ka?). Once you’ve had your fill of food, it’s time to get the check. Beforehand, a waiter may come over to collect the plates. They will ask お皿をお下げしてもよろしいですか？ (osara o osage shitemo yoroshii desu ka?). There’s no set response to this, so feel free to just say “hai!” (はい; yes). Once you’re ready to get the check, simply tell a waiter you would like to pay by saying, お会計お願いします。 (okaikei o onegai shimasu). It is important to note that there is no set rule as to whether a restaurant will have the prices listed with or without consumption tax. As tax in Japan gets changed relatively frequently, many places will opt to list prices without tax so as to avoid reprinting menus. Tax is currently 8% (and likely being raised to 10% in October 2019), so don’t be surprised if the overall price is a bit higher than expected. In Japan, you do not need to tip. However, one thing to bear in mind, is that some places will charge a service charge, or an お通し (otooshi). This is more common in izakaya and Japanese style restaurants, so keep an eye out for otooshi on the check as you get your money ready. This charge is usually justified by a small dish at the beginning of the meal, so don’t be too shocked if you’re served some edamame beans before you’ve even had a chance to order. Whether a place will give you an otooshi or not is not always listed on the menu, but the common etiquette is to pay, although there is constant debate about its utility online. Depending on the type of restaurant you go to, you either pay at the table or at the till. As a general rule, at restaurants, sushi places, and bars, you pay at the table, but at chain restaurants and larger establishments, you will go up to the till to pay. If you came as a group, you need to then decide whether you’re paying separately or individually — everyone’s most hated part of the evening. The person at the till will ask お支払いはご一緒ですか？個別ですか？ (oshiharai wa goissho desu ka? kobetsu desu ka?) If one very generous person is paying for everyone, or a representative has collected all the money for everyone, tell the server you want to pay it all together, 一緒でお願いします。 (issho de onegai shimasu). If everyone is paying separately, say 別々でお願いします。 (betsubetsu de onegai shimasu). Next up, you’ll be asked whether you want to pay by cash or by card. Q: How would you like to pay?
⇒ お会計はどうなさいますか？ (okaikei wa dou nasaimasu ka?) A: By cash please.
⇒ 現金でお願いします。 (genkin de onegai shimasu) ⇒ By card please. カードでお願いします。 (kaado de onegai shimasu) If you’re paying by card, they may ask for your PIN or for you to sign. Please enter your PIN.
⇒ 暗証番号を入力してください。 (anshou bangou o nyuuryoku shite kudasai) Please sign here.
⇒ こちらにサインをお願いします。 (kochira ni sain o onegai shimasu) Take note that as cash is favored, not all places will be happy with splitting the check among many customers all paying by card. What about cashless? While contactless card payment is progressing in Japan, unless you have a Japanese account with a service such as LINE Pay or Apple Pay. One option that does work is attaching a Suica card to Apple Pay; a good number of restaurants and even convenience stores will accept Suica as a payment option. With that, everything is done! You have successfully made it to the end. If you have particularly enjoyed your meal, you can tell the staff ごちそうさまでした (goshisou sama deshita), “Thank you for the meal”, as you leave. The servers will thank you and ask you to come again. ありがとうございました。またお越しください！ (arigatou gozaimashita. mata okoshi kudasai!) Unseen Japan on Twitter — Daily News and Tweet Translations

Medium.com,Life,Top 5 National Park Novice Tips,Travel,https://medium.com/@aczerwinskiburkard/top-5-national-park-novice-tips-a105f61aa54e?source=topic_page---------569------------------1," Tip #1: Know when to get there. This doesn’t mean that at every National Park you need to get there early to avoid lines, but be aware that at some parks this may be the best option. Yosemite, Yellowstone, Zion and Sequoia National Parks are all pretty busy (but to different degrees), whereas Badlands and Shenandoah National Parks aren’t as busy (yet again, to different degrees). Look up the yearly number of visitors who go to the specific park, when the off season is, and how many entrances and parking lots there are. These will help you navigate the lines and whether or not you’re likely to run into issues. Let’s run through an example with Yosemite, based off of my previous experiences and mess-ups. Yosemite gets 4 to 5 million visitors per year. Some months have 100,000 visitors, while others have 500,000 or more visitors. Hint: there’s going to be longer lines to get into the park and much higher trail usage during the summer months. Winter is the off season, and between November and March is the best time to go if you want to avoid people and overcrowding. Yosemite has 5 entrances. It may benefit you to figure out which one is least used and which ones are open during the time you’ll be there (some entrances have fewer hours or are only open during busy seasons). Yosemite’s parking lots are not big enough to allow for the amount of traffic that they get. Make note of this when you’re thinking about the time you’ll be entering the park, because you might be able to get in and then not find a place to park. On one level, it’s certainly frustrating to get there and not be able to park (I once drove down an hour into Yosemite Valley and all the way back up to my campsite outside the park because there were no spots to park my car). On another level, keep in mind that Yosemite is a park that’s home to many species of plants and animals, and we’re doing great damage to them by even being in the park and building lodging structures and parking. In summary, no matter what park you’re going to, make sure you’re respecting the signs and regulations within the park, be conscious of what time of day and year you’re going, and plan carefully before heading into a park. Tip #2: Plan where to sleep months before you get there (unless you’re a road tripper and/or live in a van, I’ll have another post on this soon). Most National Parks have a reservation system that lets you reserve months in advance, and if you don’t, you can’t stay within the parks. There’s rarely an opening if you just decide to show up (unless you’re at a less popular park, in which case you might get lucky). Don’t plan on just showing up and getting lodging or a campsite. Decide what kind of traveler you are and make some decisions. This might include whether you’re willing to park on the side of the road in a forest, find BLM land or a national forest campsite every day, or that you never want to camp and only want to stay in a hotel type structure (if this last one is you, you’re going to struggle money and scheduling wise). Keep in mind that you’ll need to have your own gear if you want to camp, and there’s certain regulations with food and bathroom supplies in certain areas (bears like food and toothpaste, and they’re not afraid to come find it. Follow regulations). Ultimately, it’s up to your budget and your personal taste. I don’t know much about hotels and lodging around National Parks, but I do know that they’re extremely expensive. If you’re new to camping, I’d recommend camping inside the parks (it will typically cost $25-$50 per night). If you’re experienced enough, go more off the beaten path and find a free campsite or National Forest campsite that has pretty much nothing but a place to park. I would only recommend this last option to people who know how to stay safe outdoors and know what kind of wildlife is in the area (or have the ability to research it). I honestly couldn’t have lived in my car at free campsites without my partner, who taught me many things about living outside with little to no resources (I’m not sure he knows this, but I was basically clueless on most primitive camping techniques before I met him). Tip #3: Know your limits and hiking level. Don’t make the mistake of just looking at the distance of a trail. First, know what elevation you’re at. If you live at sea level and you’re trying to hike at 11,000 ft above sea level, you’re probably going to struggle more in this environment. That’s because oxygen levels are a lot lower at higher elevations. Second, think about humidity. I live in New York, a fairly humid climate, and hiking at the Grand Canyon was like my own personal hell. Third, know how sunny it’s going to get and how much the direct sunlight effects you (I didn’t know how much direct sunlight killed my energy until recently, and now I try to bring long sleeve shirts or a light jacket to help with that). Fourth, know what temperature it’s going to be. As with anything on this list, the temperature can change what gear you should bring, how much water you’ll need, and whether or not you’ll want to (or be able to) do certain hikes. Lastly, know how much sleep, food, and water you need for the amount of exercise you’re going to do. I know that I need a good sleep to be able to hike to my full potential, and that I need to eat a fair amount the night before a long hike (or I’ll be struggling within the first few miles). When in doubt, more sleep probably won’t hurt. Be careful with the amount of food and water that you consume and take with you. In places like the Grand Canyon, drinking too much water can actually hurt you and imbalance your electrolytes. I don’t have space to go into that here, but hopefully I will in the future (there’s also great resources such as the National Park Service websites or Park Rangers that can help you with this). Tip #4: Come prepared. This is tied in with the previous tip a little, but I think it’s worth going into this on more of the money saving side. Safety is the number one priority, but if we can save money as well, why wouldn’t we? Bring your own food. If you can, on the way into the park or your campsite, stop at a grocery and get food for the time that you’ll be in the park. Make sure it’s enough to sustain the number of people you have with you over the number of days that you’ll be there with the amount of exercise you’ll be doing. 1000 calories per day per person isn’t going to cut it. Remember: nature doesn’t care about your diet plan (and neither should you) while you’re hiking. Come with your gear. If you’re camping, come with your tent or hammock. If you’re doing a long hike, come with your poles (if needed). Come with a functional backpack that can carry at least two liters of water at a time, plus anything extra you’d want to bring (such as a camera, jacket, or hat). Come with a first aid kit. Even hiking short distances, cuts and scrapes can happen. At the very least, bring some bandaids and sterilizing pads/wipes. If you’re hiking for days or in backcountry, you’ll want more than that. Tip #5: If you come with a group (or family), remember that everyone has different hiking levels. Figure out how to deal with this before planning your hike. Decide whether you’ll all be doing the different hikes, or whether you’ll all attempt the same hike. Above all, be safe. If you have to turn back, there’s nothing wrong with that. At the North Rim Grand Canyon, I met a woman who’d hiked the entire Grand Canyon almost 30 times. Her family came to see her and wanted to hike a bit of it. Regardless of the fact that she’d hiked the entire thing so many times, she knew that since she was pregnant she didn’t want to hike as much as her family was. There’s nothing wrong with that, and she was smart to turn back for her own safety. Many people won’t do this because they feel like “quitters.” It may be difficult, but try not to see it as quitting, but making a conscious choice to remain safe rather than risking your health or life. Personally, I have my partner go ahead of me sometimes because I have asthma and tend to hike slower than he does. It can get frustrating to have to go slower, but it’s better than my lungs closing up. If I go slower, I’ll still make it there, just not at the same time as my partner."
Medium.com,Life,9 Years of World Travel with Very Little Money,Travel,https://medium.com/the-ascent/9-years-of-world-travel-with-very-little-money-bf47ed6fe77c?source=topic_page---------570------------------1," “You must make a lot of money!” my friend Kim said to me the other day when I was recounting my summer travels. I can see why she might assume so. I’m 30 years old, and in the past 9 years I’ve been to 31 countries, lived in 5 foreign countries, and have only spent about 2.5 of those years in my “home” country. She’s wrong, though. I make around $13,000 per year, approximately. Some years it’s $9,000. Once it was around $20,000. I don’t work that much. 12–22 hours per week. Right now I make around $20 per hour teaching English online. And I travel (meaning I go somewhere and stop most of my work) around 1–4 months per year. My longest trip was 7 months. Now, I do have a fair amount of privilege to be able to do this. Not everyone in the world can do this. But anyone who meets most or all of the following (very lucky) conditions can…and I suspect that a fair few of you lovely readers fall into that category! Here are some tips on how to make it happen, assuming (like me) you don’t make much money: First and foremost, you’re gonna have to get comfortable with the idea of making some sacrifices. Haven’t you heard the saying “The path of least resistance is the path of least reward?” Actually, I don’t like that saying. It’s a platitude and it’s and not always true. But in this context it applies, so you’re gonna have to get behind it starting now. This step is the most important, and it also appears to be the hardest. It’s where the majority of travel dreams die. Decide how much you can realistically save within a timeframe that feels good to you, and weigh that against how long you’d like to travel for and how expensive your desired region is. This step is gonna involve arithmetic. And research. But more than anything, this involves proactivity. Don’t know where to start? Start anyway. Start with posting your questions on facebook groups and other online forums geared towards the region you want to visit. Get ‘Tinder Passport’ and ask guys and girls in your desired region whatever you need to know. In other words, be resourceful. In order to actually leave for your first long-term trip, you have to commit yourself to your budget. You must keep your focus. You can’t impulsively go on a shopping spree or get that expensive haircut. Are you traveling less than 2 miles? Use your damn legs, fool! Especially if you were thinking about Uber. Don’t you dare. You can’t even buy your lunch at that restaurant near your work. No! From now on, you pack your lunch, which you make yourself, in your kitchen, out of fresh produce from your nearest bargain grocery store. And you watch your diet and take care of your health, because medical expenses add up quickly. And you tally your monthly expenses. And you figure out how much you can realistically save every month if you cut most of the luxuries. And then you keep track. If you aren’t cool with cutting the luxuries, make a realistic budget based on how much you can save every month if you just make whichever sacrifices you’re willing to make. Let me unpack that a bit: Think carefully about what sacrifices you’re willing to make in pursuit of this dream. Then commit to them. Then make them. If your budget allows for it, maybe you can still get the fancy haircut or eat your lunch in a restaurant. I was mostly just being snarky before. But in all likelihood, you really are gonna have to make some sacrifices. For example, I don’t drink alcohol or do drugs. That right there saves a lot of money. But I do have a sugar addiction, and try as I might I have to acknowledge that I will realistically buy approximately one pastry every day. Plan some money-saving travel hacks. I’m making a list just for you, in order of lowest to highest on the scale of daredevil intrepid travel hacks: Don’t change places too often. Transportation is expensive. Choose a cheap region. In order, here are (in my experience/research) the cheapest regions: I have never been to Africa but I know that Egypt is South Asia cheap, and lovely. Can’t comment on other African countries but I know some are very affordable. Be ok with spending some time off the beaten tourist trail. Regular, everyday areas are cheaper than super famous touristy city centers. They’re also often more authentic in terms of culture. I usually go to places where I will indeed meet other travelers, but they’re usually smaller/less touristy than the absolute most famous spots. I’m talking second or third-tier tourist destinations, in terms of popularity. For example, go to Dresden instead of Berlin. Toulon instead of Paris. Oaxaca instead of Cancun. Lecce instead of Venice. Gokarna instead of Goa. Hoi An instead of Halong Bay…you get the picture. Use Workaway. You can find hosts in every country offering free accommodation and usually free food in exchange for around 20–25 hours of work per week. You can work in a resort. Or in a hostel. Or in an eco-community. Or on a farm. Or in a school. Or in an NGO. Or in someone’s house. The list goes on but those are the most common. Plus, with Workaway, the hosts usually show you around the region. Local knowledge! If you do use Workaway, try to find a host that hosts multiple workawayers at one time, and make sure there are other volunteers during your dates. That way you have a ready-made community of friends. In 9 years, those types of workaways have been hands down my best and most memorable travel experiences. Understand that what the media tells you about nearly everywhere else being ‘unsafe’ is mostly fear-mongering. Do your own research. Post in expat forums for that place you’re curious about, but a little bit scared of. Sit back and read the flood of responses reassuring you that many travelers like yourself do indeed spend months at a time there living like regular people without ever fearing for their lives. Couchsurf. There are strangers all over the world who want to let you stay in their homes for free, just because they want to meet people from other countries, or maybe because they’re repaying a favor from their own travels. I have done this on many occasions and have never had an issue with safety, except for the time my host was probably a bit unsafe because by the time I left I would have liked nothing more than to punch him in his ignorant face. But that’s a story for another day. If you are scared of Couchsurfing because you’ve heard bad things about it, try Trustroots or Be Welcome instead. They have better reputations but offer the same service. Camp. Many countries allow wild camping and are temperate enough that you won’t be super sweaty or freezing cold. If you’re really low-maintenance and you go to a warm country you can literally just string your hammock up between two trees somewhere. Camp and also ride your bike. Long bike trips, aside from the cost of the bike and the camping gear, are pretty low-budget. Plus then you can use Warm Showers, an app like Couchsurfing, but specifically for bicyclers. Hitchhike. If you do indeed want to change places a lot and transportation is out of the budget, hitchhiking is a great way to meet new people. Here are all the scary things that happened the last few times I’ve hitchhiked: Dumpster dive behind grocery stores. In Australia, this is a very common practice among backpackers. Myself and 2 guys used to go on a 2–5 hour dumpster mission with a van in the middle of the night about once per week. Usually we could feed all 8–12 people in the house for about a week after that. If you’re willing to literally get your hands dirty, there is a lot of good food in there that didn’t need to get thrown away. Good as new after a simple rinse in the sink. Get a work visa somewhere. If you’re under 31 and you have a good passport, chances are you’re eligible for a working holiday for a year each in both Australia and New Zealand. Live in a shar- house with 6–12 backpackers from around the world, work your butt off and play even harder for a year with your new multi-national friends who you know better than anyone should ever know anyone due to the cramped conditions in which you’re living together, and spend the next 7 months traveling in Asia. Or, get a job teaching English overseas. Even if you’re not a native speaker this is viable depending on the country you want to work in, assuming you are fluent or close to it. Become an online English tutor and work from anywhere with good internet. Viable for anyone with a very strong grasp on the English language with good grammar and pronunciation who is willing to obtain a TEFL or TESOL certificate (Around $20 on Groupon) and who either has a bachelor’s degree or the lack of moral character necessary to have one fabricated online instead. Don’t be a princess about accommodation. If the worlds craziest insomniac (yours truly) can learn to sleep soundly with earplugs and an eye mask in a dormitory, so can you. If you’re trying to get the cheapest accommodation possible and you’re going to Central America or South Asia, don’t book online. You’ll likely find something cheaper by walking around and looking at places in person. Don’t do organized tours. Find a friend on Couchsurfing (or even Tinder) to show you around instead. Don’t gloss over references. If you’re doing Workaway or Couchsurfing, read the hosts references. That’s the part that really tells you what to expect. If a guy on CS has references only from women, maybe pause before staying with him. If he has ‘would not stay again/would not recommend’ references…read them carefully and again, maybe don’t stay with him. If you’re worried, only stay with women. Listen to your gut when hitching. If you want to be really super safe, if you’re a female traveling alone only go with women, couples, or guys your gut loudly says are safe. Like old men whom you could easily overpower, for instance. There you have it, folks… How to make your travel dreams a reality. Again, the most important point is simply number one: Get comfortable with the idea of making some sacrifices! All snarkiness aside, I think the main characteristic that has enabled me to live this lifestyle is my commitment to being comfortable in a variety of circumstances. I strive to feel equally at ease whether I’m flying first class or sleeping in a dorm with rats scurrying under the beds. (In 9 years, that only happened once. Don’t worry. But really it was more amusing than disconcerting.) It’s like that old Buddhist proverb about how it’s easier to simply wear shoes than it is to carpet the entire world. In other words, rather than changing your outer circumstances, you adjust your mindset so that you’re comfortable with your outer circumstances. If you have the aforementioned privileges and you actively cultivate the mental flexibility to feel comfortable in a vast array of circumstances, the world truly awaits you."

And I was so proud of him. Okay, that’s obviously a joke. He wasn’t on the brink of death that much, but he was too close for comfort. I was slightly proud of him because he was trying new things, though. The dude’s never snorkeled in his life. He never wore flippers in his life. He just didn’t understand how to use them. He has since stated he doesn’t want to do a cruise again and I really hope that terrifying experience didn’t turn him off to it. Because looking like an idiot/having close calls is part of traveling. It means you had the courage to try new sh*t, which is more than what I can say for most other people. Just accept that fact and wear it as a badge of honor."

I normally avoided the beach on a Saturday because there were just too many people. But I couldn’t resist the sun, so I headed out after a late breakfast to walk the four kilometers to the shore. This was not a pristine Gulf of Thailand beach with calm warm waters lapping clean white sand. No. This was a polluted strip of garbage-strewn dirt on the northern tip of Hainan Island in China where black oily water came in as riptides on the best of days. The province of Guangdong could be seen through the smog across the narrow strip of water that separates the island from the mainland and container ships filled the channel. I had swum in this water exactly once and I’d vowed never to enter it again. The bottom was a sticky sludge that made it difficult to walk the roughly 100 meters to the deeper water, and the choppy waves that came in from every direction made it difficult to swim. Plus, the water smelled faintly of sewage. I spread my mat on the dirty sand and put in my unplugged headphones. On that day I wanted only sun and peace. Ignoring the people standing around me who made comments on my waiguoren(foreigner) body while attempting to practice their English, I drifted off into a half sleep. After awhile, I thought I heard someone yelling “jiu ming”, the Mandarin equivalent of “save me”, but screaming children and the chatter of conversation made it impossible to be sure. I kept hearing it though, and pulling my headphones out, I sat up and looked out to the water. I could see a number of people standing at the edge of the waves looking out toward a man’s head and a waving arm. I heard the cry again, unmistakable this time, but no one was making any move to help. I grabbed the swim goggles from my bag and walked down to the edge of the shore. I asked a man looking out what was happening and I thought he said that one was already under the water. I figured I must’ve misunderstood him; the local dialect on Hainan can be difficult to decipher even for native speakers. But, there was clearly one person who needed help so I ran out into the waves. I was swimming 4000 meters every morning in the university pool, and I considered myself a strong swimmer. I also knew that swimming was not a sport widely practiced in China, so perhaps no one was helping because no one there could swim. As I waded out through the muck into deeper waters, I heard the bystanders calling to each other: “The foreigner is going out. We should go out.” That was a relief because I knew I would need help to pull the man to shore in the rough waves. I got to the deeper water and started to swim. Just as I reached the man, other swimmers arrived, two of the men I had seen watching from the shore, good swimmers after all. I was shocked when they pulled you up from under the water. Your exhausted companion was the one calling for help as he’d tried to pull you head above the waves. With the help of one of the other swimmers, I towed your limp body to the shore. As we got you to the water’s edge, the man dropped you and backed away. “He’s dead,” he said in a disgusted tone. You weren’t breathing and I couldn’t find a pulse but I had to try. I pointed to one of the bystanders and told her to call 1–1–9, China’s emergency number, and I started CPR. I’d had CPR training a few times, but it’s hard to do on a person without someone else to assist. The crowd had quickly closed a circle around us but no one seemed interested in helping. Finally I got a man to do chest compressions while I did the breathing, but I couldn’t get him to press on your breastbone. He insisted on pumping over your stomach, causing the still-fresh remnants of your lunch to fly from your mouth into mine. I had to spit out mouthfuls of magenta beet and orange carrot with every exhale. But there was no time to be disgusted. You were not breathing. You had no pulse. Your skin was changing color and your open eyes were slowly becoming the dull milky fish eyes on display at the market. I was more and more frantic, even slapping your face. “No, No! Come back!” I screamed. No response. I spit out another mouthful of your lunch when I realized that a uniformed man was calmly peering over my shoulder. It was one of the medics who had arrived. I jumped back and yelled at him to help. I was clearly fading and you were probably already dead, but why wasn’t the medic rushing to take over? Finally, he and the other responders calmly pulled you over to where their equipment was set up and they began to artificially inflate your lungs with some type of breathing apparatus. I could see your chest rising and falling, as if you were taking huge breaths. I silently begged them to work a miracle, to bring you back. As I stood gasping for air, the crowd moved over to surround the new spectacle. I asked no one in particular why they hadn’t gone in to save you immediately. The woman who had called the emergency line looked sheepish. “It was too late,” she said. “No one could swim,” another man offered. “He was drunk and deserved it,” hissed the old man next to me. “Thank you for trying,” the woman finally mumbled to me. “We are embarrassed today.” I was crying by then, irrational, angry at the bystanders, the medics, the whole Chinese nation. How could people be so callous? And, I felt responsible for your death, for not saving you, even though I couldn’t have done anything more. I tried to tell myself that your friend could have drowned, too, but he didn’t, so something good had been done. Still, I was devastated. I gathered my possessions and began the walk back to the student dormitory. Somehow my shoes had disappeared in the commotion but I barely registered my cut feet when I got back. I took a long shower and collapsed into bed still sobbing. I felt haunted that night and for the next week. I couldn’t eat. I couldn’t sleep. Every time I closed my eyes I could see your eyes, the life slowly going out of them. When I was awake, it felt like you were in my body, looking out of my eyes. The feeling got more intense by the day until I felt like I was losing my mind. I’d held your body, sealed my lips over yours, tasted the food you ate, and now you were inside me. The most intimacy I’d felt in years; how could you be dead? I found a brief report of the incident online. You were young, 25, your parents’ only child, in town to visit your friend who was a graduate student at the same university I attended. You couldn’t swim and so you’d drowned, one of over a dozen drownings that had occurred on that beach in the previous year according to the article. There was no miracle. The next Saturday, I walked back to the beach in a driving rain, desperate to feel sane again, to be free of your ghost, something I didn’t even believe in. As I walked, I felt you behind me, a scruffy little dog following me back to where you had gotten lost. “I’m so sorry, but you can’t stay with me,” I told you. “This is where you belong.” I cried and watched the waves until I was soaked to the skin and then walked home, feeling that I was alone in my body for the first time in a week. Relieved, and maybe just a little bit lonely."
Medium.com,Life,The downside of traveling no one ever talks about,Travel,https://medium.com/@philbabic/the-downside-of-traveling-no-one-ever-talks-about-f8875dafd207?source=topic_page---------575------------------1," The wave is coming at you. You’re lifting yourself on your board. As you get up, you begin gliding for about ten meters or so. Suddenly, the force of the water knocks you over the board. You lift yourself up, as you look down the long sandy beach, while the Sun is shining above you. In the middle of January. There’s a slight breeze hitting your cheeks. You’re quite literally on the other side of the planet, thousands of kilometers away from your home. Alone. You’re free in the way you could never be in your homeland. Everything appears perfect. Is it? There’s no doubt traveling brings you a plethora of benefits. Yet, that’s not all that comes your way once you begin voyaging into the world. Aside from hitting your wallet hard, traveling can bring you plenty of discomforts. You may suffer food poisoning, cultural shocks, or homesickness, just to name some. Your safety is another issue worth addressing. However, all these downsides are widely known and widely discussed. There’s one; however, I noticed people rarely (if ever) address. It may seem absurd at first thought. Isn’t the whole point of traveling the enrichment of your soul and the widening of your mind? Doesn’t your spirit become wild and free? It sure does. But bear with me. Homesickness is the perfect example of this travel-related melancholy that hits people. And it hits hard. When you spend a significant amount of time abroad, you can’t but be drawn to your homeland. Perhaps it’s the people you’re missing. Or it could be food. Whether it’s your culture or a familiar mentality, something “gets under your skin.” You can’t but be compelled to go back. You yearn for the land that birthed you. However, homesickness is understandable. After all, you have spent a better portion of your life among your people. Most of your days were spent walking along the same streets of your hometown over and over. You know your culture like the back of your hand. Additionally, we get attached to people, so it’s quite logical that you would miss your family and friends. Yet, the same storm enters our hearts as we leave behind any other place we got attached to. Leaving a foreign land leaves you in the state of unrest. There’s an inexplicable itching to head back, which is somewhat alright if you’ve been to only one place. However, as you visit an increasing number of countries, you start leaving little pieces of your soul there. The more lands you explore, the more soul pieces you trade. Some people never abandon their countries. Many stay in their hometowns, to be more precise. They live happy lives. My experience with such people tells me that they mostly don’t think about the world. Their realms extend to the edge of their county or the state. Everything beyond is insignificant, non-existent even. Such people, as kind as they are, aren’t characterized by a particular complexity. They lack a certain depth to their character. Their views of the world are quite narrow. Moreover, I have noticed that people who don’t travel are usually more ungrateful and pessimistic. Though, that’s another story altogether. On the other hand, in all their simplicity, these non-travelers are seemingly whole. Their issues are rarely related to an existential crisis. It seems to me that the smaller your world (rather, your perception of it), the less existential issues or discomforts you’ll have. On the other hand, all the crusaders I met in life, albeit happy, seemed torn between places. It’s almost as if you can see their skin itching to keep adventuring. They want to go back to some of the most amazing places they visited. Perhaps to once again enjoy the beauty of nature. But maybe they also just want to feel whole again. As you voyage to certain places, granted, you’ll leave a chunk of yourself there, but you will also gain some back. I guarantee you — travel to any developing country, spend some time there, and you’ll be forever changed. You’ll see how people smile despite their hardship. You’ll see people playing sports, dancing, families spending time together, friends drinking and singing on the beach. In spite of poverty, they are grateful, they enjoy life. And we’ll always be blind to their ways of living unless we spend some time among them. Nevertheless, it’s highly unlikely you’ll understand what the proper way to live is by visiting a single foreign land. Traditions vary significantly across the globe. Values, too. But, as you voyage into the unknown, you pick up some wisdom, you start piecing together the great puzzle of life. The internet cannot teach you how to do this. Books, as amazing as they are, aren’t enough. Your personality, your values, at some point, stop representing the values of your people. Instead, as time passes and you keep cruising the planet, you embody the best of each nation. And a bit by bit, you become a true representative of the human species, a blend of seemingly incompatible cultures and mentalities. You’re trading your soul for wisdom, in many ways. As you continue journeying across the Earth, you’ll give away more of yourself. You may never again feel at rest, not even in the comfort of your own bed. As much as you appreciate making yourself a cup of coffee in the morning and reading newspapers in the privacy of your home, your heart will yearn for adventure. But life gets in the way. Work keeps you from exploring the world. Family is relying on you to help them out. Friends are seeking your guidance. You have duties. Due to those obligations, you cannot simply pack a suitcase and leave. It seems to me that there’s no cure for the melancholy of this kind. The heart wants what the heart wants. It desires to enjoy the beauty of vast lands of ours, to stand on the edge of a cliff as you look into the infinite horizon. Your heart craves tasting foreign beers, snacking on exotic food, seeking other lost souls. All in the hope of feeling whole again. Yet, you won’t be. Possibly, never again. That’s just the price you have to pay for wisdom, experience, laughter, and long talks with strangers, among other treasures of traveling. Keep journeying, and give yourself to the world some more. It’s absolutely worth it. Thank you for reading this short story of mine. I hope we meet on the road someday!"
Medium.com,Life,Bhutan — My first Solo Trip,Travel,https://medium.com/@niharika.goel/bhutan-my-first-solo-trip-1d6baf843288?source=topic_page---------576------------------1," I had recently taken a break between switching jobs. With just 2 weeks in hand, did some googling about weather, budget and safety, and I finally zeroed down to Bhutan! Not only this place is rich in culture but also you will find serenity and warmth by locals. I stayed for 7 nights and 6 days in the month of April. And here comes the best part: This was also my first solo trip in my life. With mixed feelings of excitement, nervousness and yes, loneliness I decided to overcome all and plan this trip. I tried contacting some tour operators for the trip but because of dates and overall budget, I decided to make the bookings all by myself. In 7 days of the trip, I covered Pheuntsholing, Thimphu, Punakha and Paro. I stay in Bangalore and thus, booked flight ticket from Bangalore to Bagdogra. I will share day wise itinerary below and most importantly general points to keep in mind before you plan to visit Bhutan. I spoke to many solo travelers (blogs and travel forums) who had been to Bhutan before to plan my itinerary. ▪ You can get permit either from government office at Pheuntsholing or at Paro airport. ▪ Local people fluently speak English language and you will find many Indians working in Bhutan. ▪ In general cabs are expensive in Bhutan, hardly you will see intra-city buses. I highly recommend booking full day cab (approx. INR 2500 per day WagonR, Indica) which would save both time and money. ▪ Indian currency is accepted everywhere. Indian currency notes which are accepted are 100 and 500. INR 2000 NOTES ARE NOT ACCEPTED. Also, if you swipe Indian credit or debit card, that will cost you hefty transaction charges. Thus, I would suggest carrying enough cash to make all payments. ▪ Almost all Indian groceries are available at Bhutan grocery stores. Moreover, prices are also same (mentioned in INR) which you pay in India. Here is my day wise itinerary: Flight from Bangalore to Bagdogra. After 3 hours of flight journey, I booked a cab from Bagdogra to Pheuntsholing, which approximately takes 4-5 hours. On the way, you will see many flyovers under construction and roads are in decent condition. I had booked one-night stay in Park Hotel, which is walkable distance to Permit office. You can read more about my hotel stay in the link below. I reached permit office around 2PM to complete immigration formalities. I was little worried as there was not much clarity if Bhutan government provides permit easily to solo travelers. To my surprise, the whole process was very smooth. The immigration officer enquired about my itinerary and wished me pleasant stay. More details here how to get permit easily and buying SIM card in Bhutan. After completing all the immigration formalities and buying SIM card, I headed to bus stand which is around 400meters from hotel to buy bus ticket to Thimphu for next day. In the evening, I visited Karbandi monastery which was my first visit to monastery in life! The monastery was so peaceful with great view from top. You will hear many people chanting Om mani padme hum (pronounced as Om mani peme hung), which has several interpretation and most common meaning offered for the mantra is “Praise to the jewel in the lotus”. You can read about the benefits of chanting the mantra here. Few rules mentioned by the monastery authority were — After spending serene time there in monastery, I headed back to hotel to call the day off. I decided to head to Thimphu and explore the place for next 2 days. One-way bus ticket costed INR220 and had specific timings. It was a 16-seater mini-bus and the earliest time was 7AM to leave from Pheuntsholing. From Pheuntsholing, it takes approximately 4 hours to reach Thimphu bus stand. The overall bus journey was mesmerising, driven between mist and cloud. The roads were very well maintained and in case if the road were not smooth, you may see a board of “INCONVENIENCE REGRETTED”. The fear in me as solo traveler gradually started to turn into joy and excitement! I checked-in to Dorji elements hotel (which is approx. 2km from bus stand). More details here regarding hotel stay and amenities provided by them. Places which I planned to cover in Thimphu were Buddha Point, Simply Bhutan, Institute of Zorig Chusum, Folk Heritage Museum, Memorial Chorten and Junghi handmade paper factory. More details here related to entry fees and which all places to include in your itinerary in Thimphu. After resting a bit in hotel, I took an evening walk and explored nearby places by foot. One important point to note is if you plan to visit Punakha, you need to apply separate permit for Punakha from Thimphu. The immigration process is simple and just requires you to submit following documents – ● Voter ID or passport xerox copy ● Thimphu or Paro permit xerox copy ● One application stating that you are responsible for your own well being ● Punakha hotel stay xerox copy ● Permit application form (will be provided by Thimphu immigration authorities) You can submit all the documents and come back to collect the permit document (signed document) within 2hours. I checked-out from the hotel around 7am and went to bus station to board bus for Punakha. The departure time of buses from Thimphu to Punakha is 8am till 2pm. Overall bus journey takes around 3.5hours. It is highly recommended to book your bus ticket in a day advance to avoid any last-minute hustle. Since I had just planned a day in Punakha, I covered Punakha Dzong and did Mo Chhu river rafting. Here are more details about distance from bus stand to river rafting point, overall cost of rafting and entry fees to Punakha dzong. After covering those places, I took a shared cab from Punakha Dzong and checked-in to my hotel. I was staying in Meri Puensum resort which is on a hill top. From the room, you can see mesmerizing view of Punakha and misty clouds in morning. You can read more about my experience here. This was my last morning in Punakha and I decided to start my bus journey for Paro around 7:30am. There is no direct bus or taxi from Punakha to Paro. Instead all buses and cabs will first reach Thimphu (bus stand) and from there to Paro. I took a taxi from Punakha to Thimphu (reached in 1.5hours) and then from Thimphu to Paro (1.5hours). Buses approximately take 2 hours each way as compared to taxi and have specific timings. I planned to stay 2 days in Paro and decided to cover Chele La Pass, National Museum of Bhutan and Rinpung Dzong on first day. For second day, I had just kept the most awaited Tiger’s nest trek and monastery. Paro was cooler in terms of weather as compared other places in Bhutan. After reaching Paro bus stand around 1pm, I decided to book full day cab. After talking to multiple cab drivers and hotel staff, I booked cab from bus stand which costed me much less as compared to price quoted by cab drivers at Thimphu bus stand and hotel staff. You can read more about my first day experience! I had booked Soenam Tshkong resort which was little away from the city but very close to Tiger nest monastery. The resort was hardly a year old and had spacious rooms. You can read more about the resort here. After returning from Ripdung Dzong, I called it for the day. After a sound sleep, I woke up by 5:30am and got ready for the most awaited Tiger’s nest trek. I had my breakfast in resort and started from hotel around 7:00am. I walked around 4km and reached the base point, where you can buy the entry ticket to Tiger’s Nest monastery (INR 500 per person). It took me approximately 2 hours to reach the monastery and 1 hour to come back to the base point. You can buy wooden stick (INR 50) to take support while trekking. In between the trek, there is a small restaurant where you can get snacks, water and use restroom. On the way of trek, you will meet many other travelers motivating each other to reach till monastery. The moment you are close to reaching the monastery, you will see magnificent view of Paro and the monastery. In case you are not accompanied by guide (which was my case), Taktsang monastery authorities will provide a guide free of cost. Clicking pictures and bags are not allowed inside, you can keep your belongings in the designated storage area free of cost. You will hear interesting stories about the monastery from guide and it is said that whoever makes a wish inside that monastery is fulfilled by the Guru Rinpoche. Here are helpful tips for people who are planning to visit Taktsang monastery. After completing the tiring trek around 2pm, I decided to rest for the remaining day in the hotel. This was my last day in Paro and in Bhutan. I had booked my return flight from Paro to Delhi. An elderly Indian couple was going back to Pheuntsholing and offered me ride in their car till airport. It was 30 minutes’ drive from hotel to airport and cab charges approx INR500 for one-way trip. Paro airport is a small airport and has 3 boarding gates. Airport authorities told that only 8 pilots (that’s what the figures they mentioned in April) have the license to fly from Paro. Paro airport is considered one of the world’s extreme plane landing and take-off airports. Landing and take-off is in between the mountains and is definitely a breath-taking experience! In general, the flights to Paro are expensive, run on specific days and on specific routes. Thus, would recommend to book flight tickets in advance. There are 2 airlines which run from Paro — Druk Air and Bhutan Airlines. While flying from Paro to Delhi, there is a stopover to Kathmandu and one can see Mt. Everest and other Himalayan peaks from the plane (on a clear sky). To watch the spectacular view, I would suggest to check-in early and reserve right side window seat if flying from Paro. Being a solo traveler, not even for a single moment in Bhutan I felt that I am away from family, whoever I met during this trip treated me like their family member. With so many wonderful memories, I promised myself to visit this beautiful country again 😊"

Though some people I spoke with and articles I read were supportive about solo travel, there were many that were not. The night before I left, I considered how much money I would lose if I chose not to go. I booked housing and transportation between cities prior to leaving. For me, having this figured out was worth the sacrifice of sticking to a plan and not having the freedom to make certain choices spontaneously. I did not plan any days out, but made brief lists of potential activities and eateries I was recommended and found online. Organizing a trip to countries I had never been to before was difficult. I booked things off of websites I didn’t know much about. I had little to no idea what commute and public transportation would look like. I chose to pack fairly light, taking a carry on and a purse. I had access to laundry facilities in a few of my stops. Having minimal to keep track of made getting around easier. Packing lightly also allowed me to save a considerable amount of money since I did not have to pay for luggage."

hen I first applied to be an English teacher abroad, I was naive, believing that the experiences I was seeing and reading on social media would be my own. Teach all week; play all weekend. I imagined myself trekking through China or South Korea. How could I not when these language schools fawned over my Curriculum Vitae: over ten years of teaching; five-years working with ESL learners; experience with K-12 students — even with special needs. I gave my school my two-week notice. I was going abroad. The only thing these language schools insisted on was that I follow up by sending an attached head shot. Afterwards, that’s when the communication stopped. “They want teachers of European descent,” the message board read. “If they were in dire need, they’d even take black teachers, but they rarely accepted Asian teachers, unless they were biracial. And even if they are, they have to pass as white.” I took an ESL/ESOL certification course in Cleveland, which guaranteed placement. It was an 6-week, 8-hour course with mostly white women who had never taught before. I was paying the $1,000.00 for the certificate. When it was time to talk placement, I spoke privately to the instructor about my past experiences. “It happens,” he said. “Let me see what I could do.” After a month and a half of classes, still no school in South Korea would talk to me after seeing my head shot. My friend jested that I use his photo. Another recommended that I Photoshop my face. “Lighten it up and round out the eyes.” I laughed externally, but inside I was devastated. Did they think I had an accent? If only they could hear me, they’d hire me. I did get a phone call from a recruiter. The school was in Mexico. I’d have to pay my own way, then take a 4-hour bus ride to the village, and pay for my lodging. After calculating a year’s salary, the number didn’t cover those expenses, let alone food and living expenses. I politely declined. When you’re living with your parents with time and tequila on your hands, dumb ideas seem like strokes of genius. What if I went to Vietnam to teach English?"
Medium.com,Life,"Discovering Mexico, One Uber at a Time",Travel,https://medium.com/one-table-one-world/discovering-mexico-one-uber-at-a-time-86f3561b5602?source=topic_page---------580------------------1," “I’m really sorry, I don’t speak Spanish very well,” I told the driver as we entered the rush hour traffic. “Don’t worry,” he replied in slightly slower Spanish than before and proceeded to tell me about his youngest daughter. She was blonde and a great source of pride and joy for him. “You see”, he said “blondes are rare in Mexico. She’s really smart too.” By the end of the drive he’d told me about his entire family, suggested I visit the neighbouring towns and recommended five dishes, all of which I wrote down and promised to try as soon as I could. While I didn’t speak Spanish initially, three weeks in Mexico had been enough for me to learn the basic sentences I needed to keep the conversation going for the twenty minute drive that separated my Airbnb from my sister’s student dorm. I could have stayed closer or chosen to walk but with an Uber costing between 1$ and 2$, I didn’t think very long before ordering one. On the first day, my vocabulary allowed me to tell the driver that I thought her city was beautiful and that I was visiting Mexico with my sister. Initially I thought that would be the end of the conversation, which only goes to show how little I knew about Mexican culture. She kept asking more questions, determined to find out where this strange non-Spanish-speaking visitor was from and what my country was like. When I answered in an awful approximation of Spanish that was mostly French with the odd Italian word thrown in, she gently guided me into the correct direction, nudging me on until my sentence sounded Spanish. This stayed much the same, regardless of who was driving me. I would utter a garbled mess of a sentence that would be repeated slowly and then replaced by the correct Spanish sentence with a question mark at the end of it. If I thought it sounded right, I would repeat the sentence without the question mark, affirming that their guess had been correct. My new attempt would be met with a big smile and fervent nodding. If I realised that I had confused my driver or that they had misunderstood, we’d try again, laughing at our failure to communicate. No one in this city seemed to speak English but what really surprised me was that no one got impatient with me for not speaking Spanish. Here I was, trying to pass off my attempts at Spanish as actual conversation and every one went along with it. What’s more, they always put in an enormous amount of effort to keep the conversation going. “Why do you always sit in the front?” my sister asked as I was going home one night. “You’re starting to remind me of grandma, always chatting to everyone.” As I tried to find a good reason for my sitting in the front seat, I realised that it wasn’t based on me becoming more social. It was, to a large extent, a reaction to the kindness of those around me. I had come to expect the warm conversations that seemed to arrive automatically in Mexico. Sitting in the back would have felt rude, as though I was trying to avoid conversation when I knew it was the part of their job drivers tended to enjoy the most. By the end of my time in Mexico I realised that I must have had conversations with over 50 different drivers. It never felt uncomfortable or forced because the questions were always genuine. I wanted to know about their culture and they wanted to know about mine. No two conversations were the same but they did revolve around the same three topics: food, family and music. I’m sure these topics are universal but there was always something that set the conversations apart. My Uber drivers did not say that family was important to them. Instead they would pick up the phone when their daughter called, have a thirty second conversation with her and then spend the next fifteen minutes telling me why she was so special. Food was the first topic that came up in every conversation. Spicyness was used as a judge of character and when I told them I had enjoyed the spicyness of Mexican food, there was a huge smile and a curt nod. The conversation could continue. Music wasn’t a hobby as much as a lifestyle. Every driver had their own playlist. When I started nodding along to a song, they would tell me about the artist and what was special about them. As we moved in time with the rhythm they would ask me about dancing classes and share their own experiences. The question was not whether to dance but which dance to pick. When my first Uber driver introduced himself and turned up the music as he gave me a tour of the city, I didn’t understand a lot of what he said. What I did understand was his kindness and the effort he put into getting to know me even though we were only spending twenty minutes together. The concern I’d felt about being unable to explore the country and truly understand the culture because we couldn’t leave my sister’s city started to melt away. I realised while I wasn’t seeing as many places as I would have liked, there was no way I was going to miss the culture; it was right in front of me. While I still don’t speak a lot of Spanish, I do feel like I’ve come a lot closer to understanding Mexican culture. It’s about warmth, dancing, family, spicy food and welcoming others, even if they’re only sitting in your cab."
Medium.com,Life,You’re Sleeping On Breakfast,Travel,https://medium.com/live-your-life-on-purpose/youre-sleeping-on-breakfast-6c43539d66fa?source=topic_page---------581------------------1," Breakfast can change your life. I’m cereal. My parents never let me and my siblings eat anything colorful for breakfast because our version of colorful meant Cap’n Crunch, Fruit Loops, and Lucky Charms. The only acceptable breakfast cereals were Cheerios (not honey-nut), Raisin Bran, and Frosted Flakes. The Frosted Flakes were clearly the best option of the three because they were frosted and you didn’t have to pick out the raisins. Subsequently, we got it into our heads that brown was the color of breakfast. If it was brown, it must be healthy, right? This meant that it was totally fine if I skipped breakfast at home and waited until I got to school where I could buy a bagel with extra cream cheese and a chocolate brownie and scarf it all down just before class started. The brownie had little colorful sprinkles on top, which made me feel like a rebel. College was a blur of all the colorful cereals I was never allowed to eat before, especially since it was available all-you-can-eat-buffet-style in the campus cafeteria. I went to classes still drunk and hungover off sugar-milk. I ate that shit for breakfast, lunch, and dinner because I was an adult now and tiny little marshmallows soaked in milk were adult food. What I’m saying is that my relationship with breakfast has been very typically American. Moving to San Francisco introduced me to avocado toast brunches on the weekends, but …actually, that’s a lie, it was french toast. With powdered sugar and maple syrup and a big dollop of whipped butter on top. I never gave breakfast the respect it deserves until I moved to Barcelona and met a girl from Cyprus who taught me that color wasn’t the enemy of breakfast. And that I could be living so much larger. One fine Saturday morning, as I sat at her table looking through my emails, my friend and her Catalonian boyfriend began to set up for breakfast. As they brought out dish… after dish… after dish… I finally had to pull my laptop off the table to make room for them."

What a ridiculous notion. Some facts before we get to it: Taiwan is shaped like a mango, or a heart, or a drumstick. Tourist guides never fail to mention this, in the same way that we think of our country as an oddly-shaped, lanky, possibly malnourished dog. Its capital city is Taipei, an area measuring 271 sq.km. with a prominent tower, warm weather, and lots of milk tea. This was the extent of my knowledge of that beautiful and admirable country, and I’ve come to admire it all the more in my six days there. Of the six days that we spent exploring Taiwan, only four were in Taipei. We spent one day along the northern coast, and another navigating the buses of Taichung. It was certainly an experience, of which I will elaborate later on, but the point is: we were determined to explore other areas outside the capital. Not everything had to be about cities, right? Northern Taiwan is a mountainous region, and to nature we returned."

t’s exhilarating to get an email from Forrest Fenn, the 89-year-old retired antique dealer from New Mexico who’s responsible for one of the biggest and most controversial treasure hunts of the 21st century. He doesn’t do phone calls anymore — he’s been losing his hearing in old age, he says — and he’s long since stopped inviting strangers to his house. Too many loonies looking for answers. But he’ll gladly correspond by email. And if you’re lucky, you might get a missive where it seems like he let a crucial detail slip. “Please don’t say I buried it,” he says, referring to the treasure chest he put somewhere in the Rocky Mountains almost eight years ago. “Just say I hid it.” I read this line over and over, wondering what he meant. It’s an odd request, as it doesn’t really admit to anything. He didn’t write “I never buried the treasure.” He just doesn’t want me to tell anybody else he did. Which means… what exactly? If his treasure chest isn’t buried, why not just say it isn’t buried? Is he trying to throw people off the scent? Or giving me an exclusive clue? Could it be that everyone is looking in the wrong direction, and I’m the first to realize that instant riches can be found without a shovel? My mind races, and I briefly consider giving up on journalism to become a full-time treasure hunter. That is the power of Forrest Fenn’s treasure. Let’s back up. Prior to 2011, if you knew the name Forrest Fenn, you were likely an antique collector with deep pockets. Since the 1970s, Fenn and his wife, Peggy, ran an exclusive, high-end art gallery in Santa Fe, New Mexico, which attracted celebrity clients like Steven Spielberg and Ronald Reagan. Fenn, an eccentric ex-pilot and real-life Indiana Jones, became a multimillionaire and amassed a personal collection that included Sitting Bull’s original peace pipe and a mummified falcon from King Tut’s tomb. His luck changed in 1988 when he was diagnosed with terminal kidney cancer. Faced with his own mortality, he came up with a crazy scheme: He would bury some of his favorite and most valuable artifacts somewhere in the mountains and then die next to them. “My desire was to hide the treasure, and let my body stay there and go back to the soil,” he explained to me. He beat the cancer and put the treasure idea on hold for two decades, until his 80th birthday, when he decided to finally go through with it (minus the dying in the wilderness part). Fenn filled an antique bronze lockbox, measuring 10 by 10 inches, with hundreds of gold coins, nuggets, rubies, diamonds, emeralds, Chinese jade carvings, and pre-Columbian gold bracelets. The contents are worth somewhere in the ballpark of one to five million dollars, based on different estimates Fenn has given over the years. Then Fenn took his treasure chest out into the Rocky Mountains and hid it. Somewhere. He wanted it to be found. That was the whole point. But he wasn’t just going to give it away. If anybody wanted to walk off with a fortune in precious gems and metals, they’d have to work for it. “This country was going into a recession when I hid the treasure,” he wrote to me. “People were losing their jobs and despair was the headline in every paper. I wanted to give some hope to those who were willing to go into the mountains looking for a treasure.” In October 2010, Fenn self-published his memoir, The Thrill of the Chase. In addition to stories about his adventures as an Air Force pilot and selling moccasins to Rockefellers, it includes a 24-line poem with cryptic instructions: “Begin it where warm waters halt / And take it in the canyon down / Not far, but too far to walk / Put in below the home of Brown.” Solve the clues — Fenn claims the poem contains nine in all — and they “will lead to the end of my rainbow and the treasure,” located “in the mountains somewhere north of Santa Fe.” At first, nobody really noticed. Thrill of the Chase was sold only at a local Santa Fe bookstore and had a print run of around 1,000. But word began to spread, and by the summer of 2011, there was a small community of hunters determined to find Fenn’s chest. Soon mainstream media caught on — there were appearances on TV, a feature in Newsweek — and before long it had evolved into a full-scale global phenomenon. Although there’s no official tally, Fenn estimates that 350,000 people from across the globe have searched or are currently searching for his treasure, and their numbers are growing every day. Dal Neitzel, 69, manages a community cable TV station in Bellingham, Washington, but his real passion is Fenn’s treasure. He’s been searching since 2013 and has taken over 70 road trips to Montana over the past seven years. He also runs a blog — named, like Fenn’s book, The Thrill of the Chase — that’s become an online hub for treasure hunters to debate and share theories on where Fenn might’ve put all that gold. Neitzel claims he gets well over 19,000 unique visitors a day, and not just from North America. “This past January, our third biggest source of traffic was Turkey,” he says. “Turkey, of all places! What is that all about?” Even though it’s been almost a decade since Fenn buried — sorry, hid — his treasure in the mountains north of Santa Fe, and roughly nine since people started looking for it in earnest, nobody has found it. How, one might reasonably wonder, could that be? Nine clues in a poem and hundreds upon thousands of active searchers and nobody has cracked the code yet? The problem with Fenn’s poem full of clues — or perhaps the reason it’s become such an obsession for so many people — is that it could be interpreted a million different ways. “Some of the most intuitive,” Fenn says, “stay quiet.” “We have no certain knowledge what the nine clues in the poem are,” says Neitzel. “Which line or word is a clue and which is not? We don’t even know for certain what the lines mean. They are interpreted by each individual differently, and we won’t know who is correct until someone finds the chest.” Which is what makes the mystery so appealing to both longtime hunters — if they just try long and hard enough, they reason, they’ll put all the pieces together — and people just learning about the treasure now. There is no disadvantage to being late to the party because maybe you’ll see something or interpret something in the poem that hasn’t occurred to anyone yet. It’s impossible to read Fenn’s poem without getting lost in the possibilities; each line is a rabbit hole. The “home of Brown,” for instance, could be Browns Canyon National Monument in Colorado, or Brown Cemetery in Montana, or Brown Hill in New Mexico. Or a cabin or a bear. Brown might not be a name at all, but something meant less literally. Maybe it’s the color brown. Or maybe the treasure is hidden under some porta-potties. (Don’t laugh; several people have already tried that.) The questions can drive you mad. This isn’t a scavenger hunt, where everybody works together and shares their progress. “We have no collective checklist,” says Neitzel. “We can only tick things off individually.” For instance, how many people have searched Ojo Caliente in Yellowstone National Park? “Tens of thousands, perhaps,” Neitzel says. “And tens of thousands more may look there before the chest is discovered. Does that mean the chest is not near Ojo Caliente? Of course not. In addition to the millions of square miles in the search area that have not been searched, there are tens of thousands that have been searched but maybe they just missed it. Did the folks who searched these spots look under every rock? In every tree? Wade the creeks? Look for signs of hidden objects? Who knows — so to be certain the place has been checked thoroughly, I have to look myself.” The people who’ve devoted years of their lives to finding Fenn’s treasure are an eccentric bunch and often seem like characters out of a Coen brothers movie. There’s Michael Hendrickson from New Mexico, who has only one leg, rides a motorcycle, and usually searches with his elderly mother; “Crayola” John, an auto mechanic who got the nickname because he invented something (nobody is entirely sure what) to protect kids from swallowing Crayola marker caps; Grandma (that’s what everybody calls her) from Connecticut, who searches with her pal Gilbert, a former Navy SEAL who currently wears a neck brace because of a car accident; “Tim Nobody,” who works for a gas company, collects pinball machines, and searches with his wife, Beachy. Neitzel recalls meeting a fellow treasure hunter in a Montana cafe, who introduced himself as a transgender priest whose congregation convinced him to go looking for the treasure to help keep the church afloat. If someone isn’t already working on a script for the nonfiction sequel to It’s a Mad, Mad, Mad, Mad World, it’s a huge missed opportunity. One of the more infamous names in Fenn treasure circles is Marti Kreis from Blue Ridge, Georgia — better known by her handle Diggin’ Gypsy. The 49-year-old mother of two has been searching for Fenn’s chest since 2013 and visits Montana an average of seven times a year, staying for several weeks at a time. She always travels by truck — a ’67 Ford she bought for $400 — and funds her trips west with yard sales. She’s usually joined by her extended family, including sisters Charissa, Tanya and Melani, brother John, daughters Lauren and Libbi, grandson Dylan, nephew Sam, niece Carlie and, room permitting, a pet rooster named John Wayne. “We’re real country people,” Kreis says. “We pack our tents and our cooler with our Spam and hot dogs and peanut butter, and that’s all we bring.” She only searches in West Yellowstone, Montana, no longer bothering with the other three states where the treasure might be hidden. She says it’s because Fenn once blogged about her, claiming “If I were a betting man I’d bet on this woman.” That’s enough for Kreis to think she’s on the right track. “He gave me the big head to think, Well dang, I’m hot. I’m in the area,” she says. “Why would I leave my spot?” Her spot, however, covers a lot of ground. “You just keep walking and thinking and looking behind every rock and every bush and every tree,” she says. Mike Dantuono, a DJ from Port Richey, Florida, is just as dedicated, and he credits the treasure hunt with inspiring him to get out of his wheelchair. In 2013, he was badly injured in a car accident, which left him partially paralyzed. “I had nine surgeries,” he says. “I’ve got five pins in me, some two-inch plates and four screws. They put cadaver bone in my neck.” He was confined to a wheelchair for a year and a half, and during that time discovered Fenn’s book. “It got me thinking,” he says. “I have six sons and two grandkids. If my body is broken, what am I going to do to support my wife and my kids? I can at least use my wit.” So he moved the family to Denver, and finding the treasure has become his full-time obsession. Dantuono left school after ninth grade, but he now pours over the works of Shakespeare and Plato, “anything Fenn mentions in his book,” he says. “You never know what might be important.” Even though he claims to have a difficult time getting out of bed — “the mechanism in my spine has started to deteriorate and my back is getting worse” — he’s taken hundreds of searching trips, from northern Montana to New Mexico, with and without his family, and has even tracked Fenn on occasion. “Nothing that invaded his privacy,” he says. “Just to see where he goes.” Dantuono believes he’s cracked around 60 percent of the clues, “but as Fenn likes to say, ‘The clues change as you do.’ So who knows how close I really am,” muses the former Floridian. The truly devoted — the ones who have adopted the search for Fenn’s treasure not just as a hobby but a lifestyle choice — meet for an annual gathering in June called Fennboree. Since 2014, when only 10 people attended, it’s grown to become a hot ticket for Fenn devotees, with hundreds descending on Hyde Park, near Santa Fe, a short distance from Fenn’s home, to mingle around campfires and share stories. The best part, according to Cynthia Meachum, who’s helped organize many of the get-togethers: “The more alcohol is consumed, the more some of these searchers have talked. One time I had a guy draw me a map of his search spot on a paper napkin,” she says with a laugh. “I still have that napkin!” With so much at stake, there are the expected rivalries and infighting. Kreis, who has become friends with Fenn in recent years, claims she’s been targeted by fellow searchers who’ve accused her of getting special advantages from Fenn. “There are a lot of backstabbers and gossipers and jealous women in this community,” she says. “When Forrest wrote those things about me, said I was closer than anybody, the women went nuts. Some of ’em are just mad that they can’t find it, so they call him a liar or accuse me of terrible things. But I think they’re just mad cause they overmaxed their credit cards and they still haven’t found it yet.” There are conspiracy theories, people who claim that the treasure never existed at all — “[Fenn] should be arrested for scamming,” a local once grumbled to the Santa Fe New Mexican newspaper — or that it was discovered long ago and never reported. Dantuono is pretty sure that “there’s someone out there doing dirty work, planting false clues.” “It’s this feeling of being alive, and being exactly where you need to be in the world.” A North Carolina woman claimed in 2014 that Fenn’s poem led her to the Christ of the Mines Shrine in Silverton, Colorado and that the treasure was actually “the eternal love of Christ.” Some frightening people have also come out of the woodwork in search of Fenn’s treasure. A 47-year-old man from Nevada was arrested in 2016 after he became convinced that the treasure was Fenn’s granddaughter, and Fenn filed for a restraining order in 2017 against a 55-year-old Texas man who repeatedly visited Fenn’s home and took pictures in his backyard. Fenn has responded to at least one overeager sleuth, who’d contacted Fenn to announce that he’d discovered the treasure’s location, with the message “Please don’t dig up my parents’ graves.” Then there are the fatalities. As of this writing, four people have died while searching for the treasure, three of them during the summer of 2017— 53-year-old Jeff Murphy, who fell 500 feet while hiking up Turkey Pen Peak in Yellowstone; 31-year-old Eric Ashby, who drowned while rafting in the Arkansas River in Colorado; and Paris Wallace, a 52-year-old pastor from Colorado, whose body was discovered seven miles away from his car in the New Mexico mountains. Fenn, who’s been loath to give away additional clues — “it’s all in the poem,” he’s told inquisitive hunters for years — has recently started sharing more details. After Ashby’s drowning, he wrote a short blog post clarifying that the chest “is not under water, nor is it near the Rio Grande River. It is not necessary to move large rocks or climb up or down a steep precipice, and it is not under a man-made object. Please remember that I was about 80 when I made two trips from my vehicle to where I hid the treasure. Please be cautious and don’t take risks.” More clues he’s revealed in the last few years: The treasure isn’t in a mine — “I mean, they have snakes in ’em,” he’s said — or a tunnel. It’s between 5,000 feet above sea level and 10,200 feet above sea level. It’s not in Canada or Idaho or Utah or a graveyard. Where warm waters halt is not a dam, and it’s not “on top of any mountain [though] it may be close to the top.” When I asked why the searchers didn’t seem to be getting any closer, Fenn told me “they don’t seem to be focusing on the first clue.” He, of course, didn’t reveal what the first clue was — it might be in the first line of the poem, or it could be something else — but even vague hints from Fenn are enough to make you lose an afternoon with harebrained theories. Although the victims have gotten most of the media attention, for every fatality there are hundreds if not thousands of people whose lives have been enriched by their treasure-hunting experiences. Sometimes it’s in small ways, as is the case with Neitzel, who describes himself as being a homebody prior to learning of Fenn’s treasure. He never took a walk that wasn’t necessary, but in the past decade he’s climbed mountains and traversed thousands of miles on foot. Ask Kreis about the treasure and she’s more likely to tell you about the moose birth that she and her kids witnessed (“We seen it come out and everything”) or the five backpacks and four pairs of boots she’s gone through over the years (“We buried one of those boots out in Montana”) than whether she’s any closer to finding gold. She used to be timid, she says, and during her first treasure-hunting trips she’d cower in her tent, terrified that grizzlies or other wild carnivorous beasts were lurking outside. But after so many years of exploring the great outdoors without so much as a map, Kreis now feels fearless. “It’s changed us,” she says. “My sisters and daughters, we’re brave Viking women. Nothing scares us anymore.” Meachum, a 65-year-old retired engineer in the semiconductor manufacturing business, will gladly share tales of her adventures snowshoeing through winter storms, carrying an ice axe — “as a weapon or tool, just in case,” she says — or crawling under a barbed-wire fence and sinking into a pool of muck, thinking she could very well be swallowed and die there, and then even when she doesn’t find the treasure, realizing “I was alone in this alpine meadow on a beautiful winter day, and despite a few hazards, I was in love with life. I just can’t explain it, but it’s this feeling of being alive, and being exactly where you need to be in the world.” “I hope that I never find your treasure. The journey will be treasure enough.” For some of the searchers, like Bill Sullivan of Seattle, the mystery of Fenn’s treasure chest is quite literally all they have. Sullivan, 60, is homeless and lives mostly out of his car, and he’s been after Fenn’s secrets since 2013. It’s at least a little about the money for him, he admits. He’d like to have a roof over his head and dependable meals. But that’s not why he’s focused on Fenn’s riddle over more reasonable ways to earn an income. For him, it’s about following in the footsteps of his ancestors. “My grandfather prospected gold in Alaska a hundred years ago,” Sullivan says. “He had a sled dog team and trapped beaver. So that’s in my blood.” By hunting for treasure, he’s not hoping to become an overnight millionaire — “the idea of instant riches just doesn’t register with me,” he says — but rather to honor his family’s history, and continue a way of life he truly believes is burned into his DNA. The big question: Will Fenn’s treasure (assuming it really exists) ever be found? Why do people keep going back, year after year, when it seems increasingly unlikely that anyone will ever actually track it down? So many clues have led to dead ends, and now many of the treasure hunters are resorting to wild theories to try to crack the code. Sullivan has some especially weird ideas, claiming the trick is to “count the words between commas or periods” in Fenn’s poem. (“This method came to me in a dream,” he says, “and is why I look nowhere else.”) Neitzel, who says he has no intention of stopping until he or somebody else finds the treasure, fully admits that it’s a ridiculous thing to do with his time. “I know I’m kidding myself,” he says, laughing. “We’re talking about a ten-inch by ten-inch chest hidden somewhere in the Rocky Mountains. C’mon, let’s be realistic. That’s insane!” But he doesn’t care. “What people get wrong is, it’s not all just about finding the treasure. It’s about finding treasures, plural. It’s about getting outside and exploring. That’s why Forrest called his book The Thrill of the Chase. It’s not The Thrill of the Find.” Many of those searching claim that even if they found Fenn’s chest, they wouldn’t necessarily spend the money. “I’m going to re-hide the chest just like Fenn did,” says Dantuono. “For the same reasons he did.” Even Sullivan says he’d like to keep the chase going for a new generation. “Wouldn’t it be a hoot to be the wise guy writing the new poem?” he says. As for Fenn, who turned 89 this August, he hopes someone finds it while he’s still alive to see it, and he drops hints that some people may be closer than they realize. He’s said in the past that several people have been within a few hundred feet of the treasure and not known it. He knows this because they’ve emailed him, told Fenn exactly where they’d been and asked if they were close. Fenn, who’s not about to give anyone a free pass, said nothing. Fenn also points out that not everybody involved in the chase overshares on social media or talks to reporters. “Some of the most intuitive,” he told me, “stay quiet.” Whatever he does (or doesn’t) tell them, Fenn continues to be engaged with the treasure-hunting community. He reads every email from them, many of which can be surprisingly revealing about the type of people who would drop everything to go hunting for gold. They confess their fears to Fenn, asking not for clues but some acknowledgment that they’re unique, or at least part of something bigger than themselves. They thank him for saving their marriages, for giving them a reason to take a risk even when they feel “scared to death,” and for giving their lives meaning. “Somewhere deep inside, I hope that I never find your treasure,” one person wrote. “The journey will be treasure enough.” Fenn recently received an email from a law student, who was only just learning of Fenn’s treasure. He thanked Fenn “for reminding me of a part of who I am that has waned greatly during the last years of my legal studies. I have had the opportunity to live abroad and travel widely. But now, after law school — a black hole of creativity and childish adventure — I feel old and defeated much more often than I should.” Fenn responded with an impassioned plea that offered more clues to his real intentions than any of the secrets hidden in his poem. He told the man, “Don’t you dare work as a lawyer,” even if that career brings financial security. “If you do, you will wear a coat and tie, sit at a desk all day,” Fenn wrote. “You will not have time to smell the sky or experience the soft breeze ripe with sun. Go looking for my chest full of gold and all of the other treasures that lurk once you leave the fluorescent lights behind.”"

There were four of us on this journey. Together we met, interviewed and filmed developers, engineers and educators. These hard-working, passionate people were building amazing software and hardware in 7 different cities across the globe. The people we met were all unique characters, shaped by their upbringing and culture (and obviously their genetics). Regardless of our cultural differences, it was amazing how much we all had in common. Our similarities easily outnumbered our differences. This was 21 straight days of getting up around 6am, getting gear ready, traveling to multiple locations and shooting until the light went down. Then offloading that footage and reviewing what we shot. Followed every single night by eating and drinking way too much and going to bed way too late. Yet, I was almost never tired. It’s amazing the energy you receive from meeting, talking with, and learning from people. We would spend 3–4 days in each country, then move on. There was always something new to look forward to. On this 21-day journey I brought only a small duffel bag and a backpack. The duffel carried my clothes and toiletries (what strange word “toiletries” is by the way. What does a toothbrush and razor have to do with a toilet?). The backpack held my camera rig, two camera bodies, 5 lenses, and a laptop. Carrying this light of a load was an intentional decision. And, honestly, a bit of a test. Could I travel to 11 countries in 21 days with only two small bags? The answer is, unequivocally, yes. When it was all said and done, I could’ve even brought a few less things. Our 4-person crew on this 21-day got along magnificently. But, of course, frustrations always arise between people. We had one or two of those frustrations, and after many beers in Tokyo, they came out. It was emotional for me personally, but I’m so glad we communicated about it. We did and got past it. These are some of my favorite people, ever. It’s an amazing feeling when you have a team of people that work together so well. Whether it’s physical or emotional baggage, you just can’t hold onto things. They weigh you down. They slow you down. They get in the way of moving forward. You can’t hold onto things. They weigh you down. They slow you down. There’s a clear (but not always easy) way to get rid of emotional baggage. Communicate. Address what’s bothering you with the people who are bothering you. Let it out. Let it go. There are a few ways to get rid of physical baggage. One is to not care that you wear the same 4 shirts over the course of 21 days. Another key to a lighter load is using laundromats in whatever city you’re in. It also helps to find one with a pub nearby. We discovered that in London, and as we waiting for our laundry, we were able to meet even more great people. I believe the goal of every journey is this: I also recommend wearing comfortable shoes. About me: I’m a Partner/Creative Director at Teak in San Francisco. I’m from Colorado, moved to Chicago for 8 years then settled down in San Anselmo, California (the birthplace of mountain biking) with my wife to raise two amazing kids. I’m a huge fan of the Chicago Cubs, Denver Broncos and Peet’s Coffee. This is me on Twitter and LinkedIn. Read my previous Medium article here."

Medium.com,Life,Dark Tourism Destinations — Top Dark Tourism spots and Reasons to Visit,Travel,https://medium.com/@amytrumpeter/dark-tourism-destinations-top-dark-tourism-spots-and-reasons-to-visit-a11cd2146fc1?source=topic_page---------591------------------1," Today I’m blogging about ‘Dark Tourism Destinations’ — a new wave of either morbid or educative Tourism (depending on which way you look at it) that focuses on places of interest that reflect dark periods or horrific times in history. Yes, Dark Tourism is essentially visiting spots around the world where atrocities have taken place and been turned into museums or tourist destinations. Examples of dark Tourism destinations include the Kigali Genocide Memorial in Rwanda, Chernobyl and Auschwitz. What is referred to as ‘Dark Tourism’ has been criticised a lot by bloggers lately. Many have argued that places where genocide or nuclear disaster have hit shouldn’t be another place to tick off a list, and certainly shouldn’t be destinations for selfies or promoted as tourist destinations. Although I agree with this and would never take a selfie at a concentration camp, I’m actually an advocate of the principle of visiting dark Tourism Destinations. Let me explain why… Knowledge is power. Power to avoid racism. Power to avoid fascism. Power to educate others. It’s just disappointing that as a human race, we never really learn. Otherwise genocide would have stopped at the holocaust. Sadly and shockingly, it has not. Terminology aside, as long as we accept that visiting dark Tourism Destinations serves a purpose to educate rather than to brag and boast, visiting these memorials and museums is vitally important to our understanding of a certain countries history, as well as to our understanding of the human race as a whole. Visiting Holocaust concentration camps, war memorials and genocide museums can help us to understand the past and also the present. Here’s a collection of dark Tourism destinations that you might want to visit in order to educate yourself about the history of the nations that you travel to. Travel deeper. Understand that life is not always peachy. Respect and remember the survivors. The 1994 Rwandan genocide was one of the most brutal genocides in the history of the world. Over 800,000 people were killed mostly with machetes during the Rwandan genocide in a period of just 3 months from April that year, although they estimate that it was closer to 1 million due to unconfirmed statistics. The ‘trigger’ of the genocide was said to be the shooting down of president Habyramina’s plane, resulting in his death (along with the death of the president of Burundi). The genocide of the Tutsi’s involved the majority tribe the Hutus literally hunting them down with Machetes. There is evidence to suggest that the trigger was a mere initial catalyst to something that had been systematically planned for months, with Machetes being imported from China sold for just 50c a piece. Roots of the genocide lie deep in history, politics and colonialisation (Belgian colonisers heightened the difference between the two tribes). The Kigali Genocide Memorial is a place to remember those lost and is particularly busy around April (this is a difficult time to go to Rwanda). The memorial is accompanied by a museum that informs us of the harrowing reality of the genocide. It really is something that you need to visit if you want to understand the history and current situation in Rwanda. However, it’s not an easy thing to see. Video evidence of people literally being ‘chopped up’ s played, alongside photographic evidence and accounts of survivors. If you make it through the top floor without breaking down, I would be very surprised — photos and accounts of children and babies getting their heads smashed against walls is beyond me. Sick is the only way I can describe it. But it needs to be understood to see where the country is now regarding politics, education and health care. Paul Kagame was vital in bringing the country through the genocide and out of the other side. Kagame was born a Tutsi and his family fled to Uganda where he spent his childhood. As head of the Rwandan Patriotic Front (RPF) he invaded Rwanda in 1990 and has been hailed a hero for his role in ending the genocide. The prevalence of HIV is predominantly a result of rapes during the genocide and there are many orphans and child head of households. An understanding of the genocide informs our understanding of Rwanda today. Further Reading — Why didn’t anyone intervene in the Rwandan genocide? Auschwitz is the largest WW2 concentration camp in Europe Hitler stereotyped the Jewish race, brainwashing the German population at the time with propaganda that blamed the Jewish race for the countries problems. He reverted to what he called ‘the final solution’ — mass extermination of the whole Jewish race. By the end of WW2 in 1945 approximately 6 million Jews had been murdered by the Nazis. Auschwitz is one of the most well known of dark tourism destinations in the world. It is actually split into two parts — the concentration camp or ‘labour camp’ and Auschwitz-Birkenau — essentially a mass killing factory. Jews, the disables, gypsies and many others were systematically murdered there in gas chambers where they were killed with ‘Zyclon-B’. To truly experience Auschwitz I would advise you to book a guide. Many guides have family who were killed in the camps or who survived. You can visit Auschwitz as a day trip from Krakow or Katowice. Before you go into Auschwitz which has now developed the site into a museum, you will have the option to see a video. I’m not gonna lie — it made me feel physically sick. Particularly harrowing was the experimentations that ‘scientist’ Josef Mengele did on young children and twins. Inside the museum you will see endless collections of human hair, spectacles and suitcases, which reiterate the massive scale on which these murders took place. Photo galleries show prisoners with tears in their eyes. Nail marks are evident on the inside walls of the gas chambers where people were scraping the walls and screaming to get out. Every bullet in the shooting wall represents yet another life. Auschwitz is a traumatic trip, but essential for understanding the importance of racial and religious tolerance in our world today. Dachau concentration camp is another concentration camp built by the Nazi’s in WW2, initially to house political prisoners. It lies in the medieval town of Dachau roughly 10 miles North West of Munich. The camp was opened by the infamous SS officer Heinrich Himmler. It progressed from holding prisoners of war to being a camp to hold the Jews and eventually forced labour. There were over 32,000 deaths at Dachau by the time of liberation in 1945 and tens of thousands were sick as a result. They say that there are no birds ever sing in Dachau — I never heard any. If you visit Dachau you will see the close proximity of the living quarters — three bunks on top of each other. Apparently no-one wanted to be on the bottom bunk — that’s where the rats were, or sick, shit and piss could land on you from above. The toilets were essentially rows of holes in blocks of stone all leading into one sticking trench (these often made good hiding places for children!). The toilet ‘holes’ were right next to each other with no privacy — people forced to go in just one or two minutes in front of everyone. Standing cells where people forced to stand for days on end without food or water are still there to be seen. Dachau is raw. It’s importance? The harsh conditions that people were forced to endure at Dachau are the exact reason why we should eliminate racism and anti-semitism today — because that was the result. Between 1975 to 1979 the ‘Khymer Rouge’ (Communist party) led by Pol Pot were in control of Cambodia. Their harsh regime arrested and eventually killed diplomats and those who were seen to be associated with or conspiring with foreign governments. This escalated to the arrest of teachers, lawyers and anyone they thought to be a threat to the party, followed by their execution. City dwellers were forced to the countryside. Buddhism and any form of religion was banned. Many were worked to death or shot and over a million had be killed by the Khymer Rouge by the end of 1979. Many had been tortured before their death. Estimates for the loss of life under the Khymer Rouge go as high as around 1.7 million, this is without the figures of those who died from disease or starvation due to their policies. The ‘Killing fields’ of Choeung Ek around 9 miles from Phnom Penh has become a museum and dark tourism destination, but is just one of many ‘killing fields’ in Cambodia where genocide took place. At the Choeung Ek ‘Killing Fields’ you will see a memorial containing many skulls of the victims, thousands of skulls behind a glass screen and the S21 prison that now serves as a genocide museum. If you have time, you might also be interested in visiting Tuol Sleng. Now a museum it was turned from a high school into a brutal high security prison during Pol Pots regime. Why is it important? To understand the history of Cambodia as well as the results that can stem from harsh dictatorships. The Srebrenica massacre of 1995 was the massacre of over 8000 Bosniak boys and men during the Bosnian war. The killings or so called ‘ethnic cleansing’ were undertaken by the Bosnian Serb Army of Republika Srpska (VRS) in the small mountain town. In September and October of 1995 the Bosnian Serb army attempted to unearth the mass graves and distribute them further afield in a cover up attempt. This complicated future efforts to locate and identify the bodies but by early 2010 the International Commission on Missing Persons (an NGO), had used DNA samples to identify more than 6,400 individual victims. Today you can visit the town of Srebrenica and the nearby Potocari memorial where you will find over 8000 war graves. Tours go from Sarajevo and are bookable online. The world’s worst nuclear disaster occurred in 1986 when the Chernobyl nuclear power plant some 110 miles North of Kyiv exploded. The disaster was a result of both design flaw and human error. The exclusion zone was created in a 30 mile radius of the power plant — a no go zone as the radiation was so strong. The nearby town of Pripyat was evacuated, although not soon enough. The official numbers from the SSSR (Soviet Union — the Marxist-Leninist state in Eurasia that ended power in 1991) state that there were 31 deaths as a result of Chernobyl. In actual fact it was more like hundreds of thousands. The original direct deaths were mainly the fire fighters who were first on the scene (radiation poisoning) and the helicopter pilots that crashed into the power plant when they got too close. These SSSR figures do not take into account deaths through radiation based cancer, death of children in the womb at the time the disaster took place and long term effects of radiation on generations to come. It is possible to visit Chernobyl — it’s one of the best dark tourism destinations in the world. The radiation levels are now (arguably!) low enough for people to visit without any adverse effects on radiation. If you visit Chernobyl or Pripyat today you will be greeted by a ghost town — everything pretty much left as it was during the immediate few days that followed the disaster. Most tours of Chernobyl include Chernobyl, Pripyat, the Power Plant and Duga (an abandoned antenna system that was part of an early missile warning network). On 6th August 1945 the USA dropped the first nuclear bomb on Hiroshima and this was closely followed by the nuclear bomb dropped on Nagasaki on 9th August. The Hiroshima Peace Memorial Museum explores the destructive effects of nuclear warfare on individuals and on the world. It presents a message of peace through a look at survivor histories and exhibits on Hiroshima City and Japan before and after the atomic bomb. The ‘atomic bomb dome’ remained semi-intact despite being directly underneath the explosion. Residents decided to keep it that way as a memorial and reminder of the horrific impact of war. The atomic bomb dome became a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 1966. While you are there you can strike the ‘peace bell’ and a few words or a prayer. There is also an Atomic Bomb museum in Nagaski, the site of the second Nuclear Bomb during WW2. The museum contains research rooms, video screening and an extensive exhibition showing what Nagasaki was like right after the bombing. A clock which stopped at 11:02, the exact time the bomb landed, is displayed to demonstrate how so many people were killed in an instant. As the survivors are reaching old age, it is becoming more and more important to have destinations like this to educate future generations. From Nov 1955–30 Apr to Vietnam War occurred between communist government of North Vietnam against South Vietnam and the United States as it’s Ally. It was intensified by the cold war and more than 3 million people (over 58,000 Americans) were killed. If you visit the Ho Chi Minh War Remnants Museum you will be greeted with the unexpected — An American helicopter, fighter plane and a tank. Whilst these are striking, what’s inside is harrowing. The photographs of mamed bodies and corpses of children are not ideal for anyone of a nervous disposition. Why is it important? To remember the victims and understand how the Vietnam war has shaped modern day Vietnam. The Berlin wall was a guarded concrete barrier that physically and ideologically divided Berlin between 1961 and 1989. It was built by the Communist Government of East Germany (Germany was split into East and West Germany at the time) apparently to keep the people in, but people in West Germany believed that it was built to keep capitalism out. It became one of the most prominent symbols of the iron curtain (the boundary that divided Europe in two political areas: Western Europe with political freedom and Eastern Europe under communist rule). It is possible to visit the Berlin wall today, along with several remaining towers and checkpoints. The Berlin Wall is one of the best free dark tourism destinations. The most popular places to visit are: The 9/11 Memorial Museum has been set up to remember the victims of the September 11th 2001 terror attack on the twin towers. Two planes were hijacked and crashed into the towers just minutes apart killing everyone on board. The towers were not evacuated quickly enough costing further loss of life. On a positive note, at the memorial museum, you can listen to personal stories of remembrance and resilience following the 9/11 terrorist attacks. It is possible to book tickets in advance to skip the line."

Medium.com,Life,All Things Must End,Travel,https://medium.com/@freebee1973/all-things-must-end-4dad3726bdc?source=topic_page---------593------------------1," Six weeks ago I left Austin, where I live, to drive to Alaska, where my heart lives. I didn’t know how long I’d be gone or what would happen once I got there. I didn’t know what it would feel like to be in my home state after being gone a year, what it would be like to drive more than 10,000 miles in a truck with just my dog for company, or what obstacles and adventures lay in between me and the end of the journey. I just knew that there would be all these things and that the trip would change me in fundamental ways. Now the trip is almost over. I’m back in Texas, only 350 miles from Austin. I’ll be back “home” tomorrow — in my Texas home. Driving south and east has felt so profoundly different from driving north and west. I used to think this was all in my head, a built-in bias from childhood. And of course partly it is; we all have preferences for where we like to be. But part of it, I’ve come to realize, is the pull of the earth herself. Crossing latitudes and time zones going west, traveling with the sun, I feel younger. I gain time. I chase light. Coming back over the same latitudes, I lose time, lose light, lose altitude. Aging mile by mile, I squint into the sun’s harsh rays. I think, alternately, We are all burning up; and, Maybe this is how it’s supposed to be. I came down the west coast out of Canada. Mom came with me as far as Seattle. She would not hear of me driving alone through B.C. after what happened on the way up. Not that she would have been much protection, and by then the killers were dead. But I was more jittery than I had expected. Her presence was comforting, and in the vast stretches without cellphone service, I pointed out every place I remembered from my route up the highway after seeing the bodies of the young couple who’d come to visit my dreams ever since. We talked about it some. About how I’d felt something, someone, come to rest in the truck with me, whispering guidance: stop here, not there; rest now; keep going; you can do this. Mom and I have differing opinions on who or what it was. It’s alright not to agree. We passed the place where they died. There was an Australian flag, an American flag, a cairn and some plastic flowers. I pulled over, shaking. I had a stone with me that I’d picked up from a special place, one I’d planned to keep, but I knew it was for them. Mom stayed in the car while I went and placed it at the cairn. “I’m sorry I couldn’t help you,” I said. “Please rest.” It sounded lame, but it was true. I was sorry. Am sorry. I dropped Mom off in Seattle and then wandered on down the coast. Having lived on the west coast so many years, it felt like a second homecoming, a weirder, sadder one. Truck after enormous truck chugged past me, carrying dead giants. We’d been seeing them all the way down through B.C., and the clear-cuts gave silent testimony: old-growth forest obliterated, “managed” to extinction. The trees that dragged past me on the highway were enormous, some as old as this country. I began to question everything. Where am I going? Why am I doing this — adding more carbon to the atmosphere? Every rest stop, it seemed, incurred some sort of single-use plastic, some other paper product. I tried to stem the tide, using my water bottle and kleen canteen, avoiding fast food and going for fresh fruit. It didn’t salve my conscience. These magnificent beings had been part of a vast ecosystem, supporting and sustaining myriad types of life, giving out oxygen and storing carbon for hundreds of years, and now I was wiping my butt with them in a gas station bathroom. There is serious karma coming to us for this. I strayed on down to northern California and stayed in Santa Cruz five days. Boyfriend was there, and it felt good to stop driving; even better to reconnect with him and let the dog romp on the beach with mad joy. It would be Benson’s last view of the sea, and cool weather, for a long time. For me, it was a brief respite. I walked into stands of coastal redwoods and talked silently with them. “I’m sorry I can’t save you,” I said. “I’m too small, and too late. I’m sorry for your brothers and sisters in the Amazon. I love you.” It sounded lame, but I meant it. I said the same thing to every tree I could reach, all the way back to Texas. I stopped in Arizona’s Coconino national forest, hiking a little way up an abandoned trail. The trees stood quietly and did not reply. I said it again to an oak tree at a rest stop in New Mexico, whose generous shade gave me time in the midst of eternal noon to stop and stare at its distinctive blonde-streaked trunk. Where, I wondered, did it find the water to grow so massive? In the midst of this I began to weaken. I developed flu-like symptoms: body aches, nausea, clammy sweat. I wondered if I’d picked up a bug in one of the many disgusting gas station restrooms. Driving became painful. I knew already that this was my last epic road trip; knew that driving, with all its carbon emissions, is bad for the planet; but I did want to make it back to Austin. By the time I limped into Albuquerque, though, I was in very real pain. My abdomen and mid-back were screaming. I checked into a motel, fed and walked Benson, and fell into bed. I couldn’t sleep that night, unable to get comfortable in any position. It wasn’t the flu. My entire midsection burned. It felt like someone had blown up a balloon inside my gut and filled it with fire, pressing against my low back, respiratory diaphragm, and belly. In the morning I couldn’t contemplate eating or drinking. I fed Benson and walked him, then left him in the hotel room. I went to a nearby urgent care clinic. They checked me out but, on noting the level of abdominal pain, sent me to the ER, which fortunately was in the same building. Unfortunately, that building was the University of New Mexico hospital, the largest public ER in the city and full to the gills with every kind of crazy. I waited for hours in a cavernous room filled with other people in varying shades of desperation, drunkenness, mental instability, and victims of domestic abuse. The man next to me stood up, walked a few steps, peed on himself, turned around and sat back down. A woman across the room moaned and screamed and laughed, ignored by all. I shrank into myself and fought the urge to leave. I worried about Benson. I worried about the planet. I wondered if I’d imagined the pain, decided I had, got up to leave and was stopped by a bolt of fire: nope, not imagined. I was finally admitted. A tall, broad-shouldered male nurse took me into a room and handed me a gown. Then he stuck heart monitors on my chest. I tried to explain to him that I needed to drive to Austin and that this was seriously delaying me; could he speed up the process at all? He smiled kindly, but he could not. The tubes he attached to me said “disposable.” He wore rubber gloves, also disposable, and the sheets on the bed were plastic, covered with cotton, which had something sticky on it. I gave up and lay down, exhausted. The monitors beeped. Hours later, drifting in and out of sleep, Doctor Somebody came in. He turned on a brain-numbing fluorescent light. “Nothing wrong with your labs, Miss Uh-Mill. Little blood in the urine. Kidney stone, maybe. Not the appendix.” He poked my abdomen and I nearly puked. “That hurt?” I nodded. “If it was your appendix you’d be screaming, in way worse pain. It’s probably just inflammation. Or gas. You have gas?” I squinted at him. “You pooped? Black poop? Sticky?” I shook my head. Nodded. The nurse stood by, staring at the floor, impassive and gentle as an oak. “Let’s give you a painkiller then,” Doctor Somebody said. “It’ll take care of the symptoms and get you back on the road.” Once the doctor left, the nurse turned off the fluorescent light in favor of a lower-watt bulb. He asked if I felt okay with what the doctor had said. “I kind of don’t feel okay at all,” I said, and tried not to cry. He gave me a minute. “If you want to have a CT scan, I can get you one,” he said. “It probably won’t tell you very much, except that you have a kidney stone, and if so, there’s not a lot we can do except surgery.” I shook my head no. “Okay then, the next best thing I can do for you is to give you the painkiller. It’s non-drowsy and it’ll last a long time. A week at least. It’s a shot. In the glute. Is that okay?” He gave me a shot in the butt. Two hours later, dressed and walking out into the slanting sunset of the grimy parking lot where I’d left the truck that morning, I felt weak and tottery, like a newborn. Free. Released from a strange hostage situation I’d stumbled into without understanding why. Nothing about the world had changed. It was still the same fucked-up, murdery, nature-hating, crazy-making place I’d woken up to that morning. But I was reborn into it with new eyes. I made my way back to the hotel where Benson, who’d been rescued — fed and walked by a friend of Boyfriend who happened to live nearby — waited for me ecstatically. All day I’d received texts, emails and phone calls from people who’d heard I was sick with some weird illness. Just to check up on me. People I didn’t expect. Friends, family, people I barely knew. Just to say, “I’m sorry you’re in pain. I wish I could help you. I love you.” It didn’t sound lame. It sounded like ultimate compassion. Their words made the interminable wait not only bearable, but blessed. More than anything, the last 11,000+ miles have shown me that I know less than I ever thought I did. I don’t know where we’re going as a race, what’s going to happen to this planet, how or if we’re going to survive. Sometimes I think the best thing we could do for Gaia is bow out gracefully. We won’t, of course. That’s not human nature. It’s also not in our nature to give up hope. I’m almost home, and I still have more trees to talk to, and listen to. More people to love and be loved by. More work to do. More days to be grateful for. And more to learn."

A beautiful rose full of petals. This was their welcoming gift. A gift for a stranger who came from a far country, thousand kilometres away to visit their forest community. In Nepal, flowers are important symbols. They are both used to worship gods and welcome visitors. In the middle of the village, a large tree was dominating the courtyard and throwing a large and fresh shadow over the visitors. The tree was probably centuries old and therefore highly respected by the community. The villagers walked around it every day and touched its trunk with great respect. Sometimes, they would spread ochre and flowers in the hollow spaces of the trunk. The community respect trees, the forest and living beings as part of their customs and religion. The village is located at the top of a hill and is surrounded by a luxuriant forest. Villagers could have cut the forest to plant crop and make money. But they didn’t. They respect the living beings and wanted to protect them. Instead of cutting the forest, they grew food inside, for example peach trees, bamboos, a plant to make brooms. They planted fruit trees to make fruit pickles. Medicinal cosmetics plants were also part of the natural flora of the forest. All the products derived from the forests are sold to the local market. Equipped with their traditional knowledge about trees and plants, and a financial support from the government, the village created a neat agroforestry system with a variety of trees and plants providing plenty of goods to sell."

Medium.com,Life,First Class for the First Time!,Travel,https://medium.com/the-mile-high-club/first-class-for-the-first-time-d52aed4d03e?source=topic_page---------599------------------1," My sister and I impulsively decided to upgrade to first class on a recent trip from Philadelphia to Chicago. When we logged on to print out our boarding passes and learned that first class would be just $75 extra, my sister said, “Let’s go for it!“ It was a splurge for a two-hour flight, but in 5 decades of flying, I’d never flown first class, and I‘d always been curious. How different could it be? It’s certainly different when you board. No standing around, clutching your carry-on and jockeying for position with your fellow passengers, waiting for your zone to be called. Instead, the moment boarding begins you and a small group of other privileged passengers stroll onto the plane and settle into large, comfy seats with ample leg room. There’s a pillow and a neatly folded plastic-wrapped blanket on every seat. Not to mention scads of space in the overhead bin. There‘s even a special place to hang your coat. “Here we are, as usual, in first class,” I remarked loudly as we settled in. “You’ll be surrounded by celebrities,“ one friend had predicted. “Bruce Springsteen and Taylor Swift can afford private jets, of course. But you‘ll probably be flying with a local newscaster, and a Phillie or two, at the very least.” Alas, there were no celebrities. Or else they were such minor celebrities that we failed to recognize them. The 10 other first class seats were occupied by ordinary-looking middle class dudes in suits, all communing with their laptops and smart phones. Once seated, we watched less fortunate flyers slowly file by on their way to the back of the plane. Many glanced at us enviously. (They were probably wondering if we were minor celebrities.) As they shuffled by, Javiar, our very own first class flight attendant, welcomed us aboard. “Can I serve you a drink?” he asked “We’re impeding traffic,” my sister soon observed as we watched Javiar bringing first class passengers their drinks. Every time he took an order or served a drink, everyone trying to board had to stop to let him use the aisle. “Getting us served quickly,” my sister concluded, “is apparently more important than getting them seated quickly.” You usually have to wait for coffee till an hour into a flight. In first class, I was barely in my seat before Javiar was handing me a cup of fresh hot java. “This alone might be worth that extra $75,” I said to my sister. “Especially on an early morning flight.” In first class, your coffee is refilled instantly, without your having to ask. I have always believed that The Right to More Coffee is so important that it ought to be enshrined in the Constitution. First class is clearly where I belong. I looked out the window at the tarmac as I sipped my coffee and joked, “This first class view is so much better.” Next, Javiar brought us a basket packed with snacks and urged us to take as many as we wanted. My sister selected the fruit and nut mix. I went for the cookies. Over the next two hours, he brought that basket back many times. You can get the same snacks in coach, but you have to pay for them. We consulted the price list in the in-flight magazine and calculated that we’d have to eat every snack in the basket just to break even. We decided against this. When the plane took off, I’m sure everyone on it experienced a certain amount of anxiety, if not downright, stomach-churning fear. That part of flying isn’t any easier in first class. But once airborne, we were in our own little world. The rows and rows of coach seats didn’t exist for us. Occasionally the sound of a wailing baby or the snap of an overhead bin wafted forward, but the first class cabin was pleasant and relaxed. There weren’t too many of us, everyone was quiet and well-behaved, and we had all the room (and all of the drinks and snacks) we needed. Flying coach means your seat is too small and you‘re sharing a limited amount of space with far too many people. When the person in front of you reclines, his head ends up in your lap. When you recline, the person behind you starts swearing and punching your seat. The man next to you is too obese to lower the armrests and the woman across the aisle won’t stop talking about everything she’s doing to prepare her children to get fabulous SAT scores. You’re packed in with a bunch of smelly strangers who eat foul-smelling food and spill diet soda on your laptop whenever there’s turbulence. You probably think that I’m exaggerating for comic effect. But I’m just describing our return flight, when we didn’t get a first class upgrade. Even without the coffee and the snacks and a dedicated flight attendant, just feeling that you have enough space is relaxing. In first class, you can actually enjoy the experience of flying rather than enduring it. I know you’re wondering — was the first class bathroom extra special? Diamond-encrusted sinks? Gold-plated toilets? Alas, no. It was an ordinary airplane bathroom. But with only 10 other flyers to share it with, there was never a line. (Which was a very good thing, considering how much coffee I was drinking.) The flight was over in no time. When the doors opened in Chicago, we first class folks were out the door and on our way before anyone else. Was it worth that extra $75? Perhaps not. But at 64 I’m old enough to have learned that when life offers you a new and pleasant (and relatively affordable) experience, you go for it. I’m too frugal to ever pay full price to fly first class. But would I pay a little extra for an upgrade like this again? Just ask me. (If you enjoyed this essay by Roz Warren, you might like this one too.)"

Medium.com,Life,How to be a good tourist,Travel,https://medium.com/@andrewrecinos/how-to-be-a-good-tourist-9b1e2ee5b49e?source=topic_page---------601------------------1," Summer is the time of year that business travelers like me learn to fear, dread and avoid. It is tourist season and many tourists are terrible, terrible travelers. Unlike other activities where being terrible can largely be self-inflicted (how you dress, your dance moves, etc.), being a terrible traveler makes a big impact on others. Or at very least, it makes a big impact on me. Which is why I care. In fact, I care enough about helping people not be terrible travelers, that I am happy to provide some very simple guidance based on years of personal experience. This was all brought home recently, as I spent a week as a full-blown tourist going from town to town along the Blue Danube (which for the record is more of a teal). Each port of call was thronged with tourists, myself included. And it reminded me both of how much I dread tourist season, and how much I remember being a terrible traveler myself. You see, just like everyone else in the world, I had to learn how to travel. There wasn’t a class I could take. And I started out as a terrible traveler: I did all of those things. I’m better now. Because I came to learn The One Thing You Need to Know to Win as a Tourist: YOU ARE A CAR. I want to say that again, because it is important and probably sounded dumb. You are a car. You thought you were a human, but the moment you are traveling and interacting physically with multitudes of other people, you are no longer a human. You are a car. And as such, you have to abide by and obey all the conventional laws of the road. Where you were once flesh and bone you are now steel and glass. Where once you walked freely on a sidewalk, you now drive yourself along a pedestrian street. You. Are. A. Car. I’ll give you an example. Let’s say you still think you are a human. And as a human you are walking along a crowded street in Budapest with hundreds of others on the street with you. It is a mass of humanity. You are zooming along in a mass of humanity, and now you turn a corner and you get a stunning view of St. Stephen’s Cathedral. Wow! Amazing and beautiful and you’ve GOT to get a picture. As a human, you stop dead in the street, plant both feet and take the picture. You are on a busy sidewalk. So what happens? 25 people who were zooming behind you are now either frantically trying to stop, are forced off the sidewalk and into the street, or worst case, were on their phones, didn’t even see you stop and just plow right into your backpack. Now let’s revisit the same scene as a car. You are car zooming along the street, surrounded by a mass of other cars also zooming. You turn a corner and see St. Stephen’s Cathedral in all its glory. Do you just slam on the brakes in the middle of a four-lane highway to take the picture? Do you come screaming to a halt? Do you cause a 25 car pile up on the highway? No, of course you don’t. You excitedly say “hey it’s a big churchy thing!” And then look for somewhere to pull over, safely, to take a picture. Why? Because YOU ARE A CAR. And just like that you’ve just become a great tourist. You’re welcome. Here are some other things you do and don’t do because you are a car: Finally, keep in mind that as a tourist you are always a car. This is more than just about the sidewalk. It is anywhere requiring your feet. In airports. On airplanes. At train stations. Cultural attractions, state parks, amusement parks and anywhere else that has more than 6 people in it. You may be a car with attachments. Are you wearing a backpack? That is a trailer hitched to your car. Consider it thus. Are you dragging a roller bag behind you? Consider it a fifth-wheel RV. A string of small children? You are now a train. All standard peripheral rules also apply. So for instance, if you are driving on a very narrow street with a hitched trailer (as a human: walking in the aisle of an airplane while wearing a large backpack), you don’t turn suddenly in traffic without first considering the thing hitched to your bumper. You must be aware of this thing on your back, and only move if it is safe to you and to others. I can’t tell you how many times I’ve been whacked in the face by a backpack on a plane. You are a car. It is attached to the car. Do the math."
Medium.com,Life,How To Write Better Travel Articles On The Go,Travel,https://medium.com/@Mark_Wbs/how-to-write-better-travel-articles-on-the-go-e063e3ea8a79?source=topic_page---------602------------------1," The life of a travel writer sounds perfect – travelling the world and sharing experiences with your readers. In the age of social media, a well-written, inspirational blog post can do more to promote a place than an expensive marketing campaign. You want to ignite your reader’s imagination and give them a taste of another culture. Some good photography skills can present the sights but how can you convey the smells and sounds in an interesting way? If you’re visiting a few different spots, just the right amount of description is needed to draw your reader in. Too much will confuse them and cause sensory overload but not enough won’t do it justice. Practical information lets your reader know how they can have the experience for themselves. It’s no good describing the most perfect mojito if they don’t know where they can get one. Even if you don’t know the name of the specific place, a little description will go a long way. So after an action-packed day, you sit down to write your article. What was the name of that bar where you had lunch? How long did you stay there? Was that where you saw the live band? If you haven’t made a note of these details, you will find it difficult to write your article. However, there are some things you can do on your next trip to help the words flow when you’re sat staring at the screen. Make use of GPS When set up correctly, your phone’s GPS will add the location to any photos that you take. It will then plot a map of where you were when you took the photo. Build a collection of business cards Some smaller establishments may not have a large presence on the Internet. Picking up business cards in hotels, restaurants and independent shops means that you have a bank of places to return to if necessary. You can also get their contact information to give to your readers at the end of your travel article. Imagine how cool you’ll feel when you can recommend a trendy noodle bar in Tokyo to your friends! Make notes in the application that you’re using to publish the article It’s good practise to be organised with your notes. If you know that you are going to be publishing your article through Medium, for example, have the app on your phone and make notes as you go. Without realising, you will capture unique aspects and memories from your trip that your readers will love. Take your laptop with you when you travel There are some considerations to taking your laptop on a trip and I will admit that I’ve only just started taking mine. The first one is the size. If your laptop is big and bulky then it’s going to take up space in your bag. If you’re staying in one hotel then this might not be a problem but it’s not great if you’re moving around a lot. The second thing to think about is the WiFi connection as, if you’re anything like me, then your work is stored in the 'cloud' somewhere. There’s no point taking your laptop if you can’t access it. The third thing is security. You want to know that your belongings are going to be safe, especially your expensive laptop. Before you go, check the security of your accommodation on their website. Most hostels and budget accommodation where you share your bedroom with other travellers will have security lockers which I would highly recommend. Review your day Dedicate some time at the end of the day to go over what you’ve done. Otherwise, the days will merge into one and you will forget details. Even writing a list of the places you went to will help you when it comes to writing your piece. I like to give myself 30 minutes after getting ready for dinner, just to check that I’ve got all my notes in order. Put some detail into your posts It’s all too easy to snap a photo on Instagram and hit 'send’. If you haven’t tagged your location or written anything about it, the significance is lost. If you’re not uploading directly to social media, use the 'notes' function of the Apple Photos app to record a few details. Even something simple, such as the availability of showers at a beach, could make a difference to your reader. Record the experience Technology is your best friend. If you’re using a small action camera, such as a GoPro, during your trip, consider buying a large memory card and spare battery. Hitting record as you walk into a restaurant, for example, will enable you to look back and write about the warm greeting you received from the waiter as well as other first impressions. You can always delete or edit this footage later."
Medium.com,Life,Are You A Country Soul Or A Big City Dreamer?,Travel,https://medium.com/were-still-cool/are-you-a-country-soul-or-a-big-city-dreamer-ddf78676f034?source=topic_page---------603------------------1," Every so often, I indulge myself by browsing apartment listings or cruising real estate sites. I might check out what’s on offer in my current neighborhood or pick a place I’ve never lived before. Depending on my mood, I might search for apartments in the heart of the city or lake houses in a rural town. I’m no stranger to big cities. Over the course of my twenties and thirties, I have lived in or near three. This was after spending 4 years in the idyllic countryside of my undergraduate school. I spent three years on the outskirts of the greater Tokyo area. A city that never truly seems stops spreading. But I didn’t leave Tokyo for somewhere quieter, slower. No, I took myself to New York. Le Corbusier says ‘A hundred times have I thought New York is a catastrophe, and fifty times: It is a beautiful catastrophe.’ From an architects perspective, I can see just what Le Corbusier means. The city is both planned and not. The tangle of streets that is the West Village are nestled in the grid-like layout of the lower part of Manhattan. It’s more than the layout of the city. It is people pushing up against each other. It is honking horns. It is crowded bars. It is getting caught in the rain blocks from home. There were times when all this mess would fade away into something beautiful. When I lived there, I would on occasion take cabs home after a night out. I was living in Queens at the time. I would always turn around and watch the city when we crossed the Queensboro Bridge. There is nothing like that view. “The city seen from the Queensboro Bridge is always the city seen for the first time, in its first wild promise of all the mystery and beauty in the world.” says F. Scott Fitzgerald. When I’ve spent time in New York since leaving the city, it has been in Brooklyn or just across the Hudson in New Jersey. These places have the same bordering on disaster feel as Manhattan. They have their majestic views and hidden treasures amidst delayed trains and rising rents. There is beauty in all that concrete. If we only look for it. As much as I might miss the hustle and bustle of a large city, I also crave the green of forests, open blue skies, and sparkling lakes. There is nothing like fall in the rolling hills of Ohio at Kenyon College, my alma mater. Kenyon regularly gets named the most beautiful college campus in the US. Kenyon is beautiful any time of year. Country life has its appeal as Chekov once said, “Country life has its advantages,’ he used to say. ‘You sit on the veranda drinking tea and your ducklings swim on the pond, and everything smells good. . . and there are gooseberries.” We didn’t sit around drinking tea in college, we drank other things of course. And I would most respectfully disagree with Oscar Wilde who said, “Anybody can be good in the country” in The Picture of Dorian Gray. Students did their fair share of not being good. We learned and bathed in nature before tree showers were a thing. The country gave us peace and quiet young minds need. Not just young minds, but this current womanly mind could use it, too. There are those who have their distinct preferences, Lori Lansens says, “The city, no matter how small, is corrupt and unrepentant, while the sun shines brighter in the country, making people more wholesome.” While, Collette would not agree claiming, “Nothing ages a woman like living in the country.” It might not age us but the country can give us a quiet maturity. Giving us a bit more quiet and slowness to work or dream. Time in the country is good for the soul. It is not all romantic forests and hills. The countryside has its fair share of problems from unemployment to opioids. Poverty plagues rural towns and urban centers. The city and the country are not so different. Still, we live in a culture that would have us choose between these two binaries. Instead of flowing gracefully between them. Work rarely gives enough time off to take a proper vacation. Most of us don’t have the ability to own two residences. But in a world where remote work is more and more common and air BnB and housing swaps are easy enough to find. Being better connected to both the country and the city might be one of the answers to healing our current divide. Can we come to a place where we value both, the city and the country? In my ideal world, I would be able to have it all! Isn’t that what every woman wants? Time in the city taking in all the culture. Time in the country bathing in nature. Spending more time in both places would give us the chance to see the beauty and the challenges of both. To better connect us all. To allow us to help each other, value each other whether you are city folk or country folk. It is Longfellow who might have captured it best, “The country is lyric, the town dramatic. When mingled, they make the most perfect musical drama.” Want to read more from me? Sign up for my mailing list!"

Medium.com,Life,Beijing’s Rings from Outside the Train Window…,Travel,https://medium.com/ticket-gate-19/beijings-rings-from-outside-the-train-window-d2d948b488c?source=topic_page---------605------------------1," Ticket A72 | 28 August 2019 In China, high speed rail is usually seen as something that’s slightly further from the centre of town. (Take Xiaogan in northern Hubei, just north of the provincial mega-capital Wuhan, which has its official High Speed “North” station a staggering 100 km from Central Xiaogan!) Beijing South to Tianjin is connected by the 2008 Beijing-Tianjin intercity railway, which has just a few miles inside the city’s most central ringway, the 2nd Ring. It then heads due southeast, zipping through Ringways 3, 4, 5, 6, and the newly-completed Capital Ringway, or Motorway G95, furthest out. Much of Beijing lies between the 2nd and 5th rings. If you’re seated especially on the left on a Tianjin-bound train (or on the right on a Beijing-bound one), you’re given a free, no-comment (except the annoying announcements) geography lesson about Beijing and its many, many rings. And here’s where it gets all very interesting… As you’ll see here, there’s a newly-reconstructed Old City gate tower, Zuo’anmen. This is much of “dead central” Beijing inside the 2nd Ring: hutongs, central government offices, not a load of high-rises, and, of course, the Forbidden City, Tian’anmen, the Temple of Heaven, and all of that. Newer additions in recent years include the Big Egg that is the National Centre for the Performing Arts, as well as the Beijing Finance Street, and a handful of city parks they’ve recently redone. These bits of Beijing started growing immediately after Deng Xiaoping announced the reforms in the wake of Mao’s death. Fed up with the command economy and seemingly-impossible “proletarian revolutions”, the 1980s were the most open era in China, when everything from skyscrapers to even talk of serious political reform were possible. The chaos and lack of cool heads at Tian’anmen at the end of the decade stunted growth (certainly not in a good way), but a few years after that, it kept on expanding. This part includes the Beijing Zoo, rail hubs (Beijing South and Beijing West), the shops, nightclubs, and embassies around Sanlitun and the Workers’ Stadium, and, in the south, the place where rich people “made it” first — veteran Rich Man’s Club Fangzhuang. This bit of Beijing is undergoing the mother of all makeovers in central Beijing. The Beijing CBD is your best textbook example: what used to be centrally-controlled automotive plants are now replaced by massive skyscrapers in the Central Business District. Other additions include the Olympic Sports Centre (which was the centrepiece of the 1990 Asian Games), part of the Olympic Green, part of the universities, and, especially in the south, new residential quarters with the obligatory shopping centres. Here, too, is where, alas (and quite unfairly) the “low-end” population is being ferreted; the much-resented Beijing chief Cai Qi remains infamous and criticised for such heavy-handed evictions. There’s a fair bit of (blank) (sic) in this bit of town, which was probably empty or farmland until maybe a decade back. The Bird’s Nest and Water Cube, as well as the Olympic Forest Park, are here (to the north), as are corporate headquarters and business and science zones to the southwest (in Fengtai). Two major rail hubs are being redone here: Beijing Fengtai and Xinghuo. To the northwest, there are also Yuanmingyuan and the Summer Palace around this part of town, as well as Peking and Tsinghua universities, and Zhongguancun tech hub. Otherwise, it’s still very, very new, and to some, very, very remote. And quite a fair bit of “things” are planned in future for this part of town — be it green-ness or concrete-ness… That’s Beijing geography from someone who is not a Chinese citizen, has never joined any communist league/party/whatever, jumps over the Great Firewall on a daily basis, and is very much aware of what’s going on in this city he’s been part of for the best part of two decades (on and off). Oh — and has also spent many years in Zürich, London, and the like… and is truly into trains…"

Medium.com,Life,I Took Magic Mushrooms in Joshua Tree National Park and Discovered The Meaning of Life,Travel,https://medium.com/@fayelessler/i-took-magic-mushrooms-in-joshua-tree-national-park-and-discovered-the-meaning-of-life-254e8f5c6ca9?source=topic_page---------607------------------1," Have you ever had such a perfect day that you never wanted it to end? Last September I visited Joshua Tree for a dear friend’s birthday and experienced a day just like that. Being surrounded by good people in the surreal desert landscape instilled in me a feeling that I didn’t want to let go — it was a feeling of shining tranquility, of being exactly where I needed to be. At peace with the universe. I’ve experienced this highly vibrational sense of perfection before, but it is rare and usually only comes after a period of hard emotional work, of searching the depths of my soul before the heart opening can break though. And indeed, the weeks leading up to this trip to Joshua Tree were some of the hardest I’ve faced as a working adult. After my first few months of freelancing and blogging full time last spring, I found myself hitting a wall of frustration and creative block come summer. Finding success as a blogger had begun to weigh on me, inviting me to be as loud and ego-driven as I might please in order to continue to grow. But I found that opportunity overwhelming for some reason, with my overwhelm manifesting in writer’s block, self-doubt, and self-sabotaging habits like procrastination and extreme cynicism. As the sluggish weeks wore on, I eventually came to realize (with considerable help from my friends) that my confusion and self-doubt were an indication that some part of my business plan needed to change. It was with this breakthrough in how I perceived myself as related to my business that I carried in my head and heart as I packed up to leave NYC for a few weeks on the west coast. It’s funny how returning home to familiar places can make you see yourself more clearly. Coming home to California always reminds me of the human I would like to be — one surrounded by natural beauty and love of all kinds. That clarity for my life’s bigger vision propelled me into the desert to celebrate a birthday, to revel in the beauty of mother nature, and to find myself grounded once again. I entered our 36 hours in Joshua Tree feeling confident that the desert air, the psychedelic mushrooms, and my beautiful friends would provide me with the knowledge I needed in order to move forward with Sustaining Life. We arrived at The Bird’s Nest around 10pm Friday evening, having gotten too late a start to witness the raw magic of the desert in daylight. And so we awoke the next morning to a beautifully designed space full of textures and textiles, impeccable design and desert details. Beyond our home for the weekend stretched a vast expanse of creosote and cactus, broken up by small and quiet homes. After indulging in a hearty breakfast, we donned our most practical desert gear and headed out on a hike through Joshua Tree National Park. It was amongst the dust and rusted rocks with the heat of the desert beating down on us that I found my first moment of perfection. Just feeling the sun on my head, the wind whistling through my hair, and the dusted earth beneath my feet — suddenly I had the energy of a child discovering the great outdoors for the first time. With newfound exuberance I jumped from rock to rock, climbed and clambered and moved in ways that felt so freeing for a change. I stopped and stared at wonky rock shapes, feeling creatively inspired by color and form for the first time in weeks. ‘How lucky’ I thought — how lucky I am to live on a planet this complex and astounding. How lucky I am to have people in my life who are willing to venture into the desert for fun. How lucky I am to just be here today. Needless to say we finished that hot and dusty hike feeling both famished and full — in need of replenishing our energy stores and yet buzzingly, beautifully alive — and anticipating the journey yet to come. We returned to our nest for hydration and snacks before each eating a bite of psilocybin-infused chocolates, ready to be taken on a trip through the surrealism of both the landscape and our minds. I’ve done mushrooms before a few different times in my life (to both wonderful and upsetting results) and so I had an inkling of what would come next. The stillness that overcame my body, quickly followed by wave after wave of giddy giggles, were expected, but the balloon of wonder and love which blossomed in me over the course of our trip took me by surprise. I spent the next two hours alternating between gazing in awe at a sparkling glass of water, everyone’s happy faces, and the gently waving desert plants. These three sights represented to me the three areas in my life which rejuvenate and heal my soul; a (very Taurean) fascination with beautiful objects, my love for those I hold dear, and utter awe for Mother Earth. Seeing their sparkling wonder laid so bare before me was a reminder to always make time for these three most precious aspects of life, no matter how busy or focused or frustrating times may be. Once we eventually took a step down from the peak of our mushroom trip, we broke out from our reverie to venture into the desert. As the psilocybin nudged us along we giggled our way over to some half broken down structures in the distance, camera and dramatic desert looks in tow. We meandered through creosote, crumpled cactus, glittering rocks, and random refuse before reaching our destination where we burst out laughing for no reason at all. There, surrounded by the sound of happiness and the strangest sights my mouth opened to utter the words “the creativity is boundless.” As soon as I said it I believed it. Suddenly, after a month of wondering whether I’d ever be creative enough to succeed I saw the truth of it right in front of me; that with the right people by my side I come alive, that all I need to do is surround myself with people who inspire me. With that realization under my belt, I smiled and allowed myself to give in and let myself flow through the rest of the trip. I knew that in the presence of my people and the last rays of golden sun that I would be ok no matter what. Over the next hour we looked on in awe as the sun sank slowly behind clouds and faraway mountains, casting long shadows across land and sky. The dusk brought a pink, orange, and lavender haze along with it, changing continuously as the sun glowed lower and larger and the moon rose quietly across the way. We couldn’t tear our eyes away from this spectacle of nature, this magic of the moment. I thought to myself, as the psilocybin receded, that such a glorious sunset is well deserved only when a heart has become fully open to welcoming in a new truth. With the sun set and our psychedelic journey concluded, we washed up and became human beings again. We sat by the fire soaking in the night air, enjoying good wine alongside a home cooked meal. As others indicated a desire to withdraw to their beds I found myself clinging to every second of the evening, to every last breath of the still desert air. I wished that day would never end because it represented a possibility. To live a life full of beautiful days, of sweet, shining moments of perfection. It’s so easy to get wrapped up in our heads over the mundane, what we think life should look like, or where we should be by now. But career success is not necessarily the most important thing in life. I would argue that happiness is the most profound thing for a human being to experience, simply because this fleeting life is all we’ve got. If we don’t fill the space between birth and death with some love, wonder, and joy, then what is the point of living? That reminder to hold onto joy over all else, to prioritize the things that make me happy, was precisely what I needed. I re-learned the fact that if I surround myself with the things and people who make me come alive, the “success” I crave will come of it’s own accord — but I cannot control or force the timeline. My perfect, beautiful day taught me to remember patience, too. Of course, even the most good and perfect days must turn to night. I didn’t want to let the precious moments of clarity, love, and wonder slip through my fingers so quickly, but nevertheless I laid my head to rest. As I closed my eyes I thought ‘this is what life is really about’ and I knew that I had gotten what I needed from my inner and outer journeys that day."

he 50-plus-year-old uncle in a black polo shirt is perched on top of his white horse as I walk down the trail towards him. Suddenly he sees me and raises his arms up above his horse’s thin back, like I had insulted him in a previous lifetime and he has been looking for me ever since. “All alone?” he shouts as I stop just in front of a pile of wet cow manure and the young man guiding him. “Well,” I say, looking around at the billions of Himalayan pine trees, the miles of glaciers melting into flashing rivers of water, the family of magpies singing love ghazals to the Nanga Parbat mountain range behind me, “not really, I guess.” But the uncle doesn’t seem to see any of this. “No, no,” he says, pointing his horse reigns ahead to his caravan of five friends, “I mean, no friends, huh?” The Rakhiot Glacier melting below us suddenly stops thawing. The sun curving around the Rakaposhi peak behind him stops rotating. The morinda spruce trees making sugar through their trillions of leaves stop photosynthesising. “No, not today, boss,” I finally say. And the uncle passes me with an “Okay, enjoy.” T
he day I’m supposed to fly to Gilgit, my flight is canceled “due to weather” and I’m stranded in Islamabad for 24 hours, with the hope that the flight the next day would somehow takeoff. Of course, I have absolutely no plan of what I would do if I eventually reach Gilgit, so at least I can spend some of my new-found free time doing some “research,” I tell myself. Nanga Parbat is the second tallest mountain in Pakistan, behind K2, and the ninth highest in the world, my research (Wikipedia) says. At 26,600 feet, it kinda demands that you notice it, I realize as one of 48 elated passengers flying over it the next day. It demands that you respect it, and maybe even find your way towards it, regardless of whether you had any plan to pursue its path. It even glows at night, I eventually marvel when camping underneath it, with its white snow caps and glaciers inhaling light from the moon and billions of stars, as if to announce its own place in the universe of planets and galaxies and solar systems. As if to say it will pull you towards it with an extraterrestrial gravity, even and especially if you try to resist it. Maybe I’m not resisting though, I think, as my luggage is lost and my taxi dervishes for 2.5 hours along the Karakoram highway, from the airport towards the hills of Hunza. Maybe I’m just happy to wander in the constellation that is Gilgit Baltistan: the green vastness of weeping willow branches kissing each other as they sway over the street where we are eating chup shuro; the creaking of the Passu Glacier, recreating itself on top of the world from which it grew and is slowly becoming a part of; the thumping noise of the apricots hitting the ground underneath the canopy the woman is climbing inside of; the 1,300-year-old walnut tree curling its trunk-like branches through the sky and back towards the soil where its roots are still growing; the brown Hunza River sprinting forward at 2,800 cubic feet per second, 1,000 feet below the 1,100-year-old Altit Fort where I am staying. A few days later, I drive back through all of this, alone and on top of a rented Honda 125 motorbike, wondering as Mary Oliver wrote what it means that this world is so beautiful, and what should I do about it? How is it that I can survive and matter when I am just a single black dot in a universe of panoramic color and light? Just stop and listen, the women nod as they steep tumoro tea leaves and strum rebab Sufi strings at the hand-crafted Khabasi wooden cabin. Just look straight ahead, the jeep driver squints as we crawl around an entire mountain of glacier-eaten rocks and 1,500 feet drops, on our 2-hour climb to the drop-off point for the Nanga Parbat trail. Just sit and be, the marmots squeak back and forth as they lay on top of the flat, sun-warmed rocks alongside the hike to the Fairy Meadows grassland. I try all of it, but sometimes it’s hard to listen, look or just be through all the endless questioning: “Ap akaylay akaylay, are you really alone?” Maybe it’s not about what you don’t have, but about what you have, the Beyal camp site owner suggests the night before I set out for the base of Nanga Parbat, as I ask him about the bathroom accommodations. “We have an open toilet,” he responds, through the charcoal-smoked and candle-lit kitchen-turned-dining-room. “Acha, so you don’t have a toilet,” I clarify, pushing my roti through the daal and subzi he and three of his friends just cooked. “Yes yes, brother. We have an open toilet,” he says again, as if I had misheard him. And as if I hadn’t already asked about the non-existent electricity or running water. Just feel the rough fragility of the peeling trunk, my guide, Rahim Ullah, hums at 6am as we jungle through the whitebarked Himalayan birch forest towards Nanga Parbat. Maybe it’s not about scanning the horizon for picturesque panoramas or scenic overlooks, the cloud of snow erupts as it avalanches down the North Peak while we sit on top of Camp 1, just beyond the base camp. Maybe it’s about focusing on what’s right in front of you, the river rumbles as we reach a point on our descent where the bridge over the rushing Ganalo Glacier has been swept away. “Be melting snow / Wash yourself of yourself,” Rahim Ullah conjures Rumi lines as he leaps across a 7-foot-wide gap and then motions for me to do the same. Maybe the point is to get lost, Thoreau writes as I miss my flight home and am told the next available seat isn’t for five days. “It is a surprising and memorable, as well as valuable, experience to be lost in the woods any time,” I read as I taxi 2.5 hours back to the airport the next day anyway, for an “on chance” ticket, and then miraculously get the last of 48 seats on the ATR-42 PIA plane. “Not till we are completely lost, or turned round — for a man needs only to be turned round once with his eyes shut in this world to be lost — do we appreciate the vastness and strangeness of nature,” I continue reading as the same flight is cancelled 45 minutes later, due to weather, and now all 48 passengers are told that the next available flight isn’t for five days. “Not till we are lost, in other words, not till we have lost the world, do we begin to find ourselves, and realize where we are and the infinite extent of our relations,” I close the book as a stranger and fellow-stranded passenger helps me rent a car and I begin the 20 hour drive through Lulusar, Naran, Kaghan and the snakey roads of Balakot. Maybe you need to love your solitude, to hold fast to what is difficult, to bear your sadness with greater assurance than your joys, Rilke asks after I finally return to the solitude of my Lahore house. Because your solitude, even in the midst of quite foreign circumstances, will be a hold and a home for you. And leading from it, you will find all the paths you need. Maybe the 50-plus-year-old uncle knows something that I don’t. Or that I’m only now learning. Perhaps he knows that the glacier bridge could be swept away, and I would need someone to catch me as I jumped across the 7-foot river. Perhaps he knows that there is a line on Nanga Parbat above which the forest trees don’t grow. Above which the conditions are too harsh, the water too little or too vastly frozen. Perhaps he knows that there are some places where we just aren’t meant to be alone. Where the pain is too heavy to carry up the ascent by ourselves. Where the joy at the top is too brief and spotted to not have others to stretch and relive it with. Perhaps he knows that even in Pakistan’s most hospitable parts, in her peaks and in her valleys, a country can still be that type of place."

Medium.com,Life,How to prepare for Burning Man in just 24 hours.,Travel,https://medium.com/@jeremyjkuempel/how-to-prepare-for-burning-man-in-just-24-hours-27337c02ec99?source=topic_page---------610------------------1," Just yesterday a friend of mine called me up all excited, having just purchased a ticket to Burning Man. She had great energy and enthusiasm and had been dreaming about going to the Burn for months. She was at a point in her life where she felt ready to find a new perspective and ponder some upcoming moves in her career. She raved about the art she was excited to see, people to meet, and music to dance to. But beyond the excitement, she admitted to needing some help figuring out how to survive the harsh environment of the desert. And time wasn’t on her side, she was hoping to leave in as little as 24 hours. As you might be aware, Burning Man isn’t like other festivals. In fact, I cringe a little when people compare it to festivals like Coachella or EDC. To me, Burning Man is actually a city that lives in the desert for just a week every year, but the nuances of that analogy could be a whole other blog post. The point I’m making is that the burn requires some very real survival and prep that other campouts popular among millennials just don’t. It’s for this reason that many virgins devour blog posts and Youtube videos that “explain” Burning Man like they were getting excited for freshman orientation. While it’s probably better prepared to overprepared than under the ground, over-preparing to the extreme can steal some of the magic of the playa. I actually believe 24 hours is an ideal amount of time to prepare for Burning Man, provided you know what you’re doing and follow some good advice. For some background on me, I’ll be heading to my 7th burn this year. It’ll be my 15th trip to the playa as I perennially attend the anti-event known as Fourth of Juplaya. I’ve camped on the 3 o’clock side and I’ve camped over at 9 o’clock. I helped found the camp known as Airpusher, served as the mechanic for the art car for two years and captain of the 40+ person theme camp for one year. I’ve been to the burn while single, while in an monogamous relationship, and while in an open relationship. While I have been fortunate to have seen many sides of Burning Man, I am nowhere even close to having seen it all. I’ve barely even scratched the surface. And that’s what keeps me coming back! But all those years of experience have given me one thing veteran burners tend to have in abundance, and that is strong opinions about Burning Man. I shall dispense those opinions now :) Without further ado, here’s how to prepare for Burning Man in 24 hours and have the best burn of your life:"
Medium.com,Life,Nothing to Hide,Travel,https://medium.com/@clarkboyd_64468/nothing-to-hide-a1d3d56051c6?source=topic_page---------611------------------1," Last time, I blathered on a bit about what my Dutch neighborhood, the Slachthuisbuurt in Haarlem, looks like on the outside. Now, let’s go inside. The Dutch have a habit of keeping their front curtains and blinds open, at least partially. This gives the nosy observer a fleeting glimpse of life in that one room at the front of the house. Well, a glimpse of how the Dutch want you to think they live, anyway. Those walking by pretend not to look in, but they do. I know this because I sometimes “work” while sitting on the couch at the front of our living room, and I often leave the blinds cracked ever so slightly so that I can see what’s happening on the mean, mean slaughterhouse streets. This is actually how I met my neighbor, who always shyly glances at the blinds when he walks in front of our house. Then he usually stops a and looks a bit harder. Finally, I’ll notice his head bobbing up and down between the slats. After a few more minutes of intense scrutiny reveals that I am, in fact, sitting there, he shoots me a friendly wave and walks on. I’m told that the whole idea with the open blinds is this: “I’m a good Christian and a decent person, so and I have nothing to hide and here’s the proof. Go ahead and look, there’s nothing untoward going on here. Oh, and did you happen to notice this new dining room table that I am not at all interested in showing off to you? Look at the fine wood grain! Yeah, that’s right, stare a little longer. Suck it, Stijn and Annemieke!” Many of these front windows also feature another common Dutch domestic ornament: a cat. My favorite is a little gray down the street. I call him Cone Cat because he’s had one of those protective cones on his head since we moved in a few months ago. He and his cone are often draped across the top of a sofa, also gray, that backs onto the front window. I sometimes stand in front of the window and try to get his attention, but he never bothers to look up. This will become a recurring theme. The truth of it is that the houses in the Slachthuisbuurt look so orderly and tidy inside that, as a big fan of Ursula K. Le Guin’s story story “ The Ones Who Walk Away from Omelas, “ I can only assume there’s a room just out of view where everything is a complete and unmitigated disaster, where dust and unworn clogs are allowed to accumulate for decades. It is a space, I am sure, that is also littered with the skeletons of unfed cats. It is also, I suspect, where the homeowner has been holding a neighbor (the aforementioned Stijn?) for ransom…for about a decade. Why so long? Probably (and I’m just spit-balling here) it’s because Stijn and his wife were too cheap to pay for “ransom insurance,” or any of the other hundreds of types of Dutch insurance that might (partially) cover this sort of thing. Whatever the case, Stijn languishes in the dusty Dutch darkness, being fed exactly three cheese sandwiches a day by his captor. Meanwhile, Stijn’s wife, Annemieke, tries to work through her grief. Through a gap in the curtains, I can just about make out the scene in the front room of Annemieke’s house. She and a neighbor are sipping coffee at a new dining room table. It looks very much like the one Annemieke couldn’t possibly have glimpsed earlier when she was decidedly not looking through the blinds of another house down the street. “Besides,” she is telling the neighbor, “Stijn was kind of a loud, fat, judgmental bastard anyway. Honestly, it’s been a relief that someone kidnapped him ten years ago.” The neighbor raises an eyebrow. She remembers that she needs to buy more cheese. “Plus, you get more quality time with Cone Cat,” the neighbor eventually says, running her hand longingly over Annemieke’s smooth and lustrous tabletop. Annemieke smiles quietly to herself, then squints through the blinds to watch a child launch himself off the playground swing and high into the air. Next up: “Fear is something Americans are afraid of.”"

Medium.com,Life,"Why Every Woman Should Travel Alone, and How",Travel,https://medium.com/@maimislang/why-every-woman-should-travel-alone-and-how-5c85e2cf2513?source=topic_page---------616------------------1," The decision to go off on my own was not deliberate. It was in January of 2009 when I was offered a rare opportunity: an internship at the European Parliament. The stint was six weeks and I was psyched. What an honor to be chosen to represent my country, the Philippines. A lot of people rooted for me. Someone loaned me a suitcase for long-haul travel. Another gave me his miles to cover the roundtrip fare. A couple of friends gave me money for incidentals. It was quite humbling to have this kind of support. Needless to say, the budget would be tight so there was no room for companionship. I would be traveling solo, and strangely, I had neither a sense of fear nor hesitation. I have always wanted to go to Europe, and no one can stop me. I did know that while the gig was paid, it won’t be enough to cover expenses for extraneous travel. So if I were THAT determined to see the Old World, I would have to pare down my lifestyle on this expedition. And I was. Time to put resource management skills so far learned to the test! I would be arriving in Amsterdam, via a 15-hour non-stop KLM flight from Manila — my first ever long-haul flight. It was my first foray into the challenges of sleeping in a chair, and the pleasures of in-flight entertainment to distract me from my discomfort. I loved watching three movies in a row, and the food too, surprisingly. Everything tastes good when you don’t have a choice. And it helped with sleep. So I ate, watched movies and slept. I was enjoying every minute of it, and we haven’t even landed! When we did land, I distinctly remember the wave of cold air that gushed over me when I stepped off the plane. Chilly is rare in the Philippines so it was a strange welcome. Then there were these white people suddenly towering and seemingly hovering over me, like I was Pippin in the army of Gondor! I felt like an alien, and I was. Amsterdam’s Schiphol Airport blew me away. It was massive, modern, and it had all the accouterments, like luggage lockers, walkalators and such that I didn’t know then were necessary. I was definitely not in Kansas anymore. To get to my hostel, I would need to take a train. The Dutch spoke English well, but the road signs were still in Dutch. I had no choice but to speak up and ask for directions. Everything was counterintuitive. On my first train ride, I missed my stop, even though I was ready to get off. I would soon learn that in Holland, you need to press a button to slide the doors open. At home, train doors swung open automatically. Now do recall that this was in the late 2000s when Facebook was still relatively nascent, and the iPhone was still new and expensive. I had a Nokia flip phone but had little to no access to international roaming, a handheld GPS device, or travel mobile apps. But I did have a map. Not exactly helping with blending in as a local, but I was desperate. A few days later, slowly getting my bearings, I began to explore. Amsterdam is a walkable city, and there was so much to admire. There were peculiarities on every street, in every corner, and in every coffee shop. Each idiosyncrasy built on the city’s charm, and it felt safe to marvel at the surreal. And the people who made conversation after they parked their bikes near the canals were kind enough to help me find my way. I would say the same for the other European cities I visited on that trip. It was fun to revel in the unknown: to be the child at the candy shop, to wonder in awe, and then walk around aimlessly. There was so much art to see, and so many things to love, if only the clock would stop ticking. I turned 28 on that first trip to Amsterdam alone, but I wasn’t lonely. I had never felt so happy and alive as I did that day. First solo travel, first birthday abroad, first time in Amsterdam. This happened 10 years ago and I still remember it like it was yesterday. These are the reasons why I urge women to travel alone, at least once. And it is not hard at all to get started. When traveling solo, I learn new things about myself: my threshold of pain, and my ability to dance in the rain. They are never constant. But we don’t want a trip to turn into a nightmare. Planning is everything, so be organized. Always check if you need visas for the countries you plan to visit, or if you know someone there who can show you around. I force myself to quickly adapt to a foreign setting in order to survive. In trying to make peace with my new environment, I respect local customs. The Internet has made it easy for us to do the necessary research. I have no pride. I always ask for help. People, whether local or fellow nomads, are always ready to help, without asking for anything in return. I explore independently. I sketch my itinerary as I go along, unrestrained by guide books and tour groups. If it is your first time, though, you may want to design and follow your own schedule, or mix it up with a tour group excursion. I am free to experiment and try new things, especially food, and to go on an adventure with no fear of failure. Be sure though that you have an emergency contact number on you at all times, health insurance info and medicine for food poisoning. If you are traveling to a non-English speaking country, request for a calling card from your hotel and show that to your cabbie so he can help you get around more easily. I laugh at my faults, whenever I go beyond my baggage allowance or make a mad dash to an airport terminal. Portable luggage scales are thankfully more prolific now. If you do need to rush from one airport to another, in sometimes inevitable close calls, ask kindly the check-in assistant to put a “Priority” tag on your suitcase. I know how to flirt and get what I want. It comes in handy when attempting to break the language barrier. I meet new friends along the way. I usually get invited to conferences, so I try to be nice and get to know new people of different nationalities. We all have interesting stories to tell. Your new friends will take good pictures of you too. I travel by myself once the meeting is over, not during. I have learned to trust more and find solace in those who are on the same boat. I was initially afraid that my roommates at a Venice hostel would attempt to steal my pack. And then I realized they have a pack to worry about too. I think I started the selfie trend, with a digital Canon IXUS. Absent iPhones in my earlier adventures, I had to master the art of point-and-shoot self-portraits. Because rule number one on the road is, never let a stranger touch your property. I appreciate nature. I am grateful for the pulchritude not everyone gets to see, and would like to be more thoughtful about its enjoyment by others in the future. Do not leave a trail behind. I love myself more every time I move. And I hope you feel the same way too."
Medium.com,Life,Cairns — A Beautiful Part of the World,Travel,https://medium.com/@ereeny.mikhail/cairns-a-beautiful-part-of-the-world-b2b67e4659e7?source=topic_page---------617------------------1," CAIRNS — literally paradise on Earth ❤ Where do I begin? This place has a special part in my heart. The smell of the trees, the birds chirping, the sound of water, and sun-kissed skin. It can’t get better than that! I have been up a few times because I just couldn’t get enough, and I think its best to just list the places and give recommendations and descriptions, otherwise I can ramble on forever about this place! I would recommend going up for 2 weeks but it will be a hectic 2 weeks and definitely rent a car. I personally, lived there for 18 weeks :) Let’s begin! This is a must do and it’s super easy! Essentially, the Esplanade, is just the city so you’ll just end up there most of the time and don’t have to go out of your way. It has a beautiful lagoon in the centre (I didn’t swim there) and it has so many food places and it’s just a nice place to go for a walk at night or during the day :) Palm Cove — This one is also an easy place to go to and doesn’t require much commitment! It has some nice ice-cream shops and also some (more pricey) places to eat. This is a popular tourist stop because its basically covered in Palm Trees. Palm Cove is on the way to Port Douglas so you can just stop on the way there. Port Douglas — I have been up to Port Douglas 3 times. It is a popular spot and often tourists actually stay in Port Douglas and not in the heart of Cairns. It has beautiful reefs close by and is also right next to the Daintree. I stayed one time at the Pullman and the second time at the Sheraton. I enjoyed the Pullman more as it was more lively, however this could be due to the day I chose to go there which was a Saturday night, whereas I went to the Sheraton on the Sunday and it was quiet and dark on the grounds. I’d recommend staying 2 nights and I will explain why as I go on. In Port Douglas itself, theres a church on the water, Four Mile Beach (with a stunning lookout), Rex Smeal Park and some beautiful restaurants. On the way to Port Douglas there are a few spots to stop at such as Rex Range Lookout, Ellis Beach and just some other gorgeous views such as a small monument created by humans where pebbles are stacked up! Mossman Gorge — Whilst in Port Douglas, Mossman Gorge is only a little further away. Its a stunning fall and is super popular. The day I went was packed. You can do Palm Cove, the road up to Port Douglas, Port Douglas and Mossman Gorge in a day. The following day continue on with the Cape Tribulation part of the trip (or should I say trib haha) — just a warning that you will need to pay to cross the river to begin the road to Cape Tribulation beach. Mount Alexandra Lookout — This is the first thing you will reach on the road to Cape Tribulation. It was one of the most beautiful sights I’ve seen and definitely worth the stop. I think I loved it even more because there was a local who knew how to play the Aboriginal instrument, the didgeridoo, which really created a beautiful atmosphere. Cow Bay — The next thing you’ll meet is Cow Bay, although you have to turn in to get there it is actually more beautiful than Cape Tribulation Beach (sue me for saying that). But there were these swings on the trees and people were camping around. It’s nicer because you can just swing there and watch the water and listen to the trees. Also on the way there, I saw a Cassowary on the drive in. So test your luck! As much as they have a reputation for being the deadliest bird on the planet, if you just drive past and don’t annoy it, they’re actually pretty shy. Masons Waterhole — Once you’re back on the road, you’ll next come across the beautiful Mason’s Waterhole. This was such an awesome experience. Since it is in a family backyard, they require a 1 dollar donation. However, if you buy something from the family owned restaurant you can get in for free. I personally had Crocodile Burger. Although I didn’t swim it was just a stunning little place! Dubuji Boardwalk — Another way to feel the rainforest vibes is to go to Dubuji Boardwalk. I didn’t walk the whole thing but you definitely can say you walked in the Daintree Rainforest after that. So beautiful, lush and green :) Cape Tribulation Beach — The aim is to get to this beach, but when I got there it was raining and maybe thats why I wasn’t amazed. But definitely still worth the trip, I am sure its nicer on a sunnier day! As a final note, if you would like you can continue to one last spot — Emmagen Creek — I have heard its nice but unforuntely on the day I was doing the trip, I got up late so it was getting late and I turned back before I got the chance. I have been to the Reef 3 times. The first time I went, I did snorkelling in the outer reef. I actually have a big fear of the deep ocean, so when I was told we have to swim 25 metres or so, from the boat to the reef, my heart sunk! And it didn’t help that I had got very sea sick and vomited on the way there (probably shouldn’t have had McDonalds that morning). I had a panic attack in the water but my sister swam me there and told me not to look down and it was well worth it. I saw so many colourful fish and beautiful reef. It was awesome, we got 2 hours of snorkelling before lunch and then another 2 hours after lunch before heading back. So for all you people afraid of the deep ocean, face your fears. It pays off! It was so worth it, that I actually went to the deep reef a second time and scuba dived! And got my beginners certificate :) It was an awesome experience and I would definitely recommend it. You don’t see that much more, but you do it for the experience. I went with Silverswift and they take you to 3 different reefs. At the first reef I dived for 25 minutes which was more than enough. The second reef, I snorkelled. And the third reef, I didn’t want to get back into the water because I was very cold but forced myself to and I saw a turtle! The third time I went to the reef, I did it through Fitzroy Island. I actually thought it wouldn’t be worth it since I saw the real deal but it’s definitely a day well spent and you can even spend the night. Its very family friendly too if you have kids. We went to Nudey Beach (not a nude beach but saw boobs anyways haha) which was ranked the №1 beach in Australia on a number of occasions. You can also snorkel and you’ll see a lot of fish. You can kayak too and enjoy an ocean trampoline! Kuranda is a popular site in FNQ! And the best way to do it, is the Kuranda Skyrail because you bump a few other things off the list like Barron Falls, Red Peak and you experience the Kuranda Scenic Railway. The Skyrail starts off in Smithfield and you get to see the mountainous Cairns whilst inside. The first stop is Barron Falls which is just beautiful. It is usually covered in water during wet season but unfortunately when I went, it wasn’t. I also went there as a drive once and again it wasn’t majestically covered in water. You also see Barron Gorge from the Skyrail but I also drove there and had a look too! The second stop is Red Peak, which is a nice stop to see the mountains :) And the final stop is Kuranda where you get to spend the day there visiting little book shops, and honey stores. There is also a butterfly sanctuary — basically anything that floats your boat! I then went to the Railway Station nice and early in order to explore and it was definitely worth it. It’s an old style train and theres plants everywhere."
Medium.com,Life,"Toronto the Good, the Bad, the Ugly",Travel,https://medium.com/@mikeycollins/toronto-the-good-the-bad-the-ugly-2c98a80ee2c9?source=topic_page---------618------------------1," Toronto is a streetcar that comes late. It trundles and it’s full of people, all kinds of people. There are many different languages being spoken. You get on and maneuver toward the back, where there's a little more room. Everyone on the streetcar is unified in frustration at how late and how slow the streetcar is. This unity doesn’t need language. It doesn’t even need eye contact. There aren’t many ways Toronto is like New York, but one of them is how we respect strangers by not looking into their eyes. This makes it special when eyes do meet and a smile is shared over a friendly dog or an excited child or the streetcar driver trying to be funny when he makes an announcement. Anyway, the streetcar that's full of all kinds of people speaking every language is unified, even if we keep our eyes to ourselves. Toronto is those moments when you are effortlessly part of a hive mind with people dramatically different from yourself. Toronto is all kinds of things. A few years after I moved to Toronto I saw the welcome sign for some town just outside the commuter belt. The sign read: Welcome to REAL Ontario! What do they mean “real”? White? Straight? English-only? Homogenous? If that’s real Ontario, they can keep it. They don't like Toronto, anyway. They resent Toronto. They define themselves against Toronto. But I love Toronto. Toronto is stepping out of some weird store you’ve never seen before on Queen West, where the 21-year-old behind the counter is effortlessly cooler than you've ever been. The store will have transformed into something else the next time you walk by. You step into a crosswalk and the CN Tower (such a drama queen) appears above freshly built condos and you’re surprised all over at how huge it is, this close. It looks like a science fiction villain’s lair. It looks like it emits a mind control beam, or possibly that it shoots a laser into space. It is magnificent. It is a post-World War II statement of grandiosity and dominance. Like everything else in the city, it’s built on stolen land. Toronto is crossing the Don River, which is a different river every time you cross it. Nestled in its valley, choked by pollution, its southward flow attended by an eight lane expressway. If you’re crossing it by subway, it’s your chance to fire off a text. Bursting out of the subterranean world into the sky, flying briefly, the valley far below, the river, the expressway full of traffic. SEND! Then underground again, so soon. Toronto is brief exuberance quickly reined in. The tall bridge across the Don Valley where the subway flies through the sky has bikes and pedestrians and cars on its upper deck. Until recently it was the second most popular bridge in North America for people to jump off of, after the Golden Gate. Then they installed the Luminous Veil, over 9000 slender steel rods that form a protective barrier, making it very difficult to jump. The Luminous Veil lights up at night and it is an ethereal span that connects the two sides of Toronto and keeps us safe, an expression of civic care and public beauty. Almost no one has jumped off the bridge since the Luminous Veil was built, although the death by jumping off tall things rate in Toronto was not affected. People jump off other things now. Toronto is homeless people in the shadow of new fifty-story condo buildings. The buildings will start falling apart in five years because they are shoddily made. Toronto is insufficient social programs and a housing crisis and profiteering developers and politicians who enable them. But the views are fantastic. Toronto is every NIMBY post on your local CabbageRoseLeslieDaleBeaches Facebook group. Toronto is the deadzone on Yonge Street between College and Bloor, blocks of the city’s main drag that were vibrant and full of life when I moved here a decade ago. Shops forced out by rent increases. Shops forced out as low rises are knocked down to make way for high rises. Ground level retail is promised when construction is eventually finished a few years from now, but will it be the grubby record shop or the cheap falafel place? No. Probably a TD Bank and a $20 burger place and yet another Rexall. Toronto is dead cyclists. Toronto is a serial killer in the village and the police blaming the victims. No one is making me live here. But I love this city, I do, although it wants to kill me. Never forget that Toronto tried to warn you about Doug Ford. Toronto is the Art Gallery of Ontario, a lithe and adventuresome bit of contemporary architecture, like an enormous upside-down ship, a vessel parting the waves. Toronto is the Royal Ontario Museum, a handsome neoclassical mass that’s being eaten alive by a crystalline fungus from beyond Neptune. They have to barricade parts of the sidewalk outside the ROM every winter because the architect either forgot or did not care that icicles form in Canadian winters and that they can kill you if they fall on you. There are dinosaurs inside. Toronto is delicious. Toronto is ordering Ethiopian or Thai or Indian because it’s late and you don’t want to cook. It's not a particularly good city for pizza, weirdly. Toronto is Yonge and Dundas, an ersatz Times Square that few people like but that everyone goes to. People giving out free Qurans alongside a skateboarding Spiderman and a busker playing the drums and clumps of tourists who don't know how not to monopolize a sidewalk. The man with the mic and amplifier preaching about accepting Jesus before you burn in hell is here. He is not legally allowed to get any closer to the gay village at nearby Church and Wellesley. He once went there with his mic and amp and started preaching that we were all going to burn in hell and now there is a court order telling him to stay away. Toronto is its drowning islands and its giant lake plotting revenge. Toronto’s airport is too far away and there isn’t even a subway to it. Toronto is transit projects that are proposed, funded, begun, then cancelled when government changes. The new government will begin the cycle over with new transit proposals. Nothing is ever built. Toronto is a half-finished subway tunnel being filled in (note: this really happened). The rest of the country hates Toronto, but they don't know anything about us. We hate ourselves too, but at least we know what it is we hate. Toronto is its super-intelligent raccoons, bred that way by our attempts to outwit them. It’s the raccoons’ city, we just live here. Toronto is the ravines, the green tree-filled cracks that split the city, forested crevices you can crawl into and suddenly you aren’t in a city anymore. Toronto is the coyotes in the ravines, hybrid with wolves, bigger, smarter, more resilient. Toronto is street festival after street festival after street festival after street festival. What? Who doesn’t like a festival? Toronto is glittering towers, abandoned industrial areas, anonymous suburbs, handsome Victorian edifices, concrete brutalism. You can dress Toronto up, frame it creatively, and make it look like almost anywhere or anything. There is an entire film industry dedicated to this. Toronto is going to the movies and seeing your home pretending to be someplace else. Toronto is being pulled in a million directions at once. Toronto is the occasional glimpse of possibility. Toronto is home to three million people (six if you count the suburbs) and to an immeasurable number of hyperintelligent raccoons. You should visit, if you ever have the chance."

The series of interconnecting streets that defy your attempts memorize their twisting paths make you feel like you are living in magical land. Back in 2013 you never knew what you’d find while traversing these paths. I saw old men, holding pigeons like small dogs while they conversed amicably. I met a small child who may or may not have been the sole-proprietor of a local food stand. There were a multitude of mysterious shops that appeared from nowhere and then, when you took your friends there, would disappear without a trace. This only served to make you wonder if you were crazy. Those streets gaslit me more times than any boyfriend. But it is the chicken who remains the most confusing encounter I’ve ever had in those hutongs. Mostly because there are so many questions left unanswered. The chicken and I became acquainted one day when I took what I believed to be a shortcut to tutoring gig I’d agreed to cover for a friend. While walking down this small alley that flowed away from another small alley, I heard the sound of something dragging behind me. Calmly I turned around, expecting to see an older resident with a stick broom, or a child with a toy. It was neither. Strutting along the road was a chicken with gorgeous orange-brown plumage. He seemed healthy and like a normal member of the poultry family. However his gait was encumbered with the large sandal that was attached to his leg."
Medium.com,Life,Why we book hotels without breakfast for city trips,Travel,https://medium.com/@renjunge/why-we-book-hotels-without-breakfast-for-city-trips-7ff44db26a4b?source=topic_page---------621------------------1," My wife and I like to travel. In the last years, we have visited London, Vienna, and Munich several times. Also, we were in the Austrian mountains and spent from time to time a weekend in small bathing resorts at the North Sea. For a long time, we booked our hotels with breakfast. The buffets were abundant, and it was merely practical to go to the hotel restaurant tomorrow after taking a shower and get breakfast immediately. But one day, when we booked a trip to London for the first time, we read the reviews of our hotel on the internet. Many tourists wrote that breakfast in this house was wholly overpriced and that one could get better and cheaper food in every pub in the surroundings. For the first time, we decided to book without breakfast and instead try a different location near the hotel every day, where breakfast was also offered. And the people from the rating platform were right. Outside the hotel, we got a delicious breakfast for about half the money we would have paid in the hotel. Besides, this way we got to know many lovely pubs in the city. Why is breakfast so expensive in the hotels? If one takes a look at the wide offer at the buffet, one quickly understands this. The hotels try to offer something for every taste. There is fruit, cereals, bread, sausage, English breakfast, four different juices, salads, eggs — absolutely everything anyone would eat for breakfast. Every hotel guest pays for this variety, even if he perhaps only eats scrambled eggs and sausages, but does not like fruit and cereals. But if you go to a breakfast restaurant, you can choose what you want to eat and only pay for that. You don’t have to pay for everything else on the menu. If you have to think every day about where to get your breakfast, you might also drive to areas further away from the hotel, if you have seen on the internet that there is a perfect breakfast place there. In London, we immediately tried several pubs on our first trip. If we only wanted to have a beer in the evening, we would probably have always gone to the same pub. Many pubs also specialize in breakfast. We would never have visited some locations if we hadn’t been looking for a delicious breakfast. In most hotels, the breakfast buffet is the same every morning. Sometimes there are small variations, but on the whole, it’s the same every day. Outside the hotel, many breakfast bars compete with each other for customers and have to come up with some ideas to stand out from the competition. Therefore the offers of the individual restaurants often differ clearly. We have learned to appreciate this variety very much and don’t want to miss it on our travels anymore. Despite the described advantages, we still sometimes book the hotel breakfast today. Whenever we don’t travel to big cities, we always make use of the hotel’s offer. In smaller towns or villages there are of course not many possibilities to get a good breakfast outside the hotels. Especially at the German North Sea coast or in the mountains of Austria, there is hardly anything else left to us than to book the hotel buffet. But these are exceptions for us today. Whenever we can, we try to eat our breakfast somewhere else every morning. Probably with a little more effort and the willingness to travel longer distances, this would also be possible in smaller places. But we don’t want to make that much effort. Sometimes the hotel buffet is the better choice. Anyone who likes to travel to big cities should try not to have breakfast at the hotel. Not only will you save a lot of money, but you will also get to know many great locations, eat a variety of food and even meet locals. The hotel restaurants are full of tourists, but in the city locals also eat in the breakfast bars. And that’s what travel is all about: To immerse yourself in other cultures and to gain diverse experiences. I would be happy to hear in the comments from you how you do this on holiday. Would you rather go to the hotel restaurant or the city for breakfast? Let me know. I am very curious. do you want more of this?

Medium.com,Life,Why Don’t American Bikes Have Dynamo Lighting and Other Post-Arrival Thoughts,Travel,https://medium.com/@saraheliseevans/why-dont-american-bikes-have-dynamo-lighting-and-other-post-arrival-thoughts-7e2b40fb3cd7?source=topic_page---------622------------------1," Among the many reverse culture shock events I’ve been subject to in the past two weeks, one of the most shocking was riding my American bike again for the first time. The bike and I have been through a lot together. In fact, we’ve been together for like 10 years. But after riding my European bike around for the past 10 months, it felt strange to be riding my mountain bike again, especially in the city. The seating felt all wrong, the tires felt wrong…the whole thing just felt strange. Don’t get me wrong — I still love my American bike (I do! I ❤ u) — but I’m really a sucker for those cute Dutch-style commuter bikes that come in sleek black with a handy basket on the front that make any woman look effortlessly chic running errands…. Well, a girl can dream. So my dad and I went to Scheels (talk about another reverse culture shock) to browse bikes — this is my idea of fun as an adult — and while I wasn’t really surprised that they only sold mountain bikes and racing bikes (who would use a bike to commute when you can drive a monster truck cuz that is true #AmericanValues), can you believe that not a single bike was sold with a built-in light!?! (Maybe if you are an American, you can believe this.) However, my recently developed German sensibilities were shocked, I tell you, shocked! I thought back to my beautiful, if not ancient, pink bike in Germany and how it had a lovely old-style bulb on the front that illuminated my path in the dark and kept me from hitting many a stone and from being hit by many a car on harrowing trips at five p.m. when the sun had already set. The light was self-generating, surprisingly bright, and always made me feel like Audrey Hepburn cruising through the street — and really, any invention that makes a woman feel like Audrey Hepburn is pretty brilliant. It was eco-friendly, you didn’t have to worry about a battery failing, you didn’t have to worry about it being stolen because it was attached to the bike…oh I could go on about its many wonderful attributes. I tried to describe the beauty of this lighting function to the man in the bike section at Scheels, but alas, to no avail. He seemed confused by my attempts to describe a non-battery powered light that was somehow “connected to the tire” and “self-generating.” “Maybe we carry those online?” he offered. Fortunately, Scheels had free wifi (how modern!), so I hastily typed the vague words “bike lighting systems” into ever trusty Google and — lo and behold — was led to an entire page on Wikipedia (of all places!) discussing the evolution of bike lighting systems through the years. The kind of bike lighting system I was, in fact, looking for was called: “dynamo.” Now, if you’re a bike snob, chances are you might have known that already. I didn’t because I’m only an amateur bike snob. I proceeded to read this fascinating Wikipedia article aloud as I trailed my father through the rows of kayaks, wet suits, and endless fishing gear of Scheels, oblivious to the wild heads of deers and boars jutting out from the ceiling around me. The Dynamo system is originally German, which is probably one of the reasons why it’s so well made, and it was (according to Wikipedia) required for all bikes produced in Germany up until 2013 (I mean, leave it to Germany to put the safety of its biking citizens first!), and then certain battery powered lights were finally allowed. So pretty much any European road bike, but especially any bike made in Germany, will have a dynamo lighting system. The Dynamo system! Who knew? How fascinating! Well, what was I waiting for? How did I get this genius kind of bike into my life? I eagerly and naively googled, “How do I get one of these babays in the US??” not prepared for the next shock to the system: it is almost impossible to get a bike in the US with a dynamo system without spending upwards of $1,000. Youguyz, seriously!!! I am not joking. $1000+! For a bike that’s a dime-a-dozen all over Europe, that you could easily buy used for less than 100 euros in Germany. Over $1000 and only made in elusive, obscure bike shops somewhere in hipster hideouts in California. What is this nonsense?! After I dried my tears and googled “importing bike fees” and cried some more, I came across several fascinating articles discussing this very sad phenomenon that a few other Americans abroad have discovered after returning back home, having left their precious, European bikes behind. Alas, once we realized how difficult it would be to find such a bike stateside, it was too late to bring our lovely, cute European bike with us. In other news, among the many projects I’m undertaking for the summer, I intend to become a bike activist and share my love of the dynamo lighting system with fellow Americans. And if demand increases, then maybe I’ll be able to buy a bike with a dynamo system for less than $1000 someday. In the meantime, I will be hatching a plan for bringing a chic, used European bike back with me when I return from Austria. Originally published July 10, 2017 on Sarah the Adventurer."

Medium.com,Life,5 Tips for Nomads Settling into a New Country,Travel,https://medium.com/@emilythejoyfulnomad/5-tips-for-nomads-settling-into-a-new-country-aee1c0c8e070?source=topic_page---------624------------------1," When you move to a new country as a nomad it can be a little daunting, even for someone who is well-travelled. There are a lot of new unknowns, and it can be easy to sink into a state of inactivity due to fear or lack of knowledge. I, for one, often suffer in this transition period, mostly because I tend to thrive on having a tribe of people around me and when I venture to a new land, I often do not have that. Tribes take time to nurture and grow. Sometimes I return to a place I’ve been before, so the tribe element isn’t always as difficult, but still with a new country come new bridges to cross. In the year and a half I’ve been traveling, I’ve come up with a few things I do in the first week to help me get over the landing hump, so to speak. Here’s a rundown of those activities: In any new place, you’re going to need people in your life, and most likely those will need to be people who speak your language best. Making friends from the culture you’re visiting is important, but don’t disregard how being understood and supported in your own language is. It’s why so many students abroad will find friends from their own culture. It’s okay to do this. In fact, I’d say it’s imperative to find at least one really good friend, who speaks your mother tongue. Up to you whether they need to be from your own country or not. Big cities, such as Seoul and LA have many nomad/remote working/friend meetup groups on platforms such as Facebook or Meetup already, so make sure to join a few in the first few days (or even before) and go along to a meeting as soon as possible. Don’t worry, even smaller cities and towns have thriving Nomad/Expat communities, such as Ubud in Bali or Chiang Mai in Thailand. When I made it to Taipei, one of the first things I forced myself to do was attend a board games night. I really didn’t want to, as I was feeling mentally unwell, but that night I met two of my best friends in Taipei, and never really needed to go back. It only takes one hello to start a friendship, so get it done asap. When getting to a new place, eating out is super tempting, but it can often be a hard habit to break once started. My advice is to find your local market within the first day or two and get a good shop in. If you struggle with foreign-looking cuisine, start by buying some things that seem familiar. Bravery can arrive with time. The crucial thing here is to have food in the fridge. Food going to waste is a strong pull to eating at home. Otherwise eating out will be the only thing you do, and the budget will fly out of your pocket without you noticing. In some countries like Thailand or Indonesia, this isn’t the biggest problem due to cheap meals, but in countries such as Portugal, South Korea or the US, cooking at home is most likely necessary. Other than looking after your budget, getting a shop-in means you can start eating a more nourishing range of food. If you do have dietary requirements, I’d suggest doing some research on speciality supermarkets before you arrive and checking them out in the first week, so you know where you can buy that pot of hummus , that gluten bread or that vegan cheese. As a traveller on the road, we get so busy moving, settling, meeting, packing and working that we forget about practicing our hobbies or developing our passions. Being a nomad isn’t something that’s going to change overnight. In fact, the idea is that it lasts a long time, and for me, an essential part of this longevity is to keep growing as a person. Whenever I hit a new city or country, I try to find clubs in two areas. First, a writing group, as I love being surrounded by other writers — even just talking to them about my writing can be a therapeutic practice. Many of my close friends will know how much I love talking about my characters — in detail (sorry). Writers thankfully want to hear and want to talk about their writing, so it helps me grow as a writer and it creates space for me to develop my hobby. The other type I look for is an improv group. I met a friend in Chiang Mai last year who introduced me to the hobby, and in the few classes I took I felt my confidence grow and my love of acting return. It was a welcome trip into a past version of myself, who used to love to express herself through acting. This is something I want to pursue more in terms of my own personal development; if I can stand on stage and be brave enough to do so, I know I can face the world in so many other ways. My advice to you is to keep up with a hobby or interest of yours, be it painting, poetry, singing, writing, martial arts, colouring, language or…well, you get the picture. It will benefit your health in the short term, and your life in the long term. Non-natives can sadly miss out on a lot when travelling to a new country, mostly through lack of knowledge about the places they visit or simply the inability to learn about new things due to the language barrier. If you do get the opportunity to make friends with locals, I encourage you to do so. I’m not saying make friends with a local only to benefit from their language skills, of course. Find people you connect with and give as much as you receive. My local friends are always asking me to explain obscure English words, or share my experiences of the world with them. Learn from them, as much as they learn from you and you won’t regret it. Language exchanges are a regular thing in most of the popular destinations, so be brave and join one. You don’t know when you might meet a new best friend. Another great way of doing this, especially as a freelance worker, is to join a co-working space and attend their events. You’ll find a different kind of people there, and if you pick a popular one with locals, you can easily befriend members of the staff. When I was in Taipei, I was lucky enough to make friends with some of the staff, who made me feel very at home in the co-working environment and introduced me to small bits of culture. I’ve been known to plan way too much once I make it to a new city, and then crash hard. Not only is travelling to a new country physically tiring; think long flights, delays, transfers, lots of decision-making, carrying heavy bags, new information coming in….you can see why it might be overwhelming, but there’s also a lot of emotional factors involved; adapting to a new culture, loneliness, language barriers, country home sickness and stress. When you write it down, it’s not difficult to see why it’s hard to acclimatise to a new country. For me, it often takes about 1–2 weeks to truly feel comfortable in a new place. I can forget this though; stress and loneliness can make anyone go a little crazy. Thankfully I have my online tribe to keep me afloat in these time, as well, as the following: I get close friends from home to check in on me one-week in. I also try not to plan too much work or activities in the first week (besides that key networking event), to give myself a chance to adapt and let the jet lag wear off. Lastly, I take care of my mind by reading, colouring and meditating. Remember you are never truly alone, and it’s okay to not be so busy or productive in your first week or so. Forgive yourself for finding it hard, and take some of these baby steps, which ultimately will lead you into the right communities and life that you want to experience in your new city without putting too much pressure on yourself to start with. If you ever need a friendly voice, just send me a message on Instagram — happy to make new friends, near or far!! Good Luck!"

Medium.com,Life,What We Take From Vacation,Travel,https://medium.com/@marcypedersen/what-we-take-from-vacation-e84155f042c3?source=topic_page---------626------------------1," From Colorado I took freedom, beauty, and possibilities. From Florida I took blue skies, sand, and the solace of the ocean. Nashville made me a little bit country and the beat of the city still pulses through my soul. I can still taste the BBQ, see the people, and am constantly wondering what’s going on down on Broadway. St Louis showed me how to do community and rally around a common cause. I captured the scent of neighborhood charm. It got into my bones. I still anticipate something good just around the corner. Perhaps a local pub or BBQ joint. A place to meet a friend, grab a drink, and enjoy some good company. Up next is Wisconsin. My sites are set on good beer, brats, and fishing. I hope to encounter the culture and leave with a piece of it in my heart. I want to grow through experiences and interactions with the culture, people, food, music, and life that you encounter on your travels. I want to get what it means to live in Wisconsin and I want to take a part of that with me when I leave. There is a way to travel that just visits. That picks places to see and leave. That relies on what can be seen and often follows a well trodden path. Traveling with a focus of experiencing, changing, and growing opens our lives and minds. It is traveling with the hopes of becoming a different person and returning home with a broader mind and bigger heart. It’s coming back home and carrying a piece of the place you just encountered back with you. Today, I am in the mountains. Well my heart is. My mind is at work in Indiana. It is seeking out sights, sounds, smells, and experiences that challenge your status quo, increase your boundaries, and give you an increased vision of life. These types of things can happen when you travel with the intent of having a life encounter. If we just visit we will see great things, but we won’t encounter them. Last week I visited the Rocky Mountains, but I am making plans to go back and encounter them. I need to pup tent that. I need to feel, smell, and become a part of that region. We need to get off the well beaten path to do that. To feel, breathe, and sleep in the settings we travel to so we can become a part of them. Not too simply look, but to feel and breathe in. I don’t want to say I visited. I want to say I lived. Before buying clothes, check out the markets with the materials that make them. Well at least check out local boutiques. See what the locals are making and wearing. Instead of walking through a museum attend a guided tour given by a local. Instead of having food cooked, cook. Buy foods from local markets and host a cookout on the beach. Gordon Ramsay cooks when he travels. Hey maybe not every meal, but shopping at a local market and cooking a simple meal can be a great way to learn about a new part of the world. Instead of hitting a hotel, Airbnb. Experiential learning takes place when we stay in an actual home. With making your own cup of coffee and breakfast with locally grown food. With transferring a part of our life into our current surroundings. Staying in local homes gives us the opportunity to hear and feel neighborhood. It gives us a locals perspective where we can experience the sights and sound of the neighborhood through the eyes of a local. I saw St. Louis neighborhoods best when I was in them. I felt the beat of Nashville by living as a local. By planting myself into the local culture and becoming one with the beat of the city. I came to Nashville a little bit rock-n-roll and left a little bit more country. Back home, I often wonder who is playing on Broadway and wonder what concerts are coming up at the amphitheater. I wonder what I am missing. What I ain’t hearing. If we really travel we encounter the culture we are in. We create opportunities to experience the people we meet. We get engrained with the local food scene and cook and eat it. We absorb the neighborhood by being in it. Leaving the hotels to the visitors. We go a few extra steps out of the way to experience new things and constantly hunger for something to happen to take us out of our comfort zones. We want to get to know the locals and get engrained in their way of life. We don’t visit, we experience. We want to be changed and take our destination with us. Everything is geared towards becoming a short-term citizen of our new location. We expect to return home a changed person. I am back home in Indiana, but my soul was set free in the mountains in Colorado, my heart is in Nashville, my mind is in the neighborhoods of St. Louis, and my feet can still feel the sand in Florida. I am no longer a Hoosier. I am Colorado. I am country. I am surrounded by some amazing neighbors in St. Louis and I am free to soar over the ocean. I am a traveler and I take the place I encounter with me. I change and grow with every experience and embrace the people and adopt their ways.

The rain didn’t want me under it. The trail didn’t want me on top of it. The car didn’t want me next to it. The adversities of this ride that I had been unprepared for. I’ve been racing storms for the past week. Storms that come with 1:56 AM Tornado Sirens. Storms that sweep away bridges on the Katy Trail. Storms, that flood streets. These storms are magnificent to watch as they roll into sight at speed. Skies darkening, thunder booms leading me right into the red radar screens. I’m racing for shelter. Each morning I check the radar and map my route. I’ve already addressed my body, distance estimates, and food, now I look at what may delay me. Most of these storms hold off until I find shelter, but this past week we’ve raced to my destination. And I’ve lost. When I’m 5–10 miles away from my endpoint, they begin to play. They soak me, shake me, whistle and sing to me, as if to remind me, I am no match for nature and I am unwanted."

For the months prior, we began a planning spreadsheet. We would begin in Arizona and from there, cover much of the American West: Nevada, California, Oregon, Washington, Idaho, Montana, Wyoming, Utah, and New Mexico, before winding up back in Arizona. Our plan was ambitious, expensive, and to many of our friends and family, rife with potential dangers. So, with a grain of salt, we heeded their warnings and set off with our backpacks and degrees. “Yeah, that bear would have lynched you girls had you gone down there.” We were about two weeks in when we crossed from Montana to Wyoming, where we planned to enter Yellowstone National Park. On this first day at Yellowstone, we were determined to see geysers at Black Sands Pool, which is slightly over a one-mile round-trip from the Old Faithful Visitor Center. While the National Parks Service (NPS) has made it quite easy for many of the major sites to be accessible by driving, we found it was often more fun and more convenient to leave the car parked in one area, hike around, and return to it at the end of the day. The park ranger on-duty then encouraged us to exercise caution. Over the last few weeks, a bear had been spotted near there, and this was one of the worst times of year to encounter them because many had just recently given birth. Bears with cubs were hyper-protective, but often dubbed hyper-aggressive."
Medium.com,Life,An Open Letter To The Tourist Who Took A Picture Whilst Unsolicitedly Touching My Hair.,Travel,https://medium.com/@sempiterna/an-open-letter-to-the-tourist-who-took-a-picture-whilst-unsolicitedly-touching-my-hair-b9700c1ff70c?source=topic_page---------629------------------1," I’m no stranger to having, well, strangers touch my hair. I’m a black girl, and everyone knows the saying by now. Solange popularised it. Don’t (not when it’s long and braided) Touch (Straight wig? Still a no) My (long and wavy crochet braids? Ma’am please refrain from touching) Hair (Afro? Surely you get it by now). The point is, we know our varied hair textures and styles are beautiful and interesting, but it doesn’t give anyone the right to touch us, especially not unsolicited. But the topic has been done, and done, and done. I want to talk specifically about the tourist who touched my hair, unsolicited, and took a photo. I travel a lot, so I’m accustomed to both things. Unsolicited photographs, and unsolicited hair touching. In Myanmar, walking around the beautiful Shwedagon Pagoda, I had to yell at several tourists who shoved their camera in my face to take selfies with me without asking. In Sri Lanka, in a buddhist museum on the site of the Temple of the Sacred Tooth, I was followed around by a group of school children. The more braver girls would run, tug on a braid and stand and giggle. That’s when I had to turn and address them in full Grown Up Mode. “Uhh, excuse me!” That famous teacher catchphrase. “You’re here to learn, not to pull my hair. Now stop doing that.” They stopped pulling my hair, but my little entourage followed me around until finally, they had to leave. Are you beginning to spot a pattern? This happens a lot in temples. Not because there’s anything inherent about temples, but in Asia, many temples are also sites where tourists go to visit. In taking photos and enjoying the beauty, a lot of people who are unused to seeing black people, in particular, black women forget that we’re not another site on the walking tour. It’s not hard to see where this comes from. White tourists generally vastly outnumber black tourists, and non-black tourists will outnumber black tourists – I’m no Pythagoras, but that’s just simple maths. This is especially true in South and South East Asia, where these incidents occurred. People from places in the world where there are fewer black people will naturally be unused to seeing us. Yet a darker factor (no pun) comes in when we ask – why is all this touching and photo taking unsolicited? Why don’t people just ask to take photos? Black people have been systematically dehumanised across continents. This marginalisation has meant that globally, persistent stereotypes mean black people simply aren’t seen as people. This makes it easy for people to see us as just another thing to take a photo of. After all, if you didn’t ask to take picture of the sacred emerald Buddha, why would you ask to take a photo of the black girl? Why would you ask to touch her hair? Sidebar, because I know what you’re thinking. “I’m white, and I had photos taken of me all the time! People out there just think being blonde is soooo beautiful!” Firstly, does no one ever get tired of parroting that line? Second of all, I often travel with a white man. He experienced photos and intrigue, but nothing on the scale of what I or other black girls experience – including a girl I met who spent every night crying because the constant spectacle was too much. So no, the two cannot be compared. When the woman took a photo of herself touching my hair, I wasn’t enjoying the sights. I was talking to a monk, with my husband, who is learning about Buddhism. The woman interrupted our conversation, as my husband told the monk he is a sommelier. “Sommelier?” The monk asked. “What’s that?” “Somalia!” The woman interrupted, pointing at me. “She’s from Somalia!” “No, no!” We laughed. “Sommelier. It’s a job. Someone who helps customers get drunk on wine.” Then, she took advantage of the moment to walk up to me. I had thrown a more temple-appropriate shirt over the skimpy crop top I was wearing, and my long braids were trapped between the shirt and the crop top. At first I thought she was untucking my hair, and I was uncomfortable but it’s a common motherly thing to do. Then I noticed her husband in front of me, snapping a photo of her, grabbing handfuls of my braids. She got her photo, and without addressing any of us, walked off. “This is the nonsense we deal with here.” The monk said, mournfully. People asked me, “Why didn’t you say anything?” or “I hope you slapped her?” I think slapping someone in front of a monk is definitely bad karma. But I didn’t say anything, because often we’re too uncomfortable to say anything in the moment. We don’t always want to have to defend our space. What happens then? Our entire race is painted as aggressive and hostile, and the stereotypes confirmed true, because we’re the only example they have to go on. And even if we took one for the team, explaining why it’s not okay to do this again and again, every time I leave my house, is tiring. And it doesn’t just happen in Buddhist temples in Thailand. It happens in Australia, in America, in Italy where people touch various iterations of my hair and ask “but, is it yours?”. Is it your business? It happens in England – where a group of young men grabbed my hair and yelled “nice ‘fro” as they skipped away. It’s a sustained dehumanisation that turns the way I choose to wear my hair, whichever style I choose, into a travelling circus of unsolicited, non-consensual touching. I hope that other black women, having experienced this, do not feel like travel is simply not for them. That the marginalisation is too much, and at least at home, they don’t have the additional burden of having to politely take it, because they don’t feel they’re acting as a representative of their whole race. Those of us who love to travel, must travel. We must remember it’s okay to reassert our boundaries because we are a representative only for ourselves. For anyone inclined to touch our hair or take unsolicited photos, maybe don’t do that? Or at least ask first. We’re here enjoying our holidays like you, and anything you wouldn’t enjoy, we don’t enjoy either. Respect is key. And one final question: What do you do with all those photos you take of us?! Where do you put them? What are your captions? Don’t you even want our @ so you can tag us?"
Medium.com,Life,In Pursuit of Sea Turtles in Savai’i,Travel,https://medium.com/@matt.husser/https-medium-com-matt-husser-sea-turtles-in-savaii-5f73ba67f2fb?source=topic_page---------630------------------1," Sheets of harsh sunshine penetrate the clear blue water, illuminating the rocky ocean floor beneath the steady metronome of the waves. This idyllic scene belongs to Manase Beach on Savai’i, the largest of the two Samoan islands. Much of my time in Savai’i was spent relaxing, ambling along with the freedom of a childhood summer vacation. There was little to do in the way of obvious entertainment; you could scarcely get wifi, there were few bars and the island was lacking in most expected entertainment amenities — a most welcome change, a rare destination where you could truly relax. Time was spent exploring, prodding other travelers for a thread of adventure to pull on. On this day, over our starch filled breakfast, rumors were swirling of wild sea turtles, said to meander in from sea at sunset to feast on the algae that collected on the coastal rocks closest to shore. Any dusty guidebook would inform you of a local pond that housed several sea turtles, offering the opportunity to ensure guaranteed turtle interactions in a more controlled environment. I envisioned a sargassum filled pond of pungent water that smelled like a zoo’s reptile enclosure, with a single pitiable turtle swimming in circles within its confined habitat. Neither the daydream nor the reality sounded terribly appealing. We returned to the rumored sea turtle site a couple hours before sunset, grasping a mismatched collection of snorkels and flippers we had borrowed from several of the bungalow style accommodations that lined the prime beach property. The clear, blue water steadily advanced over a slew of jagged rocks as the tide came in. The sun was especially stifling, even before sunset, pressing a sheet of intense heat onto every inch of exposed skin. I had experienced a bout of heat exhaustion two days prior, with the nausea and fatigue that follows. My fever had broken late that night, but I would not be deterred. Armed with a thin t-shirt I did, however, vow to be more careful. We set out to catch a glimpse of wild sea turtles. We were more than fortunate. Despite their sedate reputation, they glide effortlessly through the water, deftly maneuvering along the shoreline. I kept to shallower waters, running along the bottom with my snorkel perched above the rolling waves. They are remarkably tolerant animals, patiently allowing me to observe them for nearly an hour, before they retired to the sea for the evening. We returned the next two days to resume filming. We developed a certain technique to the hunt, keeping pace just enough at a snorkeler’s distance to take a picture, but not close enough to harass or spook the animals. We discovered that they had a tendency to come in to feed during the second high tide, for one magic hour, just before sun down each evening. One of us would hang back and serve as the turtle spotter, as they seemed to be easier to locate from out of the water. Those in the water would slowly advance on the sea turtles, keeping a respectful distance, camera in tow. There’s a momentary pause following the sheer excitement you felt just moments prior, as the turtle slips from view deeper into the draw distance of the vast ocean in front of you. You stay submerged for just a little longer, floating in the warm ocean, reflecting on the brief time this graceful animal granted you. In this brief moment you feel a fleeting contentment that one spends an entire life pursuing. Everything is worth that brief moment."

At first glance, it looks like Xanax, which would be funny, not very imaginative, but wholly forgettable and forgivable. But it’s not that. I have looked hard to make sure. Which is what stands out for me in my fourth visit to Germany in ten years as a tourist: this time, weirdly I admit, I am afraid. Kanak or kanake is a German word to denote people in Germany with Turkish or Arab roots. It is a colloquial term, often derogatory. My brother’s residential building is a motley collection of people from all over: Poland, Romania, Lebanon, India, Turkey. The word is a slur on all of us, then. We are all Kanaks. Can a Kanak ever belong? Do not get me wrong. I for one think it is a largesse on Germany’s part to accept outsiders into their fold. Over the years, they’ve built what is now a dream and a paradise for most of us — to visit, to study, to work in, or simply enjoy. We are benefiting from the outcome of their vision, we are trying to further it, and perhaps learn lessons to take back to our own countries so we may prosper as they have done. I am grateful. I know my brother is too. So why do I feel this way now? Because some things have changed. And it has crept on us like sagging skin: after it has arrived, it’s hard to remember what was once better. And it is harder to get used to it. During my earlier visits, I felt as if people were seeking me out to talk to me. I was exotic. Locals were curious about me. They asked questions, struck deliberate conversations. At times when they were curt, it was because they did not know how to deal with me. Or did not want to get into the trouble of understanding the different language I spoke. Now… they seemed to have made up their minds. There is a patient tolerance. A resigned inevitability. They look past me. They let me be. Do I see a faint unpleasant crinkling at the corner of their lips when they see me or do I imagine it? They try hard to camouflage it, but it’s there. I find this change disconcerting. The streets feel like those of Manhattan: it’s hard to tell what race people are from, what language they speak, what they do for work. Diversity should be a wonderful thing. But it’s not easy to cope with. I am from India. I should know. How long will it take? Will it ever happen?"

As the huge float swung our way with a dozen men carried in its momentum, my guide, Mr. Takahashi, tugged on my sleeve and pulled me to safety. This was the Iizaka Kenka Matsuri, one of the three main fighting festivals in Japan where teams wielding large yatai(wooden floats) compete in a sort of demolition derby for the favor of the Shinto gods in the coming year. And here I was, a few meters from the action, experiencing this rare event from the perspective of a participant. But let’s start with how I got here. A few hours earlier, I had arrived from Tokyo at Nakamuraya, a historic ryokan (Japanese-style inn) in Iizaka, Fukushima. Waiting for me in my room was a happi coat, the kind of clothing typically seen worn at festivals. My host, Mr. Abe, explained that this was the uniform of Uemachi, one of the six teams that participate in the Kenka Matsuri and if I wore it, I would be recognized as part of their team and able to move freely around the Uemachi yatai during the festival. I would be picked up from the ryokan by Mr. Takahashi after dinner. Mr. Takahashi was also a member of the Uemachi team and would explain the event to me as well as help ensure my safety during the fighting portion of the event. During my dinner, a parade of participants made its way through the streets outside the ryokan, and the Uemachi team, sponsored by the businesses in the area, stopped to greet Mr. Abe and receive a gift from him. The parade, from what I could tell, was a sort of public relations campaign to drum up support (literally, as a team of taiko drum players ride inside the yatai for the entire event) from the general public as well as the team sponsors in the neighborhood. Children and women carrying team inscribed lanterns preceded the yatai, which was carried by a large group of strong men, with a few young women riding astride it waving team lanterns and cheering. At certain intervals, some teams would do tricks with their yatai like spin it in a circle or tilt it at dangerous angles, to the delight of spectators. One team even threw handfuls of gifts from atop the yatai to the excited crowd. If this was just the introduction to the festival, I couldn’t wait to see the main event."
Medium.com,Life,The Great Low-Cost Low-Carbon Vacation Escape,Travel,https://medium.com/@schomer44/the-great-low-cost-low-carbon-vacation-escape-65b3764547c6?source=topic_page---------634------------------1," Every summer we Americans are reminded of how little vacation we take. . . . . . And of how important it is for us to take take time off from work, to escape the stresses of our daily lives, to restore ourselves by getting away from our normal routines. The experts all agree: it’s essential to our health, our emotional well-being, our longevity, our relationships, our productivity, our career success, our level of happiness with life. But there’s something strange about how the concepts of ‘escape’ and ‘vacation’ have become so tied to the idea of travel that they have almost become synonymous with it. “Where are you going this summer?” is the typical question among the classes who can afford to travel. Or “Did you have a good summer? Did you go somewhere interesting?” If, for some reason (lack of resources, ill-health, family crises, work obligations), you’re among those who would answer ‘no’ to those questions, you may find yourself feeling inadequate or deprived. Research on the impact of following friends on social media has found that, of all the social-media induced sources of envy people experience, reports of travel and leisure by others are by far the most intense triggers. So, following our acculturated herd instinct, we go through the steps of doing, at whatever level we can afford, what is supposed to bring us renewal: an exciting, interesting, stimulating trip to somewhere that will give us a break from our daily environment (as well as enable us to hold our heads high when comparing our vacation experiences with those of others!). We often enjoy these vacation trips immensely. The stimulation of novelty and being in a new place is undeniable. Our minds and awareness are expanded. We have a good time.The escape from our everyday surroundings does indeed make us feel good. We really do experience renewal and refreshment. Focusing on the pleasures enjoyed, we shrug off the hassles of making and remaking travel arrangements, navigating crowded airports and jammed freeways, standing in long queues to visit famous places, jet lag induced by long flights, travel-born ailments, strange food indigestion, the discomfort of extreme heat, noisy hotel rooms or campsite neighbors, and the family or tour group tensions that can occur on a trip. These often make good war stories to tell when we come home. But the toll these vacation travel experiences take on us often result in us returning from our ‘escapes’ more exhausted than before we left, sometimes sick even, needing several days to recover and recuperate. I remember a particular vacation trip of mine. It was to attend a fascinating cultural event in a village some distance from the city of Jodhpur, Rajasthan. My non-stop return trip started with a bumpy early morning jeep ride to Jodhpur, followed by a 12-hour overnight train to New Delhi, and from there a three-stop international flight back to the U.S., reaching SFO in California 48 hours later in a state of total dishevelment and exhaustion. The recovery from that particular escape took over a week! Then there’s the reality that’s hard to avoid if you’re someone with a conscience and a sense of how dire the global warming future is. For all the many social benefits of vacation travel — bringing people in contact with one another, learning about other cultures and ways of life, providing economic activity and jobs, creating resources to maintain world heritage and natural wonder sites — there’s the uncomfortable truth that it comes at the cost of placing increasing stress on the planet’s fragile ecosystem. According to an article in the magazine Nature Climate Change, tourism accounted for 8% of all global greenhouse gas emissions between 2009 and 2013 — four times more than had been expected — and is projected to become a growing contributor to global warming. The July 29, 2019 cover of the The New Yorker brilliantly captures this reality of the heavy toll vacation travelers can place on the environment! By the numbers, it looks like this: Not good, no matter how you look at it. An excellent resource I’ve found for enabling some degree of impact-and-guilt reduction about vacation travel is a UK site website called Carbon Footprint. Besides providing some basic practical tips for how to minimize your transportation-based CO2 emissions and otherwise ‘be green on vacation’, it offers you a carbon footprint calculator and suggests carbon offset projects you can contribute to. If you’re going to travel, I’m sure there are other sites like this that can help reduce the carbon toll of your vacation. But I would like to think more radically about all this. . . and invite you to join me in my own recently discovered low-cost low-carbon summer (and year round) vacation escape — an escape that lets you wander the world without causing any Arctic sea ice loss or enduring the wear and tear of real-life vacation travel. I’m all for escape. We all need it. We all have our share of stress, drudgery, and exhaustion from which we need breaks. Even if our personal and work lives are relatively stable and worry-free, it’s hard to stay calm in the face of the multiple political, social, economic and environmental crises of our times. Especially if you’re someone who cares deeply about these public matters, and want to be engaged and informed, you can make yourself sick if you obsess about them all day long — and you end up being ineffective in making any difference. What I fear about the Big Project Vacation Travel mode of escape is that it’s a chore to organize, it happens only periodically (sometimes only once a year), and the beneficial results usually wear off pretty quickly. I’ve found that the best, most immediate, frequently repeated, low-cost, low-carbon, low-effort way I can escape involves a walk in our immediate suburban neighborhood (or a hike up the steep, crooked streets of the hills behind us), stopping at Little Free Libraries to see what books people have been reading, and what wonderful surprise may be waiting there for me to pick up. Then, in luxuriant languor, curling up on a sofa in my home, or sipping a cup of hot chocolate in the privacy of a coffee house full of indifferent strangers, I lose myself in the novelty of a previously unknown world hidden between the covers of the book that came to me unbidden on my walk. A Genius Concept Gone Viral Started in 2009 by a man named Todd Bol in Hudson, Wisconsin, the Little Free Library book exchange concept (Take a Book — Share a Book), with its signature miniature schoolhouse structures perched on sturdy posts in front of people’s homes, has by now grown to over 90,000 and spread to all 50 states in the U.S. and 91 countries. Click here for an informative Medium interview article on the subject. Todd Bol’s concept combined promotion of book reading, community building, and street art. People all over the place have taken the concept and made it their own. You can purchase a kit from the organization, or design and build your own. Then, if you like, you can register your site and become part of the worldwide network of Little Free Library ‘stewards’. The internet is full of charming images of these whimsical structures. Social media enable extensive sharing of information about them. There’s also an online interactive map site where you can search locations near you, by zip code, by country, and by city and state or province. That’s for people who prefer the planned rather than the serendipity approach to finding treasures and escape travel. I tend to prefer the latter, which is more reminiscent of wandering the stacks of an old-fashioned library or roaming the streets of a previously unknown city. Different from a Library or a Bookstore I don’t know whether the Little Free Libraries were initially conceived of as a contribution to slowing global warming as well. But I like to imagine there is at least a small ripple of an effect. Not just in promoting re-use of books, but as more people, like me, make the choice now and then to skip the ‘escape’ that involves fossil fuel to propel them physically to distant places, opting instead for an adventure available near at hand in the form of a book that beckons to you from a funny little schoolhouse structure perched on top of a wooden pole. So how is this any different from going to your local public library, or a bookstore, or ordering a book from Amazon? There’s a world of difference, I would argue, because one of the pressures of modern life from which we really need escape is the constant overabundance of choice. How often have you gone to a library, or a bookstore, or searched online for a good book to read, and been so overwhelmed by all the possibilities that you end up paralyzed and leave empty-handed? How often does reading scores of book reviews leave you in a complete quandary about actually letting yourself select one and immerse yourself in it? How often do you even find yourself feeling a strange sort of guilt about all the good books you haven’t read? As the old aphorism says, “Art is long, life is short” — there’s simply no way us humans, in our brief life spans, can possibly read all the wonderful books there are to read. We can drive ourselves crazy with this knowledge, and forget that simple joy we had as children, when we used to delight in reading whatever was given to us to read, without concern about what other books we might be missing, or agonizing over selection. This is where those Little Free Libraries come in, with a wonderful contribution to the simplification of your life and to providing you with the opportunity for a genuine vacation (from the Latin vacare, ‘to be free from duty or obligation’!). Those wonderful book ‘stewards’ have gone to all the trouble of doing the curating for you, presenting you with a small handful of choices that have been vetted through the idiosyncracies of their unique minds and interests. Each Little Free Library has done the work of a careful book selection committee to bring to you the joy of a small handful of ‘previously enjoyed books’. All you have to do is pick one, shut out thoughts of all other possible books, surrender to it, and go off with it on your escape adventure. For some reason, many of the discarded treasures that show up in those Little Free Libraries, at least in the areas where I wander, are old murder mysteries. You find them promiscuously nestled among books that reveal more precisely whether the owner of the curated collection on offer is a physicist, a spiritual seeker, an art lover, an armchair traveler, a sociologist, a poetry buff , a gourmet cook, a student of critical literary theory, or a fly-fishing enthusiast. It seems that reading murder mysteries is something that cuts across all sorts of class, educational, cultural, gender and age lines. There was a time when I would not have given a moment’s thought to ‘wasting my time’ on such light reading fare as ‘crime fiction’. I saw myself as a serious intellectual. That meant my reading should be limited to great literature on topics of great humanistic import. Let other lesser humans indulge in mere ‘detective stories’ and ‘whodunits’! Then, one day, I came to a session with the learned psychotherapist who helped me greatly with one of my long-ago professional and personal crises. Edith was an intellectual to her fingertips, raised in the brilliance and ferment of pre-Holocaust Vienna, a student of the great psychologist Alfred Adler. She was unwavering in her conviction that intellect in women is sexually attractive — encouraging the women she worked with to be unapologetically brainy and intellectual… and to just ignore the poor men who couldn’t deal with it. Imagine my surprise when I found her home office lined with paperback murder mysteries! It didn’t fit my preconceptions about her or about the genre. When I queried her, she said, “You need to let your brain take a break and escape from all the intensity. You need a vacation from all the seriousness of your work and your life. Mysteries are easy to read, undemanding, entertaining. They’re fun. They refresh and restore. And, for all their lightness of touch, they often contain wickedly astute comments about human nature and society, along with letting you visit all sorts of different social worlds and settings.” And she put in my hands my very first murder mystery — Death in a Tenured Position, by Amanda Cross (better known as the feminist scholar Carolyn Gold Heilbrun, the first woman ever to receive tenure in the English Department at Columbia University). The subject was close to my concerns at the time (very close), the academic world she described was familiar (very familiar), her humor and characterization of academic types and of academic gender and other politics were hilarious. I was hooked! Since then, and increasingly so since the advent of the Little Free Libraries, some of my best low-cost, low-carbon (and low-stress) escape travel travel has been to the fictional worlds created by mystery writers. I can lose myself equally in the formal bygone worlds of the classic British mystery writers everyone knows, in the many banal, downscale or scrappy worlds of America’s contemporary tough-but-vulnerable women detectives, in the fast-paced worlds of international art theft intrigue, in crime fiction set in Mumbai or the French region of Dordogne, and in miscellaneous yarns of debatable literary quality that take me to varied places and ways of life I’ve never heard of or paid much attention to. Whether I give myself permission to zone out into this escape for several hours, or catch a few minutes between obligations, I always come out of it with the feeling I’ve been somewhere that took me away from my routines and troubles, put no demands on me, let me be somewhere else instead of in that much overrated ‘be here now’ reality, and gave me a most wholesome dose of renewal and refreshment. All that, completely free, with no wear-and-tear on either me or the natural environment, no guilt, no stress. . . Can you beat that for a low-cost, low-carbon escape vacation? — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — —

Whether American, Chinese, German, Australian or from anywhere else on the globe, people can’t seem to behave when they travel far from home. We’re not talking about the obvious — like defacing historic monuments — that’s flat out criminal. We’re talking about the people who take their bad behavior on the road and make everyone’s lives miserable. We know you’re not like that, but could you, or your travelmates, be making some of these mistakes? Here’s our list of the some of the worst things tourists do and how you can avoid being labeled an Ugly Traveler. Let us know if we missed anything in the comments. We know traveling can be stressful, and when you land in a strange place, full of unfamiliar people, sometimes you want nothing more than for things to be easy. Easy — meaning comfortable and familiar. But you’re in a foreign place and maybe there’s nothing familiar. The food is different, the language may be different, even figuring out the bathroom may be puzzling task. An ugly traveler would get frustrated and complain. Then one complaint turns into some other petty thing being wrong, and then it seems like everything that’s different is wrong and that turns into a whole lot of complaining. Not only does this make you an ugly and angry traveler, but you come off as an arrogant ass, thinking everything about your home country is the best. There’s a better approach. This includes things small and large. Expect everything to be different and revel in the newness of the experience. By shifting your perspective and your expectations, those elements that could seem foreign and unpleasant become wonderful new discoveries, or at least interesting curiosities. While you may not love everything that’s different about the place you’re visiting, approaching it with an open mind will make your trip go smoother and give you a range of responses. We recommend not complaining unless it’s truly called for. This relates especially to our US readers, many of whom are mono-linguistic. The expectation that the rest of the world should speak English has contributed greatly to the image of the Ugly American tourist. While English is widely spoken, once you step foot in another country, you absolutely shouldn’t expect anyone there to speak your language. It doesn’t matter if English is one of the official languages of the country, that doesn’t mean everyone’s going to speak it. You shouldn’t expect others to be bilingual just to accommodate you. I mean, you haven’t done the same for them, have you? Getting angry because you can’t make yourself understood is the response of an ugly traveler. We’ve tried a few different apps, but Google translate seems to be best overall, and it’s free. Install it, download the language you need for offline use, and use it liberally. Be prepared to hand your phone back and forth to facilitate the conversation. Also understand that the translation isn’t perfect, so you may be sharing a statement that the translator has botched and the person you’re trying to converse with is still confused. We were once having a conversation with staff in Thailand about hotel towels and the translator came up with something about Spiderman. You can also call up pictures on your phone for demonstration. “Siri, show me a blue suitcase.” Remember, that even if someone does speak English as a second language, if you’re having trouble understanding their accent, they’re probably having trouble understanding yours. Be prepared to come up with alternate ways to say what you want to say. A great resource for this is mime and hand gestures. Seriously, don’t hesitate to act out what you’re trying to get across, sort of like a game of charades. It can be a very helpful tool for communication. It can also be good for a laugh. It’s never bad to make people laugh. This falls under ugly traveler and arrogant ass, all rolled into one. We don’t care where you’re from, your country is not the best in the world. It’s not better at everything. Just because you understand how your home country works doesn’t mean it’s the best and only way things should be done. While people the world over have the same basic needs, the philosophies on how people should live their best lives varies widely. This can be a belief in different governmental styles, or religious and economic philosophies. Moreover, you need to remember that the government doesn’t always represent the people. There can be a vast difference between what a government does and what its people believe. There is so much that goes into making a country what it is, it’s impossible to grasp all of the underlying reasons it has evolved the way it has. History, politics, geography, philosophy…you’re never going to understand all the nuances of a culture you’re not from, especially when you’re only there for a vacation or a short visit. That doesn’t mean you shouldn’t try to understand, but don’t think you know how they should do things. Your country may be successful in some ways, but other places have different strengths. It’s not a competition. Realize that countries evolve the way they do for complex reasons. If you ever find yourself saying, “Well, they should just…” — STOP talking. You probably don’t understand the entirety of the situation. No one wants to get ripped off. We get it. But that doesn’t mean you should expect to pay the same as a local all the time, or that you need to haggle down to the last penny. This is especially true in places where your money goes a lot further than normal and everything costs less already. There’s a point where you need to recognize your privilege. Even if you’re a frugal traveler on a shoestring budget, the fact that you can travel all the way to whatever country you’re in, and afford to spend several weeks there, means you’re significantly better off than many of the people that live there. If you’re haggling down to the very last cedi and feel like you have to get the absolute best price to win, you’re being an ugly traveler. From tuk-tuk rides to t-shirts to a pair of shades, ask someone at your hotel what a fair price is. Be sure to enter the bargaining session with a good attitude, not a combative one. Every country is different when it comes to haggling. Take a moment to learn the way they do things. For example, in China I had an epic haggling session over a necklace where they offered a hugely inflated price. I countered with an equally dramatic lowball offer. However, in Thailand, there’s not usually more than a 10–20% discount to be had. If your offer is too low, they’ll just end the transaction immediately. Learn the system for where you are. Don’t haggle down to one or two cedis. If you’re paying just a smidge more than locals, put your pride on the back burner and let them have it. Those two cedis mean a whole lot more to that driver than they do to you. Of course, these rules apply to people who are haggling in good faith. If someone is trying to rip you off, play as much hardball as you want, or walk away and give your money to someone else. We know some of you love to party when you travel, but this is just common sense. Getting drunk puts you at risk for so many problems, from theft to assault. Not to mention that a lot of people get rude when they’re drunk. Have you ever had to tend someone when they’re drunk? It ain’t fun and it ain’t pretty. Don’t make drivers, hotel and wait staff clean up after you. Keep your wits about you to save yourself a whole lot of headache and prevent the worst from happening. If you’re in a group and you really want to drink to excess, assign one person the job of keeping tabs on everyone. US citizens, especially, are known for being loud and obnoxious. It’s one of the prime identifiers of an Ugly American, though it can apply to other nationalities. A standard greeting at home might be very inappropriate in a country with more conservative manners. If you see people flinching, grimacing or avoiding you as soon as you approach, you might be an ugly traveler. To be honest, the criticism above usually comes from Europeans who find American enthusiasm…distasteful. So, if you’re an American abroad in Europe, definitely tone it down. The key here is to pay attention. In our travels from Asia to Africa, we’ve encountered a variety of cultures and attitudes. I can guarantee that the complaint about loud US tourists wouldn’t be made in Benin or Ghana, where the people are outgoing and dynamic, and yes, sometimes loud. Try to set your internal gauge to match what others are doing. Also be aware that the firm handshake you learned was essential for doing business in the US is too harsh for many other places. If you’re the big, boisterous type, back off and temper your reactions until you can determine the best approach. So you’ve ridden the bus a million times, you know how buses work. But do you? In some places, despite the schedule, the bus doesn’t leave until it’s full. Or maybe you’re in a place where it’s customary to board the bus, find a seat and pay after you’re moving. If you get on one of these buses and then get upset when it doesn’t leave on time! you might be an ugly traveler. Of course, we’re not only referring to buses. This applies to hotels, restaurants, local laws and any system that you think you understand, but don’t. For example, in some Asian countries, wait staff don’t check on you at your table throughout the meal. You might think this is poor service, but they’re actually waiting for you to signal that you want something. They don’t want to disturb you in the middle of your meal unnecessarily. Feel free to ask people what to expect, your hotel staff can be very helpful here. Different countries take life at a different pace and you might actually find it quite pleasant to slow down a bit and practice taking life in stride. So the tro-tro broke down <shrug>, they’re fixing it. I’m sure we’ll get there just fine. ********** Expert traveler tip: Don’t over-schedule your day. Leave room for life to happen (especially if you’re taking a tro-tro). ********** Wearing a tank top and short-shorts in a conservative country or region because you’re not willing to compromise your comfort or freedom, is rude. If you can’t respect local sensibilities about proper attire, then don’t travel to places where your preferred wardrobe is not acceptable. If you inflict your values on someone else’s culture in their country, you are an ugly traveler. Depending on where you’re going, a certain amount may be forgiven because you’re a tourist, but try to stay within a reasonable range of local sensibilities. For example, West Africa, in general, is pretty religious. So when we landed in Benin, I asked whether wearing shorts would be okay. I was told that it’s no problem. Though my shorts are about knee-length; I still wouldn’t recommend pulling out your Daisy Dukes. However, two countries over, in Ghana, I could sense that shorts were less common and I only wore them in certain areas. Many places that are conservative are more relaxed in high-traffic tourist areas, especially when they have a beach. Be mindful to cover up once you leave the tourist-zone. VERY IMPORTANT: When visiting temples, churches and mosques, be sure to ask what acceptable attire is before you go. Usually you want to cover from your upper arms to your knees, at least. Some places will require more coverage and they might even provide a garment to assist you in this requirement. (Sometimes there’s a small fee for this rental, sometimes not.) If you don’t dress appropriately for religious spaces, you may be refused entry. If you assume that local food is dirty or icky without ever trying it, you’re going to miss out. Just because the food is prepared in a roadside stand, with plastic tables and chairs, does not mean it is of low quality. Sometimes it’s far better than anything you’ll get in a fancy restaurant and you’re doing the good thing of supporting local businesspeople. If you go to a country and don’t even sample the local cuisine, you might be an ugly traveler. Even if they come in a plastic bag with unidentifiable ingredients, are completely unknown to you or are something you don’t usually like — try them! I was walking around the Central Market in Tamale, Ghana when I stopped to watch a woman putting some ingredients into a bag. A handful of dark lumps, a sauce, some stew — and I couldn’t identify any of it. But I’d stood there long enough that it was sort of assumed I wanted some. I asked what it was called, but couldn’t understand the answer. I thought the dark bits were some form of beef — I was wrong. For a few cedis though, I had to find out. I took it back to the hotel where they told me it was tubani. Those dark bits turned out to be a gritty, bean-based paste. The sauces made it a little spicy — which is perfect for me. Not only did I like it, but Tim did, too. If we had dismissed the strange looking stuff, we would have missed out on a really tasty treat. Also, you’ll often find that flavors and ingredients you don’t like at home are much different when you travel. Bell peppers may be milder, honey is tastier, and okra isn’t as icky (it’s still slimy, though). Don’t assume you know what something tastes like. Give the new version you’re presented with a chance. Of course, it’s okay to say no to some foods, and you’ll have to choose where to draw that line, but err on the side of trying new things. The worst that happens is you don’t like it, and locals will understand. You’ll get points for having tried it. Or, you could find a new favorite food and really impress people with your willingness to eat their local cuisine. There’s nothing better than the looks of surprise you get when you confidently order fufu in a local restaurant and then dig in with your hands — the most proper way to eat fufu. When it comes to local food, try it — you may like it. Barreling through your interactions with people in your own culture’s manner while not taking local customs into account might mark you as an ugly traveler. If it’s proper to remove your shoes, do so. If there’s a code of respect for bowing as part of your greeting, do it, and learn the nuances. If a society resists using their left hand, not only for eating, but for passing things, especially money, back and forth, try to mind your manners and comply. Often you’ll be given some slack because people know it’s not your custom, but make the effort to get it right. By showing respect for their customs, you’ll receive respect and appreciation back and you’ll find it easier to make friends. When you travel, nothing ever goes as planned. Just assume that. If you’re busy getting upset all the time and spreading your negativity to everyone around you, you might be an ugly traveler. Not everything is as precision and sanitized as so much of the western world. We once saw a group of travelers in China, up on a mountain (11k feet, 3350m) who ordered the legendary chocolate cake in a local restaurant. If you know anything about baking, you know that it’s nearly impossible to get anything to rise at that altitude, and any baking is going to take a long time. When it arrived, the group of ugly travelers did nothing but rag on the chef for the cake not being up to their expectations. After too much complaining, they left. Tim and I sat there thinking what a bunch of jerks they were. By the way, we also ordered the chocolate cake. It was much like a giant, gourmet pop tart and we enjoyed the heck out of it. We’ve also seen someone who was getting agitated because he thought a bus in Ghana would be direct and actually arrive at a very specific time. Of course, it took off a little late and made a number of stops on the way in. Africa is just not the place to expect precision timing when it comes to transportation. Even after having been in Ghana for a month, this gentleman planned his airport arrival based on the printed bus schedule. He still had enough time, but it definitely bothered him. He doesn’t get counted as an ugly traveler though, because he didn’t spread his displeasure to others. He only shared it with us after we struck up a conversation and he asked for advice. You might notice that most of this advice has some common threads. Be respectful, be patient, be open-minded and be aware of how your actions are affecting others. These are good tips for everyday life, but can be more challenging to implement when under the tiring and stressful effects of travel. Here are some things you can do to keep up your energy and positive attitude so you don’t slip into Ugly Traveler Syndrome: · Get Plenty of Sleep — for the first day or two of your trip, go to bed early or take a nap, as needed. · Stay Hydrated — don’t run your body down, it makes it harder to deal with stress. · Eat Plenty of Food — Keep snacks handy and don’t travel while hangry. · Don’t Panic — Most situations aren’t as dire or difficult as they seem in the moment. If you can approach the problem in a calm, reasonable manner you’ll find the solution much faster. Now that you know how to NOT be an ugly traveler - Happy Travels! *** If you enjoyed this article, come on over and see what else we’re doing. We’ve been having some wonderful adventures."

Medium.com,Life,My Plastic-Free Lifestyle in Southeast Asia,Travel,https://medium.com/the-ascent/my-plastic-free-lifestyle-in-southeast-asia-97e372a423be?source=topic_page---------642------------------1," It was summer 2017 when I visited South-east Asia for the first time. I had high expectations that crushed the first day I arrived in Thailand. I was looking forward to those picturesque sandy beaches with turquoise waters and smiley Thais handing me coconuts all day long. I imagined myself jumping around barefoot and hanging on every palm-tree. You know, just like Instagram makes you believe it would be. Well, it was nothing like those naive imaginations in my head. Instead, it was mostly parties, disrespectful tourists trashing around, and mad Thais trying to rip off every white person they saw. I was 19 years old, all alone and never more disappointed. I kept asking myself what on Earth was I doing here? Did I really travel this far just to see all this rubbish and drunks around me? We have enough of that in Slovakia too. And without the extra sweaty heat. While I wasn’t realizing it yet back then, going there and seeing the polluted beaches and jungles live, the impact of our lifestyles was one of the best things that could ever happen to me. After three months of my eventually amazing ‘South-east Asia trip,’ I decided to quit rubbish for good as soon as I left. I was happy I saw how bad the damage was. Since then, I never bought anything in plastic again. I did the best I could to avoid any kind of waste. Sure, I wasn’t perfect. Though in the western world, with a bit of effort and all the information online, my lifestyle as an ‘eco-warrior’ was not that difficult. Now, two years later, I got back to SEA to visit the one country I skipped the last time. Vietnam. I already knew what to expect. I knew it would be far away from easy since here you get plastic with literally everything. If you buy food, drinks, clothes, even water…it’s going to come in plastic. Also, most Vietnamese speak very little English. Good luck with explaining that you’re trying to save the planet. However, since I knew what to expect, I made sure I was ready for it. This post will help you to prepare for it too so that you could inspire other travelers and maybe even locals to stop all the trashing. :) I always carry my chopsticks, bamboo bowl, wooden spoon, handkerchief, bamboo keep-cup, and a stainless steel water bottle with me. While this may sound like heaps of stuff to carry around, they’re lightweight so it’s not a problem. If you don’t have these, they usually sell them at the markets or the hippie zero-waste cafes like Vietnam Sustainable space, ‘Go eco Hanoi’, or many others. Southeast Asia is becoming slightly touristy so in the bigger cities, it should be easy to buy your own zero-waste kit. When I go to night markets or anywhere with the ‘Plastic fever danger’, I just hand my bowl to the lady selling me the food, smile, and hope for the best. There are times when my own containers make the sellers ‘angrish’ because they got caught off guard. Don’t worry though! Usually, they’re sweet and happy they’re saving their own. If you do this, you’ll be the weird tourist they’ll never forget. Hope you’re excited hah! Everybody can say hello and thank you. But why not to add a few phrases more? Learn these: No straw, please; No bag; No plastic; Use mine; Drinking water refill. Google translate is all you need here. It won’t only ease the whole process for you, but also all the locals will love you for trying to learn their language! At first, I was thinking of investing in Lifestraw water filter which filters away all the bacteria allowing you to drink the tap water. Luckily, I found out there was no need for that. Everywhere you go they usually have free water or tea. It’s totally normal, you can refill your bottle anywhere you are. Nobody frowns upon it. With the heat, we all drink like crazy and have to refill all the time. The most important thing of all! Be kind and smile! A lot. If you smile people won’t think you’re rude or weird but rather sweet. They’ll do their best to cooperate and keep you happy. Don’t beat yourself up if there’s still some plastic here and there slipping in. Sometimes, you can be 100% prepared and misunderstandings will happen. I remember I wanted to buy a Banh mi (the famous Vietnamese baguette) at a street-food stall. Most often they put it in a paper napkin and a little plastic bag. I gave the lady my own little plastic bag that I’ve been reusing for ages (already kind of attached to it). I told her in advance to put it in mine. Unfortunately, the lady misunderstood threw my plastic baggie away and put the Banh mi in a new one. I thought I’d cry when I saw it. Soon I realized that well, she misunderstood. Shit happens. Move on Kristina. Just make sure the next one understands what you’re actually doing. Later on, I had less and less situations like these. Once you get in a habit of doing these things, zero-waste lifestyle while being a traveler in SEA is not that hard. I’d say it’s even easier since no one judges you and you don’t have to explain yourself to everyone. When I got to Vietnam I had a few slips but now I don’t even need to think about it. Simply, I just don’t shop for packaged food, say no to bags, bring my utensils, know my seller ladies already, speak enough to be able to get around and that’s it. Give it time, and you’ll get used to it too. If I can do it, anyone can. Happy travels! Originally published on earthygirl.org"

e’ve considered many countries when we were thinking about where we would like to go in the world. So why did we choose Canada in the end? We wanted to live in a primarily English-speaking country since we want to be able to work and live in a country where we can fully understand the locals. We researched countries with English as their official language. Since Petra is a software developer and wants to continue growing and getting more experience in her field, we decided to have a look at the countries with more stable economies. We have also opted to go for open work permits rather than permits tied to one particular employer as this gives us more freedom. This is was our shortlist. Australia looks like a rich, beautiful and diverse country. It’s sunny with big cities and long beaches to enjoy (and there are also a lot of things that want to kill you apparently ). We did not however meet the qualifications for their Work and holiday program and Australia was a little too remote for us anyway. Getting a job first from Europe and getting sponsored also wouldn’t be that easy as Australian companies don’t attend European trade fairs that often. New Zealand: had the same problem for us with being too far from everything. The working holiday visa don’t have such strict requirements as the Australian ones, but are issued on first-come-first-served basis and are usually gone within minutes. United Kingdom is our second home as Petra is half British. We both love UK’s hospitality and culture and this country will always be a backup for us, even with the B-word just round the corner. Ireland is similar to the UK, but without all the Brexit nonsense at the moment and with the joys of the EU. Neither of us would need a work permit, which was definitely one of the plus sides. United States of America: we would love to (and hopefully will) travel across the States someday. It is Lukas’ dream to visit Wall Street and the Kennedy Space Center. However, the Working Holiday visas USA offers are only for a couple of months. There’s also the green card lottery with a limited amount of work permits given out each year to randomly selected individuals from countries with low immigration rates to the USA, we might try that in the future, who knows! We chose Canada in the end as we wanted to try living on a different continent. Canada is perfect for this because — while being on the other side of the Atlantic — there are direct flights from Prague and most European capitals. It is said that Canada is the perfect mix of American and European culture. It’s very culturally diverse and with its lack of mass shootings it also seems safer than the USA. It is also a popular destination for Czech students of geospatial sciences as Canada is a vast country and there are plenty of job opportunities. We have decided to start our big journey in Toronto, but we’ll see where we’ll end up in the end. We could have gone to the UK or Ireland and things would have been much easier — as their are both part of the EU (for the time being), we would only have to pack up our bags and move there. This was indeed our original plan but when at least one of us received the invitation for the International experience Canada program, we have decided to take up this offer and go there instead. As we are in a common law relationship, Lukas can apply for an open work permit on the basis of Petra having a stable job for at least 3 months. This isn’t a problem as Lukas has other sources of income too. We are both young and this seems like the perfect time to go and see the world. We can always come back or live somewhere else, but it would be a shame not to take advantage of the IEC program since the chances of getting chosen are relatively slim and you can only participate in the Czech Republic if you are under 35 years of age."

merica is obsessed with materialism. So much so that going to the mall is what passes for a cultural activity for kids, teenagers, and adults alike. Back when I was working as a tour director in Europe with American groups, I was always surprised our tours included built-in shopping time and not just a cursory 10 minutes in the museum gift shop. I even had passengers whose sole purpose during a Paris trip was to go to the Champs-Élysées and melt some plastic. They showed little to no interest in culture, and their attitude wasn’t even location specific. Whether in Paris, London, Rome, Amsterdam, or Athens, some folks were only traveling to collect things they could show off upon returning home. Bragging is central to some people’s sense of self, like those who can’t stop flashing their cash and gloating about what they can afford, as if money made them a worthier human somehow. What I came to think of as ‘the American affliction’ wasn’t common to all groups, thankfully. Many of my passengers wanted to soak up as much culture as possible and binge on knowledge and I was delighted to oblige, even after hours. On one occasion, we walked so many miles around Paris taking in all the sights that the sole of my boot split into two and I flip flopped all the way back to the hotel amid general hilarity. Such guests were a gift; seeing European culture through their eyes full of wonder meant I’d fall in love with it all over again, day in, day out. And notice things I had never noticed before as I kept on learning about places I’d known my whole life. All the shoppers wanted, meanwhile, was for me to circle métro stations or Tube stops on a map and send them on their merry way. It made for soul-crushing trips when I could feel my brain atrophy in disbelief. On such tours, I became a glorified shopping directory, which was dispiriting. But I made sure they went home happy regardless; this was my job."
Medium.com,Life,IVF no good? Try Britain’s ‘Rude Man’ to Improve Your Fertility,Travel,https://psiloveyou.xyz/ivf-no-good-try-britains-rude-man-to-improve-your-fertility-84ebab5c27c5?source=topic_page---------646------------------1," It
is one of those charming coincidences that only comes from research, fortuitous stumbling or more often a mixture of both: The Cerne Abbas Giant, Britain’s proudest fertility symbol and advertise of condoms, stands less than a mile from the filming of one of our earliest and bawdiest novels. The History of Tom Jones, a Foundling, Henry Fielding’s lusty episodic classic published in 1749, used Cerne Abbey as Squire Weston’s House while making the eponymous film, with a young Albert Finney and Susannah York escaping through the double oriel window of the Abbot’s Porch. In another scene that showed protagonists roistering minutes before a hunt, the abbey courtyard was used. Though why one small English village finds itself a proselytiser for earthy sensuality will likely remain a mystery. On a chilly and unseasonable summer’s day, the Dorset landscape looks no more fecund than any other, yet a notice states a proliferation of flora and fauna almost as if the big man was the giver of life itself, not Mother Earth exactly, but perhaps her son, Master Earth. Driving along the A352 between Sherborne and Dorset, the 180-foot figure cut into Giant Hill, known to millions courtesy of the BBC’s global balloon, comes into the view at the sweep of a bend. A layby-cum-viewing station offers respite from the steering wheel and discourages walkers from finding their way across the stubble field. A National Trust sign warns the best way to see both giant (sometimes called the ‘Rude Man’) and earthworks, known as The Trendle, is from here. There is little doubt it’s a fine view, square on and straightforward. But there is nothing like getting up close and personal to an ancient monument to breathe in history. The Cerne Abbas Giant’s provenance has long been the subject of hot debate: Is he a prehistoric or Roman figure of Hercules, as some believe, or a 17th century hoax? The latter is given some credence by the earliest known reference appearing in church records in 1694. One school of thought suggests he is a caricature of the tyrannical Oliver Cromwell, scourge of the Irish, cut into Giant Hill by Lord Denzil Holles, a critic of Cromwell who owned the hill between 1642 and 1666; another that he is the Saxon God Heil or the Iron Age god Cernunnus. It is possible that in typically English fashion the figure was ignored for years out of awkwardness at the sight of an enormous phallus and testes protruding on to local sensibilities. It was reason enough to press on and attempt a closer view. I strolled down a lane towards a designated picnic area and the giant slipped away. Three women in yellow, blue and red coats and a bright orange sign warning of thieves announced themselves with an undignified boldness, contrasting starkly with the rolling down land. The giant belonged not just to another age but it seemed to another species: Whether several hundred or thousands of years old, he is clearly from a time when the distinction between man and nature fell short of today’s painful chasm. Walking on, I crossed running water and followed footpath signs past a corrugated barn and a vehicular track which rounded towards the corner of the field; the giant’s patch of land rose sharply from behind a line of trees. I climbed a stile and attempted two paths, both going around the mound and both leading away from my goal. The true path was no path at all and seemed only for goats and madmen shearing vertically straight through a dense clay mud that swallows boots whole, as if nature and man were acting together at last, but in a way designed to obfuscate in favour of the Trust’s concern about soil erosion. After some sticky moments, a three-stranded barbwire fence protecting the monument came into view but the mainly concave figure lying below the surface of the turf did not. When you get close to the perimeter fence, the notice that says the best view is from the road rings deafeningly true. Helicopters excepted of course."

In the end, McCollum and her husband traveled but chose to delay trying to conceive for six months, per the doctors’ recommendations. McCollum is currently pregnant and expecting a baby girl in January. She says her doctors seem less worried about Zika virus now than they were in 2016. Still, it’s been hard to shift from the conservative mindset McCollum was in when Zika was a more prevalent fixture in the news. “I think in the back of my mind, the extreme caution we had when we were first trying is still playing a role in any decision I would make when traveling too far from home,” she said. For couples who are trying to get pregnant these days, the dramatic rise and fall of Zika virus from the public consciousness, coupled with the dearth of information about what the actual risk level is for contracting Zika in 2019, has created a minefield. Even the most scientifically literate couples would be hard-pressed to make a decision about whether or not to book travel plans solely based on the U.S. Centers for Disease Control’s traveler’s health website."
Medium.com,Life,Attending Yoga Festivals on a Budget,Travel,https://medium.com/the-ascent/attending-yoga-festivals-on-a-budget-ee9554527e81?source=topic_page---------651------------------1," Note: I am not affiliated with any of the programs/companies that may be mentioned in this post. This is just an honest summary of my experiences! If you are one of those people who enjoys the benefits of yoga — improved strength and mobility, a sense of grounding, and improved flexibility thanks to all that stretching — you might want to try a full-on festival. Imagine several days of unlimited classes with high-profile teachers, usually set in scenic locales close to mountains/lakes/oceans, with lots of friendly people, great live music and tons of cool experiences beyond your standard vinyasa (stand-up paddleboarding, hiking, sound baths, breathwork, kayaking, rock climbing…) essentially a weekend wellness getaway. Yoga gets a bad rap sometimes for being an expensive privileged hobby (which it really doesn’t have to be at all — I mostly practice in my house by watching YouTube videos). Festivals are not immune to this, but from my personal experience, the takeaways one can get for personal development and self-care make attending one worth it. I’ve learned about topics ranging from “how to do a handstand” to “the history of how the female anatomy was named.” I’ve met lots of normal everyday people — men and women — who inspired me with their personal stories about work, parenting and self-care through the ups and downs of life. The general festival environment also encourages me to feel more open minded and relaxed — something which I don’t always have the luxury of on a daily basis. Some of the festivals also have childcare available if you are a parent, so they are definitely family-friendly events. If you’ve always been interested in attending a yoga festival but cringed at the prospective cost, here’s a practical guide on how I managed to attend a 3-day yoga festival for around $250. This was including a significant budget for food and souvenirs. Tickets to these events are usually the biggest cost. A four-day pass at Wanderlust, which is one of the big name yoga festivals, can run you close to $400. It was my first ever festival, and I took advantage of the student discount to dip my toes into the water. I loved the experience and wanted to attend another one, but knew I’d have to cut down on spending. For this post I volunteered at Barefoot and Free yoga festival in Michigan, which enabled me to do 8 hours of work in exchange for a weekend pass. I spent one of my shifts helping to sell festival shirts, and another shift watching the vendor gate to make sure regular attendees didn’t accidentally park there. I managed to take five 90-minute classes on the times I wasn’t volunteering, several of which were styles of yoga I hadn’t tried before or were focused on more advanced practices. One of my college friends came with me so we spent a lot of time just hanging out; otherwise I would definitely have squeezed in 2–3 more classes. The only thing I paid for was a $15 stand-up paddleboarding class as an add-on (which is really on the cheaper end of the spectrum in terms of SUP classes). You can also volunteer at Wanderlust and some of the other festivals as well — check their websites for details! It’s a great way to get more involved in the festival and also meet new people (one of our fellow volunteers was a pregnant mama). Cost: $15 for the SUP class This is another big money suck. If you fly to an exotic locale your transportation costs will go up. If the drive is long, choose a festival location based on where you can find cheap plane tickets, or see if there’s someone you could rideshare with. Yogis are usually a friendly bunch. I live in Pittsburgh, PA and attended festivals in Michigan and West Virginia, both around 4–5 hours drive from me. With my trusty 2007 Prius I was able to spend around $40 round trip for gas. Don’t forget extra money for toll roads. Cost: $75 including tolls For me this meant camping. At Wanderlust, there were terrible winds and rain the whole weekend and my tent unfortunately was leaking. Luckily I met a really generous woman who let me use the extra bed in her hotel room (I told you yogis were nice folks). For Barefoot, I borrowed a better tent from a friend. As luck would have it, it rained again, but this time I stayed dry. You might be able to share the cost of a hotel room with other festival goers if you really don’t want to sleep in a tent — check Facebook pages or other social media that the festival may have. Cost: $50 for 2 nights of camping At both festivals I attended, I saved some money by cooking several meals on a camp stove. Still, I budgeted some money this time for indulging in fancy artisanal food truck bites. Food came in to be one of my biggest expenses (blame all the exotic kombucha flavors). I also bought a couple of souvenirs, including a headband and tank top from a company that donates at least 2% of their revenue to nonprofit youth programs in Detroit. I knew that I wanted a keepsake from the festival, and felt good about where my money was going. (By the way, did you know that there is a difference between a business donating a percentage of profits vs. a percentage of revenue? Educate yourself so that you can better decide what companies you’d like to support!) Cost: $70 for food and $40 for the tank top/headband Last but definitely not least. Turn off your phone. Breathe in the fresh air. Listen to the bugs and birds chirping in the woods. Shake the hand of the person on the mat next to you, and make a new friend. Take a run or go swimming. Nap. Write down notes about something you learned from a speaker or teacher who inspired you. Laugh and dance as much as you can. Cost: Priceless Thanks for reading!"

Way back in 2013, on fieldwork in Manila, I learned that the old-school way of navigating the city still worked — asking for directions. I had been relying on Google Maps to get to the nooks and crannies of the city. I found that there were occasional inaccuracies, where a building was not where it said on my little screen. As an introvert, interacting with people is something I have had to cultivate, not an automatic impulse. Sitting in the jeepney, and desperate to get to my destination, pre-internet habits kicked in. The driver was friendly and obliging. Filipino discursive exchange is, of course, far from efficient. And before I could get the information I needed, I had to wend my way through reciprocal recognition. I see you, you see me, and on this plane, we are equals. See, getting information from the internet is easier. We don’t need to invest emotional labor in dealing with another human being. Because seeing someone, really seeing someone, means giving of oneself. Last year, I made an attempt to learn Dutch after a moment of panic while in office. The PA system had made an announcement for people to evacuate the building. It was summer and D5.00 was deserted. The English announcement had come five minutes later than the Dutch one. A lot of things could have happened in five minutes. It could have meant the difference between being alive outside or buried in a rubble. So even though it probably wasn’t the wisest decision given my work load, I invested two evenings per week in Dutch. It isn’t a particularly difficult language to learn when you already speak English and can distinguish your verb from your adverb. Technically, you can get by in the Netherlands with only English. You have to understand though, that this will mean going through life handicapped. Not knowing Dutch means being partially deaf, mute and blind. The cycling lanes in Amsterdam can get pretty hectic during rush hours. You pick up cycling norms as you go, an important one being that slow-pokes stay on the right. While cycling, someone put their arm against my torso to ‘gently’ prod me to get out of the way. I suppose he had said something to the effect. But being ‘deaf’, I had no idea that he was attempting to pass me. Missing verbal cues can be hazardous to your health, sure, but even when there are no probable fatal outcomes it just makes living a bit more difficult. Sometimes it makes you feel like an idiot. For example, when an attendant at the H&M near Dam Square had apparently announced to shoppers on the floor that they could go ahead and try on clothes at the paskamer (fitting room) before she put a rack to block entry, I was, of course, oblivious. I completely missed the verbal cue, not being able to distinguish her voice from the general background noise. Ever try to do the groceries, or any shopping for that matter, when you can’t read labels? Ever try to figure out correspondence from immigration, tax, or municipal authorities? Fear no more! There’s the Google Translate app you can download on your phone. The niftiest bit is that you can take a photo — say of the food label or the hard copy of a letter — the app will then scan, and ask you to choose which bits to translate. It’s surprising what Google can do for you too, when you’re browsing online. I can’t imagine navigating Dutch internet without Chrome’s right-click, translate to English feature. I couldn’t have applied for healthcare insurance, figured I needed DigID, or fill out various government forms. I couldn’t shop on the Dutch version of Amazon, Bol. Or other useful merchants like Cool Blue or Mediamarkt. I couldn’t understand some instructions from my bank. In the non-digital world, I can count on my other senses to communicate when English fails. Making eye contact, a touch, or a smile can convey things words can’t. Being handicapped in this specific way reminds you how our species have had to get along to survive — with feeling, embodied cognition, tact that comes from tactile, auditory stimuli and proxemics. The kind of information this short reflection could never convey."

But it won’t be this year: read on for yet another small collection of vignettes of intriguing human behaviour, seen through the sunglasses of an accidental (behavioural) economist who cannot help wondering why at his own behaviour and that of others. It began weeks before the actual trip. While completing the booking of our ferry crossing, the site helpfully asked whether I would be interested in paying £10 (each way) extra for priority embarkation and disembarkation. Why would anyone spend this money? A simple question, concealing a rather complex reality. Let’s start with a System-2 perspective, using logic and reasoning to work out the actual benefits, and whether they would represent a good use of £10 (each way). Clearly, speed would be one. During embarkation, it would give a traveller the chance of finding a suitable spot on the ship before the crowds arrive, and at the other end it would ensure minimal queuing leaving the port (which, in Dunkirk, can be tricky). But how much time? Probably about no more than 15–20 minutes. There is an opportunity for some System-1 thinking to slip in here, with an effect called intertemporal discounting. Would you pay £10 now, so you can be on your way in 505 hours and 40 minutes from now, instead of in 506 hours? That doesn’t quite feel substantial enough to spend a tenner on (about the price of three coffees on board). But still, some people do it — I see it every time I take a ferry: a dozen or so cars are let on first, parking right in front of the exit ramp, a big sign behind the last one indicating these are priority places. The ferry company, of course, knows about scarcity — even though the demand is almost always smaller than the capacity, they were not shy, when I was making the reservation, to point out that priority places are limited. Is that what is behind it? Perhaps. Then again, the time saving that looked small three weeks ago doesn’t feel so insignificant when you’re queuing to drive on board, or worse, when you’re queuing to get on the road after arriving. If you really thought about it, it might still not justify the £10, but it definitely feels more worthwhile than at the time of booking. And there is of course the intangible benefit: yes, you would save a handful of minutes, but you would also be among the first to disembark. If you’re easily frustrated by the wait getting off the ship, that’s a strong, memorable emotion. People with a good memory of earlier experiences may well be swayed by this line of thought, even weeks before the actual journey. Still not convinced of its value? Here’s another way of looking at it. Imagine you arrive at the port, with 200 vehicles ahead of you. You are given the choice of either free priority status, or a £10 cash discount on your ticket price. I suspect even I might be tempted to opt for the status and the time saving, rather than for the money back in this case… One of the many traditions during our annual summer trip to the home country is a visit to a (locally) famous seafood restaurant. It is quite a peculiar place — on its own, well off the beaten track (walking there from the town centre, will take you nearly 30 minutes). Mussels ‘nature’ (just cooked in water and vegetables, no fancy stuff) are about a third dearer than at typical establishments in town. Worst of all: they’re served with bread, rather than with frites — this Belgian (!) restaurant manages to not serve fries at all. Then surely it has to be very posh inside? A place where the house wine costs 23 euros (about £21) for a bottle must be quite something, surely. Well, no: the place is really a huge old shack, with shared tables arranged like in a school refectory, seating around 150 people. Not a hint of candlelight or free amuse-bouches. Yet the flagship item on offer, prominently displayed on the menu, is the grand-sounding Plateau Royal, a large seafood platter for two with a Canadian lobster and a bottle of champagne, a snip at just under 150 euros (£135). They certainly know how to do anchoring. Why would people come here, and queue up outside in the rain for up to half an hour to enjoy the somewhat overpriced delights in distinctly modest surroundings? The place has a reputation — in a category of its own. The quirks are piled on top of each other (no meat, no fries or potatoes of any description, open only between 6 and 8.30pm, cannot book ahead, idiosyncratic interior and so on) making it hard to compare it with anything else. It may be bad news for anyone who doesn’t eat seafood, but that’s a price they’re willing to pay. Seafood (especially shellfish) tends to be more expensive than meat or vegetarian dishes anywhere, but if everything is seafood, everything on the menu is pricy, again making rational comparison harder. The daily queues of guests (on one visit I counted over 100 people) reinforce the message that it must be superior: what better way to provide social proof? And nobody would, of course, admit their meal it was just meh, if they had been waiting for a table for over 20 minutes. We are pretty good at saying whether something is better or worse than something else, but if there is nothing to compare with, we are prey to rules of thumb. And these all suggest that this must be an excellent restaurant, otherwise nobody in their right mind would go there. Genius! On the Sunday morning I strolled over to the baker’s for some delicious boterkoeken, a Belgian breakfast delicacy made with puff pastry and, you guessed it, butter (a bit like croissants, but much better). It was barely 8.30 but the shop was already bursting with customers, and outside in the morning sun there was a queue of about half a dozen people (social proof again!). Intriguingly, every time someone came out, the first person in the queue immediately squeezed themselves into the store. This not only maintained the packed conditions inside, but also increased the chance that someone would be served out of sequence (neatly queuing does not come natural to Belgians; queue jumping, unfortunately, does). Why would people want to exacerbate this situation? Imagine the situation before the queue forms: just a handful of customers in the shop. It gets busier and busier, and still people enter the store. At what point will the next customer decide to wait outside? A queue of one looks a bit silly, so there is a natural tendency to go inside rather than to start forming a queue when there is nobody else. “There is always room for one more,” we think, so the store gets really packed before the queue eventually starts to form. And it remains full: one customer coming out means there is definitely room for another one to go in. There is probably even more to it than this. Pastries are, eventually, scarce goods on Sunday mornings — be late, and you’ll have to make do with plain rolls instead. So actually being inside, the desirable goodies within reach, gives us the idea that we’re closer to getting it than outside behind the shop window. If you’ve ever had Belgian breakfast pastries, you’ll know this is a powerful motive, however illusory. Online trading of used goods has taken the world by storm since Craigslist and eBay arrived on the fledgling internet scene in the mid-1990s. With small ads you could only reach people living nearby, but now your entire country is your marketplace, if not the whole world. And it is not only the massive increase in both supply and demand base that is behind the success of online trading: the whole process, from searching for items, to buying and paying for them, and eventually obtaining them is in general a lot more efficient. Yet there is still a lot of offline trading going on. Why do people still make that effort? Another of the recurring activities of our annual trip is a visit to the ‘International Flea Market’ of Oudenburg, a small town just inland from Ostend. The name of the event seems a little grandiose, but it does attract people from abroad: France and the Netherlands are just 25 miles away, and many foreigners on holiday tend to drop by. Some of them come well prepared and organized: every year, you can see people pulling shopping trolleys or even small carts so there’ll be no bargain they’ll have to say no to. Others just walk around awkwardly carrying the large objects they got for a song. It’s not my kind of thing, and while my companions roam the nearly 2km of streets lined with well over 500 stalls, I sit down somewhere with a cold beer and a book, but not before having a look around as well and soaking up the atmosphere. And it is not hard to see the attraction of meatspace trading compared with the online equivalent. There is the general human-to-human interaction, and the opportunity for face-to-face negotiation, often interesting to observe when buyer and seller do not speak each other’s language. There is the very visual display of utter abundance, much more powerful than what an online platform can achieve, even if these have undoubtedly an order of magnitude more items on offer. And there is the profound serendipity of a huge flea market, displayed in glorious disorganization. Who needs everything arranged neatly in categories, if you enjoy the surprise of the unexpected discovery of an item you didn’t even realized you missed? Efficiency is not the only thing that matters, and there are plenty of reasons why we should not expect the demise of the flea market just yet — although there is one aspect it shares with online market places: the network effect. Both thrive because more people, both sellers and buyers, attract even more buyers and sellers. When you look around you, on holiday or not, with sunglasses or without, there is a lot of behaviour that raises the question why? And more often than not, it’s (behavioural) economics that comes up with the answer. We truly are economic beings."
Medium.com,Life,Breath deep and let go: Finding compassion through meditation and travelling,Travel,https://medium.com/@iita.poijula/breath-deep-and-let-go-finding-compassion-through-meditation-and-travelling-b43b17bd2ce0?source=topic_page---------655------------------1," I was couchsurfing recently in north Ghana where my host told me about his previous couchsurfing experiences. There was one particular story that really stroke me where he pointed out something in travellers’ behaviour that I had also been thinking lately: one day he brought his surfers to a bus station where two men helped them to find a suitable bus for them. The guests handed their luggage for the bus driver and were about to step into the bus when the two helpers asked them for two cedis (0,35 euros) as a tip. The surfers refused to pay, and that is when my host understandably got angry: how come they can’t pay such a small tip for the people who helped them to find a bus that probably saved them a lot of money? Two cedis is not enough to get anyone even a meal but they still refused to show this small gesture of gratitude! My host was very aware that travellers don’t have much money but he claimed that if they want to cheap up from this, they should not travel at all. This is just a small thing that happened to my host, but we both agreed that this behaviour is quite common among travellers. I begin to think further why travellers are so selfish despite seeing so much — and the more I thought about it, the more convinced I was that travellers should meditate. See, being generous should be an essential part of travelling as it is seen a part of the journey in meditating: in Buddhism, the cultivation of dana, generousity, offers the possibility of purifying and transforming greed, clinging, and self-centeredness. Travelling and meditating have been the biggest things that, in the last years, have taught me the most. Either I learned from doing them or I learned indirectly from the skills I got by practising them. I believe the main reason why people practise both travelling and meditating is to find oneself. That, admittedly, is kind of a bad starting point for a hobby; do you really wanna pollute the whole world by flying to distant places just that you can find yourself? Practising meditation does not obviously pollute but sometimes it makes one more selfish: I have witnessed a passionate practitioner turning their back to a starving elderly begging in the street because “they don’t want that negativity in their life”. Finding yourself should not mean turning your back to bad things in the world. In my experience, meditation was never about the good vibes and travelling was never about the selfies in white, sandy beaches. There is something more. According to Buddhism, one needs to be compassionate and wise to realise enlightenment. I believe this would be a great start to do both meditation and travelling: to become wiser and more compassionate. Until recent years, I never had the urge to try meditation. Growing up in the countryside, I had plenty of time for myself and loved to wonder in forests for hours thinking about life and listening to only my feelings. I have always spent a significant amount of time thinking and dreaming and I think that’s why I never had the urge to “find myself” and meditate. I was introduced to it through my other selfish hobby: travelling. A few years ago I was spending time in southern India — and you know for sure what one has to experience when in India! So I went to a zen buddhist centre for a week. There I tried to sit without moving, read a bunch of books about meditation techniques and non-religious meditation and wondered why the hell would I do this for hours per day. I know myself already. I rather walk in the woods than sit in an uncomfortable position for hours. After a while I stopped reading the books and just sat. I tried to freeze the anthill of thoughts inside my head and focus on breathing, just like the books had told me. Time went by and I realised I didn’t care about getting anything from it. I became aware of myself and, most importantly, everything around me. Sitting for hours a day made me to take distance from my problems. Small things didn’t matter. I stopped over-analysing and I let go of many things that bothered me. I begin to accept myself just the way I am and the surrounding environment just the way it is. I began to accept the buzzing fly around me as a part of the surroundings. I got more patience. I started to accept all the bad things that happened to me and let them go. This is only my personal experience, but after practising meditation for a few years, I realised something important that now helps me to understand life better. Meditation is not supposed to help me to find myself or be aware of only myself but it is a good first step in the process of becoming more compassionate. I also don’t think I could’ve reached this conclusion if I didn’t travel and get to know people who are very different from me and my cultural background. They taught me patience and compassion that made me more aware, and then meditation helped me to implement it to my daily life. Why do I think that also travelling helped me to be more compassionate, and possibly wiser, instead of a polluting, self-aware douche then? When I travel, there’s the same anthill in my head and it consists of things like culture shock, outrage, denial and sometimes even anger. Every time I travel I have to let go the norms and behaviour I was used to before, then open up and listen, and finally accept things the way they are and be ready to accept other people the way they are. Like when meditating, the first step is to be aware of myself — to sit down and calm that anthill in my head. Before I could open my mind in regards of travelling, I needed to let go of many things I had learnt when I grew up and ignore many fundamental ideas from my culture. I realised I don’t need to fulfil the expectations that my society gives me. I don’t have to be like others. I can be an outlier and I don’t have to conform to all the social norms. When I realised and accepted the fact that I can’t and I don’t have to fulfil those expectations, it was easier to accept and conform to a behaviour different from what I was used to: if I don’t behave the way I was expected to behave, the rest of the world don’t need to do that either. We have to let others to be different from us. So now, when I travel, I make sure I do some meditation. It’s natural that everyone gets confused in a new environment and gets annoyed when they don’t understand what’s going on around them. This is when I go to my room, sit down and let go of my ego. It helps me with patience: I can forgive myself for acting weird and embarrassing in new situations and I get more patience in listening and understanding other people. In this way meditation helps me to get to the roots of my problems. I remember when I first moved to Berlin and people seemed very rude. Customer service in the kiosks and bars seemed plain hateful. As I come from a country where people avoid confrontations and are always very nice and polite to each other, the rudeness of Berliners caught me by surprise. Sometimes, when visiting a shop, I just left my groceries on the counter and left angry, sometimes crying, because someone was unprecedentedly rude to me. Later I learned that there’s a thing called “Berliner schnauze”, which means the “snout of a Berliner”, that delivers a weird, rude behaviour. Eventually I had to stop being angry at a big part of the Berliners and find understanding for this, in my point of view, bad behaviour. After countless trials and errors, I found out two ways to respond to the famous Berliner schnauze: if I’m tired, I can just do what I came to do and ignore them or, if I’m in a good mood, I can respond with something witty and voila — we are now having a friendly conversation. Why did I give earlier the example of the two travellers not wanting to give a single dime for the men helping them? Because they were selfish, they lacked compassion and understanding. They forgot the dana, the way out of greed and self-centredness. People like me search for new experiences through travelling but we should not forget the two fundamentals: compassion and wisdom. If the world revolves around our own needs, we will never get real experiences and we will never find what we’re looking for. I am only at the beginning of my journey of learning through meditation and travelling but I believe the thing most of us is looking for is not ourselves, it’s each others. I want to continue getting to know people different from me, let go, open up, accept myself and be ready to accept others. In my case, travelling and meditating opened a whole new world that doesn’t revolve around me. In the centre of this world is the dana: if someone helps you to find a right bus to travel, give them a thank you — in the shape of a smile or, in my friend’s case, money. Give them two cedis from what you have. We are all poor travellers trying to share the same world. By finding yourself you find everyone else."
Medium.com,Life,Why travel-schooling is not just another family holiday,Travel,https://medium.com/@Prajakta/why-travel-schooling-is-not-just-another-family-holiday-d1751caca2f7?source=topic_page---------656------------------1," When I shared my idea of taking a sabbatical from my job as a senior economist in February this year, I was met with wonder, as expected. However, the person’s next sentence would invariably disappoint me because almost everybody misunderstood what I was setting out to do with my family. Most colleagues and friends thought of this as a travel adventure, some kind of a tick mark on our family’s bucket list. It is very much an adventure, a travel adventure yet it is also fundamentally different. Because why we set out on this journey is totally different. My husband and I are both travelers and we are immersive travelers. Between the two of us we have traveled to nearly a hundred countries and lived in (tax-paying residents) at least five major global regions. Our kids were born in different locations, they were vaccinated in hospitals across the world from Qatar to Canada. And their Skype pals exist in a dozen countries. With our family’s lifestyle and experience already being so international, what then are we trying to achieve through travel-schooling, that is different from travel-ing? Lots. In travel-schooling, our itinerary is focussed on educational experiences. For example, when we started off with Tahiti in February, it was a natural next step to my daughters’ growing interest in marine life. In the preceding year, we had purchased a family membership of the Ripley’s aquarium in Toronto and the girls had made a dozen trips. Now it was a great chance to take this interest forward and have them interact with marine life in its natural habitat. The lagoons off the coast of Moorea in French Polynesia offer the chance to swim with sting rays and black tip sharks in a calm, natural environment. As it is the animals’ natural habitat, they do not feel threatened by visitors and freely swim around us, even caress our bodies playfully. This was neither the easiest place to get to, nor economical in any way, yet it was a deeply immersive educational experience. Travel schooling is full of such experiences, which have the potential to fire imagination, directly. Based on what piques at our curiosity, we curate specific experiential learning opportunities, and travel to them. Conversely, we also ruthlessly drop any experiences which do not align. Even if they may be “wonders” or “once in a lifetime experiences”. For example, scenery and architecture bores my girls who are soon turning five and three years old. So when we made our trip to Australia in March, we dropped Sydney and the Great Ocean Road altogether and instead spent a week on Phillip Island so we could immerse in interacting with fairy penguins and koalas, even making multiple visits to the sanctuaries if the children enjoyed it. And we did… I am sure the opera house in Sydney is phenomenal, in fact it is on my personal bucket list. Yet, the point is that if we are travel schooling instead of a family holiday we can’t maximise what we see, instead we make strategic trade offs in the interest of appropriate learning. Just as we made strategic omissions, we also remain open to curiosity-led detours. In fact, as slightly more seasoned travel schoolers, now we even look for them. Detours are very useful learning journeys, in fact, they are crucial to making travel as enriching as possible. The mind is most open to learning when it is intrigued. So we remain on stand-by for sparks of such intrigue and then let them take us on an unplanned path. Recently we did a 17 day road trip across northern US to get from Toronto where we live, to Vancouver where we are spending the summer. The detours punctuated our journey with so many priceless moments. For example, while staring at the route we were taking through Iowa I spotted something called the Maharshi Vedic City. An opportunity to expose my girls to anything Vedic seals the deal for me, so I quickly googled what a Vedic city in rural America was all about. Fascinated that Maharshi Mahesh Yogi had built this city based on Vedic principles of architecture, we decided to make a 100 kilometre detour to visit it. My younger daughter had dozed off in her car seat but the elder daughter had a great time playing in the astronomical observatory they have built amidst houses, each of which has a golden kalash on its roof. I also walked with her to the Ayurvedic spa and meditation centre, the decor of which included interesting art based on chakras and mantras, important spiritual symbols in the Vedic culture. Here, nothing was obviously educational yet the calm, Veda-inspired atmosphere certainly must have left a subliminal impression on her mind. As for me, I’ve added a longer stay at this serene yet energetic city to my own bucket list. The essence is — very unlike a family holiday, a travel education journey needs broad planning but flexibility in details. Because often it is such unplanned forks and twists which give us something to learn and remember about our journeys, many years later. We may meet interesting people (or animals!) Another key element of travel schooling is that there is a structure to the day. We rarely ever step out for the day before 11 a.m. On most holidays, that’s half a day lost. Yet we learnt that children need a sense of home, especially because travel schooling can stretch from days to several months. A structure of some sort is a good way to create that anchor to their daily lives. For us, our morning and bed-time routines worked well. We always started the day with a good breakfast and journaling (my daughters love art!), sometimes even a couple of hours at a nearby cafe. And every night we read their favourite bed-time stories. Over time, we also added another element during the day — playground. Everywhere that we go, we make sure to find a good park or playground nearby which we then frequent during our stay. I had wanted to write this article right away when we were beginning our travel schooling as an experiment. I’m glad I procrastinated. That article would have been the ideas in our minds, whereas this one is seasoned with what we learnt about our own intentions behind what we are doing, through actually doing it for six months. In a nutshell, the fundamental difference between travel schooling and a family holiday distils down to why we embark on it. In travel schooling, learning is the primary objective of traveling, not an incidental outcome of a holiday. If you are dreaming about a similar travel schooling adventure for your family, do write to us. We’d be delighted to share tips. If you’re further ahead on such an adventure, do let us know too because we’d love to learn how to do this better!"
Medium.com,Life,Moving to Tokyo,Travel,https://medium.com/@christiancasim/moving-to-tokyo-377380b4287b?source=topic_page---------657------------------1," Quick tips from an initially confused Singaporean! Congratulations on being offered an opportunity to live, work and play in Tokyo! If you are (just like I was) unsure as to how things will look from here, follow this guide to learn what you’ll need to do to quickly get settled. I’ve written this post just two weeks after moving to Tokyo in the hope that it will be relevant and useful to someone, so forgive me if what you actually experience differs a little. To make the best of this guide, I’d suggest you read the sections in the written order; each item successively allows for the next to be completed. I’ve written the guide in this way so that you can receive your relocation package/salary as soon as possible; the opening of a Bank Account is crucial for this. Given the exchange rate and cash culture in Japan, you will want to secure local currency quickly. This article is split into two sections; Part #1 — Home Country and Part #2 — Tokyo. For quick reference, the sub-sections are organised according to: Generally, I’d recommend you to start applying for your Certificate of Eligibility / VISA a month before your Departure Date, and move to Tokyo six weeks before your Start Date (That’s a total of two and a half months preparation before your first day at work). This way you’ll have ample time to prepare. Upon being offered a role, your employer will pass you some documentation as a pre-requisite for a VISA. Half of this documentation will be filled by your employer and the other half by you. Here you will help them to: Take some time to look through the documentation and answer as carefully as you can — You want to avoid any instance of a ‘back-and-forth’ between you, your HR representative (or person facilitating the VISA process) and the Japanese authorities. *Note: Do not strikeout wrongly filled sections — This is not acceptable and will result in a returned form. The forms will be in Japanese, but if your Japanese is not proficient, Google Translate is accurate enough to give you a sense of what you’ll be answering. Cater around two to three weeks for processing, following which you should receive (via mail) an approved CoE which looks like this: A CoE effectively allows you to apply for a VISA. Once receiving it, you should head to your local Japanese Embassy. In my case, this was the Embassy of Japan in Singapore (For Singaporeans: There’s no parking but Tanglin Shopping Centre’s about 10 minutes away). The embassy will require a few additional documents from you, including your passport (not expired) and recent colour photo. This may defer from country to country, so make sure that you ask for the list before heading down. For Singaporeans, visit this link and look for “Work or Long-term Stay (with Certificate of Eligibility)”. If all your documents are in order, the embassy will likely take about a week to process your application. When you next see them, you’ll be returned your passport with a page displaying your official VISA. Take note of which page this is on — The Immigration Officer in Japan will need this in order to prepare your Resident Card (*See below: Resident Card). Now that you are officially a Resident of Japan, You should begin viewing apartments online and arranging for meetings and viewings with Real Estate Agents. You’ll want to start this process early if you are short on time. Take some time to research different areas of Tokyo and see if they match your preferences in terms of the environment, cost and other things which would make the next few years of your life enjoyable! Some quick examples would be Ebisu, which has a more affluent feel, lots of cafes and close to the Tokyo CBD, and Chiba which is popular with young families, has good amenities and away from the bustle of Tokyo. Note that the Real Estate process in Japan may differ quite a bit from your home country. While the upfront charges will vary from agent-to-agent, expect to pay: *Note: TransferWise has a great article on this: https://transferwise.com/gb/blog/renting-process-in-japan-guide When you arrive in Japan, the Immigration Officer will see that your passport contains a Working Visa and take you through a roughly twenty-minutes process of preparing your Resident Card. You won’t have to do much here, so just follow his/her instructions and wait to receive your newly minted card!"
Medium.com,Life,Hanging From Chandeliers,Travel,https://medium.com/@heyrocker/hanging-from-chandeliers-3f423a042f96?source=topic_page---------658------------------1," This piece contains references to events that happened with a past employer of mine. While it was very traumatic at the time, I consider it all water under the bridge at this point and have long since made my peace with those involved. The company is long gone, everyone has scattered. Any attempts to re-litigate it, pro or con, will be removed. In September of 2011 I was living in Stockholm, Sweden and my life was … kind of in shambles. I had moved to Europe with my fiancee, but 9 months later we we were done, and I moved out as quickly as possible with my cat Ozu into the first place I could find. While my co-workers were all lovely and amazing people, I was having a rough time finding my way into Swedish social life. I was 45 years old in a foreign country, single for the first time in almost 15 years, and I didn’t drink. I traveled a lot, speaking at any event that would have me. I dearly loved Stockholm and living in Europe, but I was also kind of lost. So when the opportunity came for me to move to Copenhagen for a few months to work with a new client, I jumped at it. I knew a lot of people down there and a change of scenery would be just the thing I needed. It turned out that due to my visa I couldn’t actually live in Copenhagen, so I would move to Malmö, a city at the Southern tip of Sweden and an easy train ride across the strait from Denmark. Additionally, my company offered to pay my rent while I was there, which would allow me to save up to buy a place back in Stockholm when I was done. This is a big deal, as apartment hunting in Sweden is notoriously difficult, especially for a foreigner. I was worried about finding a place in Malmö, however work agreed to take care of that for me, and I left for a conference in the US assured that everything was under control. When I got back, I was informed that a friend of one of my coworkers had an apartment in Malmö that was available. He described the neighborhood as “a little dicey” and I kind of laughed and said I was sure it would be fine. I mean, I had spent 15 years living in pre-gentrification Chicago. The thought of a “dicey” neighborhood in Sweden seemed hilarious and quaint. So I packed up Ozu and our few belongings, rented a car, and took off for Malmö, ready for the next leg of our journey together. It was after nightfall as we arrived, and as we turned onto Rasmusgatan, my new street, I was very ready to get some take out and settle in. Unfortunately, that was not to be, for as I turned on to my new street, what I saw was not good. Every doorway for three blocks had a collection of kids in front of it, and it was very obvious that they were all drug dealers. Cars were pulling up, kids would run out, and the car would pull away. If you have watched The Wire, the machinations of this street will be very familiar. As I approached my building and parked out front, one of the kids immediately came up and knocked on my window, asking what I was doing there. When I explained he looked at me incredulously and went back to his post. As I watched the activity around me, waiting for the guy handing me off my keys, I wondered what the fuck I had gotten myself into. When he showed up, we made our way through the group of dealers in front of the door, stepped over the junkies getting high in the stairwell, and finally got up to the apartment which is where I got my second shock — it was completely unfurnished. I had moved to Sweden with essentially nothing but my clothes and my laptop, and had only rented furnished apartments to that point, a detail which somehow got lost as work got me set up with a new place. He handed me the keys, wished me luck, and took off. Immediately I went into crisis mode, with the first order of business being where the hell I was going to sleep. I noted that IKEA was open for another hour so I ran over there and bought a mattress pad, as well as a set of dishes and a pot and some ramen. I fed Ozu and ate using my suitcase as a table. I looked around the huge empty apartment with amazement, but with the thought that while this sucked it probably wouldn’t last long. I was sure that work would help me out and we’d find me a new place pretty quickly. In the meantime I was guessing that the area was not really unsafe as much as unpleasant. I didn’t feel scared, certainly it was less “dangerous” than many places I had lived before, but I had never had this kind of gang and drug activity so in my face. I had been more scared but I had never been more uncomfortable. I also knew from my time in Chicago that generally gangs do not mess with civilians who actually live in the neighborhood, as that’s a good way to get the wrong kind of attention. So as long as everyone knew who I was, and I kept a low profile, I figured this would be nothing but a funny story down the line. The next day as I emailed my contact at the office, I Googled “Rasmusgatan” and discovered an article published in one of the Swedish newspapers that very day, declaring my block the most dangerous street in Sweden. I added that link to my email just to make sure and get the point across — this is a big mess, lets get me out of it. That was not to be. The first response from the office was that they had warned me about the neighborhood, so any problem was on me. When I pointed out that there is a big difference between “a little dicey” and “the most dangerous street in the country” they said this fell to the Copenhagen office to deal with. Copenhagen said it wasn’t their problem either, plus they were in financial trouble and couldn’t manage it. On top of that, I was told they were not going to pay my rent after all. They considered that original decision a mistake, and were revoking it. I started getting the feeling I was a hot potato, and there was a layer of politics involved that I was having a hard time penetrating. To make matters worse, given my place as a foreigner who barely spoke the language in a city with an extreme shortage of housing, I was fairly powerless to do anything about it. My ex had spent weeks searching for our first apartment in Stockholm as basically a full time job. The options for non-residents are largely reduced to grey market second or third hand sublets, and it is very easy to get scammed. Aside from my feeling that this was on my employer to fix, I just really needed their help. After several days of back and forth, the CEO and CFO of the company came down to Copenhagen to talk and told me they would be giving me no help in finding a new place or moving and wiped their hands clean of the entire mess. I was on my own. That night I went back to my apartment, climbed over the junkies, laid on my back on my mattress pad, put on The National’s High Violet, and started totally freaking out at the prospect of dealing with this. After a minute staring at the ceiling Ozu did what he always does — he came over and sat on my chest. In that moment I thought about how he always knew when I needed him the most, and god knows that was one of those times. We laid there for a while and I vividly remember petting his head as “Vanderlyle Crybaby Geeks” played. Hanging from chandeliers
Same small world at your heels I don’t think I have felt more alone and helpless in my adult life, and the comfort brought by his presence was immeasurable. Feeling his weight on my chest was always one of the most soothing things in my world. After the album ended I laid there in silence with him for a while. I was so happy to have him. In that moment he was my best and only friend, and I finally found the motivation to get started on sorting things out … as much for him as for anything. I stayed home from work the next day and started making calls. So many calls. So much broken English and Swedish. It took some weeks but I did get out. I got very lucky and found a lovely sublet in a quiet high-rise on the outskirts of town from a couple who were going to Argentina for six months. The day before I left, I had one of the most surreal conversations of my life with the dealer outside my door as I waited for a taxi. The kid turned to me and said “So is this the most fucked up place you’ve ever lived or what?” and I responded “No way man, I grew up in Chicago.” He took a step back and exclaimed “Whoah they be capping motherfuckers every fucking day in that place! We only nail a couple people a year! Damn dude!” I had no idea what to say. I didn’t realize it but in many ways that night was the first step towards my climb out of the shambles I felt my life had become. This perceived breach of trust by my company was the last of many straws that motivated me to resign, and by February of the next year Ozu and I were back in the states, settling in Portland. It was there that I really started to figure out the things that are important to me and what I wanted out of life. For the first time I started feeling comfortable in my own skin. I was at home and at peace in this new city. I made a lovely group of friends in the local pinball community. I met my wife. We bought a house. We got married. I am currently more grounded and comfortable than I ever have been before."
Medium.com,Life,When Adventure Ends,Travel,https://medium.com/@roxanneleemayer/when-adventure-ends-d2062c61a40c?source=topic_page---------659------------------1," Americans I met throughout my year in Spain would always say, “Oh, yeah, you look like you’re from Portland.” I’d beam with pride. I told everyone I met that Portland is a dreamland. On lonely days, when the Spanish language grated my ears, when my family gathered at home without me, and when the stores I needed didn’t reopen after the siesta, I missed Portland. I longed for the fresh smell of rain, and the sound of it tapping on fallen leaves. I longed to be a local again. Oregon became some impossibly beautiful thing I had left behind. But when I arrived home, I was confused and disoriented. I couldn’t remember how to get anywhere, or how to do simple things. Where do I buy cigarettes and groceries? Why is everything so expensive? Where do I go out on a Friday night? What can I do if all I want to do is sit on the dirty plaza ground, with my dirty friends, with our one euro beers, and listen to the fabulous Spanish swear at each other? I walked around in a daze, pretending to be happy to be home. The quiet hush of Oregon’s open spaces seemed sinister; the roads of a country organized around cars seemed aggressive. “I’m homesick,” I told a childhood friend, absentmindedly referring to Madrid. “But… you are home,” she said, confused. I shook my head. What do you do if your home doesn’t feel like yours anymore? I felt trapped, like I had happily skipped into a cage, and slammed it shut behind me. In Madrid, life poured into the streets with loud colors and loud voices. People leaned over intricate, iron balconies over the narrow streets, yelling. Now Madrid had become that impossibly beautiful thing I had left behind. I’d go on long walks, the cobblestones twisting me around in a maze; I’d feel like anything was possible, and watch the people walk by. Everyone dressed stylishly, in sleek black, with a cigarette hanging from their lips. It was an urban fashion show, and I went out to see and be seen. Anyone could show up and the crowd could carry me anywhere. The wild nights ran on through the dawn, and we sang into the early light, and played nylon-stringed guitars. My mind had filled with wine-colored buildings and the romance of ancient, filthy streets. I had forgotten, in those fits of nostalgia, the lonely nights when I yearned for home so desperately. Months went by, and routine took hold. I read on my porch, and biked to friends’ houses. I bought cigarettes at 7–11, and groceries at the organic-minded store down the street. In my culture-shock despair, I had believed that quiet Portland lacked any life at all. Slowly though, I began to find it. It is tucked away in cozy houses, with old friends cooking dinner and drinking nice beer. It is found in cars with their windows down, hip-hop playing through the speakers. It is in watching the wild seasons change dramatically from the same back stoop day after day. Yesterday, it rained just a little in the morning, and in the afternoon, the cherry blossoms began to bloom. I took a walk downtown, through the city so saturated with memories, the city that made me who I am. I breathed in that sweet smell of rain and flowers and smiled up at the cloud-mottled sky. I had finally come home."
Medium.com,Life,What You Should Never Do As A Tourist in Japan,Travel,https://medium.com/@ciaral2687/what-you-should-never-do-as-a-tourist-in-japan-d7a2094f80c6?source=topic_page---------660------------------1," Respect and manners are a very important aspect of Japanese culture. There are a lot of almost invisible rules that make up a big part of society in Japan. As a tourist or an expat, it can often feel daunting not knowing if you are making a cultural faux pas or not. I have certainly made a few along the way! There are several things that tourists should never do when visiting Japan and it is important to be aware of some of them. Tourists are, of course, not expected to be familiar with every aspect of Japanese culture, but knowing a few of the basics will definitely help you during your trip. However, being respectful of Japanese traditions and societal norms can only enhance your visit to Japan. Here are 10 things that you should never do when visiting Japan. While taking public transportation in Japan, it is important to know a couple of things. Talking loudly to friends on the train, chatting on the phone and blasting music through headphones are all very much frowned upon in Japan. On the subway, mobile phone use is very discreet and you’ll notice that subway rides are as quiet as they can be. Japanese people tend to use public transportation as a place to nap, relax after a hard day’s work or play games in silent mode. If I’m honest, I am glad I didn’t have to use the subway to get to work every day. More than a few times, I was squished so much that I was literally lifted off the floor (no exaggeration!). Yet, the train ride was void of noise unless you count the odd snore. While mentioning the subway, it’s important to know that there are designated female-only carts on certain lines due to groping incidents which have occurred on packed trains. If you are a solo female traveller, this is definitely something to be aware of. The female-only carts are usually at the end of the train and there is a bright pink sign to help identify them. Unlike many other countries around the world, tipping is simply not the done thing in Japan. It’s not rude as such but it is definitely not expected. And don’t be surprised if you find a waiter chasing after you if you do leave money on the table. There are several countries around the world where employees depend on tips to make up their paycheck but Japan just isn’t one of them. Anyone who works in customer service is paid a decent wage and impeccable service is almost always a given. It is not expected of you to be able to use chopsticks as a tourist in Japan but the Japanese will be super impressed if you do. Most restaurants will have forks on hand if you need one. What is really important though, whether you are a master chopstick user or not, there are certain chopstick rules in Japan. Certain chopstick use can be deemed culturally insensitive and even signal death. As a tourist visiting Japan, you should never, ever stick your chopsticks vertically in your bowl of rice — this is known as tsukitate-bashi, a ritual performed at funerals only. It is also bad luck. Nobody wants that! Also, don’t pass food to someone else’s chopsticks directly. Not only is it gross — it’s a big faux pas. It’s perfectly fine to share food but the best way is to take the food (with permission) from their plate to and place it directly on to your plate before eating it. In Japan, you really won’t see people eat or drink on the go. Yes, there are on average 5.5 million vending machines in Japan but people tend to eat/drink immediately near the machines and toss the empties into the bin next to it. Rubbish bins are ridiculously hard to come across in Japan. And yet, the country is sparkling clean so there has to be some logic to it. Similarly, eating or drinking on public transport is considered bad manners unless you’re travelling a long distance. I learned this the hard way when during my first few weeks in Tokyo, I got on a train eating an ice-pop (the humidity level was off the charts and I was looking for any way to cool down!) and low and behold it melted all over me and the seat next to me. The ice-pop was bright blue and I was bright red. Not a good combination — the Japanese are far too polite to say anything but I still cringe to this day when thinking about it! Escalator etiquette is a common faux pas among tourists in Japan especially if you don’t come from another huge city such as London or New York. It is a somewhat unwritten rule but you will see it in force everywhere from the subway to supermarkets. The left side of the escalator is for standing and the right is for walking — make sure you don’t leave the person behind you waiting though. Japanese people are far too polite to say anything so you could end up with a trail of people behind you hoping that you’ll get out of the way. Tourists visiting Japan need to be aware that wearing shoes inside certain places is something you should never do in Japan. Wearing outdoor shoes is deemed unhygienic by the Japanese so you will be expected to remove your shoes immediately when entering a Japanese home, schools, hospitals and certain restaurants and temples. Don’t worry though, slippers are always provided. When you enter a building and you see a line of shoes at the entrance, then you know that you will be expected to remove your own. For tourists, you will most likely notice this at a traditional ryokan, Japanese restaurants and of course inside shrines and temples. Also, another important rule to note is that you will be expected to exchange your slippers for ‘toilet slippers’ if you visit the loo. You’ll see them at the bathroom door so you can’t miss them — don’t forget to change back when you’re finished though! Also, restaurants often provide lockers where you can store your shoes and I definitely encourage wearing easy on-easy off shoes to hurry up the process. Personally, I love this whole concept. It’s hygienic, comfortable and something you quickly get used to. In fact, even though I’m no longer living in Japan, it is something I still do. My partner took a while to get used to it but he does it automatically now. The Japanese will always line up in single file whether it’s for the train, bus or the latest popcorn shop (yes, seriously!). To be honest, I’m not sure if they love it or hate it but queuing up is the done thing, skipping the line is not. The best example of orderly lining up I have ever seen is in Omotesando, Tokyo. Omotesando is a designer haven but it is also the most popular area for new brands/shops to open. I’ve seen queues go a mile long for things like crepes, socks and flavoured popcorn. Tourists should also know that you should never barge your way onto trains in Japan. You simply wait for people to get off completely and then get on when it’s your turn. Do expect to be squashed if it’s rush hour though and make sure that all of your limbs get on with you. I saw far too many arms and legs getting trapped indoors for my liking! Tourists travelling to Japan need to know that you should never blow your nose in public. It is rude and unhygienic to Japanese people. What to do if you feel the urge to blow your nose? Sniff or snort until you can excuse yourself to blow your nose in private. You will often hear lots of stuffy-nosed people sniffing continuously on trains, waiting patiently to give their nose a good blow at home. No matter where you travel to, it’s always a good idea to learn a few of the local phrases, right? Plus, it’s also a sign of respect and helpful too.
This is especially true of Japan. Japanese people do learn English in school and there is a huge emphasis on learning English now in the run-up to the 2020 Tokyo Olympics. However, put yourself in their shoes — wouldn’t you appreciate it if someone tried to speak to you in your native tongue? In most of the big cities in Japan, you will find people who can and will speak English but if you plan on travelling into more remote areas, this is less likely. Some Japanese friends also told me that they are sometimes shy or nervous to communicate in English for fear making a mistake. A few simple phrases certainly go a long way and expect to hear shouts of ‘Irrashaimase’ (welcome) everywhere! PDA otherwise known as public displays of affection are rarely seen among Japanese people. You might see some hand-holding but that’s about it. It is seen as very much a private thing so tourists should never get smoochy publicly in Japan unless you don’t mind an audience of shocked onlookers! For such a technologically advanced nation, Japan is still very much a cash-based society. Larger hotels and restaurants will, of course, accept credit cards but I highly recommend having Japanese yen on you at all times. In fact, up until a few years ago having a credit or debit card was almost unheard of in Japan. I had to open two bank accounts when living there — one had great rates and the other provided a debit card. The local conbini (convenience store) handles pretty much all online payments and you then pay in cash. Keep in mind too that not all ATM’s in Japan accept foreign bank cards. The ATM machines in Lawson or 7/11 are your best bet but some stop withdrawing cash at 9pm and they often charge ridiculous fees. Onsen (hot spring) bathing is a very important part of Japanese culture and they are widely visited by tourists and Japanese alike! There are certain well-established onsen rules though and there are certain things that tourists should never do when visiting one in Japan. The main rules you need to be aware of are that you must rinse off thoroughly before entering the hot spring, you need to bare all (literally), don’t take photos and always check the tattoo policy of an onsen. The tattoo rule is somewhat discriminatory but for Japanese people, tattoo’s are associated with criminal gangs or ‘yakuza’. Bathing spaces are separated by gender and you can cover up with a towel before getting in."

Medium.com,Life,Inside Tanzania’s Lucrative Safari Business,Travel,https://medium.com/@warrenbisch/inside-tanzanias-lucrative-safari-business-106f9a864b98?source=topic_page---------666------------------1," When considering an African Safari, Tanzania is frequently at the top of bucketlists, and for good reasons. The country boasts multiple natural parks encompassing nearly every type of ecosystem. Its vast game reserves, including the famous Serengeti National Park, boast the the “Big Five” animals — elephants, lions, leopards, buffaloes, and rhinos — in addition to hundreds of other species. And when the safari is done, there is a plethora of activities to choose from: climb Mount Kilimanjaro and take in the views from the alpine summit, relax by the beach in Zanzibar, enjoy the bustling city life of Dar es Salaam, to name a few. But what is life like for the hard workers making it all possible — park rangers, drivers, guides, translators, lodge staff, bathroom attendants, and cooks? And how does this massive influx of tourists affect the local economy and natural environment? I travelled to Tanzania seeking to answer these questions — interviewing the industry’s stakeholders with the goal of creating an unbiased, comprehensive report on the safari industry of Tanzania. From day one of arrival in Arusha, the northern city where most safaris begin, I quickly noticed the two main demographics purchasing safari tours — white couples in their sixties, and white couples on honeymoon. To learn more about those funding the industry, I sought to find the main motives behind going on a safari. As expected, “seeing animals in their natural habitats” was the overwhelming response from those polled. “Going on an adventure outside of our comfort zone” came in a close second, understandably. And in third, variations of “strengthening our relationship bond;” which, I’ll admit, was a bit surprising. With these motives in mind, the demographic began making more sense. Traveling to Tanzania alone is out of the comfort zone of many Americans and Europeans, let alone going on a multi-day excursion through the wilderness, making it the perfect place for those trying to break the bubble. As for seeing animals, it made sense that the main group would be composed of people who don’t have the same, majestic creatures in their own country. When it comes to strengthening bonds, though, it could go either way — if these relationships are in need of mending, spending an extended period of time together in the middle of nowhere may not be the ideal remedy. While the physical infrastructure of Tanzania could be its own topic alone, I was more interested in the infrastructure of the entire safari process — from booking to execution. More so than other tourism businesses, safari companies desperately depend on TripAdvisor reviews. It is nearly impossible to differentiate many of the packages offered, with a single raving review can be the make-or-break in getting the sale. As for the safari guides, it is an extremely competitive and sought after occupation. Guides go to the safari college in Arusha where they learn how to identify hundreds of species, when and where they are most likely to be spotted, and how to navigate the nation’s immense national parks. Once getting the job, they can expect to do a handful of trips per month, depending on the season. Guides for busy companies can do upwards of four 5-day trips in a single month, and larger groups may need an additional guide. In the backend, the safari companies work with lodges around the country to ensure a seamless checkin experience, and the restaurant kitchens prepare lunch boxes for the group. Tanzania is very protective of its national parks and thus requires entry fees and registration of visitors. In turn, the government funds anti-poaching efforts and rangers to keep the parks pristine. Every bathroom within the park is even staffed with a maintenance worker keeping the building in a constant state of sterilization. While Tanzania has a lot to offer to nature tourists, it faces tough competition in the safari industry with countries such as Kenya, South Africa, Uganda and Rwanda. Fortunately, each country has a relatively distinct ‘offering.’ For example, if you want to see gorillas you have to travel to Rwanda or Uganda. If you’d prefer to see the massive wildebeest or zebra migrations, Tanzania and Kenya are your best bet. So it really depends on what type of safari you’re after. If you are anything like me and picture the animation of Lion King when imagining a safari, then Tanzania’s Serengeti is the place for you. Plus, the close proximity of Zanzibar (25 minute flight from Dar es Salaam) provides the opportunity of diving for a sort of ocean safari!"
Medium.com,Life,Technology on Vacation,Travel,https://medium.com/techuisite/technology-on-vacation-507b3b07bd70?source=topic_page---------667------------------1," I recently went on a trip to Utah to visit family and have had some interesting insights on how I use technology. My use of technology has evolved over the years, but one thing I have decided not to do anymore is use a laptop while at the airport or on my flight. It is too cumbersome and frustrating. Even with a smaller sized laptop, it is just too big for using on a plane. I have also decided that I will only read or watch something while traveling. I have plenty of books on my iPad Kindle app, and we all know the abundance of new shows and movies that are available to watch these days. My trip to Utah was not business, but leisure and I will try to apply the same rules while on future business trips when it comes to the airport and airplane. I am currently reading (the wonderful) Make Time by Jake Knapp and John Zeratsky. And they talk about ways to limit our exposure to the internet. One of the ways to do this was to “Fly without Wifi”, here is an excerpt of this section: One of our favorite things about airplanes (apart from the sheer wonder of flying through the air) is the enforced focus. During a flight, there’s nowhere to go and nothing to do, and even if there were, the seat belt sign requires you to keep your butt in your chair. The strange parallel universe of an airplane cabin can be the perfect opportunity to read, write, knit, think, or just be bored — in a good way."

I often develop passions and furiously pursue them until I suddenly and completely lose interest on a dime, and never pick it up again. I also change jobs and cities on a whim, leaving friends and family completely in the lurch… Soooo yep... I’m the worst. In spite of this, there’s something I can always be relied on for, no-matter the situation, time or the place. No matter where I am, or where I’m going — I will always forget a plethora of critically important items that I desperately need. No matter where I’m going, I’m guaranteed to be missing something that’s very important for the trip.
Because of this, I’m often forced to improvise and plot like a crazy-person to find a solution. Inspired by my most recent travel screw-up, I’ve decided to write this Medium article to address the problem. My plan is revisit this article every-time I’m packing for a trip from now on. This article will now act as my new checklist.
So let’s begin with the item I most recently forgot. You would think the damn passport would be a difficult thing to forget, and when it comes to flying, this is often true. I have a special compartment in my bag that I exclusively use for my passport, and that’s done intentionally. However whenever I’m traveling domestically, my brain rationalizes this as a reason not to bring the thing. I always think, “Hmmmm, I’m only traveling a few hours to a nearby city. Why bring my passport? I won’t use it, and bringing it will only increase my chances of losing it.” Siiiiiiiiiiigh. It’s general knowledge that whenever you’re staying abroad, your passport is often the only form of ID that means anything to a hotel, bar, police, or anyone. A drivers license issued in a country far away means nothing in China (where I live), so it provides no assistance. Today I arrived at my hotel in Songjiang China, without my passport. Luckily for me, after a lot of persuading, the manager was convinced to accept a photo of my passport and pretend he saw the real thing. Having a photo of my passport on hand really saved me, which leads me to my second item. In today's digital world, it can seem ludicrous that an app may fail in providing everything you need. Perhaps an airline has lost your booking (or overbooked you and is lying about it). That same airline’s app may be malfunctioning and isn’t showing your booking confirmation.
They may also have never emailed you a booking confirmation when you originally paid for the flight. (This has happened to me before). Did you remember to print the screen when you paid for the flight? The screen that confirms your booking and contains a unique booking reference number? Without that printout, you’re screwed. I almost never have printouts, but they can be crucial. A printout of a flight confirmation will get you on that flight. Even more critically, a printout of your passport will save you in an airport situation when someone steals your backpack. Something that happens all the time. People fall asleep waiting for a flight, then someone takes their bag containing their passport. That same person can have their checked baggage pulled off the plane and their passport printout shown to the staff who can verify the document. There’s a lot of solutions that a piece of paper can provide to even the worst situation. Plugging your devices into the wall can be such a drag when you travel. Even in the tiny radius around Shanghai where I live, I have Hong Kong, Japan and South Korea. All of which sport different sized holes in their damn wall outlets. A universal adapter is all you need. Those giant, clunky things can turn any power cord into the right power cord.
But I never ever have mine on me. Ever. I pack the cords and never pack the adapter. Every damn time. Because of this, I know exactly where to buy universal adapters in more than a dozen airports. What really hurts is how expensive those things are, often in the woods of $50 to $80 a pop. Check with the sales associate of the store that the adapter is for regular plugs such as a laptop cord. I bought one once that after removing from the packaging, revealed to only take USB cords… Also check that it has optional grounding pins, because many countries outlets (cough China) will reject a plug that doesn’t have a grounding pin. (The grounding pin is the one on the bottom). Travel is a ton of fun, and that fun is worth its weight in gold. And believe me, the cost of that gold racks up. It costs a lot to see a new country, costs that hurt when elevated by stupid errors in packing. So the next time you’re packing, visualise yourself in the hotel room on the other side. Imagine yourself plugging in that laptop, does the cord fit into the wall outlet? Imagine yourself at the airport, are you screwed after some scumbag swipes your carry-on? Imagine the weather on the other side. Did you bring any sweaters on your trip to Alaska? But more than absolutely anything else…"

Medium.com,Life,‘The First European Woman to Visit Mecca’,Travel,https://medium.com/interfaith-now/the-first-european-woman-to-visit-mecca-378b098074df?source=topic_page---------672------------------1," ‘If I never see Arabia again, always will live the cherished memory of these wonderful days, of Mecca alight with the torch of a living faith, of Medina and its gardens, its peace, its charm.’ As millions of Muslims from across the world conclude their pilgrimage in Mecca, these words potently capture the spiritual and ethereal charm of Islam’s two holiest cities. But these words do not come from the millions of Muslims of Asia, Africa or the Middle East. They are the words of Lady Evelyn Cobbold, a Scottish-born aristocrat, and a convert to Islam who lived and died between 1868 and 1963. Lady Evelyn was a renowned traveller, of noble heritage, and a prodigious huntswoman. She is the first British woman on record to perform the pilgrimage. It is Lady Evelyn’s unique background that makes her pilgrim’s diary not only an excellent insight into the Hajj pilgrimage, but also an exciting glimpse of Muslim life outside of the migrant experience. Lady Evelyn wrote a diary of her pilgrimage in 1933, publishing it later. For all the novelty of its premise, Lady Evelyn’s Hajj was not unusual from what a pilgrim would typically experience. Broadly, the Hajj pilgrimage consists of the minor pilgrimage (Umrah), to be performed in Mecca, and the five days of Hajj, in which the main rites take place. Lady Evelyn first travelled to Jeddah, the city which serves as a gateway to Mecca and Medina. There, she was guest to the British Arabist St John Philby, himself a unique and notable character. Following this, Lady Evelyn took the opportunity before the commencement of the pilgrimage to visit Medina, the city that Prophet Muhammed migrated to after intense persecution drove him and the early Muslims from Mecca. Thus, Medina is also known as the City of the Prophet. She visited Prophet Muhammed’s mosque, the one that he established when he first arrived in the city. She paid respects to him at his tomb, also situated in the mosque’s complex. After nine days of visiting the plentiful historic sites of Medina, Lady Evelyn travelled back to Jeddah, much to the annoyance of Philby; for all her talent, Philby seemed to be irked by Lady Evelyn’s eccentricity and frugal spending habits. Although visiting the holy city of Medina is not a part of the pilgrimage itself, Muslims almost always visit the city before or after the main pilgrimage out of deference for the Prophet Muhammed. Following this, Lady Evelyn travelled to Mecca to complete the minor pilgrimage (Umrah), which pilgrims must complete before beginning the rites of Hajj. Before beginning this, pilgrims must enter into a state called ihram, in which certain clothing must be worn, and a number of other conditions must be met. She performed Umrah as normal, by first circumambulating the Kabah — the cube building at the center of the mosque complex in Mecca, constructed by Abraham and Ishmael according to the Quran. She then re-enacted Hajar’s running between the hillocks called Safa and Marwa. Abraham’s wife, Hajar, is said to have run back and forth seven times between the hillocks Safa and Marwa in a desperate search for water for her starving baby Ishmael. Mina, the tent city east of Mecca was Lady Evelyn’s next destination and was where she would commence the five days of Hajj alongside other pilgrims. After staying in Mina for a day (day 1), she and the other pilgrims travelled to the plain of Arafat, in time for the Day of Arafat, the apex of the pilgrimage (day 2). In Lady Evelyn’s words ‘this is the culminating scene of the Great Pilgrimage’. Prophet Muhammed said that there is no day on which Allah frees more people from the Fire [Hell] than on the Day of Arafat — thus the day holds great significance in Islam. This sacred location is also where Muhammed delivered his famous farewell sermon towards the end of his life. Lady Evelyn quotes the sermon in full, expressing great respect for it. Lady Evelyn does not write in much detail about Arafat, which is odd given the magnanimity of the day. She fondly recalls reciting the talbiya, a short invocation which translates as ‘Here I am, O God’, but not much more than this. William Facey and Miranda Taylor’s introduction to Lady Evelyn’s diary, suggests it was Lady Evelyn’s low tolerance for the heat that led to great exhaustion. Following Arafat, ordinarily a pilgrim would spend a night sleeping in the plain of Muzdalifah, before commencing the symbolic stoning of the ‘devil’ the following morning. Pilgrims gather stones at Muzdalifah, and pelt three pillars near Mina on the third, fourth and fifth days of Hajj. Lady Evelyn carried out the stoning only once, instead of thrice. The ritual of stoning is symbolic of Abraham stoning the Devil as he attempted to lead Abraham astray. After pelting on the first day, the pilgrims then slaughter a sacrificial animal, again in memory of God providing Abraham with an animal to sacrifice, thereby abolishing the custom of child sacrifice, which Lady Evelyn notes had been customary for the Chaldeans. The following day, Lady Evelyn returned to Mecca. At this point of the pilgrimage, pilgrims can remove the ihram and return to normal clothing. Lady Evelyn then circumambulated the Kabah and completed the running of Hajar once more, which pilgrims do when returning from the initial stoning. She expresses some regret that the Mahmal from Egypt, the carrier of the covering of the Kabah (kiswah), was no longer used; here we see Lady Evelyn’s childhood days spent in Egypt forming an early bond with the cultural side of Hajj. By this point, Lady Evelyn was too exhausted to continue the second and third day of stoning. She was granted special permission to leave early. She performed one last circumambulation, as a farewell gesture to Mecca and her Hajj experience, and left for Jeddah, two days before Hajj would ordinarily be completed. Despite this exhaustion, Lady Evelyn recalls upon her Hajj experience with great fondness; ‘What have the past days held out but endless interest, wonder and beauty? To me an amazing new world has been revealed.’ Perhaps in this quote, we uncover the real significance of Lady Evelyn’s journey. Although she saw herself as being the first European woman to perform the pilgrimage (which is up for discussion according to scholars), perhaps it is her insights into Islam that are more noteworthy than her moniker. Lady Evelyn published her diary in an attempt to counter racist myths about Muslims in the first half of 20th century Britain. Thus, we see various monologues throughout her diary reflecting on Islam. These passages are fascinating because they give an insight into what made such a unique person accept what was seen at the time as a backward and foreign religion. Lady Evelyn saw Western Civilisation as being indebted to previous Muslim civilisations in how they advanced science and intellectual inquiry. She related this directly to passages in the Quran and saw it as a book which engendered intellectual curiosity through spiritual means. Indeed, she was enamoured by the eloquence of the Quran; ‘the simple grandeur of the diction, the variety of imageries, the splendour of the word painting differentiates the Koran [sic] from all other scriptures…’. In other words, Islam was able to resonate with Lady Evelyn. Considering her background and her riches, this speaks of Islam’s ability to resonant with people of vastly different backgrounds. In her admiration of Islam, she was united with the masses of other pilgrims from across the world. In this, then, there is a message of hope. Despite the controversy that surrounds Islam and Muslims in today’s world, there need not be confrontation; Muslims in the West merely have to look upon their forebearers such as Lady Evelyn, and see that Islam, when articulated well, can resonate with people of many different backgrounds."
Medium.com,Life,Riding My Thumb,Travel,https://medium.com/far-and-wide/riding-my-thumb-16ec61d5787c?source=topic_page---------673------------------1," I was in Business Class sipping a complimentary glass of bubbly when I started thinking about how travel used to be for me. It was not always so posh. It was not always comfortable. But lordy, it was free. I admit it. I was a hitchhiker. It was another time. It was a different ethos. It was the 1960s and 70s. I was so broke I couldn’t pay attention. I was so poor I couldn’t afford a pet peeve. But I traveled. It was easy, really. You just wandered out to the highway, stood on the side of the road, and put your thumb in the air. Drivers weren’t petrified of serial killers or escaped convicts yet and they stopped, let you in their vehicle, and smilingly asked, “Where ya goin?” It was a bone fide countercultural experience, sometimes heartwarming, sometimes exciting, sometimes downright scary, sometimes just a little disconcerting. Early on, during a spring break trip to the East Coast, our car broke down in Bordentown, New Jersey. Lila, the woman I was with, made a sign with “Hershey, Pennsylvania” on one side and “Memphis, Tennessee” on the other. The first side got us a ride within minutes to Hershey, where we had to change to another freeway and head west to Memphis. The second ride got us to a truck stop somewhere in the middle of nowhere in far eastern Tennessee. It was getting on to late afternoon. There we were, I of the shoulder length hair, she of the overalls with an American flag sewn on the butt. As you may have guessed, two hippies in rural Tennessee in the early 1970s caught some flak from the locals. Then just when it was getting loud and it was looking bad for the home team, up stepped a trucker with a thick country accent. “Y’all leave these kids alone. They’re good people.” The locals backed off and after a bit of discussion we had a ride with a trucker as far as Jackson, Tennessee. Not all the way to Memphis, but close enough. We climbed in, Lila sat in the passenger seat, I in the sleeper behind the cab. I soon noticed a hard lump under the pad of the bed. Reached under and felt the butt of a pistol. I pulled it out. It was loaded. As you may have guessed, two hippies in rural Tennessee in the early 1970s received a little flak from the locals “Just move it off to the side,” the driver said, eye-balling me from the rearview mirror. “I always carry it. You never know what you’re going to run into on the road.” Indeed. As we drove, he talked about meeting his girlfriend in Jackson that night. He gave us a guided tour of all the roadside attractions. “That truck stop over there, you can get women. Sorry Miss. Over there, you can get the strongest bennies anywhere (aka speed). “When’s the wedding?” he asked out of the blue. Lila and I just looked at each other. A few miles farther, he turned to me and asked, “You ever drive a truck?” Then he changed his mind and kept driving. For the record, I’d never driven a big rig but I was getting ready to give it a shot. A crazy speed freak trucker with a loaded gun He shook his head and reached into a compartment for a vial of pills. “I’ve been driving for four days, and they say I’ve taken as many of these as a body can stand, but I’ve got to do something if I’m getting home tonight.” He shoveled three in his mouth and turned off the interstate onto a two lane blacktop through the mountains. And now it was dark out. A crazy speed-freak trucker with a loaded gun in the middle of nowhere. Where no one would find the bodies of two hitchhikers. By way of explanation he said, “I’m over weight and I have to miss the scales. Can’t afford the fine.” On we drove, winding through the mountains and barreling down the other side. Some time later we re-emerged on the interstate and he pulled off at Jackson, Tennessee, into the parking lot of a cheap motel. He shoved a wad of cash at us. “It’s late and you’ll never get a ride tonight. Go stay at the motel and get started again tomorrow morning. Right now I have to get over to Mary’s house before she goes to sleep.” We got out. He drove off. Just when you think people are crazy, they turn out to the most generous people. Got to Memphis without incident the next day, before noon. Total busts that turned into a thing of beauty? I take you to a truck stop in Southern Ohio on I-70, about 10 PM. I was trying to decide if I should find a spot on the side of the road or under an overpass for the night when a beast of an Oldsmobile Delta 88 rolled to a stop. The driver looked like someone who just stepped out of a scene in “Deliverence”. Flannel shirt, hat with flaps, beard. He didn’t look like someone I really wanted to ride with, but it was late. I was desperate. He didn’t look like someone I really wanted to ride with, but it was late. I was desperate. I got in. A thick cloud of marijuana smoke rolled out of the car as I opened the door. Three layers of big fat joints were poised on the rim of the ashtray. He pulled one out and lit it. He grinned. “I live in West Virginia. I try to blend in.” Off we went down I-70. I repeatedly asked the guy where he was going, but every time I thought he was going to tell me he just said something like, “Oh I’m going way down the road. Don’t worry.” We just kept driving and smoking into the wee hours. About 1:00 in the morning we the spied lights of a town. “Oh my God. I’m in Wheeling already. This is where I get off!” With that he swerved and took the first exit. He deposited me somewhere in the middle of downtown Wheeling, West Virginia. I stood there for thirty minutes, high and disoriented, when a white van pulled over. The driver was a guy in a rock band who was heading home, to Pennsylvania, after a gig at a local bar. The night rolled on. On the far side of the river and up a small mountain, my ride pulled to a stop. “Just climb up that embankment that overlooks the highway. It’ll be quiet and safe up there.” “I get off here. I’d take you home and let you sleep on the couch but my wife frowns on that. Just climb up that embankment that overlooks the highway. It’ll be quiet and safe up there.” I got out. He drove off. I crawled up an incredibly big embankment to a clearing at the top of a big hill, or maybe a small mountain. There were patches of snow on the ground. I rolled out the sleeping bag, took off my boots, and crawled in. My nose was cold, but the bag was warm and cozy. Off to dreamland I went. Sat up in my sleeping bag and looked out on one of the most glorious sights of my young life. When I awoke the sun was just peeking over the mountains. Sat up in my sleeping bag and looked out on one of the most glorious sights of my young life. I was looking down a long grade from a mountain to a picturesque little Pennsylvania mountain town with a river running through it. But there was no room service in this inn, so I put my boots on, rolled up the sleeping bag, and headed back to the highway in search of a ride to D.C. and maybe a cup of coffee along the way. In retrospect, hitchhiking was sometimes a snooze, sometimes exciting, sometimes a slog, sometimes a roller coaster, but always an adventure. I’m glad I did it, but all in all, I’ll take that seat in Business Class with the complimentary champagne. Now I like a little more comfort, and always a cup of coffee in the morning."
Medium.com,Life,How Augmented Reality (AR) is changing the Travel & Tourism Industry,Travel,https://towardsdatascience.com/how-augmented-reality-ar-is-changing-the-travel-tourism-industry-239931f3120c?source=topic_page---------674------------------1," According to a Statista report, the Augmented Reality AR market across the globe is predicted to nurture from 5.91 billion to 198 billion U.S. dollars by the year 2025. Augmented Reality trends has materialized as a constructive tool for different businesses. It allows them to transform the way customers observe their surroundings. This innovation in technology has been predominantly beneficial for those working in travel-based industries. Augmented Reality, or AR, offers an excellent selling experience and augmented environments, which can be enhanced in diverse ways in the tourism sector. In this blog post, you will get a better look at the impact of AR in the travel industry. With the power of enthralling human minds, AR is altering the game for marketers, and we will explore how Augmented Reality solutions can help travel sector. The technology is breaching innovative doors for the travel industry to improve their customer experience. However, the travel and tourism domain has already shown significant transitions with Augmented Reality. Travel and tourism business is a highly researched segment. The customers in the travel industry always plan their journey, stay, or food places to explore through extensive research. The pursuit for data and information does not come to a standstill for a customer even after his arrival at their targeted travel destination. Furthermore, all these information are explored in a range of mobile devices. Here is where AR enters in making transformations for the travel industry. AR has the capability to add to the search experiences by offering interactive ad engaging information. With pioneering mobile apps, these augmented experiences can be made extensive to the travellers by simplifying their travel search and building up reliance. Even, travel specialists have estimated that by accepting the power of AR can establish different user experiences which can turn to be a boon for the tourism domain and travel industry. Augmented Reality and tourism are fashioned for each other. What is the key activity of a tourist? Traveling and gripping every portion of the information they can be found related to a destination. When you tour to a city, such as Rome or Venice, which are full of attractions, you can simply miss a fascinating place. An Augmented Reality mobile application can hand round as a real-life tour guide. Augmented Reality apps for the travel domain can enable travellers to explore more about destinations through the camera viewfinder functionality. As the camera catches the landscape in the region, the mobile application marks places of significance and provides added information about it. These days the guests know where they desire to travel. People have a sense of destinations that will take them precisely where they want to travel using their smartphones. However, AR can effectively enhance people’s travel experience with interactive maps, making them more fitting. Travellers are obliged when they get to use an engaging, easy to use and helpful ways for navigation. Following are the applications of Augmented Reality in the travel and hospitality sector. The travel industry is all about generating exclusive experiences, and AR has the prospective to back this business sector. The technology can support tourism with new styles of customer servicing. It is assumed that in the coming time, Augmented Reality will drastically change the business models of the tourism sector. Here is a current list of how Augmented Reality is delivering values for both end customers and the tourism business. It is both difficult and appealing to travel to a foreign destination without having a translator to guide you. However, with AR technology, smartphones can be utilized to translate foreign languages for different types of users. Discovering your way in a foreign town can be challenging. However, AR turns navigation apps smarter by adding digital components like arrows and other applicable details. By integrating and combining smartphone cameras to Google Maps, AR can improve travel experiences of navigating a new place. Travels can turn chaotic with lack of correct and well-timed information. With AR, travel brands are enlarging mobile applications for tourists, to improve their travel experiences. The hospitality sector is amongst one of the foremost fields to utilize AR technologies. You may speculate in which way hotels can use AR and be amazed by the variety of options. By using AR, you can build all-around room tours with lodging details and prices when exploring a hotel. It is a good way to market and advertise your hotel for engaging targeted guests to explore a comprehensive scale of hotel services. This turns one-time guests into loyal guests. Suppose you are in your hotel room and require searching out about housekeeping, destinations to see, distances to places and other travel services. So you can immediately get your smartphone or tablet, unlock the hotel mobile app, point to a marker, and access the needed information. Effortless and full of ease, that’s actually Augmented Reality for the travel industry. For instance, some of the hotels have an interactive wall map in the rooms, that guests can point their mobile phone to explore the local travel attractions in the nearby areas. Today’s tourists won’t pay consideration to straightforward pamphlets. AR makes it possible to find out information on a novel level by having 3D animations from printed brochures. Hotels collaborate with content based companies and marketing agencies to create and publish AR based advertisements in magazines. Further, hotel mobile app users can also scan the ads to open a presentation video. Pokemon Go has stimulated many other businesses to use AR, including the travel and hospitality industry. Augmented Reality apps assist in envisioning how such Gamification can persuade and interest people to stay in a picky hotel, especially the youngest ones. Check-out how some of the hotels provide its guests with a mobile app, which showcases every corner of their hotel with supplementary AR objects. Keeping it concise, restaurants and bars can utilize AR solutions for their advantage in quite a few ways. Restaurants can have menus with an engaging and interactive 360-view of every food dish and its ingredients through AR application. AR games at several restaurants use Pokémon Go to attract clients with the assistance of mobile apps using AR to offer details about restaurants, cafes, and nearby bars. Visualize your plane has just landed, or you step out of a bus, train or a car in an unknown place, and you are unsure where to go from there. However, in that scenario, if you have a travel mobile app with AR, you can point out at the transportation objects to get best possible directions, travel route, next destination and places to travel. For foreign travellers, in particular, this could be fairly pleasurable while their tours and trips. With AR you can turn a metro map into an engaging guide in numerous languages. Discovering tourist destinations and excursions with Augmented Reality transforms those traditional city tours in a bit more amazing. We can travel back in time, bearing in mind the advancement of landmarks in time outlook, get pleasure from 3D models of places, and get fun tour guides. Best instances are theme parks, gardens, and zoos. As per Walt Disney CEO Bob Iger, they choose AR to VR headsets. According to him, Augmented Reality is additionally sociable, interactive, and concerned. AR in parks or zoos enables better Gamification, navigation, awareness, and interesting quiz. AR in museums enables travellers to view a complete live representation of vanished animals based on their structural skeletons. Traveling is always an innovative and learning experience. With modernized devices and tools, Augmented Reality in travel and tourism comes exceedingly useful for hotel tours, booking enabling information, no language barriers, as well as superior navigation. Augmented Reality is already pleasing to the eye by boosting travel experiences with inventive mobile apps. Mrudul Shah is a CTO of Technostacks Infotech which is a mobile app development company in India & USA. He is helping his entire development team and global clients to access new technologies, interests in learning and sharing IT technology news trends."
Medium.com,Life,Tips on Travelling alone for the First Time,Travel,https://medium.com/@amytrumpeter/tips-on-travelling-alone-for-the-first-time-8104004151a4?source=topic_page---------675------------------1," I get so many people asking me about travelling alone for the first time, that I thought it was about time to write a blog on it. Yes, solo travel can be the epitome of freedom. There are also challenges, and despite being a major solo travel advocate, I can understand why people can be apprehensive to take the plunge. But trust me, once you have travelled alone for the first time, you will do it again, and again and again! I personally didn’t travel completely solo until I was in my 30’s. Up to that point, there was always a relative, friend or boyfriend tagging along. I don’t think I was actually too scared of travelling alone, it’s just that someone always gatecrashed my party! By my late 20s I’d moved to London and frequently hopped across the channel on the Eurostar to friends in France and Belgium. But I didn’t quite see that as solo travel as it was quite close to home and often friends were meeting me the other end. So I moved up the solo travel scale incrementally, I would say! It wasn’t until my early 30s when I refused to see the year go by without seeing the Blue Mosque in Istanbul that I just booked it and said sod it, I’m doing this. This was the first time I truly felt the incredible freedom and satisfaction of going solo. I was like ‘I’m doing this for me, and no-one else!’ Me with Camels in Morocco! It’s easy for me to say ‘just go for it!’ as I’ve been travelling by myself for many years now. But. looking back, I remember being in my early twenties and hearing from a colleague who was taking a year out of teaching to travel the world solo. Wow, they’re brave, I thought to myself. Nowadays, I’m doing it all of the time! And it drives me mad when I hear people say that about me! But the point is, I remember being the person who saw solo travel as the majestic ideal that was somewhat out of reach, although I couldn’t put my finger on why that was. Sometimes, it’s just about biting the bullet and dipping your toe in the water for the first time. So many things can go through your mind before you travel alone for the first time. What if I lose all my bags and my money? What if I get into a sticky situation? What if I get bored/lonely/don’t know where to go. Yes, it’s true that any of those things could happen. But it’s more likely that they won’t as long as you have your wits about you and take a few precautions. In today’s blog, I’m going to outline the benefits of solo travel and then offer you some tips on preparation for travelling alone for the first time. I’m not here to make solo travel out to be all peachy. Let me tell you now that there are a few times I’ve been in a pickle. Robbed in Venice, throwing up in Belgrade, maniac driver in Tunisia and a UTI in Bangkok. Yep, all these things have happened to me! But I would always argue that the benefits of solo travel far outweigh the problems that you could experience on the road. Here are some of the benefits of travelling alone… So you’ve decided not to let anyone gatecrash your next trip. You’ve picked your destination and booked your flight. What tips do you need for travelling alone for the first time? It’s easy to think of so many things that you might need for your first time solo travel. But what I’ve found is that you actually need less than you think! Got your passport money and phone/laptop? Packed a few pairs of undies and a couple of changes of clothes? Your good to go! If you couldn’t carry your bag up a mountain for a couple of hours, it’s too heavy! What I’ve found is that almost everywhere you go you can buy something that you need — even in the Sahara Desert! It’s a good idea to have someone back home to check in with. Give them a rough itinerary and agree how often you will drop them an email or call to check in. If you really want to go to town with this, there are apps that can help you to track your journey such as Polarsteps. This is as much for your loved ones back home as it is for your safety. You can book your accommodation in advance through hotels.com and booking.com. Also book your taxis in advance if you are travelling somewhere that you can use Uber or Grab (Asian version of Uber). By pre-booking you are limiting the damage that can be done by the dodgy hotel and taxi touts who are essentially preying on people like you to con you out of your hard earned cash! It also means that you have a log of the mode of transport or where you are staying. Me at Wat Arun, Bangkok If you are especially cautious about travelling solo then start small and build it up. For example, if you are living in the UK, maybe do a solo weekend in the next city. Then try a week in Europe. Then go for your month in Asia! By building your confidence bit by bit, before you know it you are on a month long trip to Cambodia, and you didn’t even notice that you were rocking it as a solo traveller! I hear so many eager new solo travellers who are so excited to share their itinerary of 5 European cities in 5 days or their four weeks in Asia covering Thailand, Cambodia, Laos and Vietnam. Wow, I feel exhausted by just listening to this! Slow it right down to a pace that you can enjoy (I’m a big advocate of slow travel). Take time to absorb the local food and culture. Also, take rest time and time to look after your health. Solo travel is great when you are a seasoned traveller and know what you are doing. But if you are less experienced or a first timer, it makes sense to go travelling somewhere that you will feel confident and be well looked after in an emergency situation. For example, you might want to pick a very safe destination such as Iceland, or another English speaking country such as Australia. If you are looking for ideas, check out this article on top solo female travel destinations. If you are thinking about travelling alone for the first time, you might also find these resources helpful… As soon as you have taken the plunge and travelled for alone for the first time, let me know!

was the summer of me. Not in the way you’d think. Not as in the self-destructive season of debauchery and hedonism. Rather it was a specific time to focus on and be with me for a while. It was the vernal equinox but it felt more like a lunar eclipse. Everything had shifted and was brighter and there was no turning back. Summers are my time. Always have been. I teach all year and make sure to safety pin my blouses so as to be appropriate. I wear clogs and comfortable shoes and sprinkle my leggings and t-shirts with the occasional sundress, but save the good ones for my summer respite. It’s the one season I feel like a lady — prancing around in dresses almost every day, accentuating my generous hips and curves but still tasteful. Reserved."
Medium.com,Life,An unforgettable road trip through Colombia,Travel,https://medium.com/@stella_brooks/an-unforgettable-road-trip-through-colombia-11353a8e3eb6?source=topic_page---------678------------------1," As the old saying goes, “It’s not what you know but who you know” rang true for me as I was sitting on a hostel couch in Cali considering what my next move was. I was overwhelmed with all the things I could do in Colombia but was not ready to leave Cali when the hostel owner (Gabe) asked me if I wanted to go on a road trip up to the Northern Caribbean Coast with his 5-year-old daughter. We met a couple of days earlier and had hit off the beginnings of a new friendship. I am not sure what it was that ignited our friendship, but I am going to put it down to us both being from Australia with very similar humour. I knew I wanted to stay in one place in Colombia for a while, to immerse myself into the culture, practice my Spanish and possibly continue my study of Salsa. A 2.5-week road trip was the perfect way to have a sneak peek at all the places on my list of “possible home away from homes”. I could then choose my favourite and completely avoid the FOMO feeling of missing a great town. I had really hit the jackpot here! Needless to say, I saw and learnt so much about Colombia on this road trip — I learnt about the culture, the people, the landscape, the places I like, and the places I didn’t — all through the things I saw and the stories Gabe told me. Gabe has been living in Colombia for 9 years (in both Santa Marta and Cali). He was reminiscing a lot on the drive up and I was privileged to hear his stories about his transition into the Colombian Culture — a journey I am currently on.

Medium.com,Life,Goat Bog,Travel,https://medium.com/swlh/goat-bog-48517d93c126?source=topic_page---------679------------------1," You think you know your neighbourhood — until all of a sudden you realise you don’t. Spaces and places in our lives can quickly become overly familiar, and when this happens, we lose something in the process. Curiosity. Adventure. Child-like wonder. Recently, while out on my usual morning walk, I came across a map of the area on an information stand. Glancing at it, I noticed a huge patch of green, just across from where I was standing. “Bog Meadows Nature Reserve.” That’s odd. We live in a built-up area close to Belfast City Centre, right beside the motorway and far away from nature… So I thought. A few days later, I set out to explore — and boy am I glad I did. Bullrushes, trees, wildflowers, thorns, nettles, long grass, rabbits, ducks, ponds, bogs and even goats (weird right?). My morning walk is the most important part of the day. I do it straight away. As soon as my alarm goes off and I wiggle into some shoes, I’m out the door, putting one foot in front of the other. This simple habit adds so much to my life. It helps me prepare for the day; it blows away the sleepy cobwebs from my brain and gets my body moving. I’m outdoors, I’m unplugged, and I am happy. “Goat Bog” (as it will affectionately be referred to from now on) has made my day-to-day life better. It’s something I look forward to every morning. It’s a place of rest, a deep well I can go and drink from (though definitely not literally, bog water is nasty), and a way for me to add some much-needed input into my life. I have a niggling feeling that there’s a Goat Bog in every neighbourhood — even yours — you just gotta find it. Well, part of the adventure is stumbling across it yourself. But there are some things we can do to make stumbling across it more likely. Be curious. Walk home a different way. Sit on the other side of the bus. Try a commute without headphones. Study (Google) Maps. Tune into an ultra-local niche podcast. Read local history. Search the hashtags. Cycle through your neighbourhood (you’d be surprised how many different things you can pick up on from a different vantage point). The reality is, we all need a place to dock, anchor ourselves and recharge. (Much like the phones we should probably leave behind on our adventures every now and then). Discovering a place locally that’s close to home and one you can ideally walk to could be a small thing that has a big impact on your daily life. So keep an eye out. Who knows what you’ll find? A park? A cafe? An abandoned warehouse? A bookshop? A Goat Bog? I’m not sure, but I do know it’s worth a try. Good luck. — Matt"
Medium.com,Life,How to cross a river:,Travel,https://medium.com/usfws/how-to-cross-a-river-6c4609a4d531?source=topic_page---------680------------------1," Alaska’s rivers are no joke. Beautiful, yes. Forgiving, no. If you’re planning to fish, hunt, or otherwise traverse Alaska’s lands and waters, there’s a good chance you’ll find yourself on a riverbank. You may be tempted to rush. Don’t. Take time to walk up and downstream. Locate the hazards. Standing waves can signal swift water and boulders or logs. Listen for submerged rocks rolling downstream. The bigger they are, the stronger the current. Never cross above rapids, falls or other hazards. Identify a safe exit point(s) on the other side before committing. The current will likely push you downstream as you cross. Plan accordingly. The safest places to cross tend to be straight sections between river bends, wider areas of the channel, or braids (multiple channels separated by temporary islands/bars). The swifter the current, the shallower it needs to be to safely cross. To test swiftness, throw a stick in and track how fast it travels downstream. Faster than you can walk? Probably unsafe to cross. To test depth, toss a rock in and listen for a hollow “ka-thump” (deep) or probe with a stick. Always thoroughly consider your skill and comfort level. If the crossing exceeds either, abort. Before you go, get familiar with the river’s pattern of high and low flows, both seasonally and daily. When’s the rainy season? When does snow-pack melt at higher elevations? Is there rain in the forecast? Has it been especially hot and sunny in areas with glacially-fed streams? Is there a dam upstream that releases water at certain times of day? Is there a tidal influence downstream? The flow can rise quickly within a few hours on warm sunny days or after heavy rains, making a once-passable stream dangerously impassable. The U.S. Geological Survey’s National Water Information System is a great place to begin your assessment. Unbuckle your pack in case you have to ditch it. A secured pack can weigh you down and drag you under. While you’ll probably want to keep your boots on for traction, keep the rest of yourself as dry as possible. Consider removing your socks and pants. Keep them on top of your pack, or in a dry, sealed bag. If you’re wearing waders, be sure your belt is snug. If you have a personal flotation device (life jacket) make sure you’re 1) wearing it and 2) wearing it properly. Face upstream, with the water flowing towards you. Lean forward slightly, keeping your feet shoulder width apart. Bend your knees to lower your center of gravity, especially if you have a pack on."

Through the sea of traffic and honking horns, my mom spotted a taxi pull over across the street. We carefully made our way through the busy intersection and got in. I’d just started to buckle my sister’s seatbelt when my mom leaned over and whispered “Not here.” I’d find out later that wearing your seatbelt was a dead giveaway that you were a tourist (and you definitely didn’t want that). My mom turned back to the driver and let him know we were headed to Abovyan, a small town just north of the bustling capital of Yerevan, Armenia. As the city faded into the background and the road turned from concrete to dirt, we found ourselves in a place entirely different from where we’d been staying in Yerevan. Rather than tall apartment buildings clustered like sardines, there were old homes surrounded by trees and overgrown grass. The streets were empty apart from the occasional child playing outside. We were driving up a narrow winding road for a while when the taxi suddenly came to a stop in front of a set of old stone stairs carved into a small hill. “We’re here,” said the driver. My mom quickly paid for the ride and the three of us climbed the stairs to the front door of the house we’d arrived at and knocked. The door immediately flew open and we were showered with hugs, kisses, and kind words of welcome from several overjoyed family members — extended family members I was meeting for the first time. The moment I stepped inside the house, my nostrils filled with the familiar scent of freshly baked xachapuri, an Armenian puff pastry stuffed with feta cheese. I felt my stomach rumble and realized how hungry I’d managed to get on the ride over. The room we’d stepped into was empty apart from a couch, a coffee table, and a few folding chairs, but the walls were covered in beautiful, ornate carpets. We were quickly led into the kitchen, where we received another round of hugs and kisses from several more family members in flour-covered aprons. The kitchen counters were hidden beneath an array of colorful ingredients in all stages of preparation. One woman stood at the sink peeling potatoes, while another chopped parsley at the counter. I offered to help, but was waved out of the kitchen in true Armenian fashion; a guest never cooks. Out in the living room, I plopped down on the couch and traced its fabric with my fingertips, thinking about the several generations of family members who might have sat in that very spot. When I looked up, a girl who seemed about nine years old was standing in front of me. “Hi, I’m Anna. Can I give you a tour of our house?” she quietly asked. “Of course!” I replied, and off we went, with Anna excitedly explaining what went where and which family members slept in which rooms, while I followed, struggling to keep up with both her pace and her storytelling. Toward the end of her tour, Anna led me out to the backyard where there were rows and rows of beautiful fruit trees––some with fruits I’d never even seen before. Anna jumped up on a ladder, plucked an apricot from a tree, then handed it to me “Eat it, they taste best this time of year,” she said. I took one bite and the fruit’s sweet juice filled my mouth. I knew in that moment no other apricot would ever measure up. Then, Anna was zooming off to our next destination, a huge shed at the edge of the backyard. When she opened the door, a chicken came hobbling out. Then five bunnies. I slowly inched closer and picked one up––we were instantly friends, the bunny and me. Anna and I fed the chickens, then chased them and the bunnies back into the shed. Just as we were making our way back in from the backyard, Anna’s dad came outside and shouted that dinner would be ready soon. Back at the house, a large balcony enveloped in a sea of green trees was being prepped for dinner. I settled in on a long bench on one side of the table and looked out at the view. I could hear birds chirping in the distance and the subtle rustle of leaves. It was paradise. I was so mesmerized by the view that I’d practically missed all the food laid out on the table. There were salads, pickled vegetables, deli meats, an assortment of cheeses, and freshly made bread. My mouth started to water as I scanned the table, but quickly remembered my manners and got up to go ask if I could help with anything. Once again, I was turned away from the kitchen and told to relax outside. The dishes piled high with traditional Armenian recipes continued to fill up the table. Then finally, we’d all sat down and started sampling some of the food when Anna’s father came out to the balcony with a giant plate of barbecued chicken. When everyone’s glass was full of wine, he gave a long heartfelt toast about the beauty of life, how lucky we were to have such delicious food in our midst, and how happy he was to see our family all dining at one table together. The adults clinked their wine glasses and Anna’s dad began cutting meat and serving it to everyone at the table. As he put a piece on my plate, he gave me a quick wink and said, “You’re going to love it.” I finished up my bite of salad and put a piece of chicken in my mouth. I let it sit there for a moment, noticing that it tasted pretty different from the chicken back home. I turned to my mom and quietly asked, “Does the chicken taste different to you?” My mom let out a small laugh and said “It’s not chicken, it’s rabbit.” I stopped chewing and slowly raised a napkin to my mouth. I stared in horror at the people at the table and then at the giant piece of meat sitting on my plate. My mom saw my hesitation and quietly let me know that rabbit was a dish only served for special guests. My heart dropped. I felt terrible and committed myself to trying again, but I couldn’t get the image of my new bunny friend out of my mind. I covertly put the leftover meat on my mom’s plate, hoping that the family knew how much I truly did appreciate the gesture. The rest of the meal was a whirlwind of layered salads, roasted vegetables, and delicious dips, followed up by an array of sweet and sour fruits, pastries, and espresso for dessert. With our bellies full of amazing food, we talked about life, death, and everything in between. The family shared hilarious stories about kids in the neighborhood, but also let us in on the struggles they’d faced over the years. They loved Armenia, it was their home, but they longed for a different life. I looked around at this huge family all living under one roof. Their clothes were worn and their faces were tired, but in that moment, they were truly happy. While saying our goodbyes, I noticed Anna hiding behind her dad’s pant leg, puppy dog eyes in full swing. I went over and gave her a great big hug and told her to give the bunnies extra kisses for me. She nodded and whispered, “It’s okay that you didn’t eat the meat, I don’t really like to either.” I gave her a big smile and a wink and made my way outside. As the sun set behind the trees, I wondered what my life would have been like had my family not had the chance to move to the U.S., and felt my heart fill with gratitude for all the sacrifices that led to my life’s opportunities. I was pulled from my thoughts by the sound of honking and my mom calling my name. I ran down to the taxi and took my seat — making sure to leave my seatbelt unbuckled — rolled down my window, and let the summer breeze kiss my smiling face all the way home."
Medium.com,Life,Travel Full-Time for the Kids,Travel,https://medium.com/@williamjteskey/travel-full-time-for-the-kids-8023e69fe718?source=topic_page---------683------------------1," Travel had benefits for all of us. Particularly for our children. My wife, Rachel and I have begun the exciting journey of raising our mixed-race twin sons together. We were avid travellers prior to becoming pregnant and have decided not to let that slow us down because the benefits slow travel hav given us should be extended to our children. Rachel and I come from different cultural backgrounds. I’m Canadian with English-Irish roots raised in small-city Ontario. She is Chinese from a city of 7 million. We speak different languages as our mother tongues and each other’s language as our second. We often see the world differently as informed by our respective cultural upbringing. That’s beautiful! Our marriage is a tapestry. Cultural differences do not necessarily need to cause problems. I’ve heard a lot said about the idea of ‘compromise’ as a way of one party giving up some thing or another in order to appease the other and vice-versa. This solution makes it seem as if one side needs to give up part of their identity in order to conform to their other, but that is a negative way to look at mixed-culture relationships. They are an opportunity! Rachel and I have found strength in embracing our cultural differences, recognizing why we do the things we do and ultimately picking and choosing what we like from each culture and creating something new. It’s like when peanut butter met jelly. We did this for our wedding celebration and have done this throughout our eight years of marriage (at the time of writing). The result has been a shared cultural identity that is uniquely our own. We are Canadian and we are Chinese; at the same time we are both and neither. We plan to apply this philosophy to our parenting as well. Our twin baby boys are mixed-race and mixed-cultured and equal importance will be place on both sides of their heritage while maintaining a truly international worldview. We plan to raise them as true world citizens. This is easier said than done. It is realistic to expect our sons to disproportionately identify with the culture of the country we are living in, so it will take a concerted effort by mommy and I to share both of our cultures with them. We plan to focus on a few areas to strengthen their cultural connections: language, exposure to different cultures, exposure to people from those cultures, and cultural holidays. We will achieve this by continuing to travel slowly. According to our travel slowly life philosophy, we plan to live in different cities and countries for years at a time in order to fully immerse ourselves and our twin sons in the local culture. Rachel and I have been living this life for the entirety of our marriage. In eight years of marriage we have lived in Changchun and Suzhou, China Calgary, Toronto and Quebec, Canada. Five cities in eight years that we have lived in for at least one year at a time. The shortest stay was Suzhou for one year and the longest as married couple was Toronto for three years. Language is a keystone of culture, giving insight into how people think. Rachel’s native language is Mandarin Chinese and she speaks English fluently. I speak English natively and Mandarin fluently. We both grew up monolingual and learned our second language as adults. Both of us found that a second language opens up parts of the world in ways that we never really knew existed. Rachel and I both have the ability to speak with 2.5 billion people. Economically, an additional language opens up opportunities that were otherwise inaccessible. We want our children to grow up with those advantages and opportunities. We lived in Toronto when we became pregnant. We moved to French-speaking Quebec City, Canada for most of the pregnancy and first year of our twin sons lives. Many of their toys are in French and most of our interactions outside of the home are in French. We borrow library books in French to read to them, but their favourite book – Superchimp – is in English. They will be just 13 months old when we leave Québec so it’s unlikely that they will retain any French at this stage but we plan to teach it in the home and return to a French speaking location later in life. I believe thi has laid a foundation for greater learning. I’ll be Publishing the Québec edition of travel slowly for the kids in the coming weeks. At home Rachel primarily speaks Mandarin to our children, but sometimes English. I speak primarily English to our children, but sometimes Mandarin. Rachel and I mix and match when we speak together around the children as we always have. That is just what we are used to. Yuehua, our sons’ maternal grandmother has been staying with us since the beginning and only speaks Mandarin. She spends a lot of time with our twins so we think that many of their first words will be Mandarin. They call me Baba 爸爸 and Rachel Mama 妈妈 in Mandarin. These were their first words. Once we move to China in a few weeks Rachel and I will speak mostly English at home because the boys will have exposure to Mandarin naturally through social interactions with family and friends. As part of our travel slowly philosophy, our children will enrol in the local school system wherever we are in order to learn the local language natively, absorbing it like a sponge. We will frequently visit local cultural sites, museums, galleries, and local happening spots to give our twin boys a rounded experience in each location. We will take short mini trips to nearby locations, cities and countries to give our boys even more travel experience. You can’t really know a place without knowing it’s people. Our twins will interact with local children of their age wherever we travel slowly. We will find local friends and model healthy adult relationships with people wherever we go. Our kids will also be exposed to my businesses as they get a little older including any employees that we have locally. They will be enrolled in local cultural classes with local teachers as they get older. Not much we can study at one year old, but we are thinking ahead and preparing for it. I’m preparing to launch an early-education language school when we arrive in China, so they will have exposure to local children. Holidays are a glimpse into a peoples’ soul. They demonstrate what the people hold dear and important. Like Thanksgiving and Christmas in North America, they will experience Spring Festival (Chinese New Year), Chinese National Day and other holidays such as Dragon Boat Festival and Tomb Sweeping Day. When we move onto other countries, we will be similarly immersed. The thought of raising my twin boys to be true world citizens inspires me and motivates me to work hard toward my goals that an facilitate this lifestyle. Read more about how actionable SMART goals have helped make this a reality while I work toward my best life as I’ve designed it. I’m actively working towards our big-picture goals of financial and location independence to make this happen. This means hard work today for greater rewards tomorrow. Travelling slowly is how we will give our sons a deep connection to our multicultural world starting with their multicultural roots. They will learn languages through immersion in local culture, education system and engagement with local people. Celebrating local holidays will give them cherished memories and a warm connection to each culture we experience as a family. My sons deserve the world and I will give it to them."
Medium.com,Life,Chasing Saints in Norway,Travel,https://medium.com/@CindersThereAre/chasing-saints-in-norway-aaf3a33ad509?source=topic_page---------684------------------1," M
ichel de Certeau notes in The Writing of History that hagiographies, the written accounts of the lives of saints, are the inverse of secular biographies. Whereas the latter are linear narratives from birth to death, the life of a saint is a “composition of places” (1988: 281). It is in this sense that hagiographies often read more like travel literature than a conventional chronicle, more like an itinerary of coming and going lacking any false confidence cultivated through retrospection — as if the causes of life’s happenstances were all already determined in advance. Thus, the hagiography attempts to capture something very different than teleology: from aimless ascesis in the wilderness to the chance self-discovery to the miracle work back home; from the trial in the desert to the revelation of God to the epiphany among the Gentiles. Unlike travel literature, there is never in the life of the saint much description of what is actually visited, of that sacred place (the mountaintop, the monastery, the tomb) which orients his entire life. Instead, in this oscillation of contrary movements of coming and going, perfectly exterior to one another, therein the reader discovers the singularity of an inside. In their contradiction, that is, there emerges the non-place of spirit. It is thus precisely in the movement of the text, when the place traveled is made relative through its composition with many places — this is when the reader, running his finger across the page to chase the saint, bears witness to grace."
Medium.com,Life,The Essence of Traveling,Travel,https://medium.com/@meilian881/the-essence-of-traveling-4abb1163e313?source=topic_page---------685------------------1," Traveling is important but just traveling is not enough. The idea is not to just hop on a plane and discover other countries as if you were reading a book. Trying to visit every corner of a country is great, but the intention behind it should not just be focused on checking all the boxes to then tell the world that you saw A, B, and C. I see traveling more like a beautiful humanizing experience. We grow up in a bubble with people who look more or less like us, think the same way we do and believe in similar things. We then become hungry to burst the bubble and rebel against the status-quo thinking that the garden next doors or overseas is better. And so, we cross rivers, seas, and lands to land on an unknown exciting territory. We have no familiarity with it and so, overwhelmed with excitement, we start discovering. Because we don’t have previous pictures from that world and because we feel more like outsiders watching from a screen, we seem to always feel positively impressed by the new garden we are exploring: New smells, colors, shapes, tastes, and new feelings. Most people who travel go through this experience and shortly go home enchanted by the lights of Paris or the skyscrapers of New York. They go home impressed and hoping to go back and live there because life there is definitely better than back home. People on the other garden seem to have figured a lot of the solutions that don’t exist on our land. In their speech, this type of travelers falls in the comparison trap and solely speak of how much their lives would be better if it looked like the one in the garden next doors. And from this type of traveling, I warn you, as it gets you inside another even worse bubble then the first one. This second bubble only and solely exists in your mind as it is simply inspired by a part of reality. This, I would say is the characteristic of a one or two-week trip that is solely filled with sightseeing trips and touristy activities. Then you have the other type of traveling which happens on a longer basis, the one that most international students or immigrants go through. They too leave their original garden seeking a better reality and more comfortable life. And so they hop on a plane and reach their destination. In the beginning, they are living the dream and they are fascinated by the new life and its decoration. They start adopting the new garden’s way of life and beautifully sink into the painting. Soon enough they get bored, discover the flaws of the new garden and they miss the old colors, and so they hop onto a mental plane searching for the familiar in the new garden. A little later they get the chance to go back to the homeland and they are so happy! Finally, they are getting back all those memories ( it is important to note that they only remember the good ones.) They have the time of their lives until one day, they get used to being back. They start to see the flaws because of which they left the original garden but this time it is a thousand times worse. And so they can’t wait to go back to the new garden. And they return … searching for ways to make that longing for the familiar less arduous. They start finding communities of expats from their homeland, listen to nostalgic music, cooking food from home, and even marrying a partner who comes or is somehow linked to the motherland. And here my friend two types of decisions are made: whether to get used to this mental discomfort in order to enjoy the physical comfort or the other way around … and make your way home. In both scenarios, you will be haunted mentally whether by the longing and lack of sense of belonging or by regretting not staying in the dreamland. Most people’s traveling journey stops here … What I urge you, reader and traveler, to do is to use traveling to humanize people, to discover the essence of humanity, to the extent that wherever you go you will feel at home and you will meet people with whom you will feel familiar no matter how different they are physically or ideologically. As this type of traveling is a pilgrimage outside and inside of your soul. This type of traveling will help you see the beauty everywhere you go including the garden you initially fled … and so no matter where life will take you, you will feel fulfilled, loved and at peace. How to reach that type of traveling? There are so many examples of world travelers, read about them, but don’t copy them because you are a unique traveler who may have similar questions to which you won’t find novel answers. Yet, the answer here does not matter. The process of getting it is of the utmost importance as it is the one responsible for the change that will happen inside of you."
Medium.com,Life,"Backpacking Iceberg Lake Valley in Wrangell-St. Elias, Alaska",Travel,https://medium.com/@msavener/backpacking-iceberg-lake-valley-in-wrangell-st-elias-alaska-6a9fbc333967?source=topic_page---------686------------------1," Every summer, I embark on a backpacking journey with a couple of friends from college. We started doing an annual trip over a decade ago, and this year marked our 10th trip. We’ve visited some of the crown jewels of American wilderness: Yellowstone, Yosemite, Glacier, Colorado 14ers, the High Sierra. For the past few years, we’ve been tossing around the idea of going bigger, with repeated mentions of Alaska. This year, the 49th State fit the bill. But Alaska is massive—and intimidating. Where to go and how to do it right? The first thing that comes to mind is the legendary Denali. I don’t mean to disparage it in any way, but it was out for this trip — too many people, too hard to get good permits. Turning my attention elsewhere, I found Wrangell-St. Elias National Park. Most of the people I talked to before this trip had never heard of it, nor had I. That’s unfortunate, since it’s the largest U.S. national park — bigger than Switzerland! It forms a huge portion of the Alaska-Canada border to the east and stretches all the way to the Pacific in the south. Standing near its western border at Glenallen and looking east, the nearest road is almost 200 miles away, in Canada. It contains three major mountain ranges (Wrangell, St. Elias, and Chugach) and several subranges. It’s home to the second-highest peak in the U.S. (Mount St. Elias) and nine of the 16 highest. It contains 60% of all the glacial ice in Alaska. It’s the largest designated wilderness in the United States. Despite all of these superlatives, Wrangell-St. Elias doesn’t feel like a national park. It’s more like a wilderness area or even BLM land. There’s no entry fee and no backcountry permits, there’s not much NPS presence, and it gets 40k visitors per year to Denali’s 600k (and Yosemite’s 4 million). There’s only one major road into it: the McCarthy Road. The McCarthy Road is 60 miles of dusty gravel washboard that runs east from Chitina (pronounced chit-nuh) and ends at the Kennicott River just west of McCarthy (more about this below). McCarthy is the gateway to the Wrangell interior. From its airstrip, bush planes transport visitors to several backcountry airstrips around the park. So there we had it: our destination. Now to choose a hike. The only major guide published on backcountry routes in Wrangell-St. Elias, as far as I can tell, is this Falcon guide, which contains a collection of day-hikes and backcountry trips all over this massive park. The last edition is currently several years old, but you should still pick this up if you’re considering a trip. It will help you choose a destination, and the beta is invaluable for the tricky route-finding once you’re on the ground. One of the most important factors in choosing our destination was moderation. None of our group had even been to Alaska before, much less backpacked it, and we were all feeling conservative for our first trip to the Last Frontier. Alaska is a dangerous place, and we felt it was important to stay humble in regards to mileage and technical difficulty. Combined with its incredible natural beauty, this is why Iceberg Lake stood out. It works best as a short loop trip with day-hikes. You’re retrieved from the same airstrip as drop-off, so there’s less pressure to cover a set amount of mileage. Plus it’s a short flight from McCarthy, so it’s cheaper than many other destinations. The Goat Trail, Pyramid Peak, and a few other options were finalists, but ultimately, Iceberg Lake was too good to resist, and we booked our flights. Next up were frontcountry logistics: Anchorage hotels are standard fare. But the options in McCarthy are limited. We chose the least expensive, the Lancaster’s Backpacker Hotel, which brought me back to my days of European hostel-hopping: tiny rooms with noisy bunkbeds, shared bathrooms, shower shoes. And no ride from the footbridge. But it did include a solid breakfast at the bistro next door. McCarthy is a great little town with a big personality. It feels almost like the Wild West (with cell signal). In addition to the few hotels, there are three restaurants, a couple of shops, a bike/watercraft rental spot, the Wrangell Mountain Air office, and a small general store. That’s it. (The saloon has a full bar and solid food; the Potato has good food and an excellent beer selection.) Plan to bring all gear and supplies with you to McCarthy, as pickings are slim. Access to the town is a little weird and inconvenient. The only vehicle bridge into McCarthy is for locals only. Google Maps will tell you to take this bridge, but you can’t — it’s locked up. Visitors must park on the west side of the footbridge and either get a lift in a van operated by their hotel or walk the mile into town on a gravel road. (All the hotels in town except Lancaster’s provide transportation from the footbridge.) This setup can require some extra running around for your gear and bags before/after the backcountry. For example, you may find yourself walking a mile to your car and back to get clean clothes after arriving hungry and dirty back in McCarthy. A few miles up the road from McCarthy is the reason this town exists: the Kennecott Mine, which was the largest copper mine on earth. We didn’t have enough time to visit, which was disappointing, but it looks fascinating. The McCarthy Road is built on the bed of the old railroad that hauled the ore west. The only ways to get to Iceberg is to fly in on a backcountry air taxi operated by Wrangell Mountain Air or hike point-to-point from a different airstrip such as Bremner Glacier. The prices listed on WMA’s website are one-way and per-person, so this is not a cheap flight. The landing strip at Iceberg (N 60.79164, W 142.96663) is a big sandbar made of glacial till. The flight in and out over the Chugach range is incredibly beautiful. If weather cooperates, you get views of 16k+ peaks in several directions as well as myriad glaciers, including 17-mile-long Tana Glacier. This flight is probably not for those with a fear of flying. Takeoff and landing at Iceberg are a little intense, but the cowboys behind the stick are fully capable and it’s a hell of a fun ride. Wrangell Mountain Air operates out of the McCarthy airstrip. The morning of the flight, they’ll drive you to the plane from their office on McCarthy main street. You can take bear spray on the plane, but they must strap it to the outside of the plane for safety. You can bring isobutane fuel but only from approved brands (MSR, Snow Peak, and Primus). White gas is also allowed. I believe you can take firearms if declared (but you can’t fire inside the national park except in self-defense). You are encouraged to bring at least an extra day’s worth of food in case of delayed pickup due to bad weather. The guide we spoke with confirmed that this does happen — sometimes for more than one day. Iceberg Lake Valley has quickly become more popular over the past several years, and more groups mean more impact on this ecosystem that is already stressed from climate change. Please consider your impact: Keep group size small, and practice clean camp procedures plus Leave No Trace principles at all times (pack out all trash, including TP). Note that the valley’s namesake lake does not really exist anymore. A few years ago, it drained and has not returned to anywhere near its original size. You can see this difference between Google Maps’ map layer, which shows the old lake shoreline, and its satellite layer, which shows the drained lake (as of this writing, anyway). Most topo maps will still show the full lake too. Walking on the old lake bed with the Tana Glacier towering in the distance is interesting and a little surreal. The old lake bed would not make for good camping (although I did not get all the way down to the current lake/glacier edge), but it is much easier walking than the rocks. For Iceberg, the book departs from its usual practice of specifying established campsites and instead lays out five general camping areas around the valley, labeled Areas A-E, which I’ll refer to below. I’m not posting an annotated map because you should buy the book and at least one topo! Day 1: Our (thrilling) flight to Iceberg was at 10 a.m. and we were on the ground by 10:45. Our plan after drop-off was a short hike to Area A to camp, get our bearings, and prepare for day 2. But we’re not very good at sticking to plans. Instead, we had our biggest day of the trip, hiking all the way to the glacier, crossing it, and proceeding over a few brutal miles of talus fields to the lake at Area B (with me regretting my decision to carry both of our communal meals). This was a tough decision point on our route, as no decent campsites were apparent to us and this lake is very murky (plus we were out of water). There’s an area on the southern edge of the lake that may have clean water and flat sites, but we decided against that and instead turned to the north, climbing up the ridge toward Area C. Luckily, we didn’t have to get all the way to Area C — which would have been an ugly evening of hiking—and found a flat (if narrow) spot with clean water and an outstanding view just above the rocks. Relief. Day 2: We packed up and headed to Area C, happy to be rested and hydrated. This was a great half-day of backpacking up and over the rocky ridge, and we descended to C’s gorgeous, vividly deep-blue alpine lake to find camping. (Head uphill from the northwest tip to get away from some of the bugs.) After plopping down our packs, we headed to the lake in our skivvies for a shockingly cold but refreshing swim — the next best thing to a shower. We spent the rest of the day wandering around the area’s smaller lakes and waterfalls, and enjoying the view north to a valley thousands of feet below, which looked like prime moose territory. Day 3: Day-hike. We left our tents up, packed some lunch in our daypacks, stashed our bear cans, and headed up this unnamed peak west of the lake. The early going was easy route-finding with mostly soil and alpine plants underfoot before steepening and giving way to flakes of shale scree. This got a bit sketchy at one point as my imagination started running with images of the whole slope giving way into a rockslide, but we made it up with no problems, and the descent was easier than expected. I highly recommend gaining a thousand feet or two off the valley floor if you can. Up high, the vastness and wildness of the park becomes apparent: views for dozens of miles in every direction and not a single sign of human impact. Entire mountain ranges and glaciers come into view from up here, some of them truly intimidating massifs with impossible-seeming summits. It’s difficult to imagine these sprawling glaciers melting along with all the others, but they are. At least they’ll be here awhile yet. Day 4: We had considered moving camp to Area D or E, but the likelihood of having to cross the river on Day 5 seemed high, and all of the advice we received had warned us strongly away from that (a world-class mountaineer nearly died crossing this river). Plus we were stoked to cross the glacier again, so we headed to Area A instead. Here we encountered at least two other groups of people in close proximity to our camp, which was a little jarring after a few days of isolation. If you’re headed back toward the airstrip or Area A from Area C, make sure to stay to the north and find a safe place to get onto the glacier. The river becomes far less powerful after one outlet from the glacier and we were able to easily step onto it instead of dealing with a dangerous crossing (or what looked like a laughably precarious ice bridge — no, thank you). Finding your way back to the ice entry down-valley can be a little tricky from above too, so have that waypoint handy. Day 5: It was a short trip back to the airstrip, where most of our group set up a sun shade on the “beach” and relaxed while waiting for our flight. I took off on a solo jaunt south toward the Tana Glacier, hoping to get a better look at it while exploring the old lake bed. If I’d had another hour or so, there was a big rock outcropping from which there looked to be a good perspective of Tana, but I forced myself to turn back so as not to miss my only ride out of the wilderness. Back at the airstrip, we eagerly hopped aboard when our plane arrived, and we were soon back in McCarthy after another gorgeous flight across the Chugach. We voraciously tucked into some burgers and beers at the Potato, and after several more, enjoyed the townie softball game. There are many glaciers in the mountains around this valley, but when I refer to “the glacier,” I mean the monster covering half of the valley floor. It’s amazing and a great glacier for first-timers (like we all were). I highly recommend crossing it even if you don’t have experience on ice—as long as you’re going late enough in the year that there’s no snow left to hide crevasses and holes. Two in our group had lightweight crampons and two had microspikes. Both worked great. I think it would be possible to do this glacier crossing without spikes at all, but I would not recommend it. Especially near the northwest end of the glacier, there are some larger crevasses to step over or around, and having extra traction adds safety and confidence. Watch where you step at all times! There are some deep holes that are easy to spot as long as there’s no snow, but if you accidentally stepped in one, things could get serious instantly. It’s important to enter the glacier at the right spot so you don’t have to cross the dangerous river. This location is where we were able to step directly onto the ice when approaching it from the airstrip/Area A. It’s just west of where the river emerges from the glacier in a large ice cave (this location will change as the glacier changes, of course): N 60.81209, W 143.01576 Finding clear water was sometimes a challenge on this trip, especially after the glacier crossing. Most of the glacial lakes are very murky and would soon clog a filter. I recommend bringing extra water capacity (I had 4 liters) and filling up when you can. Here are a few good options for water: We met a wilderness guide at the airstrip who said he never filters water in the valley. We filtered all of ours, but apparently there is no giardia present in the area (yet). Drink at your own risk, of course, but the water coming off the snow and ice looked delicious. Three people died in Wrangell-St. Elias last year, and they were all due to river crossings. Alaskan rivers are dangerous! Read up on this topic before you go and do not underestimate it. Be patient, look for braided sections, and don’t attempt an unsafe crossing. Bring good river crossing shoes. Trail runners are great for this but they are heavy and they stay wet, which is not ideal if they’re doubling as camp shoes. Regular Crocs might do but can be unstable on uneven surfaces or slip off in fast-moving water. I bought a pair of Crocs Swiftwater Wave and found them ideal for both rivers and camp. They fit more snugly than regular Crocs and have better traction (but are slightly heavier). I was able to do water runs and even some light rock-hopping in them, as well. Bear cans are required for backcountry trips in Wrangell, and in Iceberg Lake Valley, there are no trees to hang a bag from even if you had to. Bear spray is recommended—keep it handy and be ready to use it. Know how to handle a bear encounter (“run” is 100% the wrong answer). We did not encounter any bears in person, but we spotted two from the plane. Another group we met observed bears near their camp in Area A. And another group who had done a 16-day point-to-point trip ending in Iceberg had seen seven bears. They’re here. Our group had two Garmin InReaches and a Spot beacon. I wasn’t familiar with InReach. It’s a full-featured GPS as well as a comms device. It allows you to send a preset “check-in” message to your loved ones, as Spot does, but InReach also has customizable texting to any number via satellite—this is some next-level backcountry connectivity (it’s up to you to weigh the pros and cons of that)! This means you can text with Wrangell Mountain Air to send/receive updates. All the pilots and various other folks we encountered around McCarthy had InReaches, but they are expensive and require an additional subscription. If this isn’t a device you’re going to use much in the future, a rented satellite phone will do just fine. (This can be accomplished in Anchorage or via mail before you leave.) The need for good backcountry map and nav skills goes without saying. But a GPS is also a good addition to map-reading here in Iceberg to assist with the omnipresent route-finding. Drop waypoints at important locations because the terrain looks different from every angle, and it can be difficult to retrace steps. You gotta get the gear. And I had plenty — I packed for Alaska’s fickle weather but got none of it. I’m not going to get into weights here because I’m a bit embarrassed by how heavy it was (and I didn’t actually weigh it). Hopefully this can help you keep some of that dreaded weight off. My comrades toted our stoves, pots, and water filters. We did two dehydrated dinners on our own and two communal dinners. One was pasta, tomato sauce (packet + paste), olive oil, and lots of pepperoni. Another was seasoned couscous, salmon, pine nuts, and sun-dried tomatoes. Both turned out great. Dehydrated meals are all the rage these days (with good reason) due to their light weight, convenience, and easy cleanup. But it’s also nice to cook a real meal, enjoy it together, and go to bed stuffed. I have a big appetite and have never been able to get by with just snacks during the day. So I bring cheese, summer sausage, and these bread flats to make sandwiches for lunch. For breakfast, I’m partial to granola, dried fruit, and dehydrated milk (you can use hot water on a cold morning and cleanup is easier than oatmeal). I don’t bother brewing real coffee; Starbucks VIA suffices. Plus snacks: bars, jerky, chocolate. And a little bourbon, of course. Gear I found to be essential on this trip: Gear that was nice to have: Gear I didn’t need (mostly due to terrific weather): This trip turned out to be exactly what we were looking for. It’s a great intro to Alaska, to glacier travel, and to backcountry fly-ins. The hiking is hard and slow going, and there are dangerous elements. But it’s all manageable if you play it smart and plan ahead. This place is mind-boggling and eye-popping. It’s cliche to say it, but the pictures truly do not do it justice due to the sheer scale. Getting there and back is not a short or cheap trip, but it’s worth it. I wish I had more time there. I’ll be back to Alaska (and hopefully Wrangell) someday."
Medium.com,Life,SoWA so Good,Travel,https://medium.com/@HenriettaTweets/sowa-so-good-d95c953ef0dd?source=topic_page---------687------------------1," Women have historically, collectively, been pretty good at starting revolutions, particularly of late. But now-in an especially impressive feat-they are doing it by choosing to be both on their own, and on holiday. According to a new study by Culture Trip, the market demographic that is the solo female travelers (also called SoWas) is currently making big changes to the global tourism industry, with a 131% increased interest in holidaying independently over the past two years. This is significant because it’s changing the travel market. More than half-a-millennia since Marco Polo set sail for undiscovered lands, it would seem that all the world has been explored, conquered and Instagrammed to within a microscopic inch. But tourism, for all its redeeming qualities, has largely centered on satisfying travelers that fit neatly into different categories: couples, honeymooners, sportsmen, students, business delegations, and so on. With solo females setting forth at the rate they are currently either doing (14% women) or thinking about (34% women) the opportunities to cater for them are vast, and relatively as yet unchartered. It’s exciting for all involved. Personally speaking, as a woman who frequently travels alone for work, I have always felt guilty if I went somewhere wonderful but didn’t at least try to tag on days here and there for adventure. I have detoxed to extreme in Koh Samui, mingled with sheiks in Kuwait, found new friends in the fjords and bounced back from setback in Bali. On my own. I’ve observed elephants in Chaing Mai, and sipped sundowner sauvignons in Marseille. Toute seule. I’ve braved bullet trains across Japan without the help of a smartphone, and ventured out in Venice pretending not to have a clue that this a city where everyone but everyone is actually one of a two. I was there, it seemed rude not to. SoWas-the new term dubbed for solo women adventurers-are on the rise for lots of reasons that I can relate to. Though I have less opportunity now to travel-solo or otherwise-with two very small children and a shift in my professional focus, I have learned firsthand that adventuring independently is, with few exceptions, exceedingly good for the soul. And I have witnessed over the last decade, how the world is changing to make it easier. To begin with, I just did it because I was opportunistic, and as a journalist the opportunities were frequently there. And while I was often not in fact single, simply unaccompanied (SoWAs aren’t always the Eat Pray Love stereotypes-women today are more than ever leaving their friends and partners at home out of choice) exploring, and in particular dining, alone can be lonely. It can also be awkward and occasionally frightening. Regardless of whether or not I was in a relationship and someone to write home to, I often felt judged. But if this is the reason why so many women have shied away from solo travel, it’s also the reason why more and more now, are booking their tickets and trying it. Of those millions of women who choose to holiday solo because it’s either that or not holiday at all, the options are greater and the risks lower than ever. The market is noticeably changing. With thoughtful packages and innovative ideas dreamt up with solo travelers in mind, tourism the world over is beginning to provide this burgeoning demographic with the necessary reassurance. Social media and smartphones too now provide a buffer, a link, an excuse to share and an immediate audience: it helps. For me it was always about the learning curve: the more I travelled the braver I got and the more I understood how to manage any tricky moments. Street smarts? Maybe, but more important is a positive mentality and a purpose-travel to see the world rather than to be seen posing with a landmark; adventure to amass a bank of stories, linger in places where there is much-so much-to learn. I’m not, here at any rate, alone: according to Culture Trip the majority of SoWAs are using their adventures as a path to enrichment, education and personal growth, with 93% of women who have recently taken a trip on their own confess that they want to educate themselves and learn new things, whilst 74% want to explore different worldviews, beliefs and cultures. Escaping the grind, the stresses and strains and heartaches or physical aches of modern life is another huge driver when it comes to getting SoWA bums on plane seats. The invitation to check in, tune out and return home healthier is an extremely attractive one for hardworking, multitasking modern women. And if it turns out-as some trips can do-to be an unmitigated, nightmarish disaster, chalk it all up to experience and at least bring back a hilarious anecdote or two as a souvenir. Many women, of course, are simply doing it because they can, and they want to travel well while they have the chance. Successful, relaxing, mind expanding and regenerative holidays with babies and toddlers, anyone? It surely can’t be long. Vive la révolution."
Medium.com,Life,Beyond Noodles: A Guide to the Different Types of Restaurants in Japan,Travel,https://medium.com/one-table-one-world/beyond-noodles-a-guide-to-the-different-types-of-restaurants-in-japan-226a183e4a18?source=topic_page---------688------------------1," Japanese cuisine is globally renowned. However, when asked what they know, people often get stuck after sushi and ramen. But Japanese food has so much more to offer. Here’s a quick-fire introduction to ten types of cuisine and restaurants you’ll find in Japan. The izakaya is often dubbed a “Japanese pub,” a moniker which does it a disservice. Unlike the pubs found in the United Kingdom which change from restaurant to bar over the course of the day, izakaya provide a seated affair with food being served well into the night. Izakaya serve a variety of drinks — shochu (焼酎; shouchuu) and sake (日本酒; nihonshu), to name a few) — and tapas-style dishes which pair well with alcohol such as karaage (唐揚げ; karaage, Japanese-style fried chicken), meat or vegetable skewers, heaps of edamame beans, and maybe even horse sashimi. While in Japan you will probably find yourself at either a chain izakaya ( Tori Kizoku, Kin no Kura, or Watami, to name a few), or at a smaller independently run store. Although fundamentally the same, there are a few key differences. In a chain izakaya, you usually order your food from tablets, and sometimes you’ll be sat in solo booths. As you would expect from a chain, prices are usually cheap, with the added bonus of the privacy of a booth. By contrast, in the smaller, independently run stores, you will be sat in front of, or at least nearby, the owner in an open-plan space. These kinds of izakaya can give a wonderfully intimate experience, so if you’re feeling brave I would advise seeking out the neighborhood’s local haunt. However, be prepared for the unexpected — when I first went to Sharakutei, an Okinawan-style izakaya in Senkawa, I realized that nothing was priced, you were given what the chef felt like making (a style of serving known as omakase), and the owner’s English was…not perfect. If you’re feeling up for the unexpected, these experiences can give you some of the most unique experiences of your stay. Famiresu are everywhere, providing a reliable and predictable offering. As indicated by the name (famiresu being a contraction of “family restaurant”), famiresu are a good low to mid-range option that provide a nice balance between price and quality. Popular examples of famiresu include Jonathan’s (ジョナサン) and Saizeriya (サイゼリヤ). Famiresu tend to be ideal for groups. Many of them are chains, and are easily able to accommodate big groups. They’re also very economical, meaning they won’t break anybody’s bank. Additionally, many famiresu will serve both Japanese style food (和食; washoku) as well as Japan’s take on “Western” food (洋食; youshoku) — dishes like omelet rice, hamburg and spaghetti, and Japan-specific dishes such as doria. This makes them appropriate for large groups of people with diverse tastes; even the picky eaters in your group can find something to eat! Famiresu are very popular among students and solo diners. After all, almost every famiresu is equipped with a cheap, free refill “drink bar”, and as there are no general rules about length of stay, you can work in peace on school work, language study, or anything you want with endless coffee on tap. Teishoku refers to fixed meals you can get at various eateries in Japan. Although there is some variation, the meal generally consists of a bowl of rice, miso soup, a side dish (usually a small salad) and the main portion of the spread. Some teishoku places will serve these sides as fixed portions, while others will offer them as a buffet options — known in Japanese as “viking” (バイキング) style. The main portion is flexible, and can include dishes such as grilled fish, shogayaki (生姜焼き; shougayaki, or ginger-fried pork), to fried oysters (焼き牡蠣; yakikaki — my personal favorite). Teishoku is served in many outlets, some specializing in it, but also at famiresu or shokudo. Shokudo, literally meaning “dining hall”, refers to a number of small Japanese eateries that serve a lot of what I would call Japanese comfort food. You can usually find shokudo on street corners in rural neighborhoods and they provide a nice homely menu. Come to one of these for some delicious omelette rice (オムライス; omuraisu), teishoku, or Japanese curry at very reasonable prices. Okonomiyaki is generally dubbed “Japanese pancakes.” Although those of us who come from a sweet pancake culture may find this nomenclature a bit surprising, it is clear that this dish has a lot in common with its savory pancake brethren. A simple mix of flour, eggs, cabbage, spring onion, adorned with a variety of toppings, the okonomiyaki is a hearty dish perfect to fill you up on its own. Literally meaning “grilled as you like it”, the joy of okonomiyaki comes in the amount of variations in available toppings. With okonomiyaki sauce, mayonnaise, bonito flakes and seaweed as standard, you can enjoy the addition of pork, beef, cheese and vegetarian toppings. One fun aspect is that as the grill is integrated into your table, a number of places allow you to cook it yourself! Should you find yourself in Hiroshima or Osaka, take note, for each city prides itself on their local variety. The basic difference is that Osaka okonomiyaki contains more cabbage and meat (beef or pork), whereas the Hiroshima style contains noodles and vegetables. Give them both a try! Hot pot is a vastly underrated dish and there are two Japanese variants that are worth knowing — sukiyaki and shabu-shabu. In either case, as with most hot pot establishments, you’ll be sat in front of a broth-filled hot pot. You can then order a set amount of meat, tofu, and vegetables and cook it right in front of your eyes, where it will be ready to eat in no time. Whereas much Japanese cuisine doesn’t contain a lot of vegetables, most hot pot places will provide you with all you can eat veg, and recently more vegetarian options have become available. Where the two styles differ is mainly in the broth. Sukiyaki finds its origins in Edo-period farmers who used their hoes (suki) as a hot-plate on which they cooked ( yaki) fish and vegetables. Nowadays, sukiyaki is a term generally given to hot pots containing a broth which is seasoned with sugar and soy sauce. A unique part of sukiyaki, is the option of having a soft-boiled egg to dip your cooked meat and vegetables in. Shabu-shabu is a relatively recent dish, finding its origins in Osaka in the 1950s, with the name being an onomatopoeia of the sound of the bubbling pot. The traditional shabu-shabu pot contains a simple dashi broth and you are given ponzu and sesame seed sauces to dip your food in before eating. For those wanting a filling meal, donburi will hit the spot. Donburi is a simple dish of a bowl of rice with various toppings — usually pork or beef. There are donburi outlets all across Japan, with chains like Sukiya, Matsuya, and Katsuya dominating the landscape. There’s a donburi for everyone, with traditional pork-topped bowls, katsudon topped with pork cutlets, and even the delicious yet grotesquely named oyakodon (親子丼; oyakodon — literally mother and child bowl) which is topped with chicken cutlets and egg. Soba and udon are two of ramen’s noodle cousins which are less well-known outside of Japan. Whereas ramen is a heartier, heavier dish, the light freshness of soba and udon provides a feast that will leave you feeling less stuffed than a night out at the local ramen joint. One key difference between these noodles and ramen is the option to choose whether to have them hot or cold, providing an all-year appeal. Soba comes in a few standard options, such as delicious deep-fried toppings kitsune and tanuki. When it comes to udon, however, there are endless varieties. Should you find yourself up in the colds of Akita like I was one year, I would recommend a hearty curry udon. You can often find soba and udon at small eateries on mountain climbs, so take care to refresh after all that physical exertion. Ramen is a staple for any visitor to Japan. There are many varieties so it would be best to be aware of what’s available before going. The three standard broth options are shio (塩; salt), miso (味噌), and tonkotsu (豚骨; pork). At most ramen restaurants, you order beforehand from a machine, where you can also customize your dish — you can choose the thickness and amount of noodles, or even to add extra toppings. Another less-known option to try is tsukemen (つけ麺). This off-shoot of ramen comes with the broth and noodles served separately. The broth is slightly thicker, used instead as a dipping sauce. Not even a century old, this unique dish is definitely worth a try for any ramen lover. Probably the most famous Japanese cuisine in the world, the sushi you get in Japan puts the sushi you can get in almost any other country to shame. Broadly speaking, there are two main types you’ll find — makizushi (巻き寿司), the sushi rolled in rice and seaweed that’s common in the US, and nigirizushi (握り寿司), which is a cut of raw fish over a roll of rice and more common in Japan. Most sushi places will serve you by the plate with two pieces of nigirizushi per order, or one for the pricier cuts, and six rolls of small makizushi. Of course, you can get dishes which will serve a whole range of different fish at a discount, but for picky eaters, it may be wiser to approach the meal one plate at a time. Again, your service will depend whether you head to a chain or an independently run store. Chains such as Sushiro (スシロー) will usually have a conveyor belt (回転寿司; kaiten-zushi), and a tablet to order plates which aren’t currently circling around. At an independently run sushi restaurant, you usually order directly from the chef and the sushi will be prepared before your eyes. It goes without saying that the closer you are to the sea, the fresher, and therefore tastier, the fish is. Also, if there is the opportunity, be sure to try out the kaisendon, a relative of the earlier mentioned donburi. Literally meaning “seafood bowl”, you can enjoy a bowl of rice topped with a variety of diced, raw fish. There are many other delicious types of cuisine you can get in Japan. Be sure to keep an eye out for delicious Okinawan food, or local specialties like the interestingly named jingisukan (yes, named after that Ghengis Khan) from Hokkaido, or champon from Nagasaki! Arthur Reiji Morris is a freelance translator currently based in London. He lived in Tokyo for four years, which he mostly spent playing music in tiny venues, attempting to visit every prefecture in Japan, and finding the best melon pan in town. He spent two years working at a video games company and three weeks working at a coffee chain, before deciding that being able to work from bed was far more appealing.

Medium.com,Life,8 Incredibly Easy Tips To Travel More Eco-Friendly,Travel,https://medium.com/@yanamaximova/8-incredibly-easy-tips-to-travel-more-eco-friendly-4db4d80c912?source=topic_page---------689------------------1," We made a list of the 8 easiest things you can do to travel more eco-friendly. They will not reduce the quality of your trip in any way but will help to save the planet. On average 8 million people fly every day around the world. The majority book their flight tickets online and get an e-ticket and itinerary sent to their email address. And almost everyone prints it out before the trip. Although we don’t have to do it at all! The e-tickets are issued for passengers information only, so they don’t forget the date and time of the flight. At the check-in counter, you will need only your passport to register for your flight. And no one will ask for your printed e-ticket. Moreover, in the majority of the airports, you don’t even have to print your boarding pass. So if you checked-in for your flight online, you need to save your boarding pass on your phone. Then you just show it from your phone when dropping your baggage, going through the customs and boarding a plane. If you need to print your ticket and boarding pass for some reason, then choose an eco-friendly paper. Look for FCS sign on the paper. It means that the paper was produced according to ecological standards with minimal damage to the environment. Many travelers want to protect their luggage from damages or from being open and they wrap it in plastic film. Some people use special services at the airports, others do the wrapping themselves. But think about it twice before doing it next time. The plastic film will be used just for several hours, but after that, it will take almost 200 years for it to degrade. The best alternative would be to buy a reusable luggage case. Not using any protection for a suitcase at all is also not a completely right decision. Without cover, your luggage case can easily get damaged during the flight or handling at the airport. Production of a new case takes a lot of resources and energy, thus if you have to change your suitcase regularly you increase your footprint on the planet. Nowadays you can also find suitcases made of recycled materials, such as recycled water bottles. If you are in need of a new suitcase, this would be a great option. Remember to use a reusable cover to protect it to make this side of your travel eco-friendly. Walking is the most eco-friendly way of getting around. Cycling can also be called an eco-friendly way to travel, however, its production involves a large number of resources and energy. While walking doesn’t require production or resources. 🙂 We cannot recommend stopping flying at all. But here are some tips for you to make your flight more eco-friendly. This is one of the nicest “duties” of a responsible eco traveler. You are in France and having croissants for breakfast? Enjoying Jamon in Spain and mozzarella in Italy? You are doing everything right! The most eco-friendly product is the one made locally as it involves minimal transportation. The biggest part of our ecological footprint comes from transportation of food items. This is why it’s best to stop buying imported products. Instead, we should purchase seasonal and locally made products. This way we help to cut on carbon emissions that come from the transportation industry. Let’s be honest, no one changes their bed linens at home every day. Don’t forget about it when you travel. Say no to daily cleaning of your room if there’s no actual need. Hang a sign “Don’t disturb” outside of your door and the hotel staff will not come into your room. Also, pay attention to the “Eco Tips” in your hotel. Many hotels will provide a card explaining the “signal” you can give to the staff if you want or don’t want your linen and towels to be changed. For example, if you want your towels changed you need to put them on the floor or in the special basket. Otherwise, you should keep them on a hanger. Did you know that conventional sunscreen contains a chemical that destroys coral reefs and marine ecosystems? Its name is oxybenzone, and many sunscreens contain it. According to experts, approximately 14,000 tons of sunscreen end up in the oceans every year. If this doesn’t convince you to make a change, then you should also know that this and other chemicals containing in the sunscreen are harmful to your skin. If you want to protect yourself and the environment, you need to use organic sunscreens that use zinc oxide or titanium dioxide as a base. Also look for the QAI, BDIH and EWG signs, that certify that only organic components were used in production and the sunscreen is safe for use. Make sure to take a reusable water bottle with you wherever you go. In many countries around the world, it’s safe to drink tap water. In others, you can get your water bottle refilled in the hotels, cafes or special water stations. This way you will avoid buying bottled water every day, cutting down on your plastic waste and saving money. If you forgot your bottle, then you can buy a bottle of water in the shop and then reuse it till the end of the trip. A reusable water bottle is the must-do during your eco-friendly travel. We used plastic bags on average for about 15–20 minutes. After that, they end up in the trash bin and later in a landfill. Some of them will end up in the ocean. At the same time, we should also refuse biodegradable bags. This is just another marketing trick, greenwashing. Unfortunately, most of these materials fall apart to microparticles, a.k.a. microplastics. The particles continue traveling around the globe, polluting the environment. The situation with the paper bags is not so easy as well. During the production of paper bags, the air and the water get polluted even more than during production of the plastic bags. At the same time, a large volume of trees needs to be cut for this purpose. The best solution would be to always carry your own reusable bag!"
Medium.com,Life,Birthday in Burchard (Nebraska),Travel,https://medium.com/@charleslawrenceepting/birthday-in-burchard-nebraska-3a00e0ba55aa?source=topic_page---------690------------------1," Esther Tegtmeier has lived in Burchard, Nebraska for the last 68 years. For most of that time she was a teacher at the local elementary school. She remembers the last time the trains ran through town in the mid-1960s; her class rode to Pawnee City, 13 miles away, and had to take a bus back home. She recalls a time when there were two grocers, a hardware store, and two service stations in Burchard, whose population hovered around 200 in the middle of the 20th century. Now, with an advertised population of 82, only a bank and a gas station remain. Her two sons still live in Burchard — one delivers the mail daily — while her daughter now lives across the river in Iowa. And for 30 years, Esther lived and raised her family in the house where one of the most iconic movie stars of all time was born — except she didn’t even know it at the time. The humble white house is situated on the northwest corner of Pawnee and 4th Streets. A sign with hand-carved letters proclaims, “THE BIRTHPLACE OF HAROLD LLOYD.” When Esther lived there the home was a bit more substantial; there were two bedrooms and a kitchen that have since been removed, as the local historical society determined they were not original to Lloyd’s time in the house. With a fresh coat of white paint, the Harold Lloyd home looks to be doing quite well by all appearances. But the biggest problem it faces? At 100 miles from Omaha and 150 miles from Kansas City, there is simply no easy way to get to Harold Lloyd’s birthplace. One must be determined and devoted to an actor whose heyday came nearly a century ago to make the pilgrimage. And there just aren’t that many people like that left. August 2 was my 26th birthday, and I knew in advance that I’d have to spend the weekend in Omaha for a conference. Looking to make the best of the situation, I told my girlfriend Olivia that we’d spend the day on a road trip to Burchard, about an hour and a half’s drive. Harold Lloyd has long been one of our favorite actors, and the chance to visit his birthplace and childhood home was something I had dreamt of doing for years. There are two phone numbers associated with the Harold Lloyd house online. Several weeks before my planned trip to Nebraska I decided to call to make sure there would be someone available to greet us. Both lines were busy for the better part of the day, but several hours later I finally got through to Esther, who asked me which day I’d like to tour the home (although she also admitted that it didn’t particularly matter, as she lived alone and was home most of the time). I told her to expect us around noon, and she said that she lived a block away and would be looking forward to our visit. That morning we loaded up the rental car and set our sights south, making brief detours to Lincoln and Beatrice, before arriving in Burchard at 12:35. There we were greeted by the home, appearing exactly as it did in the photograph on Wikipedia that I had stared at countless times. There was no sign of life in Burchard; a few churches dotted the landscape, and a car with a flat tire was pulled onto the grass next to Lloyd’s home. Apparently we just missed Esther, as she had left a handwritten note with her phone number tucked into the backdoor screen. Unable to call due to the lack of cell service in much of southeastern Nebraska, Olivia and I decided to walk to the nearest neighbor to see if they might know where Esther lived. In a town like Burchard such a task is easy; the door we knocked on was answered by Esther’s hairdresser, who pulled out a phone book and announced our arrival to our host. Five minutes later we were back on the front porch of the house with Esther, who lives only a block south but had to walk because her car had a flat tire, she explained. Once inside we were told that the floors and windows were original, and were shown a display case with several artifacts from Lloyd’s life: his Shriner’s fez, a trophy won for raising Great Danes in 1927, and several scrapbooks of photos. Craft projects made by local school groups are displayed alongside posters from the re-releases of Lloyd’s films. The living room is furnished in a manner typical of the time Lloyd was born. Somewhat apologetically Esther told us that Harold Lloyd had only lived in this particular home until he was about three years old, at which point the family moved to nearby Pawnee City and Beatrice. I assured her that the length of his time in the home was irrelevant; that it was merely the fact that a comic genius entered the world in such a humble setting that compelled us to travel so far to visit the site. As we sat and flipped through the scrapbooks — some with stills from Lloyd’s most well-known films, others with local newspaper clippings and a 1929 letter inviting Lloyd to visit his birthplace — I was trying to sort out my melancholic mood. Esther asked Olivia to sign the guestbook, and it looked as if about a dozen people had visited this year. One travelled all the way from Iran, although I sincerely doubt the home was the purpose of his trip. Most people were from Lincoln or Omaha or Topeka. While Olivia added our names, I decided to take a peek at the “gift shop.” Fundraising is obviously not the strong suit of the Harold Lloyd home, as the price of every item was slashed. A biographical VHS tape was down to $5. There were programs from the 1993 centennial celebration of Lloyd’s birth — now $1 instead of $2. Wooden blocks hand-painted to look like the home were likewise a dollar. Esther informed us they were created by a local artist in Pawnee City, but they weren’t selling all that quickly; there were several left from the original run of 100 created in 1993. I embarrassedly opened my wallet to find I only had two singles on me. But, wanting to support Esther and the museum, I asked where the nearest ATM was. Esther admitted she didn’t know, but she imagined there would be one at the bank or the service station — the only two business left in Burchard. I jumped in the car and, two blocks away, found the First National Bank of Burchard, trapped in time from the late 19th century. I’d imagine that Harold Lloyd’s father did his banking in the very same building, and it must have looked identical. The lone bank-teller informed me that there was no way to withdraw money, as they didn’t keep cash on-hand (a bank without cash — only in Burchard). She told me the nearest ATM was about 12 miles away, or suggested I try the service station (where I was likewise met with blank stares when I asked for cash back). With my tail between my legs I went back to Esther and explained my predicament; she told me to just take whatever I’d like, and to mail the money when I got home. After a few more photos Olivia and I decided we had seen all Burchard had to offer and parted ways with Esther. As we pulled away her son was just arriving to fix the flat tire. For much of the drive to Pawnee City (where Harold Lloyd attended a since-demolished high school) we were completely silent, trying to reconcile our excitement with an unshakeable sense of dread. I had visited the birthplace of one of my all-time heroes, but rather than being joyous I felt like I had said goodbye to an old friend for the last time. In 1993, the town of Burchard celebrated Harold Lloyd’s 100th birthday. At the time the house was not yet a museum, but the Harold Lloyd Foundation (which today survives in name only) hosted a four-day festival in both Lincoln and Burchard to celebrate the man’s life. There was a Harold Lloyd trivia contest, a pie throwing contest, a film screening, a car show, and a Hollywood lookalike contest. Both Harold’s daughter Gloria and granddaughter Suzanne were in attendance, along with (strangely) Dallas star Patrick Duffy. According to contemporary newspaper accounts, over 1,000 people attended the festivities. The restoration of the Harold Lloyd birthplace home was only the tip of the iceberg; grand plans were also announced for a Harold Lloyd museum and farming hall of fame, to be located directly across the street. It is either endearing or tragic that anyone believed such a museum could actually be built in Burchard, but as a testament to their optimism there is still a large sign in the middle of an empty field that reads, “Future Site of Harold Lloyd Silent Film Museum.” The sign has survived 26 Burchard winters. Today, 26 years later, none of that optimism remains. Ground was never broken on the museum, and even Esther admits that it will “probably” not get built (I admire her reluctance to give up on the project completely). The Harold Lloyd estate seems to have little to do with the museum, aside from donating a few artifacts. Esther was proud of a new coat of paint on the house but admitted the sign out front could benefit from the same. It is deceptive to think that the solution to save the Harold Lloyd home is to raise money. This was my first thought; that some Hollywood auteur with an appreciation for the past (a Scorsese or Bogdanovich or Tarantino) should step in and make a donation. But the more I think about it, the more I’m left wondering what good money would do. After all, the home is on a stable foundation and is showing few signs of its age. Inside and out it is meticulously well-kept. But even an influx of a million dollars would not change the fact that few people will ever visit Burchard, Nebraska. I don’t know what the path forward for the museum is. I don’t know what will happen when Esther is no longer able to provide tours to the few monthly guests. I don’t know that there’s anyone who is both willing and able to take the reins and become the next steward of the house. Burchard, whose population steadily declines with each census, will probably not exist in any recognizable form within the next 20 or 30 years. It is tempting to suggest moving the house — perhaps to Lincoln, where it could be cared for by a university or civic group, and perhaps attract a new audience that would never make it to. Burchard. However, the context of Lloyd’s birth and early life (a quintessential rags-to-riches story) would be mostly lost. Is the trade-off worth it? At what cost must we as silent film fans fight to save the home? Is there an empty plot of land in Hollywood big enough? Or is it best to let the home die with dignity, the same way countless towns across the Midwest will soon be forgotten? I wish I had the answers to these questions. I wish there was an easy solution to preserve what I consider to be one of the most important cinematic landmarks on the planet. But I don’t, and there’s not. All I can say is that I turned 26 years old in Harold Lloyd’s birthplace. It might not ease my anxieties about the future of the home, but it’s still a pretty special memory."

Grbavica had suffered heavy shelling in the 1990s when Sarajevo was under siege by nationalist Serbs. Window sills bloom with flowers now, even though the acned walls keep the war alive. I’ve just exited a kafana, where the music has me swaying but the snacks left me hungry. I pull up my jacket collar to my ears and skip a few steps to enter the pekara on the ground floor of one scarred building. White light bright, and warm enough to loosen my stiff shoulders, the half-empty shelves promise to meet my meager needs. Burek — meat or spinach stuffed into a coiled flaky pie — would see me through yet another night. “Eine burek molim,” I tell the woman at the counter, mixing fragments of German and Bosnian. She packs the two burek in a paper bag. “Kako?” She utters a word, pauses, then raises four fingers: That’s 4 Bosnian convertible marks (KM). Or, about 2 euros. Or, in a currency that I convert mentally, which makes me happy, approximately 170 Indian rupees."
Medium.com,Life,A Timeless Box Full of Whistles,Travel,https://medium.com/@four4thefire/a-timeless-box-full-of-whistles-6f8ebd743413?source=topic_page---------692------------------1," If you walk across the central plaza of Haarlem, The Netherlands, at just the right angle and with the proper mindset, time — at least visually — can stand still for a moment. The plaza hides the modern accouterments of the surrounding city, and before you, the soaring Grote Kerk lords over the Grote Markt as it has since the 14th Century. Haarlem’s great church, St Bavo, isn’t actually a cathedral in the proper sense, that honor going to the like-named Cathedral of St Bavo two kilometers away. But walking up to it your mind screams “cathedral,” and a marvelous example of one. When I did it, I was holding the hand of my 10-year old daughter who was nearly dragging me across the plaza, so great was her anticipation of going into the vast building as part of a school trip. My admonishment of “you can’t go running off in a foreign city alone” wasn’t registering, so strong was the pull of what was to come. It didn’t disappoint. It was amazing, a truly remarkable structure to behold. And that’s before you even get to the organ. Walking into a cathedral with intricate wooden ceiling, enclosed vaults, and hundreds of years of history envelopes you immediately. Crossing the floors, uneven due to the slabs of stone being graves to a quarter of a millennium’s worth of Haarlemers’ bones, the sheer majesty of it — the point of building vast palaces of faith in the first place — is inescapable. But then you see IT: the awe-inspiring Müeller organ, resting like a massive living heart inside the chest of the great church. It takes up the entire western wall of the church. If it sat on its own in the Grote Markt, the Müeller organ would be second only to the church itself as the largest building on the square. It is almost 100 feet high, with ornate cherubs carved as if holding it above the floor, capped with two lions bracing the city coat of arms. This all frames 5000 pipes arranged in 64 registers of musical muscle dressed up in beautiful craftsmanship. Twenty-five stunningly beautiful figures carved by the hands of sculptor Jan van Logteren silently watch over this loudest of tourist attractions. It was completed in 1738, the same year that saw the birth of Charles Cornwallis who would, a generation later, be the General whose surrender at Yorktown effectively birthed the United States. That same year, and just up the road from Mother Cornwallis’ labour, John Wesley found religion in a spiritual awakening that would later be the foundation of the Methodist faith. Meanwhile on the Continent, the Wars of Polish succession finally ended with the Treaty of Vienna. From the throne of France, Louis the Beloved granted permission for the planting of new vineyards, so impressed was he by the quality of Rémy Martin cognac, forever adding the year to the label the brand is now famous for. Throughout all that history, all those years and lives and events that moved the world, people have come to see an epic achievement in craftsmanship, to hear a marvel of human engineering, to wonder at something as natural as wind being harnessed by mortal hands to produce music intended to inspire the divine. Not bad for what is essentially a big box of whistles. The origins of the modern pipe organ go back to the ancient Greeks. Calling the components “reeds” was not just an obscure reference but actual nomenclature, and the foundations were more hydraulic than musical. The earliest “water organs” predated Christ by more than 200 years. The oldest example we have, remarkably with metalwork still intact, is from the first century. St Bavo’s Müller isn’t the largest pipe organ; that happens to be the Boardwalk Hall Auditorium Organ in Atlantic City, New Jersey. Nor is it the oldest playable pipe organ still in use; that would be the dozen pipes of the organ inside the Basilica of Valère in Sion, Switzerland, dating from 1435. But viewing it with my 10-year old made an indelible impression upon me. It was a moment when intersecting moments of present, and history, and place meet and blow your mind. While listening to the history of the mighty instrument, I was told the story of another 10 year-old child anxious to enter the great church and see the mighty pipe organ. I wonder if that 10 year-old held an adult’s hand, perhaps a parent’s or teacher’s, and fairly dragged them across the Grote Markt just like my daughter had. Unlike my child, this one wasn’t content to just see it, but simply had to mount the console and play it. They didn’t let my daughter do that, but 2008 isn’t 1766, and my kid isn’t Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart. So … perhaps different rules for different eras. I wonder if he had to be admonished to not walk alone, or if his genius even registered such terrestrial issues on his quest to make heavenly music. Händel had the same problem some 20 years before Mozart, traveling to Haarlem for the same purpose. The metal reeds in St Bavo’s box of whistles called to him. He particularly obsessed over the “Vox Humana,” the ability of the pipe organ to imitate the human voice, in a manner of speaking. He was known to conduct singers from the console of his parish church’s organ, though he wasn’t a formally recognized organist at a time when such titles and privileges were ruthlessly enforced. Such was his desire to get the voice of both man and machine exactly how he wanted it. The other end of the musical spectrum still finds a pipe organ useful in a much different places than those classical masters. While the broad traditional and middle still use the pipe organ and its electric descendants in places of worship and classical works, some good old-fashioned secular users can seek out the instrument. Benmont Tench was far from a child prodigy Mozart or Händel in his peak, but he can play the hell out of an organ. Granted it was usually a Hammond, that stalwart of rock and soul music, rather than a pipe organ. Tench earned his musical bones keyboarding for The Heartbreakers, backing up Tom Petty as the core of an illustrious career. But he was at the console for one of my personal favorite, if lesser known, pieces of pipe organ music. Manning the pipe organ of the St James Episcopal Church in Los Angeles, he accompanied a rather unlikely vocalist, riddled with disease and with his own mortality in mind, who wrung what he could out of his wearied voice through old standards “Danny Boy” and “You’ll Never Walk Alone.” Almost everyone hated the pairing, thinking the overwrought emotion of the songs and the church setting they were recorded in didn’t work. Fitting his contrarian legend, Johnny Cash didn’t care. “The session lasted about two hours and it was over. Just exactly the way we had hoped and planned and prayed it would be. It really adds an element that I’ve never had on a record before. Never had anything like that.” “Danny Boy” was released to little fanfare or notice. “You’ll Never Walk Alone” only saw the light of day as part of a flurry of posthumous material released after The Man in Black faded to black. That was when I found it, and I have loved the old song ever since. Tench takes the St James pipe organ for a solo in it, but is decidedly muted, only teasing a soaring pulling of the stops before gently falling back into the familiar melody. It’s more warm blanket than the sonic sledgehammering the box of whistles can be when fully operational and manned by someone with a mind towards auditory assault. But against Cash’s battered baritone, it works magically so, critics be damned. I listen to that song often, thinking of my own relentlessly running life clock. I’m often thinking of my own rather tenuous mortality, or my children and other loved ones and taking comfort in the thought of them not being alone, even if it’s just a wish or song or semblance of love that sustains them. My alarm on my phone has long been the bombastic blast of pipe organ that kicks off Meatloaf’s otherwise melancholy and melodic “ Home By Now/No Matter What.” It never fails to awaken, like “You’ll Never Walk Alone” never fails to nearly bring tears or a smile in equal measure. That is a remarkable testament to the range and power of an instrument we’ve had as a part of humanity since Hannibal took elephants across the alps. Across the lineage from metal reeds back to the Greek’s real reeds, from antiquity forward to modern-day LA, there is power in the man-made winds of the pipe organ. When Hans Zimmer scored the movie Interstellar to musically accompany a story of travel that was both futuristic and literally spanning our understanding of time, he turned to the mighty pipe organ. The oldest of our instruments driving home the story of mankind’s future seemed appropriate. The main character of the film reaching for his daughter works on the screen as well as it works for me walking across the Grote Markt with mine, or perhaps to the adult chaperon of Mozart 300 years earlier. It works because man-made wind has a story in and of itself, lending gravitas to its music beyond just the mechanical creation the stops and ranks produce. It’s amazing how something attached to the wall of a church can travel with you without it moving at all. Pipe organs can be absurd things in the abstract. The bare idea of a 10 year-old boy playing an 8 story building inside a Dutch church sounds strange. But the image of Mozart playing the Müeller of St. Bavo, steeped in our knowledge of the unspoken power of music and the weight of greatness and history behind it… it’s breathtaking. It’s history and place and people all intersecting into something special. It means that none of them, or us, ever really walk alone. The sounds of the others are always close by. Not bad for a two thousand year old box full of whistles."
Medium.com,Life,Do You Really Need Travel Insurance?,Travel,https://medium.com/@chadrwyatt/do-you-really-need-travel-insurance-54f73e965d79?source=topic_page---------693------------------1," If you have booked a trip or vacation recently then you have probably asked yourself, is travel insurance worth it? The answer is yes and no, and I will explain the reasons behind each in this article. There are many different reasons behind getting travel insurance, and the good news is, it’s completely up to you if you want to get it or not. There are many different stipulations when it comes to travel insurance and insurance in general. This article will not be laying out all the details and T&C’s of travel insurance companies. I want to give advice to people who travel on when it is advisable to get travel insurance, and when not to. When you book your travel, companies will usually try and pressure you into taking their travel insurance, and even if you want coverage, don’t take it from the company you book with. These companies usually have extortionate fees and points to catch you out in the small print. You should also be aware that there are a number of credit cards in the world that offer travel insurance. Please don’t think that this means you are fully protected. Credit card companies generally advertise with “free travel insurance” as a benefit but you will find that the small print has some hidden warning signs. I have come across cards previously that offer free travel insurance, and later found out that the travel insurance might only cover you for a 7-day trip or covers up to $500. Just make sure you read all the terms before thinking you are covered. As mentioned already it is entirely dependant on you to decide if travel insurance is worth it, and there are different reasons that can help you decide that. If you are going to spend the whole time worrying because you aren’t covered, then it’s probably worth just paying the money and enjoying your trip. The main two considerations that you should have to begin with is: Medical Some people go 25 years without ever breaking a nail, then break their leg on a trip. Some people will injure themselves every day but will be absolutely fine when they travel. The point is, you can’t predict what’s going to happen when you travel, you could develop appendicitis which would require expensive surgery, a tree could fall and hit you, or you could get food poisoning. Without travel insurance, you may end up paying anywhere from $500 to $30,000 depending on what happens and where. This is where you need to decide if it’s worth the risk, even if you are that person that “nothing ever happens to you”. Financial There are a range of financial risks that you take if you decide that travel insurance isn’t worth it. You might have a family emergency that means you have to cancel the trip, items may get stolen, you could lose your luggage, and also suffer if you rent a car without insurance. Most of the risks here are a mixture of your responsibility and things that are out of your hands. You also may already have insurance out on your electronics for example, but you should double-check the terms in case it doesn’t cover you in another country. Just make sure you are aware of the financial risks you take when travelling without insurance. Disclaimer — I am not telling you what the right thing to is, this is purely for advice based on logic and experience. There are instances where you should consider travel insurance no matter what. Here are some of the main reasons when travel insurance is worth it. If you are booking a flight with a budget airline OR an airline that has had speculation of recent financial troubles, I would strongly recommend getting travel insurance. There have been instances over the last 5 years where major budget airlines have ceased activity due to financial constraints. This can happen at an instant, and while it may not be so bad if you haven’t left yet if you are already on your vacation/trip, you could find yourself in hot water. If the airline you are flying with ceases activity it will usually happen at the click of a finger and all flights will be grounded. They are at no obligation to get you home and occasionally other airlines may jump in and help as it’s good marketing for them. I have read stories that people have been stranded in a country because they didn’t have money for a flight home and had no travel insurance. This might not be too bad as a single traveller, but imagine a family of 5. There are some credit cards that will cover this with travel insurance, however, I would recommend getting travel insurance to be on the safe side. When you book international travel, you should expect to pay a hefty amount of money for flights, accommodation and any additional extras. Even if you are a budget traveller, international travel is still a considerable amount more than domestic. Most international trips are booked months ahead of time to get the best price too. If you aren’t covered by travel insurance, then you run the risk of losing a large sum of money. It makes more sense to protect your expensive investment for a small sum of money. You will be surprised how many long-term travellers don’t actually have travel insurance. You might be really lucky and end up going 1–2 years without ever getting sick/hurt or losing your bags. But the reality is you are going to be away for a very long time compared to a short vacation, this automatically increases your risk by huge amounts. You should therefore definitely have travel insurance for long-term travel. If you travel to a country that is known for poor hygiene and sanitation, then you should probably take out travel insurance. You never know how sick you will get and should be prepared that even though it’s a cheap country, the medical bills are the opposite. This also applies to people that decide to travel with illnesses or that are prone to them. For example, if you know you have asthma and you are travelling, not taking out travel insurance would be a huge risk. Anyone with a lasting condition should get travel insurance. Be aware that some may not cover recently diagnosed conditions. Also, if you have a weak immune system, you should get travel insurance. Your body will be introduced to new “bugs” when you travel, which could knock you off your feet. If you need medical assistance as a result, you will lose money without travel insurance. The main example of a location I can give is Bali. Bali is prone to earthquakes and volcano eruptions that can disrupt flights. If you know you have you booked a trip to somewhere that is at risk of natural disasters, then you should also purchase travel insurance to be on the safe side. Problems can occur before you travel resulting in loss of money and problems can occur when you are at that location causing medical expenses. There are certain instances where I would suggest that travel insurance is not necessary, but this is circumstantial and is your choice entirely. I look at the situations as if the benefit outweighs the risk then you don’t need to worry. If you decide to travel internally or domestically then there usually isn’t a need for travel insurance. You have to look at it this way, you will be covered for medical with your normal insurance provider, some credit cards may have increased coverage for travel insurance as you are still in the country, and you generally will not have invested $1,000’s on your travel. Don’t misunderstand though, you can still stand to lose money with domestic travel. If something happens with your flights, for example, you will lose that money. The good news is, it will be minimal compared to and international flight. Is travel insurance worth it for last-minute travel? Again, it depends on what you have invested. Some people are put off by last-minute travel because they don’t have travel insurance. What you need to consider is that with last minute travel deals, you will likely pay much less than normal, which means less of a risk. I would say that with last-minute international travel, you will be more at risk and should be sceptical of deciding to go against travel insurance, after all, it doesn’t take long to take out travel insurance. If it is domestic last-minute travel, I wouldn’t worry at all. When people take out travel insurance, the main reason is to cover their flights. However, you should always check the airline’s terms and conditions first because some of the bigger airlines will give you a new flight at no extra cost when something happens that is their fault. Make no mistake though, if it is your fault you couldn’t make the flight, you won’t get any money back. There are instances where the airline may delay the flight by 15 hours, 20 hours, or even a day, this means that without travel insurance, you will lose out on other bookings you have made for arrival. It would be a headache to try and type out all the different travel insurance T&C’s for credit cards as they are so diverse and complex. In my opinion, credit card companies try to catch you out with travel insurance. Some cards will cover cancelled flights but not lost bags, some will cover a portion of medical expenses on trips shorter than 90 days, and there are so many other variations you will find. The main thing to remember is to check you are covered before you leave. The best tip I can give, don’t sign up to a new credit card for travel insurance before you book a trip. You should book your trip and once you know your financial investment and length of trip, browse the different credit cards to see how much they cover you for. It’s better to know what is covered in case you are missing something vital, for example, you book a trip for 3 weeks and the credit card covers you for 14 days only. You should also check your existing credit card to see what you are covered for. You might find that the credit card covers you for everything and you won’t even need to worry about travel insurance. So is travel insurance worth it? Next time you book a trip, think about these points and make a decision that suits you best. Just remember one thing, ensure that the benefits outweigh the risks. I have travelled with and without travel insurance with experiences of paying for lost flights and being covered for medical expenses. Originally published on the travel blog Couples Carry-on"

Medium.com,Life,I Had the Luckiest Flight Ever!,Travel,https://medium.com/the-mile-high-club/i-had-the-luckiest-flight-ever-d54edd01be4f?source=topic_page---------695------------------1," Right from the beginning this flight was lucky. I needed a flight ASAP to get back to Shanghai from Australia for my work. I jumped online and begged the universe for a flight that wouldn’t cost the earth on such short notice. Whenever I’m booking a flight connecting Australia with anywhere else I open Qantas first, followed by my universal booking site, SkyScanner. I can usually rely on SkyScanner for the best prices, but will always check Qantas because their great onboard service makes flying economy a bit less terrible.
(Their service off the plane is a different story). My search for a flight was short lived because for some reason the first flight I found from Sydney to Shanghai was only $400! And I don’t mean US dollars, I mean New Zealand dollars! This price is insanely fantastic, especially on such short notice.
I then had another stroke of luck, the exit row had one seat left and was going for an additional $100. “Not worth it” I hear some people say. But when you’re 6'3"" and stuck on a plane for 10.5 hours, that extra legroom goes a long way. The seat was everything I could have hoped for, and more. While my seat wouldn’t turn into a bed, I had more legroom than even the business class passengers!
I was literally on top of the world. My seat-mate was strange, but not terrible.
He sat almost the entire flight doing nothing. He didn’t watch TV, sleep, read, nothing. He just sat with his hands on his lap and stared forward. The only way I even knew he was alive was because he ate and checked the progress of the flight occassionally. As much as he acted like a martian, he never disturbed me. So he’s all good in my book. In this seat your screen must be stowed for takeoff and landing, so bring alternative entertainment for the approximately 1.5 hours combined that you’ll be unable to use the screen. I watched pre-downloaded episodes of Glow on my Netflix app. The flight attendants for this flight were really funny, they made a lot of jokes and did a lot of flirting. One joked that while I sleeping, I had apparently said out loud that I’d wanted to take one of the other flight attendants on a date.
(This guy was a solid wingman for his coworker). Through this flirting and joking I learned that they were all spending the night in Shanghai and were looking for something to do.
I couldn’t help them out with their problem however, but it made for a hilarious flight. When it came to meal time, my charming flight attendants claimed to have run out of the meal option I wanted, despite having enough for seemingly everyone else on board. (Including my martian seat mate). They didn’t make me choose one of the other options though, they just had me wait a while. The wait was worth it though, because after about a 20 minute wait, I was given a medley of food options from the Business Class cabin. This amazing turn of events proved once and for all that how you treat your flight attendants will make or break a flight. My good luck carried on once the plane landed and the flight experience was over. Somehow my bag was the first one on the conveyer belt, which should be impossible if you fly economy.
Not only that, there was no line at customs. I flew out of the airport. It was just one of those once-in-a-lifetime flights where everything goes perfectly. What’s your luckiest flight story? Have you ever had a flight as lucky as this?
All I’m hoping is that this level of luck isn’t just a one time thing."

It was about 6AM in the morning. I was under a kiosk where people could charge their phones and get WiFi. I arrived in Jinan the night before. China has a strange law banning foreigners from certain hotels and hostels, so I couldn’t find a place to sleep. After getting kicked out from a park bench, I managed to find this kiosk where I set up camp. It was a great place to sleep, it had a slight roof, a clean floor, I could even charge my phone. But it was very public. When I woke up the next morning, the city sidewalk was bustling with people. I read my book in peace until a woman in a luxurious red dress saw me. She crouched down next to me, her jewelry jangling on her wrist. “Why are you sleeping on the street?” she asked in Chinese. “I couldn’t find a place to sleep,” I responded. She stared at me, dumbstruck, then let out a great laugh. “In China, we all think you white people have money! But you don’t!” Then she walked away, laughing. Lesson 1: Get laughed at. Get embarrassed. It’ll do you good."
Medium.com,Life,My Least Favorite Piece of Travel “Advice”,Travel,https://medium.com/a-passport-and-a-pencil/my-least-favorite-piece-of-travel-advice-9699235bae71?source=topic_page---------700------------------1," Because I like to travel, I’ve spent a lot of time reading travel blogs and other sources of travel advice. I’ve scrolled through pages and pages of blog posts, Instagram posts, and Pinterest boards, looking for inspiration and feeding my wanderlust. In all my time consuming travel-related content, I’ve gotten a lot of good tips on saving money, packing, and planning a trip. But there is one piece of travel “advice” that has been rubbing me the wrong way for a while now. It goes something like this: “Anyone can afford to travel. If you just make it a priority and work hard, you will be able to make your travel dreams come true!!!” -some travel blogger somewhere, probably right now Closely related to this is the mantra of “Just go and don’t worry about the money.” This line of thinking is, to me, not only bad advice, but actively harmful. The people who say things like this are, I think, well-meaning. Their particular set of circumstances and desires lined up to make it possible for them to travel (usually extensively and abroad-that is almost always what people mean when they encourage others to “just go.”) and this experience has been meaningful to them. They really believe that everyone can do it, and that everyone should. I just don’t think that’s realistic. For one thing, this line of thinking assumes that everyone wants to travel the world extensively, which I’ve said before is something I don’t think everyone needs to want. But it also assumes that, on a practical level, travel is financially accessible to everyone if you just work hard enough. And like any kind of “pull yourself up by your bootstraps” mentality, things just don’t work like that. While it’s true that there are plenty of ways to make travel more affordable, it’s rarely truly cheap. And if you aren’t interested in living a nomadic lifestyle and instead want to fit travel into your normal life, you will have to factor in paying for travel on top of your normal expenses. Then there is the fact that many of the “money-saving tricks” touted by travel bloggers assume a certain level of disposable income to start out with. For instance, any advice that I have come across to get cheap flights involves gaming the credit card rewards system. But in order to get those rewards, you have to be spending money. And oftentimes, the highest rewards come from spending money on travel or dining out, things that you might not be currently doing if you are trying to save money for a big trip. Plus, getting one of those high-rewards credits cards isn’t easy or even possible for everyone. If you don’t have great credit, good luck getting one of these cards. Race and privilege come into play here as well, since non-white Americans are more likely to have lower credit scores due to systemic racism in the financial industry. Which means that these rewards systems that are the cornerstone of “travel hacking” aren’t equally open to everyone. So when someone says “everyone can afford to travel” what they really mean is “everyone from certain socio-economic backgrounds.” (I have the same problem with any money-saving advice that assumes you have things in your life you can cut out. “Stop buying coffee and eating out” is terrible advice if you literally can’t afford to buy coffee and eat out.) I also think that this idea put out by a lot of travel bloggers and online travel content creators that “anyone” can travel and that you should “just go” has a judgemental undertone to it. Like, if you don’t or can’t make this a priority then you are just lazy or somehow else a failure. I’ve fallen prey to this mindset as well, since I do want to travel more but haven’t been able to make it as much of a focus in my life as I would like. I’m looking to change that, but I still sometimes feel as though I’m failing or somehow running out of time to travel because I haven’t just abandoned my financial responsibilities in pursuit of “living the dream.” I don’t want to discourage people from traveling. I think if you really want to travel and it is possible for you to do so, then you absolutely should. I know that the spirit behind the “Don’t worry, just go” advice is to not let unnecessary fears get in the way of your travel dreams. The people who make it their business to promote this idea probably aren’t (always) completely unaware of how the world works and are just trying to encourage those who need encouraging. But I also don’t want people who see yet another blogger or Instagrammer posting a photo of their breakfast at a villa in Bali or whatever to feel like it is somehow their fault that they aren’t living that lifestyle because they couldn’t qualify for a travel rewards card and have no disposable income. So while I don’t think we should stop sharing money-saving tips or ways to make travel more affordable, I think we can all be a little bit more aware of what we are really saying when we say “everyone can afford to travel”"

the one hand, it’s tempting to say, “better go see Alaska now, before the glaciers are all gone!” In fact, that’s exactly what my family recently did. All of us love to travel, crave the peace and sublimity of the natural world, and are fascinated by animals and plants of all sorts. We tote our binoculars and field-guides and almost no trip is too short or urban not to warrant our taking sturdy shoes and hiking-appropriate clothing. So a trip to Alaska, part-cruise, part-overland, was a no-brainer. In one sense. On the other hand, all signs point to human mechanisms accelerating the shrinking of the glaciers and countless other ecological changes, such as the loss of high-arctic sea-ice, that have been documented in the last fifty years or so. Undoubtedly, travel is part of the problem. But I think it’s only a small part, and perhaps not the part that warrants the most attention and effort at this point. I hope that’s true, anyway. Let’s say your closest thing to an experience of “tundra” is a memory of your high-school history teacher enunciating words like “tundra,” “taiga,” and “perma-frost” in that emphatic way she always spat out key words that you’d better be sure you knew for the test (pinning you in her steely gaze if you so much as thought about yawning in her class; hell to pay if you were unable to suppress it). Or let’s say Jack London’s “To Build a Fire” lit a fire under you to find out the unimaginable places signified by words like “tundra” and “Yukon.” Or perhaps you read the account of Christopher McCandless’ death in the Alaskan wilderness as told by Jon Krakauer in Into the Wild (Villard, 1996) and tried to imagine the terrain that had so captivated that young man. Of course, our travels in Alaska were nothing like those of McCandless, who hitchhiked and then walked out for miles with little more than rice to fuel him. We and thousands of others rode comfortably aboard what I came to think of as a floating Las Vegas, waking to find ourselves, one morning, docked in Juneau, where we could take a bus out of the city to see the Mendenhall Glacier, and another day, cruising into Glacier Bay National Park with rangers and a naturalist narrating our views. We heard, several times over, about why glacial ice is blue (compressed, it has less air in it than your freezer’s ice cubes, so it absorbs the red end of the light spectrum but scatters the blue). In the visitors’ center at the Mendenhall Glacier, a large slab of glacial ice sat out in the open, a bit of the past for us to touch. The trails in that park take hikers through the geological history of the area, marking the extent of the glacier as it has receded since the mid-1700s — a total of 2.5 miles, notes the U.S. Forest Service. Now, a short, easy trail runs to a spit of land near the glacier’s terminus. Nugget Falls cascades nearby, while bald eagles perch on promontories to take in the view. It was green and misty, lush as you’d expect a rainforest to be, and the gray, silty lake was glass-calm, except at the base of the falls. The blue-white cliff of glacier was incongruous in the scene, though if I’d been looking at it from the perspective of the ice-field that feeds it, all this green and vapor and liquid might’ve looked out of place. Point of view matters. A couple of days later, the ship entered Glacier Bay on a day that was as warm and clear as any advertisement for summer vacation spots much further south. For us as viewers, it meant sharp, glistening panoramas of the fjord’s waters and glaciers. It meant that sea-otters and seals sunned themselves near the ship on icebergs (very small ones that looked sort of like bright ice-cubes in a punch-bowl), and every spout released by a humpback whale sparkled, alerting us to the possibility of seeing flukes or a breaching body. It was glorious and awe-inspiring. It was not difficult to imagine the glaciers melting in all that intense sunlight. The park rangers pointed out to us the Lamplugh Glacier’s ridge of orphaned ice at the terminus that marked clearly its retreat. And as we slowly pivoted in the fjord’s cul-de-sac to see the brilliant, robust Margery Glacier, we also saw the Grand Pacific, now receding and blackened with silt and debris. The juxtaposition of Grand Pacific to Margery’s white and turquoise face was like an illustration of before and after. Though the truth is more complicated than that, the visual image is haunting. That was the beginning of the summer of 2019. By August, all the sea-ice within 150 miles of Alaska’s ridiculously long coastline had melted, far earlier than is normal. Meanwhile, in Iceland, scientists posted a plaque with the following message on the side of a mountain by the Okjukoll Glacier: Ok (Okjökull) is the first Icelandic glacier to lose its status as a glacier. In the next 200 years all our glaciers are expected to follow the same path. This monument is to acknowledge that we know what is happening and what needs to be done. Only you know if we did it. I’m glad to have seen glaciers, glad I’ve had the chance to marvel at the ecosystems that have formed around them while they’re still thriving. It’s difficult to think about the future, that time that only exists in imagination and may or may not include us, but it’s not much of a stretch to think that humans of the future would not thrive in climates and weather much more extreme than what we now face. For my family, and for many others on board the ship with us, the resplendence of each ice-vista was set off by a shadow of the uncertain future. Both are memories we’ll return to.

Medium.com,Life,Land of Fire and Ice: A week of Backcountry Ski Exploration in Iceland.,Travel,https://medium.com/@quinnbrasel/land-of-fire-and-ice-a-week-of-backcountry-ski-exploration-in-iceland-d59b8602d774?source=topic_page---------704------------------1," If you’ve never soaked in a “hotpot”-a naturally occurring hottub after a sweaty morning of ski touring, you’re not living life to the fullest. Among the pleasures one can experience while backcountry skiing in Iceland are clean socks, hydroflasks with something hot waiting in the car, touring next to the Arctic Ocean and a good dunk in one of these aforementioned hot springs. I didn’t discover this until halfway through our adventure in the far north. We hit the road for 10 days with a very loose itinerary but a solid desire to seek out the best terrain and snow the country had to offer. The trip was concocted on a whim; a dreary Seattle winter day with no promise of snow in the near future. 4 months later we arrived in the early morning in Reykjavik to freezing, sideways rain and swearing at our rental car for not having a more intuitive navigation button system. While our first day in Reykjavik dumped rain on us, we hoped that it was dumping equal amounts of snow further north at our first destination, Akureyri. We decided to take advantage of the situation and plotted possible mountains to scope out the following days while devouring a warm, dripping cinnamon roll from a historic Icelandic bakery, . The next morning we packed up the car, enjoyed a quick trailrun up Mt. Esja (the Mt. Si of Reykjavík), then drove 5 hours north to the small ski town of Akureyri. We chose this as our first homebase because of it’s proximity to the backcountry ski paradise of Tröllaskagi- The Troll Peninsula. Our first morning we drove from Akureyri to Dalvik, a tiny fishing village 40 minutes away. After driving several confused loops around town we identified the best trailhead at the base of Mt. Baejarfjall, spotting some beautiful lines overlooking the icy sea. We toured for about 3 hours and were pleasantly surprised to find some powder stashes on the way down that appeared out of nowhere. Afterwards, to truly soak in the local culture we devoured fish soup and beer bread at a tiny cafe with an easy to pronounce name “Gisli Eirikur Helgi Kaffihûs Bakkabrædra”, named after three brothers from an Icelandic folk tale. Feeling cozy and full of liquid, we returned to Akureyri eager to plot the next days adventure. The second day brought clear, sunny skis and an unforgettable hike up with views of the Norwegian sea which were masked the previous day by fog. It had been an unusually sparse snow year in Iceland, but made for a consistently stable snowpack as we assessed on our way up. A handful of times we could hear the distant whir of a helicopter. This was the territory of Arctic Heli Skiing, where Iceland’s only UIAGM-IFMGA guide Jökull Bergmann runs his guiding operation. Alas, we couldn’t stay in Akureyri forever. The next day we made the incredibly long and windy fjord journey to Ísafjörður, where I was convinced our farmstay awaited us. As it turns out, when you travel in a foreign country with an actual address, you should plug the entire address into google and not just the city. We overshot Heydalur by 1.5 hours and were too tired to turn back, but found a simple hotel and delightfully random Thai dinner in the heart of old town (in something akin to a strip mall). The Icelandic ski gods delivered the next morning, where we spent the first part of a brilliantly sunny day skinning up the resort of Tungudalur and skied a southern facing slope loaded with untouched pow. We arrived at our (correct) destination later that afternoon, Heydalur Guesthouse where we were enthusiastically greeted by a robust golden retriever and a feisty shepherd. Bangsi (icelandic for “teddybear”) and Loki became our fast companions and were occasionally shadowed by a shy arctic fox named Thora who was a resident of the property. We enjoyed unrivaled dinners that took the term “farm fresh” to a new level. Trout from a nearby stream and roasted rosemary fingerling potatoes put our Reykjavik meals to shame. The valley of Heydalur was vast and spotty with snow,making it necessary to hunt in order to string together a ski tour. In the end, we skinned up a frozen river canyon behind the farm. Bangsi sweetly ambled along behind us for most of it but decided to bail when the going got too steep. The descent involved questionably thin coverage, which invoked some Homer Simpson-esque “DOH” moments skiing over rocks. We soaked in the natural hotspring for the remainder of the afternoon, enjoyed traditional lamb stew for dinner and mentally prepared ourselves for the long journey back to Reykjavik the next day. The highlight of our drive out of the West Fjords was a stop at SALTVERK - a hand-harvested sustainable sea salt company. Located in the remote West Fjords, visiting the factory and the allure of taste testing is a great reason to visit in person- not just buying off Amazon (Shh yes, technically you don’t have to travel to Iceland for this). We grabbed a few of the Arctic Thyme, Birch Smoked, Lava and Licorice and like any normal person, wondered how they would taste on ice cream. In my mind, the more remote the better when it comes to travel . Not just in a physical-landscape sort of way, although that doesn’t hurt but as a premise of things to seek out. It’s much more rewarding to find the underbelly of the city, mosey down the alleyways, run up the mountain instead of walk…you get my drift. By using backcountry skiing as our catalyst, we drove to corners we never would have otherwise, ate the best damn beer bread in the country and found the ski stoke that brought us there in the first place."

Paddy Hegarty from Lahardane kindly showed me through his land after his two well-trained sheepdogs alerted him to the trespasser coming up through his farm from the main road, exactly like the internet said he would. Paddy lived in England all his life but his untouched Mayo accent and effortless knowledge of the local area makes it sound like he hadn’t so much left to cheer the footballers on in Croke Park the odd summer’s weekend. He told me his brother had built the pillar marking the summit by making the ascent up with sand, water and cement back in 1958. A pony had carried a load for him every day for two weeks. One day they went up twice, and the brother would have gone more often but the ould pony hadn’t been quite able for it. I told him I was going to try and run up it. He wished me well after giving me detailed instructions — too detailed for me to follow to be honest — about how to get through his land, avoid the boggy patches, and mind the fences before getting to the approach to the south side. I figured I’d find the mountain anyway, and I’d be sure to mind the fences of course. I was out this Sunday morning to get a bit of training in for the Nephin Up and Over Challenge coming up the following weekend. I only realised on the way up after availing of Paddy’s hospitality that instead of googling ‘How to Climb Nephin’ I probably should have looked up the actual race route, as I was fairly sure this wasn’t it. The ascent was steep, any attempts to ‘run’ ended quickly even when I tried to traverse up and across the face. The ground was boggy and uneven, some rocks but mostly covered in heather, and it was better to hike at a solid pace than risk serious injury and waste aimless energy over. I figured the pitch of the race route must be more forgiving for going up at a pace faster than walking. I was conscious of the winning time from last year — an hour and 23 minutes — which was some feat considering it included an up and down of the mountain and a 10km road run spanning either side of the climb. I stopped worrying about speed and decided to just enjoy the day for what it was, slowing down and turning more frequently to enjoy the stunning views. A beautiful, spring morning, it was fresh but the sun screamed when it emerged from the layers of clouds drifting overhead. The mountain and surrounding valleys and plains were bathed in dazzling light; the horizons were swallowed by a haze that gave the quality of a stifling late-summer’s evening. In reality it was colder than it looked, but the sun made the air warmer than it should have been. As I approached the top, some stubborn sheets of snow still lay on the ground, refusing summer and reflecting the sun’s rays. I reached the top and Paddy Hegarty’s brother’s pillar in an hour. I had the fortune to meet a hiker from Crossmolina who knew the area well enough, and he was able to orientate my view from the peak, which I realised was hopelessly inaccurate. He was familiar with the race and showed me the route, which didn’t look any easier than the steep ascent I’d made myself. “It’s on the way down those lads win these things — no regard for their own safety” was his bit of insider info. I assured him I wouldn’t be winning the race in that case and that “it’d be a nice day out on the hill at least.” We talked about how Nephin is getting more popular, but Westport and the surrounding mountainous coastal area of south-west Mayo “gets all the attention.” “Nobody knows this part of the world exists” he said, sounding more rueful than proud. He’s a local not a hipster. Whether looking at it on a map, driving through, or marvelling at it from above, North Mayo is a remote place. It is barren, a patchwork of scorched-earth bogs and lonely houses dotted around a forgotten place. We might be close to the nearest Spar shop here, but the rolling hills and sparse farmland just tell the soul of the relative isolation. Paddy doesn’t live in the cottage he keeps at the foot of the hill — he tells me of incidents of rural crime on lonely householders and farmers which make it too dangerous these days to live so far from civilisation, so he lives in Lahardane village a few miles away. My tour guide at the top points out which towns and compass points lie in which directions from the top, and I nod along pretending “Oh I knew that”. I promise myself I’ll make it my business to learn more of the geography of my home county in the coming weeks and months. The strange haze prevents us from seeing all the way to the Reek on one side, to Donegal facing north. Most of Mayo itself must be visible from here on a clear day, a perch fit for a king. It starts to get chilly before long and I realise visibility has dropped slightly, reminding me that even on a beautiful day you can never be too sure that it won’t change. I jog back down the flat ridge and for a few minutes enjoy the exhilarating feeling of flying that running over hills provides. Once I get to the steeper part I have to be careful, such that when I meet Paddy again at his cottage at the bottom, I haven’t come down much quicker than I got up. Paddy has the sharp intuition of a man who knows the land, and of course he was able to watch my route up the hill as he was out checking on his sheep. It would have been easier if I’d kept to the left and gone up the crest, he tells me, but he assures me I did it “quick enough all the same”. We talk a bit about Mayo football and getting lost in the fog climbing mountains. He tells me about a Lithuanian guy who came into his farm the same as me one day when visibility was bad. He had climbed the mountain and managed to get down again, but now was lost and didn’t know where his car was. Paddy told him to hop in the car and drove him around the base of the mountain to find it. They eventually came across it hidden away up in a spot that even locals wouldn’t have ventured to much. He wouldn’t have ever found the car if Paddy hadn’t brought him looking for it. He knows a bit about the race next week, and gives me a bit of info on the top competition. “I know the guy who won it last year” he tells me. “He goes up and over every day of the week, works as a physio. Super fit.” Another local racer, in his 60’s, “does a full loop of bottom of the hill every morning.” The times they’ve clocked are ridiculous, about half of what I expect to do after today’s tester. Like the last guy I tell him I’ll just enjoy the chance to get up the hill again. I tell myself that winning’s not important. For me it’s all about the feeling of flying. I’ve learned the joys of running as a means of travel, of how working yourself into a sweaty and muddy state allows you to really explore the environment in a truly immersive way, making you more one with the natural world. I don’t tell Paddy that, but I’m sure he knows well enough in his own way all the same. When I get back to the car, they’re chatting on the radio about rural depopulation and how it’s affecting the GAA. Looking around you here, you’d think “No shit.” But ironically places like Mayo, Kerry and Donegal are in better footballing health than most parts of the country. Maybe no-one knows this part of the world exists, but it means a lot to the ones who do."
Medium.com,Life,A Visit through Post-War Vietnam,Travel,https://medium.com/@ambrune/a-visit-through-post-war-vietnam-220d24a6d83c?source=topic_page---------707------------------1," Whether profiteering or pride, Vietnam can’t get enough of its revolution. Neither can Western tourists. Núi Bà Đen. Tây Ninh. Phu-Loi. Củ Chi. These were the names of places I had heard over and over growing up, but had little meaning to me. I knew these villages existed in Vietnam — the country invoked in the 1980s whenever Americans wanted to pontificate about either American patriotism or American imperialism. And I knew that my father had served in the Vietnam War in the early 1970s. Other than that, meh. I had better things to do — friends to make, tennis to play, colleges to which I needed to apply. But as I entered my late 30s and early 40s, and began to identify my father as more of a persona and less of a parent, I began to wonder what he was like as a younger man. Nearly 35 years later, when the opportunity to visit Japan arose, I suggested a seven-day detour to Vietnam. Dad went for it, and before three months elapsed, I was standing in a long, winding and seemingly never-ending queue of Americans, Canadians and French nationals while waiting for my visa approval at the very same place my father landed some 49 years ago: Tan Son Nhut International Airport. To me, Tan Son Nhut looked like any other extremely busy airport in a developing country; to my father, it was unrecognizable from the U.S./Republic of Vietnam Air Force (VNAF) air base where he landed for official duty in the fall of 1970. I came to Vietnam with a basic education about my father, but I didn’t really “know” him. Dad had always been bookish, formal, inclined toward intellectualization and wary of wading into personal waters — ponds or other. When it came to Dad’s experience in Vietnam, he proved a lesson in contradiction. As Dad talked of the Vietnam War with friends or fellow veterans, he would sometimes puff out his chest like a marine (although he was Army), deepen his voice and refer to lessons taught to him by Colonel So-and-So or Captain What’s-His-Name. But his second wife actually found the combat medals he won in an old cigar box stuffed deep in his closet; she was the one to have them framed for him, along with a photograph: my fresh-faced father with a full pompadour, speaking into a radio transmitter — slightly feigned for effect. Dad had still always delved into any book, play, or movie about the Vietnam War that he came across. He felt Apocalypse Now was a bit over the top for his pre-adolescent children, but I do recall falling asleep on the couch while he watched The Deer Hunter on VHS. It’s general family lore that in 1968, my father was enrolled in the University of Iowa Writers Workshop, where he was studying poetry just about the time that U.S. President Lyndon Johnson decided to lift educational deferments for the draft. This threw him. He had the course of his life set: English professor, marriage to his high school sweetheart, gentleman farmer, maybe a published author. But when faced with the choice of boarding that bus for basic training in Fort Polk, Louisiana or running off to Canada, my father “accepted a calling his country made and got on with it.” He enlisted and then, because he had a college degree, transferred to Officer Candidate School at Fort Benning, Georgia. This way, he could better control the outcome of his Vietnam experience. Or so he thought. “Vietnam changed everything,” my 73-year-old father said in a van from Ho Chi Minh City to Tây Ninh, on the border of Cambodia. To begin with, Dad met my mother at an Officers Club dance at Fort Knox, Kentucky — they married in three months — just before he deployed. When he returned, he finished his English degree, moved to Oklahoma for law school and became a respected attorney in Tulsa. Facts I did not previously know, I would only learn as two of us were on the way to Núi Bà Đen — the “‘Black Virgin Mountain” — a former U.S. Army Signal Corps base where he was stationed in 1970. His job: call out orders and protect the ridge line. That meant keeping all the Viet Cong tunneled deep inside the butte away from all the expensive equipment the U.S. used to signal the time and place for an artillery battery of men — or a napalm bomb strike. Dad also performed other administrative tasks, normal day-to-day stuff, except armed with a M-60. He rode a helicopter to distribute paychecks, official letters and other dispatches to the troops. He made sure the Vietnamese nationals who served as cooks and cleaners at Núi Bà Đen and Phu-Loi were transported to and from work, sometimes picking up soldiers who spent the night in their villages. And he ventured on occasion to Tây Ninh, the nearest town, on behalf of the colonel in command. “We were on a road just like this one,” he told me as we drove by rice fields through disheveled villages — some lined with “dollar” homes built with money from U.S. refugees. “We saw something rustling. My driver hit the gas and we turned around to see the Viet Cong walking off.” He meant to imply that the Viet Cong had missed their target — Dad’s jeep — by about two seconds. I never thought of my father as particularly heroic for being a Vietnam veteran. Neither, did he, it seems. But as I watched my father interact with the dozens of sites and people we would visit over the following week, my perception of him evolved. No, Dad wasn’t shot down and imprisoned in the Hanoi Hilton and he wasn’t attacked in the Mekong Delta with nowhere to go aside from the waters beset with snakes and crocodiles. He accepted a job he did not want, in a war he felt was misconceived and risked his life to thwart four American presidents’ fear of encroaching Communism. He did it quietly and without fuss, defending his signal base at Núi Bà Đen from advancing Viet Cong during a particularly bad firefight one night in the summer of 1971. When the Colonel he served awarded him a Bronze Star and offered to promote him to Captain if he signed up for full-time military, Dad declined. He sold his dress blues when he returned to campus and just “got on with it”: law school, a family of three children, divorce, some losses, some tragedies and well, life. After our trip, however, I believed Dad heroic for going back to Vietnam — for seeing for himself the flaws of American exceptionalism and the war itself; for speaking with, extensively, the sons and daughters of North Vietnamese and Viet Cong fighters to hear their perspectives; and for witnessing the fierceness of Vietnam’s right to independence, and even vocally supporting that. A lot of Vietnam veterans take this trip; the majority do not. It’s much easier to allow politicians to wrap up their service in adjectives of patriotism and allegiance of than to take a hard look at the thorny paths of the complicity and ideology of the past, especially regrettable ones. Still, I kept eyeing Dad for something, some totally irrational, a-ha moment, blaze of glory scene that would summarize the reasons we came 5,000 miles for this. Friends who had their preconceived notions about what a ‘special’ and ‘life-changing’ trip this would be didn’t help. I wanted to visit a Saigon nightclub, where a lounge singer had chased down my Dad on a sultry R&R weekend. I wanted stories of Army pals with whom he shared poems and pot before these comrades in arms went off to fight. I wanted pictures of Dad kneeling at the spot where he rescued a fellow soldier — or maybe a mother and child — from advancing danger. But just like Vietnam’s government and economy, Dad had moved on. My only satisfaction came just after we entered the gates of the Núi Bà Đen gondola park, built in 1980 when the country began to reopen to the rest of the world. After paying our entrance fee, taking photos by the rows of peonies that spelled out “NUI BA DINH” and getting whisked by golf cart to the cable car that would take us over the jungle treetops to the top, we stopped at the Linh Sơn Thiên Thạch pagoda dedicated to Bà Đen, who, according to legend, threw herself off a mountain — after she was raped and with child — as punishment for betraying her commitment to Buddhist celibacy. Finally, the prodigious moment: Dad did a 360-degree spin, looked around and loudly said, “Now this, THIS is TOTALLY weird.”"

Medium.com,Life,Shanghai West: The Station You Didn’t Know Existed in China’s Most Populous City,Travel,https://medium.com/ticket-gate-19/shanghai-west-the-station-you-didnt-know-existed-in-china-s-most-populous-city-7822798f6e58?source=topic_page---------709------------------1," Ticket A61 | 16 August 2019 The irritatingly-cliché Oriental Pearl Tower, along with much of Lokatsy/Lujiazui, is what we come to associate with Shanghai. Shanghai is supposed to be a mega-huge city, this being home to China’s most populous settlement. (The city’s HSR megahub, Hongqiao, shows every sign of this.) Shanghai at present has Shanghai Main (formerly close to a now-no-longer-extant Shanghai North), Shanghai South, Shanghai Hongqiao, and Shanghai East (never heard of that?… It’s a new station not far from Pudong Airport, to be reality soon!). To most of us, Hongqiao and South are colossal enough (Hongqiao is both busy and colossal)… and so we forget about Shanghai West, a 5-platform station that is the Bielefeld-ish station to ala Zanghae-nin… simply because it’s hardly “in existance”. The station is so little league, it misses out on some otherwise very mainstream features — such as not offering ticket rebook or refund services. (So let’s hope your lost ticket didn’t prescribe Shanghai West as the station where you get off, because to get your ticket back, you’ll probably need to refund it in the first place!) Yet for a station that’s virtually unknown to many, its concourse says otherwise. (In early 2011, I was stupid enough to lose an iDevice at Shanghai Main as I was actually about to head to Shanghai West on a short sprinter service! Rail police who registered my loss were taken aback at how much I know about the railways — 18 rail regions (rail bureaus back then), and even with the former name of Shanghai West station well etched in my mind — it was formerly known as Zhenru (真如), the name of the nearby mostly-residential region!) Shanghai West got its long-awaited improvement in 2010, just in time for 300 km/h services to start between Shanghai and Nanjing. The station is extremely quiet, yet features a three-line interchange on the Shanghai Metro network. Right now, Line 11 is already there; the 15 and 20 are coming later on. (By quiet, I mean right now, there are no train services between 10:34 and 13:09 — super-long for a city station!) Shanghai West has exclusviely “G”, or National High Speed, HSR trains, with about half of these one-stop sprinters over just 5 km to Shanghai main station. Five of these are the new Revival Express trains. The longest services run for over 500 km to Anqing, even further west (southwest, also) of Nanjing. Closing out our look at Shanghai West, it’s probably most apt here to talk about the train you’ve just seen zip by the station. That blue/white/black double-decker is actually a double-decker sleeper train on the high speed network! (Beds there are to either side of the aisle, rather than making everyone sleep in their own compartment.) These trains are extremely rare in China (right now) — so if you see one, CAMERA OUT — SNAP AWAY!… (PS: Classic Rail has double-decker sleepers as well, although they function a little differently…) Hopefully, we will now have had more readers now aware of Shanghai West — than there are of those new double-decker sleeper trains in China…!"

Medium.com,Life,How to Make Long-Term Travel Your Reality,Travel,https://medium.com/swlh/how-to-make-long-term-travel-your-reality-2feef0856b54?source=topic_page---------713------------------1," You have the hotels booked, the plane tickets are in order, and you’re off-task at work, preferring to gaze at pictures of your destination instead of filling out Excel sheets. There’s nothing quite like looking forward to vacation. But the escape flashes past us in an instant and, before we know it, we’re back in the office chair. Back to reality. But what if, instead of escaping reality, you decided to change your reality? It can take some planning and preparation, but it’s possible. You can live the dream of long-term travel. Your first objection might be that it’s too expensive. However, living abroad can actually be much cheaper than your standard routine at home. You can easily end up paying $2,000 a month for a studio apartment in Los Angeles. On the other hand, in Manizales, Colombia, you can rent an apartment of similar quality for about $500 per month, utilities and internet included. Food is cheaper. Transportation is cheaper. Everything is cheaper. You can also save money by simplifying your life. In Vagabonding, Rolf Potts offers three main strategies for reducing your life to the essentials: While society and marketing may tell you that you need more to be happy, try experimenting with a minimalist lifestyle. It’s amazing to find out how little you really need to be content. The more you have, the more you have to lose. Simplifying your life can bring happiness and tranquility. Thoreau said: “My greatest skill has been to want little.” Less is more. When planning your new reality, don’t try to obsessively predetermine every activity. Some of the best experiences happen by chance. There are some things you just can’t plan. Try not to buy transportation or non-refundable lodging too far in advance. Otherwise, situations might come up where you end up changing your plans and wasting money you’ve already spent. You’ll get tips from locals and other travelers about cool places to go, and you should allow yourself the flexibility to adjust course. Buying long flights ahead of time is usually cost-effective, but train and bus tickets can be purchased the day before (or at the station) at the same price as booking ahead. Try to strike a balance between planning and serendipity. One of the most rewarding aspects of traveling is meeting the local people. Put yourself out there and allow for some genuine human interaction. While in Cali, Colombia, I was sitting in a park when some Hare Krishna followers started chanting nearby. I was intrigued. Eventually, they came over and I decided to get up and join the circle. I ended up going to their temple and taking part in a ceremony with them, which was followed by a nine-year-old’s birthday party. It was quite the experience. Talking to local people teaches you about their culture more than sightseeing ever could. It’s fascinating to uncover similarities and differences between cultures. We’re all different, but we’re all the same. If you’re used to a 10-day vacation, then embarking on long-term travel will require a different mindset. You’ll have the opportunity (and the requirement) to slow down. While taking a whole day to do nothing but reading might seem wasteful on a five-day stint in the Andes, it may be a necessary rest day on a long-term journey. Your body will need recovery days just like you would need while living back home. Your mindset about partying may also require a shifted paradigm. It’s common for young travelers to go out drinking almost every night of vacation. Better pack in as much fun as possible! However, on longer trips, the pressure for constant excitement decreases. Taking it easy every once in a while can be a lot more enjoyable (and healthier). You will likely want to add variety to your travels. If you have been staying in cities for a few weeks, consider going to the countryside or doing a trek. If you have been solo for a while, link up with a fellow traveler and share some experiences. Just because you are in a different country doesn’t mean you won’t get bored. Experiment with learning a new skill. Try taking classes and learning the language of the country you’re visiting. It can give you a sense of purpose. An important part of long-term travel is making sure you stay healthy. A big factor is getting enough sleep. Your body is much better at fighting off infections when you are well-rested. Other precautions include pre-trip vaccines, bringing antibiotics, and using sunscreen and bug spray (if there are mosquito-borne diseases in the area). When it comes to food, consider drinking only bottled water unless you’re 100% sure that the tap water is fine to drink. This also includes ice, which is likely made from unfiltered water. If you want to be super safe, brush your teeth with bottled water too. Stay away from foods that cannot be cooked or peeled. For example, a banana or an orange is fine, but you might want to avoid a salad. You can’t be sure whether it was washed with clean water. Consider bringing a small reserve of food with you wherever you go, just in case. Nuts and fruit are a go-to option for many travelers. Long-term travel has the ability to stimulate your mind and help you grow. Everyday situations (like grocery shopping or buying a bus ticket) turn into exciting adventures. When I was recently in Brazil, I ordered two portions of rice and beans in Brazil, which the person serving the food apparently thought was a mistake. The resulting choreography of hand gestures and smiles was quite entertaining. I eventually got my food. 99% of the people you meet will be lovely, helpful people who will go out of their way to make you feel welcome. Take advantage of the opportunity to immerse yourself in a new community. “ Vagabonding is about looking for adventure in normal life, and normal life within adventure.” — Rolf Potts You have the ability to fuse your dreams with your reality — it’s within your reach. Once you believe that long-term travel is possible, you open up new opportunities for personal growth. Seeing the world helps you see yourself in a new light. Begin your quest, get out there, and start meeting your neighbors across the world. You won’t regret it."

Medium.com,Life,Paradise in Sweden: a Young British Expat’s View,Travel,https://medium.com/@estherlawton/paradise-in-sweden-a-young-british-expats-view-f52ad95ef957?source=topic_page---------716------------------1," Me and my husband Joe lived in England before an opportunity arose that changed our lives: Joe was offered a job in Sweden. Beaten down by the stress of trying to make ends meet as working twenty-somethings in London’s commuter belt, we took the bait and moved to Linköping, South Sweden, in early 2016. It’s not just pine forests and freshwater lakes that make this Scandi paradise a healing land, but the fact that you can live a good life without always being broke and off-your-head busy. Without an increase in Joe’s salary, we were instantly better off and living in a flat three times bigger than our last, and all without me earning a krona. With higher food costs and taxes, we didn’t need to look far to find out how… Rent is regulated, ever kept in line with real term local wage rises, so, for the last two tax years, we have enjoyed a 0.6% rent increase. Included in our rent are council tax, water and heating. So we’re only paying bills for internet and electricity. Public transport is great. We no longer grow hot around the collar with train cancellation after cancellation, or buses just refusing to turn up. Car-pooling is super popular and affordable. All of this means that in a city there’s no need for us to own a car, let alone two. Worker’s rights are office furniture. There’s no such thing as the hallowed martyr working late or through a lunch break. Workers are paid for their time. End of discussion. Such a thing as government-enforced travel pay exists and increases the further Joe flies. Minimum wage is high. Access to health care benefits and parental leave is unrivalled. 25 statutory paid holiday days are Joe’s, plus an abundant 9 plus public holidays, depending on the calendar. Sound infrastructure means excellent public services. A doctor sat with us both for an hour — separately. The roads and what lies beneath them are regularly maintained. Bike lanes are everywhere. The library feels more like a polyglot university and architectural masterpiece combined than a library. And everywhere we look is clean. Walking around our local residential area we can’t miss the filled children’s sandpits that are openly available and safe, the used and looked-after public barbecues, and the plentiful, well-kept green spaces. Within eighteen months of moving, we had travelled to Denmark, Finland, Croatia, the UK and around Sweden — all for fun. Add another 2 years and we can jot Israel, China, Germany and Italy on the list too. I’ve been able to chase a dream and write a novel, get employment as an English teacher, and we’ve saved more than ever before. We could never have afforded this life in the UK. Plus, our mental and physical health is recovering well, and our relationship is better than ever. All we did was move, which changed lots of little things, which then transformed our lives. If the primary language in Sweden was English, I’m certain the country would be bursting, and we wouldn’t have enjoyed the same experience. But, in reality, it’s fourteen times less densely populated than the UK. Swedish is a beautiful language and, amongst a few other things, the secret to Sweden’s success. Swedes help me learn it too. There are regular free language cafes run by churches and local organisations. The government runs free, comprehensive courses for newcomers and others wishing to study the language, and, in the meantime, Swedes indulge you with their stunning English skills. There are many more things I could tell you, like how one midsummer we stayed on a mini island and spent hours swimming, rowing and partying with friendly strangers under a sun that barely went down; or how when we got the wrong train from a spa hotel we had virtually to ourselves (the officer gave us free tea and saw us onto the right train instead of charging us fines or for another ticket); and also the vast difference in air quality between Sweden and the UK … but then I’d be broadcasting the country’s successes, and this would be, by definition, not very Swedish."
Medium.com,Life,36 Hours in Moscow,Travel,https://medium.com/@thelifeweknow/36-hours-in-moscow-51346ead0b20?source=topic_page---------717------------------1," Having spent my formative years in Paris, I know what Moscow is going for. Ornate Art Deco lamps are never far from your bistro-terrace post. But for all its European yearn, this city just isn’t. And that’s fine. We saw it in a blur, and stuck to the 7th arrondissement equivalent: posh, slow, and never too far from an impressive national treasure. Decades of movies and news coverage couldn’t prepare me for what lay ahead now, peeking its meringue hat over the horizon as we ascended cobblestones towards Red Square. Saint Basil’s Cathedral stood proud, smaller than my mind had created it; a Disneyland cupcake with swirling golden streamers tumbling down hot brick walls of Airforce Blue and mustard gold. I couldn’t take my eyes off. The food here is exceptional. On Tuesday we broke fast in a grand Imperial ballroom complete with central marble-gold fountain and a hand-painted glass ceiling that coloured the sun as she streamed in on plates of steaming blinis and salmon caviar. Despite opting for the buffet option, an eager-to-please Kirov fetched top-ups of champagne mimosas. Perhaps he was just encouraging our departure as the harpist covered her instrument with a red velvet slip for the day, her job already done by 10am. Of course no visit to Russia would be complete without sampling the Stroganoff, which is exactly what I opted for at the city’s formidable Russian cuisine stalwart Café Pushkin. We washed down our choices with horseradish vodka and cranberry juice, a combo copied from the rotund gentlemen on a nearby table that I suspect is popular for flushing away more than just food or a long day. In just two days we learned that Russian stoicism is alive and well, but that smiles lurk beneath. We learned that Moscow is scarred from its politics (just visit a supermarket) but proud as hell too. We learned of a strange parallel between Britain and Russia: both having commanded vast and important empires, now struggling to make sense of a new world order. I learned I like vodka and watermelon juice, and that even the Kremlin has hamburger stands for hungry tourists. Two days was enough, and as we sat on a lone bench bending under the weight of our bags and bodies waiting for the long-distance 003 to roll in at Yaroslavskaya station I felt ready to leave the whirlwind I’d just witnessed. Moscow, you were special. I can’t wait for Siberia."
Medium.com,Life,When in Rome,Travel,https://medium.com/@srividyabhaskar/when-in-rome-47c767173f31?source=topic_page---------718------------------1," Departing Copenhagen on Saturday morning, our flight veered close to the edge of the sea. The sun shone, and with sheer excitement, I made my way. What did I find? A city to fall in love with, a city that is iconic and everything in between. But what stuck with me the most, were random thoughts walking through the streets of Rome (and believe me, walk we did, 35 kilometres to be exact), which I’ve managed to collect here. First things first, the birds of Rome are not afraid. They’re almost as accustomed to tourists as the hopeful taxi drivers waiting at the airport, with their ‘Scusi, where are you going? I can take you there, it’s cheaper than whatever you were thinking of, I promise!’ My guess is that when it comes to picking bread crumbs, the glorious Italian food that these birds anticipate emboldens them. Pigeon-pecks on foot, and posing seagulls are definitely an interesting Roman musing, and I will admit, an Instagrammable one too. On a more serious note, the city feels old, quaint charming but also fast and modern — a paradox best seen by nuns walking in groups, all deep in prayer, mere streets away from graffiti on funky neighborhoods and even a new age take of the Pope. The streets are deserted on Sunday, with a quiet calm, and for a minute, you almost believe that you might be a lone tourist. And suddenly behind a corner, you will find throngs of people queued up to enter the Vatican City, or grab a slice of pizza from that one cafe that Lonely Planet endorses. Tourists mill around, the locals swat them like flies and keep moving.
The cars and Vespa riders snake their way through traffic, pedestrians, whatever have you, in a constant flux. The city goes on, sirens wail right through the ruins, forging a future stacked on ancient history. The Roman Empire stands guard, in the form of ruins and relics while people go about their business, paying no heed to the wonders of the world that surround them. Culture embeds much of daily life — in the names, the mannerisms, in small details of the quotidian…a quiet and filled to the brim book store — paintings, post cards, cozy streets. Sonorous priests preach the good word inside gorgeous churches. Devotees nod and sing fervently, kneeling on the pews. Ghettos, signs proclaiming “refugees welcome“, an international melting pot, with people that look different, speak different languages, all in a city that’s charged with protecting history and wisdom of the old world. The eternal city, it is indeed. The streets are enchanting, cobble stoned streets with overpowering history.
Mysterious doors, proud trees, harbouring secrets and stories that beg to be told. The sound of water, wild rivers cascading through the night, broken bridges sporting gargoyles. Fountains, with a melody that refreshes you constantly. Welcoming cafes, aperitif glasses gleaming in the sun. Old people waking dogs, small children dressed for the Carnevale, playing while scattering coloured paper and glitter on squares. A garden of pine cones, locals enjoying a sunny day, lovers holding hands. Smiling, coming together as if to say, ‘Come, this is Rome, this is where the old world meets the new’"

It was sandy and unapologetically barren. And yet, here I was on a bicycle, hauling a heavy trailer across the middle of the continent with a stranger I’d met on Instagram a week prior. Boy, was I was hating it."

We were watching her from an overpass above. We were 17 and 19, and we had just walked out of Los Angeles International Airport. We had worked the first part of the summer to afford this first ever trip on our own — a three-week odyssey up the coast of hippie California. But there was no allowance in the budget for taxis out of airports, so we walked out. Suitcases in hand, we crossed over Sepulveda toward Century Boulevard, and we looked down from the overpass. And we saw her: Ann-Margaret strutting down the street just outside LAX the very hour we arrived. Hooray for Hollywood. Of course, there were cameras on cranes gliding down the street beside her, filming her. That was Hollywood, too. A fine, magical welcome it was. Not that we two teenage hippies were very much fans of Ann-Margaret, beyond the obvious. We hadn’t traveled from our New York, East Village hangouts all the way to California — “promised land of my people” I would call it that fall in a senior-year creative writing class essay — to ogle the last gasp of old-line Hollywood’s old-time sex-kittenness. We had come on a pilgrimage, to see the Sunset Strip, the Pacific Coast Highway, Santa Barbara, Big Sur, Berkeley, Haight-Ashbury, Golden Gate Park. We were just getting started. In those days, my name was Arnie. My friend, the older of we two, was also named Arnie. We were two Arnies, and we arrived in Los Angeles the first week of August 1969, a month in which the world would famously contradict itself. The world, it must be said, contradicts itself all the time, every day, even every moment — consider the oscillations of the sub-atomic neutral B meson particle, for instance — but not always so noticeably, and even when it shouts for our attention, to please themselves, people tend to choose what they wish to hear, and, even then, remember. So people picked and chose, it was all a fearful muddle in the Age of Aquarius, and by August of 1969, Joan Didion had lost the thread of the story. Arnie and I, keenly attuned in more adolescent fashion to the tenor of the times, had traveled from one coast to the other to hear Blind Faith sing “Can’t Find My Way Home,” a not uncommon way for a seventeen-year-old already to feel, but made more disorienting by the cultural as well as personal wandering. We crashed that first California night in Richard Nixon’s ultra-conservative Orange County, home of his San Clemente “West Coast White House,” in a backyard of teens in transit. While the resident mom and dad went to Sunday church in the morning, Arnie and I set out on eight hours of trying to hitch a ride back out of that sun-blanched anti-hippie hell and north again. We managed finally, absent cell phone and GPS, to meet up with my older brother, Jeff, 22, already in the Golden State on his own, better financed odyssey of California-girls fornication up the coast. Jeff had taken a motel room right in the middle of the action, a room that opened directly on the Sunset Strip. Arnie and I shared the second bed. The Sunset Strip in 1969, it must be recalled or told, was a cross between a Silk Road bazaar and the canteen in Star Wars. Freaks abounded, flags flying, their foreignness of intention hanging between every familiar transaction. The freaks hung on corners, roamed the streets, crossed them back and forth. They were dirty freaks, homeless freaks, drug dealing freaks, and deal making freaks, with sleek, rock-club scene-making freaks among them, the wandering of spirit and the beautiful of body, male and female alike, adorning the storefronts and bejeweled in their exotic selfhood. Amidst them all, fiery and concentrated, the full-throated Arthur Blessitt pronounced the word of God and hailed the return of the Lord to any who would listen and even those who didn’t. Arnie (the other Arnie) debated theology with the aspiring savior of souls. This Arnie, shoeless and shirtless but for the long Mexican vest I wore like a uniform beneath the long hair and the crab-grass beard I was trying to grow, was ticketed by the LAPD for vagrancy. I made a certain impression. The world was making daily impressions on me. I tried to make one back. It was a lie. I was an insecure teen-aged boy, hungry for experience and afraid of the world, and the world was spinning out of control all around me. Joan Didion felt it too. It was in the air. Deliverance and danger dancing together. By that time, Arnie and I had been acid heads for about a year. We loved our LSD. But since everything was already speeded up with age by then, older brother Jeff had not yet himself dropped acid. He was doing downers. One night, Arnie and I already in bed asleep, Jeff stumbled off the street into the room and took down the lamp reaching for the air. Later, in the very early morning hours, back to sleep, and the memories of the previous phantasmagorical Saturday night still shaping our dreams, we woke again to a man roaming up and down the Strip screaming, so everyone, including he himself, could know, “I’m not crazy! I’m not crazy!” Daylight come, and the three young residents of a motel room on the Sunset Strip risen at last, Arnie and I ventured out on the street to retrieve that day’s Los Angeles Times from a corner vending machine. We saw at once, standing in the metaphorical shadow of the Hollywood Hills, the right-side headline: “Ritualistic Killings: Sharon Tate, Four Others Murdered.” It would be some time before the killers’ identities would be known, and more murders would follow, but that such events had occurred seemed unsurprising, if unsettling. After all, “Rape, murder” was “just a shot away,” the devil-channeling Rolling Stones would tell us on Let It Bleed just months later. But the bitter, piggish street slang for police mixed in with the name of a Beatles song, written in human blood? Helter skelter? Yeah, it was. I chose at the time to look like a hippie because one of the ways you become something, whatever it is, is to appear like what you want to be. Every dress for successor knows that. People of all ages try to look like some internalized image of themselves, though teens of every generation do it with a special poignancy. By 1969, the naivete of this notion, and the look it produced in nonconformist uniformity (and the cynicism driving its commercial capitalization) had devolved, in actuality, into people from ages 15 to nearly 50 needing to be instructed daily, as if it was the delivered wisdom of the counterculture, in the lessons of elementary school. Don’t break into concert venues without paying for the ticket, stage managers would implore. (Don’t break into concert venues.) Don’t charge the stage. Don’t spike people’s Boone’s Farm and Wild Turkey with unknown drugs they don’t know they’re taking. (It’s not cool.) Don’t cheat people with pot look alikes that aren’t pot. (Really not cool.) Treat people, yeah, the way you want to be treated yourself. What a revolution, got to revolution. And that long-haired, bearded guy at the party who looks like one serious kind of wild hippie freak — man, he’s got a far out rap — may not be about peace and love like you at all. He might be a hitter. He might be Charles Manson. Shit, he was. But Arnie and I were kids. There were kids all around us, many of them actually kids, and though we were freaked out, the whole world, in truth, was freaked out, everywhere you looked, and we had lives to live and adventures to pursue, and a next stop in Santa Barbara, on the way north, to see Blind Faith. On the morning of August 16, 1969, then, with Woodstock underway back in our home New York environs, Jeff drove his younger brother and his younger brother’s best friend to the Pacific Ocean, to the intersection of Chautauqua Boulevard and Pacific Coast Highway in Santa Monica to begin hitch hiking their way northward. We would meet again in Berkeley at the far end. Arnie and I held out our thumbs. If the Sunset Strip was like a Silk Road bazaar, the PCH was like the Silk Road itself. Beside an ocean of sun-speckled waters, along a mountainous winding coast, within a delirium of salt sea air, young people were traveling up and down the highway amid an endless train of cars, like donkeys crossing the mountain passes of Persia. If they weren’t carrying the wares of cultural exchange, they bore instead the wonders of cultural change, and yes, it was a wondrous time to be alive, to be young and free and on the road to somewhere, including the rest of your life. A station wagon stopped, already filled with teens. But there was always room for more. We piled in. A joint was passed around and the music pumped up as the coast sped under our wheels. The first song was from the Rolling Stones’ psychedelic Their Satanic Majesty’s Request album. “Why don’t we sing this song all together,” the Stones, and we, sang: Open our heads let the pictures come And if we close all our eyes together Then we will see where we all come from"
Medium.com,Life,L’Esprit des Flâneurs,Travel,https://medium.com/@gavinbrennan/lesprit-des-fl%C3%A2neurs-d733e7585145?source=topic_page---------721------------------1," I’ve just moved back to Dublin. I’m inspired by the flâneurs of 19th century Paris to combine my love of running with my love of travelling to get out and run around my old new home with no goal other than to see what’s really out there. Les flâneurs “In the pedestrian, the wanderer, the rambler, the flâneur, can be found the soul of the idler. The pedestrian is the highest and most mighty of beings; he walks for pleasure, he observes but does not interfere, he is not in a hurry, he is happy in the company of his own mind, he wanders detached, wise and merry, godlike. He is free.” - Tom Hodgkinson, How to be Idle Flâneur (ou flâneuse)– “a man (or woman) who saunters around observing society.” Flâneur is an old French word meaning something like to stroll, to saunter, to amble or to generally arse about town with no greater purpose than to watch the world go by. The flâneur sees their slow journey through the city as its own reward, a riposte to those who see busyness for its own sake as a virtue. The original flâneur was the writer Charles Baudelaire, whose poetry and passion for wandering about 19th century Paris helped re-brand the term from connoting someone to be a time-waster or general layabout to something grander: a person of leisure, an idler, an urban explorer — a connoisseur of the street. The flâneur is the hero of the idle-at-heart — someone who saunters through life with no deadlines or goals or seemingly purpose. They walk for its own sake, they observe but don’t interfere. They are meditators and bon-vivants; they have no masters and achieve a form of transcendence simply by walking and basking in the world in all its glory. No commuter nor errand-runner, and certainly not a career or hobby shopper, the flâneur seeks to enjoy life at his own pace, and to experience the full richness of life in the city. Main streets provide a wealth of life and sensory indulgence, for sure, but the flâneuse also appreciates and seeks out the side streets, the back alleys, the cul de sacs, for they are full of people and life and hopes and dreams and stories too. The flâneur wishes to observe life as it is — not to interfere with it. But being a flâneur or an idler is not about being lazy or trying to get by doing as little as possible. Rather, it’s about being true to yourself and not going through life on others’ — or god forbid, the whole of society’s — terms. I’ve written before about how I first took up running for fitness, and after finding my feet running up the streets and down the roads and through the parks of Dublin and Hanoi I came to love the pure feeling of just running around the place. Child-like freedom in an adult’s body. Exploring new or familiar places on foot with a heavy-beating heart is a great way to really get to know them. And whereas wandering slowly on foot allows you to visit places with a gently meandering mind, I find running gives you a different experience. Heightened senses, greater focus — narrower, in a sense, as you’re often best to watch where you’re going, especially in a crowded city, but more in tune with what is in front of you. Things may pass you by a bit quicker but the things you do notice, you really do take them in. I get frustrated sometimes when I come back to my laptop and try to retrace my steps street by street, recalling all I’ve seen. Or even just remembering the addresses of cafes and hardware shops and printers for future reference, to come back and enjoy or find a new mop-head for the gaff. Exercise helps you learn. But it’s not about the memory test. It’s proper learning. Learning about the world around you. Recognising what people are thinking and how they’re feeling. Processing intangible cues and information in the way they walk, the little glances you get through the barber shop window, the friendly wave of a kid cheering you on with a giggle. The kids always get it. You remember these things a lot more when you’re running. Not like when you’re strolling through town and suddenly realise that the window you’re staring through has someone on the other side wondering what the fuck you’re looking at, pal, with your mouth hanging open like that an a squint in your eye trying to figure out what the special offer is. Some call it a runner’s high but really it’s just a return to our natural state of awareness. Interactions are different when you’re running, even with ‘ordinary folks’ — the commuters, the hangers-out, the sitters, the shoppers, the walkers — it seems the heightened state of consciousness brings the friendliness and the well-wishes out of everyone. I love giving other runners ‘the nod’ of acknowledgement and a bit of a “Howiya”, or maybe a “Well”. They don’t always respond or reply. Not yet anyway. I’m working on them. Maybe it’s a country thing, like doing the one-finger salute when you inch past someone driving down a side-road. It’s nice to say hello to people. When people do reply, the bit of shared appreciation of what you’re doing is lovely. It’s more than lovely. I really do think that being in the running state — whatever it does to your heart, your bloodflow, your body or maybe even your soul — creates some sort of positive waves of consciousness that others can feel. Maybe that’s what a runner’s high is. Make eye contact with people the next time you’re out running. Say hello to them. Give them a wave or a nod or the one-finger salute. Pay attention to how they react to you. It might be curiosity, resentment if they’re truly miserable. Usually it’s a smile. Now think of how the world itself can smile back at you — how it can appear — when you’re experiencing a runner’s high. A lot of the time it’s the idlers who are most in tune with the runner. If you acknowledge their presence, that is. Whether they’re down-and-out or just sitting down. Walking is the ultimate way to unlock the mind, to de-stress and to really become yourself. The flâneurs know this. It is physically and mentally healthy. It allows the mind to relax and work at its own pace, and many will tell you that their best ideas come when they’re out for a stroll. It can be done socially and it can be done anywhere. It unlocks creative juices and great ideas and most importantly — it just puts you back in touch with your surroundings, whether your own neighbourhood or when you’re taking a weekend break in a new city. Don’t let anyone tell you it’s not important work. It’s the best kind of productive. Walking or running. Walking is dreaming. Running is different — running builds the mind. It energises and empowers it. The elevated heart-rate awakens the senses, the blood flow makes you more aware of your surroundings. Running makes you smarter. Walking is a writer’s friend, so why not running? What better way to explore the world and report back on what you see than by running at it, through it, towards it. The flâneurs might be disgusted with the busyness of recreational sport, of purposeful punishment for its own sake when one could be lounging, taking it easy and enjoying life. But I’ve decided to take a break from ‘training’ as such and just go running around Dublin for its own sake. No earphones pumping out motivational tunes (they broke a while ago anyway). No pace. I’m just going to get out and run. And see what I see. Follow me as I report back on what I see. Stay idle, be free. Chào"

Medium.com,Life,Holidays with children just aren’t the same as life before parenthood,Travel,https://medium.com/@iamalaw/holidays-with-children-just-arent-the-same-as-life-before-parenthood-4e86189dc857?source=topic_page---------725------------------1," I was somewhat of a late bloomer when it came to being bitten by the travel bug. Two consecutive years of ‘lads’ holidays’ didn’t count as they were void of culture with my youthful and ignorant perspective at the time. With the same mindset, I also eschewed the idea of a gap year, travelling before starting university. It’s a decision I lament but I simply couldn’t appreciate what travel could afford me when juxtaposed against what it would actually afford in financial terms. It wasn’t until after university that I started traveling but once I started, I was gripped with Wanderlust. With the end of one trip came the initial planning of the next one. As the list of places I visited grew, so did the list of places I wanted to travel to. It was the same for my wife. Before we became a couple, she went backpacking for several months, travelling throughout South America and Asia Pacific. Subsequently, our mutual love of travel continued with shared trips and experiences. We would visit long haul and short haul destinations, soaking up culture and seeking adventure and new experiences. We’d take long walks nonchalantly exploring the local town, both on and off the beaten track, and were always keen to meet locals and like-minded travellers. There was also the escapism and chance to relax that travelling provided and we most certainly embraced. Most of our trips would feature a beach or a pool where we could both bask in the sun for hours, taking intermittent dips in the water to cool off. We were no strangers to hours of cross-country journeys via train and coach as we travelled between cities to visit must-see and lessor-known landmarks. For our honeymoon, we travelled through Central America and the Caribbean, combining backpacker-esque experiences with the more traditional honeymoon stays at luxury, adults-only beach resorts. The following year, we took a similar trip but this time travelling through Southeast Asia. We visited Malaysia, experiencing the rainforest in Borneo and the tea plantations in Cameron Highlands, while also enjoying the modern city of Kuala Lumpur. We went to Singapore and lazed on the beach in Ko Samui in Thailand before returning home via Hong Kong. It was exactly the kind of trip we typically sought. The year after that, our son was born. And consequently, our holidays were no longer the same. Becoming a parent changes your perspective. You become less carefree and more pragmatic. And arguably rightly so. Therefore our approach to travel was always bound to change. Our holidays, at least for a while, would now be family-friendly, risk averse experiences that didn’t require any further travel once in our destination. In many ways, they presented the antithesis of the type of holiday that for so many years we had both enjoyed. When our son was 8 months old, we went on our first family holiday. It was our first experience of intentionally seeking family-friendly accommodation. In fact, previously, we’d avoid it. Even as a parent, does anyone really want screaming, excitable children, high on sugar, running around while you’re trying to relax or enjoy a meal? No one can be blamed for actively avoiding that scenario. Yet we had now traded wandering into town on a whim to sample local food and drink with eating at the hotel restaurant. And mealtimes had to be mindful of our son’s schedule and sufficiently before bedtime. Because while you might be on holiday, your child’s schedule probably won’t be. But the contrast between holidays with a child and travelling before becoming a parent didn’t end there. After years of overpacking, I had perfected the art of the light-pack and the last-minute pack. Taking only what I would use, rather than packing for endless eventualities, and comfortably managing to get everything into a small case, I would smugly watch the scales at the bag drop-off desk confirm that I was well within the airline’s baggage allowance. Or better still, I’d circumvent the desk completely as the contents of my carry-on backpack was everything I needed. Now, an entire large suitcase would be dedicated to my son. Nappies, swim nappies, wipes, formula, baby snacks, bath toys, several books, a selection of toys, Calpol, Nurofen and enough clothes for any accidents or meal time mess meant the days of light packing were over. He may as well have had an entourage given how much we needed to pack for him. Getting to the airport too wasn’t with the same ease it once had. Where we’d previously take public transport as the quickest, most convenient and cost effective route to the airport, we had now had too much luggage, not to mention a pushchair in tow. And carrying that much meant we couldn’t risk a hurried journey to the airport. Where we used to drop our bags and go to the gate, now we’re one of the first there when the bag drop counter opens. Ever felt a flight was dragging until you reached your destination? Try keeping a toddler occupied for hours as he refuses to go to sleep on a flight that’s just shy of 5 hours. That’s exactly what our son did on our recent family holiday. I went through my repertoire of nursery rhymes, games, books, ebooks and walking up and down the aisle as we became acquainted with several passengers on the flight. We’d even timed the flight to coincide with his nap time but it was to no avail. When did he decide to fall asleep? As we disembarked the airplane. As I write this, we’re on our return flight as he sleeps on my lap and I’m grateful for the respite that just wasn’t forthcoming on our outbound journey. In contrast to our first family trip abroad, on this holiday our son was walking (or rather mostly running), talking and full of personality and curiosity. It was important that we allowed him to embrace the freedom and experience of a new space and the opportunity to roam. We also had to balance that with not becoming one of those parents who assumes their family holiday equates to not controlling their child and allowing them to ruin any modicum of relaxation for other holidaymakers (the kind of parent that receives disdainful side-eye from hotel guests wishing they’d booked somewhere else). The carefree approach to travelling we’d once taken was no longer compatible with travelling with a child. On previous trips, I’d usually wake up, go to the gym and then meet my wife for breakfast. My only regard for the time was what time breakfast ended. Even then, I didn’t really care as I could always pick something up later. How times have changed. On this trip, I still endeavoured to go to the gym but aimed to be back before I expected my son to be awake (to avoid leaving my wife to get him ready by herself). And most of our days were spent by the pool or the beach. Not sunbathing with a book while listening to music and sipping on a cocktail or a beer. Instead, I’d spend the day in the pool with my son, exiting when he’d had enough or for a snack or lunch, and returning when he was ready to re-enter in the fickle way children fleet between activities. And with a toddler, we’d be uber-conscious of safety. There’s arguably less immersion in local culture than there used to be. However, we’d still visit local attractions and go on walks as a family to the town, where we would sometimes eat as a departure from going to the hotel restaurant. There’s no doubt in my mind that for now, holidays with our son just aren’t the same as they were before parenthood. That doesn’t mean they aren’t a worthwhile experience. It just means they’re different. In the instance of both our family holidays, I was lukewarm towards the idea of going while my wife was in favour of it. Her line of thinking was that it would be nice to get away to a warmer climate and to provide new surroundings and experiences for our son. He’d welcome being able to play in the pool or digging in the sand at the beach. Not to mention, she rightly asserted that we needed a holiday. My opposition was based on her own rationale that we needed a holiday. However, taking our son, and being subject to the same constraints of everyday parenting, wasn’t a holiday in my opinion. It was parenting business as usual but in a different location and with the added effort of travelling with everything a toddler requires. On reflection, we were both right. Of course we remained on duty as parents; there are no days off from parenting. Furthermore, there was definitely an effort involved that was alien to previous holidays but our son had a great time. He loved being in the water and playing in the sand and was undoubtedly stimulated by both the nuances and greater contrasts with home. As a family, it made for vivid memories that my wife and I were able to create with our son; just as we had created memories as a couple when travelling together before he was born. Travelling is no longer the same as parents. Our trips may not represent the same adventure and discovery they once did for us. Although in a different way, they provide adventure and discovery for our son as they expose him to new surroundings and experiences; something that wasn’t a feature of my wife’s or my childhood. Sure, they require a lot of effort and don’t exactly provide the extent of relaxation we were used to from so many holidays as a couple before our son was born. Nevertheless, the trade-off is the opportunity to build shared memories and experiences as a family."

Excuse me? Is this the ferry to Tallinn?” I was running late, I often run late. He looked down from his newspaper, took a nice deep breath, and uttered one single word, “no.” He then proceeded to lift his newspaper back up and continue reading. Not exactly the most proactive of security guards. In desperation, I pointed to another ferry, “This one Tallinn?” I noticed while speaking to people who don’t speak particularly good English, I drop words like, ‘the’ ‘to’ ‘is.’ I am not sure if this actually makes it easier for people to understand me, but I can’t help it. He once again dropped his newspaper down, looked towards the ferry I was pointing at, and shook his head again, “no.” Once again, he gently raised his newspaper, but I was in a rush. “Which one is Tallinn then?” I showed him my e-ticket, he dropped his glasses, read it and said. “Not here.” Satisfied with his answer he went back to his paper. ‘Not here?’ ‘Then, where?’ I leaned back over to the security guard and with a wide grin and warm smile, that not even the angriest of people couldn’t get cross with asked. “Where?” He sighed again, obviously, I was interrupting his very important news reading session. “Other terminal,” he grunted and lifted his newspaper back up for the final time. I could tell that if I interrupted him again, he’d probably carter me off to the nearest Finnish prison cell, where he would promptly finish me off. (Hahahaha, Sorry!!) After briefly getting lost again, I quickly found the other terminal, which once again lived up to its name. I don’t know what its is, but I have this weird accidental habit of booking really weird and downright bizarre public transport. I quickly hot-footed it inside the other terminal, where I was expecting to find my large ferry waiting to whisk me across the mighty Gulf of Finland. Instead of that, waiting for me was some jumped up little catamaran, with no time to hesitate I quickly boarded and settled in on the top deck for some magnificent views as we pulled away from Helsinki. Fortunately, it was another warm, calm spring May day, so there were very little waves to trouble my little old catamaran, but judging by the size of it, it must be hellish on a day with rough seas. It would get tossed around like a salad in Andy Murray’s hands. Altogether though it was a rather scenic ride, there’s also a little café on board where you can buy overpriced snacks and some magazines to read, but I just whiled away my time on the deck and soon enough, I could see land ahead. Tallinn was in my sights. I don’t know whether the harbour in Tallinn is under construction, or if it is just our little catamaran isn’t allowed in it, but we arrived at this strange sort of old abandoned military fort. The captain promptly jumped off the boat and ran over to a little gate, pulled it open and gestured for us to cross into Estonia. There wasn’t a passport official or customs official to be seen. I quickly passed through the little metal gate and I was now officially in Estonia. Schengen seems to make borders simply vanish, either that or they couldn’t be bothered to turn up this day. I quickly made my way around the city, to my Airbnb on the other side. Settled in, met my lovely host and then went to the nearest shopping center. Not because I wanted to, but because I needed some new shoes. I do a lot, and I mean a lot of walking while I am travelling and don’t really have room in my backpack for more than one pair of shoes at a time. I wear them until my trainers have turned into sandals with my toes peeking out of the sides. Returning, I quickly settled into my little studio apartment and decided to go for an evening walk around the picturesque town. It was a Saturday evening, so the town was a hive of activity… To be honest, I really had no idea what to expect from Tallinn, was it going to full of hideous old communist architecture? Nope, instead, it was more like a fairy tale like world, with stunning castles overlooking a medieval town… Like Helsinki, I quickly fell in love with Tallinn, but in a totally different way, I adored its little-cobbled streets and high vantage viewpoints, that gave great views of the surrounding areas. It’s hard to know what to expect when you arrive in a new country, especially smaller ones that don’t feature in the news often. The population of the whole of Estonia is less than the city of Barcelona! The only thing I really knew about Estonia, was that it was the birthplace of Skype, and has a weird E-Residency scheme every digital nomad seems to be raving about. My plan was to spend three nights in Helsinki, before boarding the morning train down to Tartu, spend the day and night there, exploring the city and its bizarre observatory. I would then once again hop on the morning train down to the border town of Valga, kill some time there, before finally getting the train to Riga. Yes, I know I could have just got the direct bus, but this seemed to be much more interesting, and I wasn’t in a rush. But for now, I was in Tallinn. Breathing in the sights, wandering along the cobbled streets and enjoying the may sun…"
Medium.com,Life,Night Watch over Mai Po,Travel,https://medium.com/wwfhk-e/night-watch-over-mai-po-3cbf5dcb3d57?source=topic_page---------728------------------1," by Thomas Gomersall Saturday nights can be spent Netflix bingeing or catching up with friends over drinks. But for nature lovers in Hong Kong, it can mean getting outside with a torch and plenty of mosquito repellent to spot a few elusive nocturnal animals. And from late May to August, one of the best opportunities to do that is the Night Safari at Mai Po Nature Reserve. The activity starts like other Mai Po eco-visits, albeit in the early evening at around 6pm. In the sultry twilight, the wildlife seems noticeably dozier than usual, staying mostly subdued and out of sight, save for a few Chinese pond herons snatching a last bit of dinner. But what this first stage of the tour lacks in wildlife sightings, it more than makes up for in scenery, concluding at the Education Centre lily pond where the beauty of a mauve sunset sky is perfectly complemented by a serenade of gently croaking frogs. Later, the tour moves inside the Education Centre for a welcome break from the humidity and a briefing on what might be spotted in the reserve that night, including Asian barred owlets, night herons, leopard cats, 13 species of bat and even Eurasian otters. While seeing many of these animals is definitely a long shot given their secretive nature, even that slim chance quickly excites the tour group I’m with, which can’t seem to resume the safari fast enough. By this time, night has well and truly fallen over Mai Po, though the reserve is surprisingly well- lit thanks to the shine of nearby Shenzhen. Still, that doesn’t mean the wildlife is any easier to spot. Blink and you might miss the tiny, electric-green light of your first firefly, or even a whole field of them. These beetles are deceptively easy to miss as their bioluminescent bottoms twinkle in and out of sight. But if you’re lazy like me, you can always rely on the guide’s red- tinged torches, which easily pick out other insects in the dark and provide a reassuring source of light along the damp, sometimes slippery boardwalks. Unsurprisingly, one must rely more on hearing to detect animals at night. But this can be problematic, especially with animals that make sounds at frequencies beyond the range of human hearing. Fortunately, the eco guides have a solution on hand. Bat detectors pick up the ultrasonic calls made by bats during echolocation and convert them into a series of spitting clicks (which, in an amusing coincidence, sound a little like flapping wings) that are loud enough for us to hear. The louder the clicks, the closer a bat is. For those not content with just hearing bats or seeing their dim silhouettes fluttering overhead, a clearer view can be had at one of Mai Po’s bat boxes, which the guides will shine a light up into to search for any bats roosting inside (geckos and wolf spiders may also be seen). But if you want a photo, be sure to bring a highly light-sensitive camera as flash photography is not permitted. Of course, spotting wildlife is always a luck-of-the-draw thing and there is no real guarantee of seeing animals in the reserve. Luckily, the guides have a back-up plan just in case: a white sheet hung next to an ultraviolet light near the Education Centre. Left for an hour or two while the tour group wanders the reserve, the heat from the UV light attracts a myriad of insects. Moths, crickets, grasshoppers, dragonflies and damselflies are all dotted across the sheet, along with a few spiders perhaps hoping to snatch something from the living buffet all around them. Some of the more impressive specimens are also scooped up and placed under see-through lids for visitors to get a better look at. While the Mai Po night safari is an excellent opportunity to see nocturnal animals in Hong Kong, it is far from the only one. There are also plenty of public walking trails all over the city where a casual evening stroll can potentially turn up some spectacular wildlife. Porcupines and wild pigs along Lugard Road. Fireflies and moths in Tai Po Kau. Snakes and frogs on the trails near Ng Tung Chai village in Lam Tsuen. They’re all out there and are all easily accessible via public transport. So if you’re ever stuck for ideas for your Saturday night, why not grab a torch and try your luck? Tips for nocturnal wildlife watching: · Do not disturb or harass wildlife. · Move quietly and slowly to avoid disturbing animals. · Walk in a pair or small group (3–4) to reduce noise. · Look for wildlife away from main paths and instead along small trails on the side (try visiting the site during the day first to identify potential animal trails)."
Medium.com,Life,Tips for a great trip to wine country,Travel,https://medium.com/the-wine-nerd/tips-for-a-great-trip-to-wine-country-3daaa218cc0f?source=topic_page---------729------------------1," I’ve lost count of how many times I’ve gone to wine country this year. Is that a good thing or a bad thing? Jury is still out. One great thing about it though is that let’s face it — you do anything enough times and you’ll find ways that work and ways that don’t. This post will summarize what I think about and what I’ve learned when setting up a great trip to wine country. To me, this is the most important decision to make and stick to in the planning process. It is totally reasonable to spend a day tasting wine, go to 2–4 places, and be still functional and able to drive. BUT. You’re going to need to take only a sip or two of each wine, drink a lot of water, and really be smart and pace yourself. On the other hand, it is so easy (and honestly so fun) to not have to worry about how much you are drinking. For some quick math: if each tasting pour is 2oz, and you do a flight of 5 wines, then you’ve had 10oz = 2 glasses of wine. Do that at 3 places, and boom — you’ve just drank more than a bottle of wine. There are some wine regions where biking or walking is feasible. In that case, consider spending the night and ditching motor vehicle transportation altogether! In general — my recommendation is to hire a driver/tour if you don’t visit wine country often. The way to fully enjoy the experience is to not worry about how much you’ve consumed. If you have someone willing to DD in your group, that’s great too. But making a a plan and sticking to it is the best way to stay smart and safe! Pick a region, and ideally a subregion. To save time and minimize driving between stops, I like to narrow down to a subregion. For example, Healdsburg within Sonoma or Stag’s Leap District within Napa. Do your research about appointments. Some regions are known to be mostly appointment-only (i.e. Napa) but the worst thing is pulling up to a winery you were planning to taste at and discover they have no availability. 99.9% of wineries will allow you to make appointments, so if you want to be safe and don’t mind a plan — call or email ahead of time to ensure you have a spot! Think about varietal diversity. Take a quick pulse on your group: do you all like red wine? white wine? a mix? not picky? If there’s any strong opinions in the group, you may want to look at wineries’ offerings and make sure it fits your preferences. Don’t try to do too much. My go-to schedule these days is booking 2 appointments and keeping 1–2 as options for later in the day if it works out. Most wineries open and close quite early; it’s not uncommon to see hours like 10am-4pm. If you’re planning to do basic tastings, expect to spend 1.5–2 hours at each place and schedule your day accordingly. Smaller groups are more flexible; large groups require more upfront research. It’s incredibly fun to do a wine country trip with a group of you and your closest 10 friends. But know that you definitely need to do pre-research and schedule tastings because most wineries won’t accept large groups without a reservation. Pack a picnic lunch. A food plan is especially important when you’re spending the whole day drinking. I prefer to pack a nice array of cheese, meat, crackers and fruit, but I’ve also done sandwiches and they were great! Check with wineries ahead of time if you are hoping to picnic on their property (some regions require special permits). Otherwise, pulling over on the side of the road works in a pinch. Bring lots of water and dress in layers. A couple of things are common in wine tasting — being really cold and being really dehydrated. Why both? Well a lot of wineries will do tours or tastings of their caves, and wine needs to be stored at 55 degrees! On the other hand, a lot of wine regions are in warm climates so if you’re tasting outside or touring vineyards, you may be sweating a lot. Alcohol is also a naturally dehydrating substance. Best to be prepared! I hope these tips have helped you or give you ideas for your next wine country visit! Stay tuned for my series on wine tasting recommendations in some of my favorite regions."
Medium.com,Life,5 Reasons Why I Travel,Travel,https://medium.com/@joellemumley/5-reasons-why-i-travel-49175781e56b?source=topic_page---------730------------------1," The first time I traveled outside the country of my birth, I was only two years old and my family was moving from the U.S. to Kenya. I’m pretty much an infant in my first passport picture and I had to quit my pacifier cold turkey because it was lost somewhere in our luggage during the journey. So travel has always been a part of me. And as I’ve grown up and chosen the type of life and career I want, I’ve continued to make travel a priority. Here are a few reasons why. 1. Learning I love learning about history, geography, literature, architecture, culture, geology — it’s all interesting to me. And traveling is a chance to stay in school forever, with a much more interesting classroom setting. Wandering through museums, going on a touristy tour, visiting the quiet of a cathedral, walking through the ruins of an ancient society, and talking to people who have different life experiences than me — these are some of the best ways for me to learn. 2. New Perspectives It’s helpful to remember that, when we travel, we’re visiting a place at a particular moment in time. Maybe we’re there at a really rough point, when famine, war, poverty, or corruption are central features. Or maybe we’re a guest during a period of renaissance, where art, science, and literature are thriving. Our experience of that particular time does not fully encompass the characteristics of that place. It is not static, but evolving and growing. The more I travel, the more I’m convinced that every place is a mix of good, bad, and just okay. It can be easy to experience something that’s so different from your own context and either say, “Why do people live this way? It makes no sense!” or “Why don’t we live this way? It’s so much better than the way it is back home!” And the fact is, neither of those statements on their own is completely fair or true. Every place and culture has beautiful things about them. Every place and culture has toxic features that need to be improved. My hope is that I am able to listen, observe, and come away with a broader perspective. 3. Getting Uncomfortable I wouldn’t say that I naturally like to be uncomfortable. But saying yes to things that I’m unfamiliar with or that scare me (within reason — stay safe!) has giving me plenty of practice in the feeling. And I’ve learned to value it, even in the midst of the experience, because the moments of discomfort are where the real adventure happens. It’s where all the good stories come from. 4. Seeing Beautiful Things Life is hard. And sometimes you just need to hike to the top of Lion’s Head in Cape Town, or appreciate the view on a drive along the coast of Iceland, or go on a game drive early in the morning with views of majestic Kilimanjaro taking up the entire horizon… in order to remember that life is also really incredible and the earth is a beautiful place worth cherishing and protecting. 5. Living a Travel Lifestyle I’ve noticed that, since I turned 30 and started to travel more, and especially since moving back to Nairobi, I have been more purposeful about living a travel lifestyle — by that, I mean I’m more likely to embrace these previous four things in my day-to-day routine. I want to live my life with the perspective that there is something new to learn every day. Nairobi is such a diverse city, with so many different perspectives to listen to and learn from. I don’t want to forget what it feels like to be uncomfortable, so I try speak my mediocre Kiswahili and I don’t just look away from the person trying to sell me something outside the car window. And as I sit at my desk, staring at the bougainvillea plant, listening to the birds, hoping to see a monkey, I am very aware of and thankful for the beauty that surrounds me."

I heard the class offered ample opportunity to be outdoors and I needed the science credit. While the professor went over the syllabus on the first day, I flipped open one of our textbooks and saw North America, a full-spread black and grey relief map, unmarked, undivided but for a thin, jagged line connecting the East and West Coasts — too far south to be the border with Canada, too regular to be a natural feature…curious. The professor said something that made everyone laugh and I closed the book before I figured out what was up with the line. I didn’t suspect that the line would become important for me, that over the next two years it would come to represent a new way of thinking about the world, and help me make sense of a particularly disordered and aimless chapter of my life. I didn’t even end up taking the class. Turned out the amount of time spent trudging around outcrops and dry beds in the Southwest was going to interfere with my raucous last-semester senior year agenda. I switched to an airy seminar on continental philosophy, returned all the geology textbooks except for the one with the map, and didn’t think about it again until I’d graduated and suddenly everyone was gone and I had nothing to do."
Medium.com,Life,Disasters and Beauty at Sun Moon Lake,Travel,https://medium.com/the-winding-trail/disasters-and-beauty-at-sun-moon-lake-b33d6064eb9f?source=topic_page---------735------------------1," Sun Moon Lake is one of the top sights to see in Taiwan, though it’s rather tricky to get to, and in the wrong hands, it can be rather painful, especially when one forgets which brakes are the front ones! I was relaxing in the rather industrial city of Taichung, a great city to get a real feel for the Taiwanese way of life, as there are very few travellers if any, there. My really rather simple plan, in hindsight, probably too simple, was to head over to Sun Moon Lake for a day trip. My first challenge though was to find the correct bus, so feeling all intelligent I headed over to the bus station. This was my first in a very long line of mistakes, there were no buses to Sun Moon Lake at all. After trying to ask for a ticket, and quickly realizing that my charade attempt of Sun, Moon, Lake was starting to cause a panic, I decided to head to the small bus station near the railway station. Once again though, I came to a dead-end, there didn’t seem to be a single bus to Sun Moon Lake, maybe I had gone to the wrong city? I fired up my trusty phone, grabbed some traditional Taiwanese food at Mos Burger and found out that the bus went from Shuangshi Rd, which was right opposite my hostel. Returning to my hostel, I scoped out the streets, and couldn’t find anything resembling a bus station. After wandering into an old shop that sold weird military-style outfits, anyone would think Taiwan was planning for some sort of invasion. I was about to give up the ghost, until I saw, coming around the corner a rather rickety old bus with the words Sun Moon Lake in the front window. It shuttered to a stop outside what looked like, a rather dreary dry cleaner. On second glance though, I saw, next to the dry cleaners, a small little shop, couldn’t be any more than 5 metres wide. Inside it looked like a travel agent and low and behold the bus had stopped right outside of it. I gingerly stepped inside, once again ready to practice my charade of Sun Moon Lake. Fortunately for me, they spoke pretty good English, which was great, because judging by the size of the place, I probably wouldn’t have successfully done my Sun Moon Lake routine without putting my hand through one of the walls. The kind lady though then wrote me out a little ticket, and promised me, the next morning at 8 am sharp, my bus would be waiting to take me all the way up to Sun Moon Lake. I am pained to admit it though, I was somewhat sceptical of that promise. Next morning my alarm went off with a painful screech, when you’ve been travelling leisurely for a long time, avoiding early morning flights and buses, the sound of an alarm can be a real shock. I quickly got up, grabbed some breakfast and headed across to the little ticket shop, to my surprise instead of one bus, there were two parked outside! This you might think was a good sign, not at all. Neither of the buses had any signs on them, and asking the drivers was hopeless, neither of them spoke a word of English. (Why should they?) And my Mandarin was about as useful as a chocolate teapot. Which ironically is the only thing I can say in Mandarin. So there I found myself, on the side of a busy road, commuters speeding off to work, doing my Sun Moon Lake dance again. The driver though just looked at me rather confused, and I swear if a helpful passer-by hadn’t stepped in, he’d be carting me off to the looney bin. “Ah, Sun Moon Lake.” The passer-by pointed me towards one of the buses. I climbed aboard, hopeful that this helpful passer-by wasn’t just playing some elaborate prank upon me. To be fair, it would have been rather funny, going around sending tourists onto the wrong bus, a right old giggle that sounds. Unfortunately, at that moment in time, I was the tourist. At 8 am sharp the doors closed and we were off, ah good I thought to myself, this must be right the bus. Looking back I then saw the other bus close its doors and follow us. Right then, they were both going to Sun Moon Lake, nothing to worry about. Nothing at all. I tried to relax in my seat but struggled to get comfy, something was nagging away at me, I turned around again, and saw the other bus dart off in another direction! From then on I kept frantically checking my phone to make sure we were going in the right direction. Every turn we made I kept checking it with my map to make sure we were heading towards Sun Moon Lake and not some random Taiwanese mountain village. During my frantic searches on my phone though, (while I was depleting my battery) I found an offer online, free bikes for foreigners! Coming from western Europe the idea of someone giving free bikes to foreigners seemed absurd, the way that Europe is heading at this moment in time, the only thing we’ll be giving foreigners is cyanide pills. Anyway, I digress, reading through all the terms and conditions this seemed to be a legitimate offer, a way of encouraging more tourists to visit Sun Moon Lake. Brilliant I thought to myself, a free bike, I am an adult, I can ride a bike, that is not remotely dangerous. Ah, there was a catch, you had to show them your passport to prove you’re a foreigner, and I had left mine back in the hotel. Then again, look at me, there’s no way I could pass for a Taiwanese person, I looked up the price to rent a bike properly, but I wasn’t going to pay 5 Euros when I could have it for free! As we weaved through the stunning mountains, through little quiet villages, my mind was elsewhere, I was plotting, planning how I was going to save 5 Euros and get a free bike. Yes, I am really that cheap. Soon though I finally arrived at Sun Moon Lake, I quickly jumped out of the bus and made a beeline to the store mentioned in the news article I had been reading. I had a whole story all worked out and flung open the day ready to shower them with a pile of lies. But before I could open my mouth, an employee came over to me, “free bike?” How did they know I was a foreigner, a mystery I tell you. They said I could select anyone I wanted, all I had to do was return it back in the same condition they had given it to me, and within 2 hours. No need for a passport after all, though I left my EU health card as collateral. They even gave me a map of the lake with the route I should take, all for free, I couldn’t believe it. So I bid them farewell and started off on my ride. The scenery around here was breathtaking, I could see why so many people come here. I followed the path along, slowly and carefully, the bike I had chosen was a fast road bike with skinny tyres and vicious brakes. To be honest I wasn’t really used to riding these sort of bikes, actually, come to think of it, I had never ridden a bike like this before in my life. Most of the bikes I rode growing up all had shoddy brakes and big chunky tyres. This in comparison was a beauty to ride. Round and round the lake I cycled, dodging in and out of all the tourists, the views were simply out of this world. After finishing my ride to the other side of the lake I took a breather, proud with my achievements, I hadn’t got on the wrong bus, and I hadn’t fallen off my bike, yet. You see, I was so confident with my ability that on the way back I thought I’d go extra fast. Have a bit of fun with it. For the first half of the ride, it was rather busy, meaning I had to watch out for random people stepping out in front of me. One the other hand though, the second half was practically deserted. With sweeping hills and smooth pavements, I was going to have some proper fun now. It started off great, speeding along, up and down small hills, leaning into the corner like a rallycross biker. I was having a whale of a time, but as I arrived back at the halfway point, the Sun Moon Lake National Scenic Area my cockiness caught up with me. Looking back, I am not sure exactly how it happened, I was going downhill, yes, but not particularly fast. I gently pulled the brakes, slowing down to merge with another track just behind the Sun Moon Lake National Scenic Area. When suddenly, in a flash and I swear involuntarily my left hand squeezed the left brake a little too tightly and the bike literally just stopped, sending me flying over the handlebars… It took me a couple of seconds to realize what had happened, and as I gathered myself up off the floor, I did what I like to call a full body check. That is not as rude as it sounds. Yep, my head was fine, no bleeding there, knees had a few cuts, but nothing to worry about. The palm of my hand was also bruised and bleeding, but again, nothing that wouldn’t heal in a few days. It seemed I’d had a lucky escape. The bike was fine as well, which was good, meant I wouldn’t have to pay for any damage. It seemed I had had a lucky escape. I headed to the nearby toilets to wash some of the blood off me, brought a packet of plasters from the local seven-eleven, thank god for seven eleven and then climbed back on the bike. That is when I noticed it. My right arm was killing me. I could barely move it. My elbow was badly bruised, but what caused the most pain was my upper arm. It seemed in my fall of the bike I had landed on my elbow and my right upper arm had taken my entire body weight. Fortunately I had packed some painkillers with me, unfortunately, I had left them in my bag back at the hotel. I quickly dropped the bike off, washed off the blood from my elbow, applied more plasters and realized I had to make a decision. Should I get the next bus back to Taichung City, or continue exploring Sun Moon Lake. It was a beautiful place, but I was now in rather a lot of pain, no stuff it, I thought, I was probably never going to come back here, so forget the early bus home, I set out and explored the rest of the lake. Catching the boat across it, I hiked up to Master Xuan Zang’s Memorial Hall. Before then going across to Yidashao Wharf. By this point, though my arm was starting to really hurt, and I caught the last bus back to Taichung City, holding my arm all the way. It was worth it though, what a beautiful place. Fortunately, I had two more days in Taichung City and spent most of them lying in my hostel room recovering watching The Sopranos. It was only a sprain though, so there was no need to try out Taiwanese reputably brilliant medical system. My arm slowly recovered over the next couple of weeks, and by the time it had, I was ready to drive my Burmese moped. Will I ever learn?"
Medium.com,Life,"Tel Aviv Airport, Israeli Immigration — On Being ‘Checked’",Travel,https://medium.com/@bruno.cooke/tel-aviv-airport-israeli-immigration-on-being-checked-46380675180e?source=topic_page---------736------------------1," A step by step account of what it was like for us, being held at Israeli immigration, at Tel Aviv Ben Gurion Airport, for five hours. And it might happen to you, too. We land at 10pm, keen to make up for lost time. Outside the plane, we’re smoothed with that cold heat, night-warmth of the Middle East. We are here, after much umming and ahing. I was dubious about our trip to Israel, as you can imagine, and made more so by the Lebanese girl, in Delhi, who said to me directly, ‘Do not go to Israel. You would not go to a zoo, so why would you go to Israel?’ Well, yes. Our flight was delayed by a day because of a nuisance airline. That was fine because they put us in a 120EUR/night room in Lisbon and gave us lunchmoney, but it was still a bummer. So, when we do get to Tel Aviv Yafo, we want to hit the ground running, so to speak. It is 10pm and we want, probably more than anything, to eat hummus and falafel. We approach the immigration desk, passports in hand. It is a strange thing, holding a UK passport. Travelling within Europe is so seamless it is possible to change country without even realising it. Passing in and out of Sri Lanka or India is typically painless, often smiley. Most countries, it seems, are happy to have us — our money, at least. We enjoy many of the same freedoms as our European friends. Only occasionally is our ‘special relationship’ with the US an active hindrance (as with Iran). We are used to being treated as trustworthy. Perhaps I was lackadaisical in my approach, (I read that a Lebanese stamp might slow the process down), complacent in my expectation that if I tell the truth, and am polite, it would be a relatively smooth entry. This is what one is taught. I went on the internet; I prepared. At first we are told to sit in a waiting area, penned off from the main immigration room. Well, no, not exactly. At first, we are actually told to go to the office, and waved away from the immigration queue. It takes some time, waiting at an empty reception desk, before we are told which waiting area we should sit in. The pen is lined with chairs. Perhaps five or six other seats are occupied. At its mouth stand a number of security guards. Young, bearded and jocular, these appear incongruent with the guards one imagines guarding Israeli outposts in, for example, Palestine. They laugh with each other and make jokes while watching the television. There is a football match on. Perhaps, I think, their good humour with each other is an indicator of how they might treat us, their wards. After an hour of waiting without any explanation, I am interviewed, alone, by a man with an American accent. A woman sits with him. She has curly hair and wears glasses. The man asks me about what I do — which can be difficult to explain. He asks me about my father and his job, about where I plan to go in Israel and why I am visiting. Then he asks me about Lebanon. He asks me why I went there, where exactly I went, if I went to the south of the country, why I didn’t go to the south of the country (this is a very political decision, from an Israeli perspective), if it was my first time, if I went alone, why, why, why, and so on. This is known as an Israeli breakfast. Now I’ll switch to past tense. In the end the mood was positive. He gave me a chance to confess any other transgressions, should anything come to mind, “because our security checks are quite thorough”. I’m sure they are, Mr. Man. The woman spoke for the first time: “parking fines, that sort of thing”. What? Why would you need to know about parking fines? Are parking violations indicative of anti-Israel sentiment? Heaven forbid I should have an overdue TV license bill — they might accuse me of being a terrorist. No, I’m being sarcastic. But that really was her only interjection. I was excused from my interview and told my passport would be returned in due course. In due course… those three words. During the four hours which followed (approx 11pm to 3am), we saw two dozen people come and go — be interviewed, security checked and let in. At several points we remarked on the high percentage of single, young women among the people held. At one point, there were 13 women, most very young, three of them pregnant, four of them with infants or young children, five of them in tears. Sat nearby was a French woman, heavily pregnant. She was distraught. She had spoken on the phone with a man we presumed to be her partner, and was sobbing loudly, inconsolably. We did what we could to comfort her but our words were useless. She then called her advisor, or lawyer, who required to speak with the immigration desk. The security personnel refused to even look at her, let alone talk to her — they would not tell her how to get the information her advisor required. When I suggested to one of them that it might be easiest if they just speak to the advisor directly, I was told, ‘It might be easiest if you sit down and be quiet’. It was shocking. It was a blatant display of collective disregard for this heavily pregnant woman’s emotional state. There was nothing. This went on for 45 minutes. There were times when, glancing cursorily around the room, my eye would sought out another’s. Women were upset, a man with broad shoulders spoke peremptorily into his phone, girls looked to the guards for hope. But no one looked at each other. I looked around and wanted to build some kind of clan — to express to the others, waiting there, that we were all clearly lumped in this thing together and should treat each other as teammates. But everyone was so subdued and defeated that eye contact was nearly impossible. It was a bizarre experience. It wasn’t traumatising, but it secured a negative mindset towards a country rich in culinary and cultural history. Naturally, we came with preconceptions — we understand. But this was our very first experience on Israeli soil, and it concretised an already burgeoning sentiment of negativity and incomprehension. And my guess is that it can happen to anyone — a big Saudi businessman, a petite Russian teen, a French mother-to-be, me. A four hour social media security check really does scrape the bucket dry. - Visit www.onurbicycle.com for more tales from around the world — by turns political, humorous, anecdotal and bizarre."

Medium.com,Life,Smashing Bucharest Stereotypes,Travel,https://medium.com/the-winding-trail/smashing-bucharest-stereotypes-1d060290883f?source=topic_page---------740------------------1," Bucharest is one of those cities that rarely ever seems to get any good press, from violent street demonstrations to extreme poverty and squalor, but after spending nearly a month there, to paraphrase the late great Mark Twain, ‘reports of Bucharest’s death are greatly exaggerated.’ First off, I was in Bucharest during the summer, with near wondrous sunshine every day, and highs of 30 degrees. I have a feeling if I went during the depths of winter, this post may be slightly different. I don’t deal with the cold very well. Also, interestingly Bucharest is one of the only cities in Europe that has seen a population decline over the last twenty years, so my opinion of the city doesn’t seem to be shared by the majority of its residents. Now, in Western Europe, Romania has been the butt of a lot of negative stereotypes, as a sort of backward part of the EU, with extreme poverty and an unhappy citizenry who just can’t wait to pack their bags and move to the even duller United Kingdom. Yes, there might be a bit of truth in this, but happily, like most stereotypes, they’re greatly exaggerated. One of the first things you’ll realize when you arrive in Bucharest is that the city centre is completely different from what you imagined. Unless you imagined the city centre would look like Paris, in that case, well done you, help yourself to a typical Romanian lunch. The heart of the city was a massive surprise to me, I expected some sort of communistic type centre, (yes, even the best of us fall for stereotypes.) Instead, I was greeted with wonderful old cobbled streets, wondrous historical buildings, and a small church straight out of the bible. On first glance, Romania was nothing like what the news had led me to believe. Stepping out from the city centre, you’ll find plenty of parks to while away the hours in, most of them include super-fast free wifi as well, which is a nice bonus. Actually, Romania is probably one of the most wifi friendly countries I’ve been to. Sat in a lovely park, under the shade of a nice large tree, with 100mb/sec free open wifi to play around with, is my idea of paradise. The two main parks are ‘Youth Park‘ and ‘King Mihai I Park (Herastrau)‘, which is next to the ‘Arcul de Triumf,’ and has a nice 6km path going around a clean and pristine lake, perfect for cycling, running or walking the dog. On this theme, I also found Bucharest a weirdly livable city, plenty of 24-hour shops and little bakeries serving everything from pizza to freshly baked croissants. To be honest, for the first couple of days I was there, I felt smitten with the city, I was staying in a nice part of town, near Piața Romană all the streets around me were lined with large impressive looking homes, and there were plenty of small parks where I could relax and while away the day. Just around the corner, there were plenty of restaurants and cafes, I was just a ten-minute walk from the heart of the old town, and I really couldn’t understand why so many people had left the city, and why so many wanted to leave. This is where I did most of my work, from the Parcul Lumea Copiilor, where they had little bandstands with benches, perfect for a laptop and a kindle. Compared to other cities I’ve lived in, like Barcelona for example, there seemed to be a distinct lack of beggars and rough sleepers. The streets felt pretty safe, either day or not. Also, I didn’t feel the need to constantly check my pockets on the ultra-modern metro. But something was niggling away at me, I wanted to understand why so many people had left a city I was slowly falling in love with. It certainly wasn’t for lack of cultural exploits, as on my first day I encountered a large display, involving a horse, a giant, some really cheesy jokes, and a crowd cheering them on. Picking up a pamphlet I saw the whole of July was full of cultural exhibits, from outdoor theatre to street art exhibitions and performance art. Encountering a large demonstration against corruption was my first clue, that all was not well in Romania, also, things didn’t actually seem that cheap. I would say only 10%, 20% cheaper than Spain, which was surprising, when I googled the average wage in Romania is just around €500 a month, compared to the average wage in Spain which is over a €1,000 a month. Spain certainly isn’t twice as expensive as Romania. It also occurred to me that most of the people eating in the nice fancy restaurants seemed to be foreigners and tourists. Deciding that may be wandering around the wealthier parts of Bucharest might not be giving me the most overall picture of what it is like to live in the city I jumped on the metro and headed off into the suburbs. Now for those of you that paid some attention in History/Geography, it will not surprise you that Romania, right up until 1989, used to a communist country. Communist, in my book at least, weren’t exactly concerned with beauty, ‘let’s just stick up a bunch of poorly built identical flats, then return to our nice rich palaces.’ So, it was here, on the outskirts of Bucharest, where I quickly realized why so many Romanians had left their city. As, for as far as my eye could see, there was row upon row, of rather dilapidated 1960’s tower blocks. The buzz of the old town had been replaced by shop windows with big bars across the front of them. This was the Bucharest, the Romania I had seen on the news, I was less than ten minutes from the heart of the old town with its pedestrians streets and wonderful terraces, but I could have been on a different planet… I write this post, not to disparage Romania, but to make the point, that as tourists we only ever really see the nice parts of a city. The parts that have been done up for us. Even though I was living there for a month or so, unless I had decided to take a trip into the suburbs I would have been left with a very warped view of Bucharest. Maybe if I returned in the middle of their brutal winters, I wouldn’t have had such a rosy view, certainly wouldn’t have been able to while away my time in the nice parks, writing these posts… Also, the old ladies, babushkas I think they’re called, seemed frigging miserable, not one of them I encountered broke even part of a smile. It’s as if someone hasn’t told them communism has ended, and that they can smile now. :)"

Medium.com,Life,Conscious Traveling — Is That Possible?,Travel,https://medium.com/@alexandraroman/conscious-traveling-is-that-possible-3870c9299dc4?source=topic_page---------742------------------1," How do you travel? Is a question I don’t often hear. With 1 or 5 luggages? A guide or free form? A spree through all local restaurants
or perhaps a simple stay in your resort? A question we should all ask ourselves, do we travel responsibly? do we travel consciously? Do we acknowledge the culture surrounding us? Do we make an effort, even the smallest of efforts, to integrate into a culture when being its guest? Or are we ignorant, partaking in a massive homogenization? In the summer of 2019, I went to Bali. In the Spring of 2019, I went to Morocco and it dawned upon me — in a perverse game of host and be hosted, whose at stake to adapt? Is anyone? Since the 1950s, international tourism has skyrocketed and exploded in size, virtually overtaking our planet through economic recovery, real estate, jobs, airports, etc… The UN World Tourism Organization claimed that tourism generated more than $2.1tn in annual revenues and in many island nations and countries word wide, tourism acted(s) as the primary source of foreign exchange and employment. Yet the objective downside of tourism ripples starting with technological connectivity to cheap travel. Tourists cause food, land, water and housing prices to increase at a rate linked with a steep decline in tourism operators’ margins. Thus, tourism does not directly lead to benefiting host communities. But even moving past this, in the summer of 2019 as I was strolling through Ubud, I noticed an avalanche of tourists whom stuck out like sore thumbs; an avalanche of businesses privately owned by foreign investors; an avalanche of visitors taking mindless photos with “rocks” and offerings that they had no idea what they meant nor what cultural significance they held. In the summer of 2019, I noticed an avalanche and social media was a catalyzer. Apart from the media cashing in an exorbitant amount of money from advertising holiday locations and cheap flights, on a broader level, we have a new hybrid — “influencers” or “travel bloggers”, a species so keen on showcasing faux luxury, attempted haute couture fashion placed within inappropriate contexts and banal photography to an unknown audience. We have travel bloggers who desperately believe to be on set of a Vogue shooting amidst their mediocre trips, completely disregarding the true potential of an authentic experience abroad. But then another phenomena is at play, where locals begin adapting to their visitors’ needs and create “instagrammable spots” or Western inspired clothes. We have over-commercialization at play turning cultural honeypots into dystopian theme parks (or perhaps Banksy’s Dismalands). So if countries begin adapting to tourists to boost economy, then what remains? Is it ethical to say that social media, influencers or simply, superficial travel is leading to a death of culture? For example New York is a culture pot, yet not all countries are. Not all places are meant to be globalized since globalizing is homogenizing and homogenization is conformity. What about the average tourist? How far does this phenomena go? When I was at the Goa Gajah temple in Ubud, also known as the Elephant Cave, my experience was swallowed by flippant travel and visitors. The temple is carved into a cave and inside it, are Lingas, aniconic devotion objects for Lord Shiva, hence making this a Shaivite temple. Yet to actually see the temple inside proved to be a challenge. It was an uphill battle as endless tourists were obsessively taking photos at its entrance and ending it at that. 1 in 20 visitors actually had the interest of going inside the cave instead of superficial photos on the outside and that simply baffled me to say the least. Imagine 20 people in line in front of an ancient structure. Imagine 20 people in line in front of an ancient structure whose story, whose history they know nothing about. Imagine 20 people in line in front of an ancient structure just for a solo photo. Imagine. How is it that imagining is now reality? Perhaps willful blindness and ignorance have become pervasive and entrenched in our society because it seems that lately, we only do places and rarely experience or learn. So I ask, is it insensitive to say that tourism kills culture when it seems that tourists are not even remotely interested in the culture they’re visiting as they are in its photographic and commercial appeal? I think it’s worth asking why such an effect is generated. I think it’s also worth asking why such episodes are so vaguely debated in press or mentioned in general cultural or business literature. I believe a notion of conscious travel should be developed. Not to say that photographs or creative endeavors are all “bad” in this context, as I am guilty of this as well, but perhaps after a photograph some interest beyond would be more fulfilling. Maybe traveling should return to its origins of exploration, where purpose, meaning or fulfillment were sought on a very general level. Perhaps when visiting, some prior research should be done on local customs. Perhaps when visiting Muslim countries, short dresses shouldn’t be in your repertoire. Perhaps when visiting Bali, some petite knowledge on their religion might be useful when interacting with a place so closely linked with its faith and way of living. Perhaps… 1.Gajah Temple Lingam — In Hinduism, the Lingam (or Linga) is an aniconic devotion object for Lord Shiva. It mainly centers around its generative power and is generally found in Shaivite temples (temples dedicated to Shiva). In the Mahabharata and the Puranas (ancient Hindu Sanskrit texts) the lingam is a phallic symbol of Shiva. The Linga is generally placed within a cylindrical structure, the Yoni, meant to symbolize the goddess Shakti. Together, the Linga and Yoni embody the the union of male and female and thus the totality of existence. 2. Tirta Empul Temple — Hindu Balinese Holy Water Temple, famous for its ritual of purification from its holy springs, said to be created by God Indra. Indra’s story revolves around his lustfulness. There was once a beautiful woman named Ahalya. She was sent to live with a sage until she came of age. Once reached, Brahma (the highest God) married her to the sage yet Indra grew furious. He tried seducing Ahalya but failed up until he assumed the Sage’s appearance and tricked her. Once the sage found out, he cursed Indra by having his body adorned with over 1,000 vaginas. Indra’s predicament became tragic so Brahma morphed the curse to 1,000 eyes instead …"
Medium.com,Life,Backpacking Europe: 10 Observations of a Novice Traveler,Travel,https://medium.com/@itsjonsantiago/backpacking-europe-10-observations-of-a-novice-traveler-6fa01eee253f?source=topic_page---------743------------------1," I arrived at my gate breathing heavy and sweating through my clothes. Sprinting through an airport because you’re running late will do that to you. Trust me, it’s not an ideal state in which to begin a transatlantic flight. Only the gate agents remained when I arrived. Every other passenger had already boarded Norwegian Flight №7068. I was the last. But the frantic rush to catch my flight on time did serve one good purpose. It kept me distracted from the gravity of the moment. After stowing my backpack in the overhead bin and then taking my seat, reality set in. “Wow, I’m leaving America for a very long time,” I thought to myself. I had always wanted to travel but never had the gumption to do it. Seeing the world seemed like something that was always out of reach. In my mind, cost would always be a barrier to entry. But then I read a book called “Vagabonding” by Rolf Potts. In it, I learned about the concept of long-term travel. By committing months or even years to a trip, travel could actually be affordable. Thus, this 10-hour flight from Oakland to Stockholm began a seven-and-a-half month trip. The journey was the first of its kind for me. I had never spent nearly this much time on the road. Until that point, some weekend adventures and a few work trips here and there were the extent of my travels. I learned a lot during my half-year backpacking Europe. Some of what I gathered was unique to the places I visited. The rest were universal lessons, applicable to other adventures abroad. As a first-time traveler to Europe, here are some of the observations I gleaned. Cities like London and Paris top the itinerary lists of most travelers to Europe. They visit these places expecting to witness some semblance of medieval times. Yet, what they discover is the opposite. The most popular parts of Western Europe are modern. In fact, they’re not much different from what you might find on the East Coast of North America. Sure, there are cosmopolitan cities that bustle with diversity. But they have a look and feel of what you can find in the States. Go east, though, and you’ll encounter the part of Europe that you seek. In Poland, explore Krakow or Wroclaw while walking on cobblestone streets. Or visit Romania, where you’ll find Gothic castles plucked straight out of a fairy tale. These are the parts of Europe where you’ll see the continent’s rich history up close. Aside from its historic value, backpacking Eastern Europe is also quite affordable. Food, transportation, and accommodation are all less expensive than they are out west. Take the price of beer in the Czech Republic, for example. It’s often cheaper to pay for a liter of that than it is to buy a bottle of water. Now there are some exceptions. Visiting some of the coastal countries can cost a little more for your budget. For example, consumer prices are 20% higher in Dubrovnik compared to Budapest. But don’t let that discourage you. Spending more time in the former Eastern Bloc is one of the easiest ways to extend your trip. Before backpacking Europe, I wondered if communication would pose a problem. After all, I could only speak English, plus a little high-school level Spanish. But after I arrived, I realized that none of my worries were necessary. Aside from the United Kingdom and Ireland, much of the continent speaks English. And as you travel east, it’s not uncommon to meet Europeans who are bilingual. In fact, I often found that most people under the age of 35 to 40 could speak English. This made me a little envious. In the U.S., we learn other languages in school, but it’s rare that we put them into practice. In Europe, it’s the opposite. Many Europeans learn English and also put it to good use. They see being fluent in English as a valuable skill to have. In general, Europeans aren’t home bodies. Armed with an ability to speak English, they’re actually frequent travelers. It’s not unusual to run into your fair share of Europeans while exploring their home turf. Gap years are common, and student exchange programs like Erasmus are standard. Traveling at a young age is an integral part of European culture. Many Europeans know that they’ll have plenty of time to climb the professional ladder. Therefore, it’s customary for them to dedicate a part of early adulthood to traveling. It’s not hard to find accommodations these days. You can enjoy the luxury of a hotel or the residential comfort of an AirBnB. Free lodging is possible too, thanks to Couchsurfing and volunteer work. But if you’re backpacking Europe, staying in a hostel is an essential part of the experience. Hostels can keep your travel costs low. They’re also prime grounds for meeting other like-minded backpackers and making brand new friends. Hostels get a bad rap from people who’ve never tried them. They knock the idea of sharing a dorm room with strangers. Or they question cleanliness and safety, too. But today, these issues are rarely a problem. Thanks to the internet, reviews hold hostels accountable for providing a comfortable stay. Staying in hostels immerses you into a community of travelers. You’re all backpacking Europe at the same rapid pace. You’re all trying to experience as much as you can in the limited time that you have. So as a result, it’s not unusual to see some of the same faces from country to country. It’s helpful to be part of this community, especially if you’re backpacking alone. There’s an open exchange of ideas of where to visit, places to eat, and things to do. Seeing a few familiar faces provides some certainty on what’s bound to be an overall uncertain journey. This was a tip I learned from my AirBnB host in Rome. But it’s proven to be valuable in any major city I’ve gone to since then. If a restaurant has hired help whose sole job is to convince you to come inside, don’t do it. Keep walking, instead. The best places let the quality of their meals speak for themselves. Meanwhile, it’s the bad restaurants that resort to these cheap tactics. They’re the places that often serve undercooked and overpriced food to unsuspecting tourists. It’s also best to avoid any establishment with embellished displays of food. Take some gelaterias in Italy, for example. The good ones showcase their gelato in a modest way. But, the bad gelaterias do the opposite. Their gelato containers often feature mountainous displays to capture tourists’ attention. Falling for this trick can often mean the difference between tasting a great scoop of gelato and a disappointing one. While backpacking Europe, prepare to feast on some of the world’s best cuisine. But don’t expect to eat large when it comes to breakfast. Instead, save some room for lunch, which is often the most important meal of the day. In Spain, order the menu del dia. Every restaurant serves this inexpensive and filling, three-course lunch. The meal even comes with a drink, too. After you’re done, you can enjoy one of Spain’s best traditions: the afternoon siesta. Italy’s not that different, either. Starting at 1 p.m., many businesses and schools shut down for a few hours so people can go home for a midday meal. And like Spain, Italians eat a hearty three-course lunch, also. Backpacking Europe is a rite of passage for most first-time travelers because it’s so easy to get around. Whether by train or car, ground transport in Europe is affordable and convenient. Coming from the States, I welcomed the change of pace to travel by train. I often relied on The Man in Seat 61, a website that’s all about rail travel, to plan my routes. Traveling by train is cozy and allows you to admire Europe’s scenic landscapes. But I also enjoyed traveling by bus and car. Companies like FlixBus cost a fraction of the price and have coaches that are as comfortable, too. Meanwhile, carpool services like BlaBlaCar connect travelers with drivers headed the same way. I used it in Spain, riding from Granada to Madrid in three hours for less than €15. Since all European cities are walkable, it’s also fun to explore Europe by foot. You’ll never regret the hours you spend wandering aimlessly around European cities. In fact, some places (like Florence) are awkward to drive through because of such narrow roads. In Europe, budget carriers usually cost a half or third of what a passenger pays on a standard airline. It’s not uncommon to find flights that cost around €10 one-way while backpacking Europe. In fact, that’s the price I paid to fly from Warsaw to Stockholm at the end of my trip. Of course, there are drawbacks, too. Budget airlines in Europe operate from airports that aren’t the main hubs. As a result, you’ll often pay for further transportation to the city you’re visiting. Budget airlines also nickel and dime you for check-in baggage, too. But the sacrifices are worth it, considering how much culture you get to experience. Backpacking Europe is a great introduction to travel for any first-time vagabonder. It will alter your perception of what’s absolute. And, it will transform how you see your place in the world. You won’t notice some of these changes after your trip is over. But when you’re in the midst of the journey, savor the experience. By doing so, you’ll discover delight in some of the most unexpected circumstances."
Medium.com,Life,Facing my fear in Montana,Travel,https://medium.com/publishous/facing-my-fear-in-montana-7e4f3193c1c3?source=topic_page---------744------------------1," I have always had a fear of snakes, and I am not even sure why. But in places like in the wilderness of Montana, a rattlesnake is something you should fear. Medical help is hours away, and that is even if you can get a phone signal — and you probably can’t get a phone signal. A rattlesnake bite in this scenario would likely be fatal. Buy my fear has never been the sensible rational kind. It was a fear of the unknown. It was a fear of what might happen. Many times I have not gone somewhere, or not taken a chance, because of what might happen. But this day would be different. I was exploring Montana and it was one of the hottest days on record. Pictograph Cave State Park near Billings, Montana. has paintings that are thousands of years old. There are three main caves along a path, about half a mile from the welcome center. The main path was wide and safe even for a person afraid of snakes. The first two caves had big openings and were fairly easy to get to. The third one was a bit steep and had bushes with leaves blocking your view of the ground. A great place for a snake to hide, and a great place to not see the snake until you had already stepped on it and been bitten. To the rational mind that should mean not being foolish and taking the necessary precautions. To the fearful with a snake phobia, it means getting the heck out of there fast. I had already been through two of the caves and had nice pictures of the Petroglyphs made thousands of years ago. The third cave would be more of the same. It was hot and I was out of water. The third cave was not even rated highly in the travel guide, with the second one being best. So there is a whole bunch of real sound excuses to not go to that final cave. No one would blame me if I just passed it by. I would not get any better pictures than what I already had. I looked up at the cave, then looked back down the main path. I shrugged and started to head on down the path, but I realized I was feeling fear. Yes, I had some good excuses not to go. But dammit. The real reason I was passing it up was fear. I was afraid of what “might” happen. One of the few lines of Shakespear that I know crept into my mind as I stood there debating with my fear. “A coward dies a thousand times before his death, but the valiant taste of death but once.” What I know about snakes is they do not “want” to bite people. They would just as soon let you walk by and go on about their business. They will retreat when they see humans coming if they can, and that is the key. They will only bite you if they feel threatened, or if you are standing on them. Yes I know that is the truth, but … fear was still there. It was pretty hot, maybe 100 degrees. Any snake with any sense is in the shade somewhere sleeping. It was time to take on the fear and get to that third cave. My heart pounded and there was even more sweat. But having confronted the fear and brought it out into the open at least in my own mind, made this a no turning back moment. Yes, I was afraid, but I knew I would hate myself more if I gave into fear now. I wanted to make sure any snake in the area knew I was there and hoped conventional wisdom was right. I threw rocks into the bushes, kicked rocks against each other, making whatever noise I could. I found a stick and beat on the bushes to add to the noise. Then just to calm my nerves a little bit I started singing. There was no one around, so I sang loud. I made as much noise as I could with my feet as I walked the little side trail. In less than a minute I stood at the opening of the cave. The Petroglyphs were not all that impressive. Probably the least impressive of the three, but it’s the one I remember. I stared fear in the face and did not blink. I realized I was breathing hard and felt like a weight was off my shoulders. I felt like an internal victory was won. I walked back down the path not even thinking about what might happen. When I got back to the welcome center my wife asked me why I was smiling. I shrugged and said the caves were cool. I am still afraid of snakes. I still take precautions, but I don't feel the dread of going places they might be anymore. My overall confidence level increased a bit as well. The answer to fear is to just do it anyway. It is not always simple, but fear is an enemy. What has fear kept you from doing?"
Medium.com,Life,Dating For Plane Tickets,Travel,https://medium.com/outspoken-by-sugarfuzz/dating-for-plane-tickets-b97aa9c26ff5?source=topic_page---------745------------------1," The Broke Girl’s Guide To Free Travel When I see young, single women complain about not being able to travel because it’s too expensive I think, “Come on girl! Hop online and get some guy to buy you a ticket and go for free.” It’s not hard if he’s excited to meet you. It’s pretty easy to get a guy to fly you out. I could be on a beach in Miami next week if I really wanted to. Between 2014 and late 2017, I dated to travel. Sounds exhausting I know but I had fun hopping around the country meeting new people and having experiences I didn’t have to break the bank for myself. I live in a state where, unless you’re an outdoors person, not much is going on. And for a woman who loves being in larger, more diverse cities and near water, I have no choice but to travel. I wanted to get out. So, I decided to maximize my experiences on dating sites to actually check off something on my bucket list I was too broke to do, travel. I used the free sites I could and paid Tinder’s ridiculous monthly fee so I could swipe all over the country. Why meet some local guy for dinner when I could meet a guy in San Francisco or Vegas and not spend a penny? Although I had several calls and video chats with these guys as a safety precaution, flying to their city was the first time I met some of them in person. Trust me, it’s not as scary as it sounds. I had fun on The Strip in Las Vegas; shopped, dined, and took in the sights in New York, Beverly Hills, and Scottsdale; strolled the Santa Monica Pier and spent a day at Universal Studios in Burbank; boated on a lake in Charlotte, NC; took a plane ride over my fave city San Francisco; and spent a week having the time of my life in Mexico. I didn’t pay for my passport nor did I spend a dime on any costs. All of those trips would’ve cost me thousands of dollars had I went on my own. If that’s not being savvy with other people’s money I don’t know what is. I didn’t have to go into debt or lose any savings traveling places someone else was willing to foot the bill for. And in this culture of consumerism and rising costs, you’d be a fool to pass up free opportunities. Travel is increasingly expensive and you can almost forget it altogether if you’re raising a family. Sure, there’s sites dedicated to helping you get the cheapest deals but it doesn’t change the fact that most people have to spend months saving up to go somewhere. I say don’t stress yourself out if you don’t have to. Help some guy spend all those reward miles he’s been saving and still isn’t using."

This is what our trip looked like. Months ago, my partner and I planned out a vacation — our first real vacation since our honeymoon five years ago. For the first time in five years, we both had full-time salaried jobs and could take two weeks off work without bringing financial ruin upon ourselves. We settled on San Juan, Puerto Rico. It was a place I’d visited and loved back in college, back before Hurricane Maria, before a yearlong power outage, before the current U.S. president threw paper towels into a crowd. My memories of the place from that trip were vague: the constant symphony of coqui frogs, nightly parades leading up to a local election where people threw hard candy from the back of pickup trucks, trying to explain in Spanish to a pharmacist that I had pink eye and needed antibiotics, garlicky and delicious mofongo that was like a mystical dish I would never find again. I wanted to go back. We weighed the decision carefully. As mainlanders, we would be going with a certain amount of privilege. While we share the same U.S. citizenship, we are able to vote and have a say in how we are represented. We also didn’t want to be disrespectful in visiting a place that was still recovering from a natural disaster. While we struggled with the implications of vacationing in Puerto Rico, we finally decided that we would strive to do what we always do: support local businesses. Less than a week before leaving for our vacation, protests broke out in Old San Juan, just ten minutes from where we would be staying. Puerto Ricans took to the streets calling for their governor, Ricardo Roselló, to resign. He had taken office two years prior at a time when Puerto Rico was struggling with debt and all-around economic crisis. Unemployment and education cuts grew under Roselló. This compounded with the devastating effects of Maria and the energy crisis were fuel to a fire, and the spark that lit the fire was Telegramgate. That’s when the protests begin. Screenshots of a chat of which he was part were released to the public that showed him making sexist, homophobic, and threatening comments about other politicians. They also confirmed what many already suspected: that there was corruption in his business dealings. In the ten days before we were scheduled to fly to San Juan, we followed the news and media coverage of the protests. I reached out to our host to confirm that it was still okay for us to come. We were less concerned about our own safety (we live in a city that has regular protests and in a country with insanely high gun and domestic violence rates); it was more that we didn’t want to come voyeuristically as a resistance unfolded. We are politically engaged at home, and we have our own issues that lead us to protest. However, we didn’t want to wander through Old San Juan looking at shops, exploring historic sites, and drinking cocktails ignorant of the resistance happening around us. We weighed the decision yet again: could we enjoy ourselves in a place that has dealt with so much power inequality? Or would we be complicit in the inequality? Our host reassured us that we were coming at a “peaceful” and “historic” for Puerto Rico, “for our people,” she said. The day after we arrived, we went out to dinner at the nearby strip of restaurants and shops on Calle Loíza. Signs of the resistance were everywhere, from a giant black flag waving over Ocean Park that read “RICKY RENUNCIA” to the flyers comparing Ricky and his friends to basura. At dinner, the televisions were playing the news. My Spanish is rusty, but I had enough to translate the headlines to my partner — Ricky was to make a big announcement that night. This was likely in response to the fact that the Puerto Rico Legislative Assembly had announced earlier that day that they would proceed with impeachment related to his misconduct. No sooner had I spoken the headline aloud in English that the entire dynamic of the restaurant changed. The bartender dug around for several remotes, turning off the music and unmuting the television. Bodies shifted, no longer interested in their drinks or food but searching the screens for Ricky’s appearance. Instead, bodyguards emerged from the baby blue and white doors of La Fortaleza and a man in a suit who confirmed what the headline implied, that Ricky would announce his resignation that night. We stayed at the restaurant for an hour after that man returned inside La Fortaleza. The news coverage that followed just focused on the doors, unmoving. Finally, we wandered down the street to a nearby bar that also doubled as a barbershop. It was quiet, just us, a bartender who fluidly switched from English to Spanish to making smoky Old Fashioneds, and a middle-aged couple from San Juan. They were tuned in to the same news coverage of La Fortaleza’s front doors. Someone appeared, but it was the first lady letting the dog out. Both she and the dog went back inside, and the doors stayed closed. Nothing had changed. We all sat at the bar together and the couple jokingly said, “Ya se fue” — he’s already left. Hungry to be part of momentous occasions, I stayed until John Ray finally convinced me to walk home, after all, this was not our resistance. Back in our little apartment, Ricky still hadn’t formally announced his resignation as of 11:30pm. We both doubted he would go through with it. The next morning, we awoke to the news: he had promised to step down effective 5pm on August 2nd, the day after our flight home. The protests in Old San Juan turned to celebrations, and all of our Uber drivers and servers talked to us about their experiences with the protests, with the resignation. We visited Old San Juan, or El Viejo as it was called, that day. I felt energized by the signs of protest. It was intoxicating: magnificent art, graffiti on walls and monuments (even ones that had nothing to do with colonialism or corruption as far as we could tell), flyers, policía. While I initially looked at the signs of protest with rose-colored glasses, John Ray pointed out to me that I was glossing over broken windows, a piece of plywood spray-painted with “gringos cochinos,” and the messages wishing death on Ricky. Resistance is rarely clean and simple. We stood at the intersection of Calle de la Resistencia and Calle del Revolución, at the entrance to La Fortaleza, barricaded and heavily guarded as a young boy sat on the barricade and waved a Puerto Rican flag, a man with a cup of coffee shouted for the governor to come out. At another gate to La Fortaleza, we watched as an SUV readied to leave La Fortaleza and everyone seemed to be drawn in — news anchors and camera crews, tourists, and locals — hoping to catch a glimpse of history in the making. All we saw, though, was a silver SUV with heavily tinted windows drive down toward a nearby park and heliport. Even with the protest crowds absent in the daylight, Old San Juan was alive with the mark of resistance. Perhaps most striking to me, though, was that nearly every Uber driver we encountered — and many bartenders and servers — was willing to talk politics with us. Our sample size is small and limited, but the locals that we discussed the situation with all agreed: Ricky needed to resign. As a mainlander in 2019, I have a hard time imagining people agreeing on any political issue much less being comfortable discussing politics with a stranger who has the power to tip you (or not). They certainly expressed differences in their opinions of how the protests were conducted — one man chose to stay home because he was worried his military training would get him in danger, another criticized the graffiti on monuments and other places that couldn’t easily be repainted, yet another offered free rides to the resistance as a way to support the protests. There was a united front, though, in the people with whom we spoke: they wanted the governor out. Resistance wasn’t far from anyone’s mind. In the days between Ricky’s announcement of his resignation and the date he had promised to resign, we joined in conversations about who would be the next governor. The line of succession was (and remains) confusing at best to me, an outsider looking in. Flyers appeared that denounced the next few people in line as unacceptable replacements. Some had been part of the chat and were being pushed out. Still, others were seen as an extension of Ricky’s corruption, which was not reassuring to anyone. We went about our trip looking for small businesses to support, cafés off the tourist path, and soaking up Caribbean sun and waves at the nearby beach. One rainy day, we watched Anthony Bourdain’s Parts Unknown episode in Puerto Rico. Notably, Bourdain filmed the episode just a few months before Hurricane Maria hit in 2017. The episode aired just a few weeks after Maria. When you examine the crushing blow that Maria dealt to the island and to an already struggling economy alongside the hope and persistence that the people interviewed demonstrated, it is gutting. It was for me anyway. Bourdain makes a great point: Puerto Rico remains a colony of the United States, one that has been made financially dependent on other countries to the point of instability. It was a cheap way to buy a country. The political unrest and culture of resistance are not new. If anything, it is as old as Puerto Rico itself, an island colonized by Spain, taken by the United States following the Spanish-American War, and consistently used/abused as a strategic key to the Caribbean. Our history of the island seems to begin with it belonging to others, which is unfair but speaks to the power imbalance that still exists. These things are all connected. That is why protesters didn’t just hold up signs calling for Ricky’s resignation; they also held up signs with only “4,645” written on them, one estimation of Hurricane Maria’s death toll in Puerto Rico. Protesters see the connection, the intersectionality of the corruption happening in La Fortaleza at the expense of over 3 million Puerto Ricans living on the island and countless more scattered to the mainland and around the world as job prospects have dried up at home. Take note, protesters on the mainland, recognizing intersectionality is so important to resistance. It’s why we can’t talk about mass shootings perpetrated primarily by white men with an inclination for white supremacy without also talking about the deeply rooted racism of our country. On late August 2nd, Ricky formally left La Fortaleza. I won’t explain here the political and legal processes that happened (and are still happening) in the days after Ricky’s resignation. Journalists have done an excellent job exploring this, and I would refer you to David Begnaud’s Twitter feed for a play-by-play of the line of succession, the loopholes, and complications of the power vacuum currently occupying La Fortaleza. As I write, Puerto Rico is on its third governor in a week, and the protests continue. We are back in the mainland now, watching as our people engage in protests that are our own. This week, the protests being covered by the media are mainly against gun violence and the separation of migrant families. On a weekly basis now, I write desperate emails to my representatives about issues I care about and usually about the ones getting media coverage at the time. I don’t feel heard. I don’t see change happening. I don’t strike up conversations with strangers about the political unrest happening in our country because we as a people are so deeply divided and hold to our political beliefs as though they are palm trees in a hurricane: bending and swaying but never snapping. As mainlanders, what can we do about the political unrest and economic instability in Puerto Rico? Is there anything to be learned from a seemingly successful movement that ousted one governor but led to (at least) two more unwanted governors to be sworn in? What does Puerto Rico’s future look like and how do Puerto Ricans want to shape their future? These questions (and so, so many more) are distracting me. I still struggle with my role in Puerto Rico’s resistance and future governance. I don’t have the answers, and I frankly never expect to. The situation in Puerto Rico is complicated and hundreds of years in the making. I do think this event is worth watching and developing opinions about. I firmly believe more mainlanders need to be aware of Puerto Rico’s history, of the ways the United States created dependency, and of the power and passion of los boricuas. We should ask our representatives to think about these issues and develop political stances related to Puerto Rico’s future. Mainlanders, take note that a united people with a comprehensive understanding of the intersectional corruption happening in their home effected change. Governors and leaders can be called on to resign, especially when corruption and bigotry are fundamental. Mainlanders, I know you are tired. I know the protest in your heart has been happening for too long, but think of the islanders. Think of the people dancing in the streets, of the children waving flags at the intersection of the resistance and the revolution, of the massive black flag with the message “RICKY RENUNCIA” that appeared almost overnight, of the people banging pots and pans on their balconies, of the lone man and woman shouting into megaphones outside the legislative assembly’s building and calling for their accountability in this mess, of the handwritten sign that just said “4,645,” of the beautiful street art that screams its message, of the movement to make up lost revenue at local Old San Juan businesses, of the taxi driver offering free rides to the resistance because he couldn’t be there himself, of the people who have been told for hundreds of years that they are not capable of governing themselves or managing their own economy or being independent. They are tired, too, but they have not given up. Puerto Rico is strong, and if you aren’t paying attention, now is the time. It is not our civil unrest, but it could be. It can be."
Medium.com,Life,ČinČin — Ljubljana,Travel,https://medium.com/@britta79/%C4%8Din%C4%8Din-ljubljana-25213d96ebbf?source=topic_page---------748------------------1," My current drug of choice is travelling to a region as yet uncharted (by me), devoid of expectation — an immense challenge with today’s media saturation. At times, it proves to be a calming narcotic; at others, a muted adrenaline shot. I had no expectations of Ljubljana or Slovenia, my mind a tabula rasa in relation to this Balkan land. Google informed me the area is renowned for its cuisine. Slovenian wine has also apparently gained a reputation. Yet, as a globally known tourist destination, the region appears fresh. If you are a bon vivant (cheap replica or actual), or relish weak moments of gluttony as I do, this is a place to draw arrows around on your map. Ben is my partner in travel crime and enjoyment of ‘John Coffee’ (our term for caffeine) and IPAs across the globe. He and I frequented a venue called ČinČin Tobačna while in Ljubljana. We happened to pass it upon arriving and leaving our accommodation — rather convenient, it turns out, like the hotel buffet breakfast you keep returning to. Theoretical travel plans morphed into lazier realism. But more so, it was a venue we enjoyed and we would have traversed the city to return to. Perhaps I felt a vestigial kinship with ČinČin. A few lifetimes or Gregorian calendars ago, I worked in a bar. A few, actually. They weren’t classy affairs, but the experience taught me many things. Perhaps it also corrupted me a little. But only in vices. I always adhered to my morals. It was the late nineties. Garish-coloured drinks. Bourbon and coke. Vodka and orange. Vinyl posing as leather. Bleached hair, not as stark as in the eighties, but destined to become the ombre of the early 21st century. Bourbon and coke. Dance music posing as techno. Fluoro glowsticks. Belts for skirts. Crass saloon bars. All not even worthy of kitsch, just tacky. All that ČinČin is not. It is no doubt a bar established primarily for students, but the patronage spans all ages. ČinČin is the type of bar where love-locked eyes cross through an elegant trail of smoke, not intoxicated drooling and stumbling. Where there are no hamster angles; all angles are the attractive side. Words such as ‘soliloquy’ and ‘prose’ are exchanged. Glasses are chinked, not spilt. Waiters stride and deftly work their drinks trays like tools. I don’t intend to mislead; ČinČin doesn’t fall into classic or elegant or classy. Beyond elegance becomes pompous anyway. It’s rough around the edges, intelligent, unashamedly hip and yet sophisticated only in the ways it feels it needs — good qualities in both bars and men. In another country or city, ČinČin may have felt so uber cool that I would have avoided it, but here I felt as though it captured a part of Ljubljana; it provided a taste of what the city is all about. This city has rightly earned a ‘hipster guide to’, whether they rest comfortably in this premise or not. Ljubljana is saturated with trendy eateries and bars and thus reminds me in many ways of my home, Melbourne, Australia. They treasure their history and heritage, admirably maintaining their architecture, monuments and culture. To most, there would be nothing quintessentially Slovenian about ČinČin, but this is where we sit. This is where we learnt that zdravo is hello and hvala vam is thank you in Slovene. This is where the noun, Slovenia, grew wings for me. Okay, along with a food festival, the Ljubljanica river and some other venues. The front doors to ČinČin are an abstract of absinthe and red, a scarlet hue reminiscent of the carnation that is Slovenia’s national flower. The car parking areas surrounding the venue were intermittently crazy, which seems to be a common theme in Ljubljana. Parking here is more a game of stacks on than soldiers in a row. There is no order. Pray you aren’t the first in; otherwise, plan to not move your car for a long time. A long row of bicycles out the front is an indicator of Ljubljana’s love of cycling around its treasured heritage streets and alleyways. A handful of university students at the outdoor tables were consuming coffee and beer on this day — at 10am, to be precise. Anything goes here for consuming and imbibing and it seems to defy the laws of Darwinism: retired couples drink shots alongside their morning coffee; slender women enjoy ice cream at ungodly hours, always. Inside ČinČin, the tunes were a rotation of classic rock and what I assume to be Slovene pop. Tastes of traditional Slovenian folk music can be detected within some of the modern tunes played. A hint of tobacco seeped in to the venue from the outdoor patrons. This odour combined with the aroma of short, long and all-crust pastry baking and with an intoxicating, subtle floral aroma. The location of a nearby 24-hour bakery had been circled on a map by our accommodation’s reception clerk. He had drawn many circles on the map. A legion of circles and no text. A waxing lyrical on Ljubljana that I was destined never to remember and many circles on a map and no text. It is currently May, so the floral odour may have been from linden trees, some located not far up the street, their flowers blooming through May and June. Slovenians treasure the linden tree, known as LIPA. They create custom linden flower honey (beekeeping is prolific across the land), and they dry the flowers and make bespoke handmade products and herbal tea reputed to improve health. For Slovenians, the archetypes of the linden tree span health, fertility, romance and justice. An à la carte of virtues. I was trying to snort in this divine mutant tobacco-baked goods-floral aroma while remaining socially acceptable. That odour represented the ambrosial experiences across the town that were yet to be experienced. I am a novice food and wine buff and I am not interested in climbing any ranks. My taste buds are at times libertine and not always in unison with my morals or my head. I probably represent exactly 82.5% of the population (who really knows?) in that I enjoy most things, but I enjoy most things done well. With love and care and sanitary utensils, and dedicated hands (that are likewise sanitary). So if you fall into this percentile, if you’re a purveyor of edible things, then you will embrace the food and beverages that Ljubljana puts on its tables. I had learnt quickly in Europe that it was easiest to order a cappuccino rather than a latte. Although in Melbourne a plethora of coffee options are available and a simple latte suffices, in Ljubljana a latte is not available everywhere, although a cappuccino is universally recognised. Likewise, Ben reverts quickly from ordering a long black order to enjoying an Americano. Or an espresso is a good fallback when a watery black soup is served. Melbourne has, no doubt, reared both of us to coffee snobbery. It’s a curse at times, and we struggled initially with the widespread use of pod machines around Europe. Coffee in the morning is sacred time and a pod is sacrilege while on holiday. Our need was sated when we arrived at ČinČin, the quality caffeine fix a welcome respite for our xenophobic Melbourne palates. I would happily order a Kava s smetano again, and a standard Bela kava was also enjoyable. Minds break many rules and judge wholeheartedly. Over a cappuccino, mine was assessing the physical appearance of Slovenes. Yes, I was objectifying. The bar staff at ČinČin are primarily male, and, as it turned out, a suitable typecast of the Slovene male in all his glory. Slovene women present confidently and are refreshingly comfortable in their natural beauty. Fashion is unique and varied, not saturated by trends. Up a steep flight of steps cum ladder sat a Slovene femme fatale at her proverbial zenith. Not sure if she owned the entire hood, the student region we were in, solely the venue or none of these, but I trust her name would be Daria or Alina or something else reminiscent of running a large-scale cyber attack on any entity threatening her people’s right to consume Alkoholna pijača whenever they desired. My eyeballs now in a relationship with her from my lower peasant vantage point, I coaxed Ben to trigger my memory for the name of the TV series about Americans and kompromat and that awesome Romanian girl who is revolting against clichéd government-driven gagging of civilians. My brain is a constant victim to the Mandela Effect — it opts to fill in gaps in reality. I needed to know this program. As she was her, in looks anyway. So freakishly similar. Oblivious to our presence, she was glued to a laptop covered in stickers reminiscent of a student’s. This was, after all, a venue surrounded by educational institutions. The art on the walls of ČinČin is organic with an air of patriotism and perhaps even a hint of rebellion. Along with Serbia and Croatia, Slovenia made up former Yugoslavia. Slovenes only gained their independence as a sovereign nation in 1991, not without an uprising and civilian conflict. So, no surprise that remnants of unrest are evident throughout the city. Slovenian history is rich in fables, yet also roughened over a long expanse of time with unrest and political turbulence. This unique past of the abrasive, the mystical and the patriotic results in the Slovenia of today. Slovenes continue to treasure their many art-forms, markedly literature, evident also by their national culture celebration, a public holiday known as Prešeren Day, revering the nation’s most renowned poet, France Prešeren. For current affairs, The Slovenian Times offers a monthly issue in English. I was still entranced by the wall-art and wondering if one piece resembled their ‘kozolec’, a Slovenian hay rack, usually constructed of wood, now also regarded widely as a national icon. Perhaps just in my head. How the hell did I know what a kozolec was? I’m rather good at absorbing the random and pointless. Our dedicated and polite bartender, let’s call him Jožef, served two soda waters (mineralna voda) to follow our coffees. He was reserved yet friendly. No fluff, but always helpful and happy to snap into English in any moment. He was a taste of the generally pleasant, conservative yet congenial nature we would encounter during the remainder of our time here. In some areas of Europe, custom does not necessarily include smiles or pleasantries. Service that is short and blunt can leave a bitter aftertaste. Slovenians are not contentious and they get socialism right. The interactions we had while in Ljubljana were laconic yet polite. There is no eye rolling, no quiet contempt. Even a crying baby here sounds softer and more muted, like it is conscious of not being grating to anyone, even though it’s screaming its lungs out. Slovenia appears to be irreverent on how it should exist under the eyes of Mother Europe. The people go about their dailies humbly and with a superlative wisdom underlying their practices and livelihood. Their churches and institutions do not appear pious as in some regions of the world. No strict regimes or caste systems here. My European blood resonated strongly with the conscientious church bells that tolled regularly here, a sound my German mother often yearned for once settled in Australia. After exploring the city along the charming Ljubljanica river, we returned to ČinČin for an early evening pijte before retiring for the day. I was feeling a little beige. They say that when you travel you take yourself with you. Bills still exist, their weight often compounded with travel expenses. The complex matrix that is me I still carry. All that said, venturing to new regions, terrain or venues provides novel tastes, smells and experiences, at times worthy of recoiling and at times ambrosial, both unsurpassed with the groundhog of everyday life. On this particular evening, in a venue as hip and cool as ČinČin, I was acutely feeling my own calendar years. Also, as we were only a few days into our trip, I was finding it difficult to fully drain work from my system. I perused the menu, a gospel in this moment. I requested a blended elixir from the most attractive bottle on the shelf. Note: not the most expensive looking, just the most attractive — I’m a sucker for packaging. So, my escapism of choice while my roaming eye noted all the spritely, young, attractive females and males within and without was whatever was in that most attractive of bottles (which I couldn’t read from a seated position, or perhaps because of my increasingly dubious eyesight). The suns and moons we experienced in Ljubljana allowed the human I was devoid of through the everyday back home to leach back into my being. So it was. And it was grand. My blended drink turned out to be a Negroni. Lovely, but a touch, or mile, too far on the bitter side, appropriate for an element of my current mood. I regret that we didn’t delve into any of the local distilled options. Zganje is the generic Slovene term for brandy or schnapps from fruit. Common types are slivovka (plum), sadjevec (mixed fruit), visnjevec (sour cherries), borovnicke (blueberry), brinjevec (juniper berry) and medica (honey). All varieties can be explored in more detail through a countryside sojourn (soft-tops and billowing scarves optional), with custom distilleries dotted across Slovenia. I would love to join the dots on some of their wineries and appreciate firsthand their dedicated beekeeping efforts, but alas, there was no time for that on this trip. The glassware the Negroni was served in raised my mood a few notches. Yes, glass in select forms has that kind of power over me. Along with exorbitantly high thread count sheets and dinner-plate-sized showerheads. Crystal coupes, whiskey tumblers, highballs, champagne saucers (which I like to call Josephines), chalice glasses, Copa del Balon and anything that mimics a Wilhelm Wagenfeld design… select glassware will undoubtedly make the drink taste better, a vessel made for a seltzer, the finer of which would be made by Baccarat or Swarovski. These labels, however, much too exquisite for my harlequin hands and lips. Our progressive venue-hopping over our time in Ljubljana was to reveal that many venues throughout the town stock enviable glassware, the vintage cut-crystal tumblers and stemmed varieties. Ben, predictably, ordered an IPA. The craft beer scene here arguably puts Melbourne’s to shame. On this day Ben was bittered out. We had ventured to their flagship craft brewery, Human Fish, and sampled one of their better-known IPAs, SIPA. Ben getting ‘hopped’ out had never actually happened before. So, of course, he soldiered on with another IPA. Soldier, or typical male? A bit of both perhaps. He had already enjoyed their domestic local, Laško. The Slovenian craft beer scene is saturated with IPAs with sky-rocketing IBU levels, so if IPAs are your bag, Ljubljana is your place. Hops are grown and harvested throughout Slovenia and the area’s domestic commercial brewer, Laško, makes the most of this in their production and marketing. The wines are likewise top quality. Local varieties include pinela and zelen (whites), and teran or rebula (reds). The three main wine regions in Slovenia are Posrasvska (primarily white, sparkling and dessert wines), Posavska (Cvicek — a unique sour red wine), and Primorska (white, red and blended varietals). All musing on beauty, purging, glassware and beer strength aside, my age is my age and I should embrace it. Risking written copy that may be worthy of a Pond’s Cold Cream advert, the moments you feel more (rather than less) attractive make life seem that little bit more spritely. It by no means douses any ability to enjoy a beautiful sunset or moments with loved ones, but those moments where vanishing cream feels more apt than cold cream no one enjoys. I currently had vanishing cream feels. The food, drinks, sights, culture and architecture in Ljubljana all rank high. I found, however, that it was the people that got a strong hold on me. Okay, equal bullseye with the drinks. To an outsider looking in, they are far from a bourgeois society by any definitions of the term, although they may well feel that is the life they live. Their verdant and industrious nature matches the atmosphere of the ever-growing city. They are introverted, yet not submissive. Through its history and culture, Slovenia has distilled some of the best parts of its neighbours, Austria, Hungary, Italy — Concentrated them, rendered them, sieved them and squished them into the small space which is now Ljubljana. And so, I finally remembered who the Slovene femme fatale, Daria, reminded me of: Katarina Cas, who played Sofia Vesik in Berlin Station. Almost an exact replica, and upon googling, it turns out Katarina Cas is Slovenian, not Romanian. Isn’t that fitting."
Medium.com,Life,101 Travel Tips You May Not Know,Travel,https://medium.com/@chadrwyatt/101-travel-tips-you-may-not-know-b44385d43ea9?source=topic_page---------749------------------1," I always get asked for tips on travel and it can be impossible to fit everything into a short conversation. I thought that since now I have a travel blog, I can share the top travel tips that I have learned over the years. I have travelled for over 10 years, half of that time has been long-term travel and the other half has been part-time travel. You don’t learn a lot of these tips until you make the mistakes yourself, so I am sharing these tips to help you avoid those mistakes and have the best travel experience. Plans can always change when you travel and it can be contradicting to say “don’t have a plan when you travel” because you need to have at least a little idea of what you want to do. Reasons your plans might change could be: - you might love the country so much you want to stay longer - you might hate travelling and want to come home - you might not have got the chance to see everything - meet a new group and want to travel with them - the weather might cancel your flights Having a backup plan can be anything as simple as having enough money saved to afford a flight home if everything doesn’t work out. Another example, say you book a flight and it gets cancelled but you really need to get to that destination, already have another flight prepared just in case, so if your flight does get cancelled go straight online and purchase the other flight (you will get refunded the original anyway). One of the best travel tips that I have come to learn is to take a power bank or a portable charger with you. No matter how much you think you can live without technology, the fact is that most of your life is planned on the internet. You might have on your phone, confirmation numbers, reservation details, itineraries, or come across the perfect photo op, and without juice, in your devices, you could run into trouble. I have arrived at countless places where they have no record of the reservation (the companies fault) and needed access to my phone to get a confirmation number. Without battery, I wouldn’t be able to access this. Also, this is a great idea for digital nomads who want to work outside and you can get portable chargers for certain laptops too. It can never hurt to have a copy of your passport, just in case you lose yours. It won’t work with flights but for proof of I.D., it is a useful backup. Also, in some countries international visitors are required to show passport only for access to clubs/casinos/bars, therefore taking a photocopy is much safer than your actual passport. You should also copy your visa, job references, resume, bank statements, or any other important documents you may need. I would even print a list of useful contacts such as the number to call if your bank card gets stolen, it’s just peace of mind. This made the list of best travel tips because unfortunately I don’t do it and have realised the hard way. I have paid over $400 in fees due to overweight bags. When you fly domestically or with budget airlines internationally & domestically, they will likely weight your carry-on luggage. Take Jetstar in Australia for example, they only allow 7kg combined for your carry on luggage, which is ridiculous to start with. My laptop weighs 3kg so that leaves very little room for anything else. There’s no way around it, if your bag is too heavy you will have to check it and pay a $60 fee. However, if you weigh your bag beforehand, you will know it’s too heavy and can go online no later than 24-hours before to add a checked bag for $20. It’s better than $60 after all. I know that not every airline does this so it’s up to you if you want to take the risk. When you arrive in a new country, you might need to call your hotel for pick-up or call a friend from a payphone, having change is vital. You might also get stuck at an airport and the ATM doesn’t work, it’s useful to have if you want to get some food or drink. Get enough cash to cover your transport from the airport to your accommodation and a little extra in coins. You never know if a location will accept credit cards. For American citizens, this is a given with the majority of travel credit cards. For other citizens of the world, credit cards without international fees are not very common. Thankfully there are now digital banks which pretty much cater to travellers and digital nomads so they all offer free payments abroad. Here are some of the more well-known ones: - N26 - Schwab Bank High Yield Investor Checking Account - Capital One 360 - Discover Bank The more you know about a destination the better. Learn the laws of the country, if you should tip if you can see everything without renting a car, top things to do, I could go on forever. It’s useful to know details about where you are going to so you can be more prepared and make the most out of your time there. I am not saying to learn 100 years worth of history about each city, just spend 30 minutes browsing the most important things. An example is to research whether you need a visa to enter the country. It’s different for every country and depending on where you come from, some countries give you one on arrival, some won’t let you in without one, and some don’t even require one. This is a sure way of draining all your travel money. It’s good to try new foods and treat yourself, but limit it to once every 2-weeks maybe. If you decided to travel because you want to experience all the different restaurants then this is not the best travel tip for you. It’s great to take pictures for memories or check in on social media but don’t spend every second doing it. I recently visited some of the most picturesque locations in Switzerland and witnessed people arriving and taking pictures/videos walking out of the coach and didn’t put their phone down until they got back on. Obviously, you are welcome to see the world how you want but one of the best travel tips I can give is, take one or two photos, then put your phone away and actually take in what you are looking at. You should consider yourself lucky to be able to visit different parts of the world. If you are going out for the day to visit a city, go and see the things you really want to first, then just walk. You will discover so much more about the culture and find hidden gems when you walk with no direction. If you feel like an area is unsafe or don’t feel comfortable then turn around and go somewhere else. Just don’t be afraid to explore. I have come across many different coffee shops, activities, picture sports, scenery, and other cool places from just walking. I once visited Prague and walked for 17 hours, I covered the whole city and saw some places where there were no tourists at all. I couldn’t walk the next day though! So don’t overdo it. Google Maps are a great tool to have and it is definitely worth its place in the best travel tips list. You can create a custom map for every location and it allows you to mark all the top destinations you want to stop off at. You can also download them to use offline, so it works perfectly for anyone planning a road trip and ensures you don’t miss out on the essential spots because sometimes those spots are not even signposted. If you really want to go overboard and plan on a budget you can see the distance between each location and then do a rough calculation to work out an idea of how much gas/petrol will cost. Here is what one of my custom maps looks like from Switzerland. Travel credit cards come with great benefits. You can earn free access to airport lounges, over $1,000 off flights, cashback bonuses, no foreign transaction fees, damage coverage for rental cars, and so much more. It’s worth having at least 2 travel cards. Depending on who you book with, rewards programs can be a good way of earning free perks. Most of them are useful when it comes to accommodation, for example, Wyndham and Hilton Hotels have good rewards programs. If you think you will book regularly with one company, see if they have a rewards program first. A good one that I can recommend is Enterprise car rentals. They have locations all over the world and they are one of the cheapest car rental services. You never what is going to happen when you travel. Have an emergency stash in a separate bank that you don’t touch. You might need a new laptop if yours breaks, a loved one might become sick and you have to travel home, you might run out of money and have to return home, the number of reasons is endless. You will learn that when you travel it becomes easier to talk to strangers. You should never be afraid of speaking to locals or other travellers, you never know where it could lead or what tips you can get. This includes people that try and talk to you in the street. If you are visiting a country that doesn’t speak very good English, this app can make life so much easier. All you have to do is take a picture of what you want translating and it will do it automatically. Another reason to have your phone charged with a power bank! If you are paying for a service and it is not provided, you are entitled to complain. That doesn’t mean you have to be horrible or you should complain about the tiniest of things. If something is really bad complain to the manager and see how the situation is rectified. Everyone is scared of complaining but let’s say you go out to eat and get served a meal that’s cold, why should you sit there and not eat and pay for that service? The business needs to know to improve on quality and you need to get what you paid for. Economy cars are not only the cheapest cars to rent, but they are also the best on gas/petrol. I rented a car recently for 4 days and did a fair bit of driving. I didn’t have to put a single bit of gas/petrol in the car, the gauge just didn’t move. If you go out for the day, leave a credit card, some cash, copy of passport, and other important things you may need in case of an emergency. If your items get stolen while you are out and you carry everything with you then you will be SOL. Equally, if you leave everything in the room and someone breaks in, you will have nothing. Be sensible and keep an emergency stash somewhere else. This works well if you are going to book a lengthy stay. Airbnb owners are mostly normal people looking to make some extra income. If you message and ask for a discount, 7/10 times you will get a discounted rate. They might not have any bookings or have slowed down for the season and might just want to get some income. It’s worth asking. Don’t demand anything though, you should ask politely, they are not entitled to give you a discount. The world of coupon codes is very much still going strong. Before you book anything hotels, accommodation, flights, trips, go onto Google and type “ (what you want) coupon code “ then browse through all the options. Some might be hit and miss but don’t give up because there is bound to be one that works. Fresh smelling clothes everywhere you go, why wouldn’t you? You can thank me later. One of the best travel tips but also one of the most obvious! When you visit in peak tourist seasons not only will you battle through hoards of people, you will also pay more for things, sometimes double. Peak tourist seasons are peak for a reason though and generally will be when the weather is best so you will have to sacrifice something if you avoid the peak times. An example of this would be Piazza San Marco in Venice, Italy. You will pay extensive amounts of money for coffee and ice-cream compared to a coffee shop located down one of the back streets the other side of Venice. Obviously, if you want to pay the money and enjoy the atmosphere then that’s fine but as one of my best travel tips, this is to warn people that you will pay much more for eating and drinking in busy tourist areas. Some people want to take the risk, those people end up with $10,000 worth of medical bills. It could be something simple as getting sick in unhygienic countries where you need to visit the hospital and get medication. Recently an Australian woman had to pay over $10,000 for an injection because she was bitten by a monkey in Bali. The point is, you never know what is going to happen, you might not be accident prone but you can’t prevent something like a tree falling over and hitting you or catching a bug in a new location that your body isn’t used to. Even if it’s just hello, please, and thank you, be respectful and try and say some basic words back in the language of the country you are visiting. You won’t look stupid for trying, you will be respected more for trying. It also makes navigating a bit easier if you understand some basic words. One of the best travel tips I can give is to respect the culture. See my previous blog on sustainable tourism. You are a visitor in a new country which is other peoples homes, you should be painting a good picture of your native country and of travellers. This means respecting the rules whether they are written or unwritten. If you visit a temple and the religion requires you to cover up, then you cover up. If tipping is recommended, then you tip. Flexibility will not only save you money but it allows you to experience more. If you plan a trip with one date and one activity in mind, you will be disappointed if you can’t do it that day or it’s $200 more expensive than 2 days later. An example here is that if you book an expensive tour in a location, you should allow 2-days either side of that tour, if not more, because weather conditions may force it to be rescheduled. You might not have an internet connection or access to Wi-Fi. Make sure you have everything important as a screenshot. I would say to print it but not everyone has access to printers when travelling. This has made the list of best travel tips because it provides great convenience. It can take up space on your phone so I recommend downloading one area at a time and deleting after you leave. You can use the offline maps for directions when driving and walking without having to worry about a Wi-Fi connection. It’s good for a navigation system when driving. All the talk I have given about planning and having emergency plans, now I say don’t plan. It might sound contradictory but what I mean is that you shouldn’t have every flight and hotel from now until next year booked. Your plans will change without a doubt. Plan a month at a time and see how you get on. I’ve seen other blogs saying vacuum seal bags allow you to fit so much more in your case and they are the best things ever. They are not. What other people fail to mention is that yes, they might allow you to fit more in the case, but that means extra weight. So you could be charged more for your case. If not, let’s say you get to a location and they don’t have a vacuum to use. How are you going to fit all that stuff in your case now? I recommend packing cubes instead. This goes for everything in life, not just travel. Media generally picks up on the strange and terrible events that occur because it makes news and goes viral. Media is rarely going to promote a place and say it’s nice to visit because that’s boring to read. So don’t pay attention to those stupid Facebook posts about “why you should never visit Africa” they are posts written by silly people who just want their content to go viral. You will take a lot of photos when you travel, the last thing you want to happen is to run out of space and have to delete some of your favourite photos. Have a backup. Seriously, you don’t. Security lines don’t take that long and if you are worried that you will miss your flight, ask security if you can skip the line. Simple. Ditch the shower gels, buy a soap everywhere you go. They are small, compact, cheap, and do the job. You can even save the ones you get from hotels, just don’t plan a heist on the maids’ trolley. I have travelled with and witnessed people panicking about Wi-Fi everywhere they go. The first thing when sitting down in a restaurant “what’s your Wi-Fi password?” You don’t need constant access to Wi-Fi, just relax and enjoy the atmosphere and company you are in. Sometimes if you fly to a city nearby where you actually want to fly to, it can be up to $400 cheaper. You will have to travel from that city to the one you originally wanted to visit, so research that too, but it can work out much cheaper. Plus you get to see a new place. I have never understood people that waste their life sleeping. Fair enough, if you had a heavy night the night before, but try and make the most of being in a new country. There is so much more to see and do when you wake up early and make the most out of your day. This is an important addition to the best travel tips list. Don’t let any travel blog, person, or group, dictate what you do. If you travelled to a new city to visit a museum because it’s the one thing on your bucket list, but all your friends want to go out somewhere else, you go to that museum and do what you came for. You will regret it if you don’t. Even if you want to have a McDonalds for dinner, don’t be embarrassed, go and do it. This is your trip, you paid for it, you do what you like. You should make the effort with new people and try to stay social when you travel. It’s good for you and can lead to new opportunities. More importantly, though, you should never forget about your friends back home. Always try and keep in contact whether it’s the occasional message or a video call. Some friends you will lose because they won’t understand why you can’t call them every day like you used to, but that’s their problem, as long as you know you have done all you can. Not many people know this travel tip. If you want to know the best locations for pictures all you have to do is #location and see where everyone else is taking pictures. Don’t actually type “location” that was an example, you need to type the city you are in. Here we go again with the make a plan and don’t make a plan. This one applies more to when you visit a location for a short amount of time. You should make a list of all the things you want to see in that location, number them in order of most important, then start from the top. If you don’t make it to the bottom, you will be less disappointed. Try new things, make a rule that you do something you have never done before in every location. You will discover more about yourself and enjoy your experience more. If you want to get good pictures, you should invest in a reasonably good camera. It doesn’t have to cost thousands. With USB chargers, you might not struggle to charge devices in most locations but you should still have a travel adapter for the devices that need a plug and for countries that don’t have USB charging access. This universal charger is perfect and even comes with a case. This is different from a backup plan and is more oriented towards emergency situations. Do you know what to do in case of an earthquake? If you get bitten by a snake? Learn the vital things you can do in an emergency situation that will save your life. What if you lose your luggage? You will have no underwear, no clothes, no chargers, and pretty much nothing. You should have a small pack in your hand luggage that will cover you for a few days just in case. Most people should know that you can’t use a foreign sim card in a phone that isn’t unlocked. Call your provider before you leave and ask them to unlock the device to all networks. If they can’t do it then find a small electronic shop or stool that can. Like everywhere in the world, the weekend is the busiest time to do something and will likely be more expensive. You should plan all your activities in the week to avoid bigger crowds and higher fees. You should never book accommodation for a long stint. If you arrive and discover that it wasn’t as described and you feel really uncomfortable there you will then be stuck for the duration you booked. At least if you only book a few weeks, you will be able to change it afterwards. It’s always useful to know what other people are saying about a trip or accommodation etc. You should take a look through reviews to see if anyone mentions good or bad things that you want to know. For example, some Airbnb owners might not list they have a washing machine for use, which may be important for you, but someone in the reviews may write that they did have a washing machine. Don’t let one bad review put you off. Sometimes bad reviews, especially on TripAdvisor, can be fake with the intent on disrupting a business. If you see that 99% of reviews are good but one is bad, you should ignore the bad review. If you notice a trend where there are 10–15 bad reviews all mentioning similar things, then it’s likely to be true. Use your common sense on this one. In most cities, you will find that there are now bikes and electric scooters you can rent through apps. They aren’t expensive, can be dropped off anywhere, and provide a great way of getting around a city, especially if you have limited time there. Research the city before to find out which companies have them. In some countries, you may not be able to get the same contraception or it may cost hundreds of dollars more. Make sure you get the biggest supply you can before you leave and avoid running out or paying more money abroad. As one of the best travel tips, this is an important one. Sometimes people think that you are going to be able to relax and enjoy home comforts when you travel. This is far from the truth. You might only get the opportunity to enjoy a bath every 5 months, eat out once a month, live without new clothes, and so much more. You need to remind yourself of this as your travel until it sinks in. If you can’t come to terms with it, then travel might not work out for you. A spare towel is useful for accommodation where you don’t get a towel and also if you stay in a campervan and visit beaches/shower. Just take a normal towel though, regardless of the convenience that microfibre towels provide, they are unhygienic and smell. Packing cubes are a great way to organise your stuff. You can separate underwear from socks, tees from sweaters, and organise however you want to. They aren’t expensive and just make life so much easier when you pack up and unpack at every new location.

A foldable water bottle will save you even more space, check this one out. It can become easy to get lost in a new city. When you arrive at your hotel/Airbnb/hostel find out what the nearest landmark is to your accommodation. Maybe it’s a hotel name, statue, church, or anything that stands out. If you have no access to maps, this will be a lifesaver when it comes to navigating back home. Some people wonder why milk tastes horrible in different countries or meat tastes different. Your palette would be so used to the foods from home when you try foods in different countries, it will taste considerably different. This is also down to the way animals are raised, what they are fed, the processes involved in making food/drink, and much more. Just remember things may taste much different. Some places completely shut down on public holidays and they are different all over the world. If you are planning something big on a trip then you should check to see what days the public holidays are. Even if a place is not closed, it may charge double or triple the price. Anyone under 25 can receive discounted travel in Europe. This is most useful to purchase train tickets. When you see the option of booking online, it will be in the dropdown box that has adult, child, student, etc. If you decide to book in person, make sure you tell the ticket officer you need a youth ticket. Whether it’s food, an activity, a dance, or a new type of accommodation, make sure you try something different everywhere you go. If you travel to a country and stay in a hotel every time, get McDonald’s for dinner every day, go to one museum everywhere, it can become pretty mundane and you won’t get a true experience of what travel is like. “I have enough underwear when I travel”, said no one, ever. You might think 7 pairs of underwear is enough but when you realise how difficult it can be to access to a washer and dryer, plus the cost, you will begin to wonder why you didn’t bring more. We’ve all been there. This has been a hot topic in the news recently where people that are travelling are begging for money on the streets in poor countries. This is disgusting and I don’t know why anyone would find that acceptable. Just don’t do it, seriously. Local people can be very friendly to tourists and always offer a helping hand. If you are lost, ask somebody. Even in the big cities that have a reputation of people being rude, you will still find people that are willing to help. When I first started out travelling, I was lost in New York City, a person that lived there, actually approached me and asked what I was looking for, he then gave me directions, along with some tips of places to stop at. 2 for the price of 1. The best travel tip that is so obvious but not everyone listens too. The Sun is dangerous, your body can be in the Sun for a maximum of 20 minutes before you need to apply sunscreen, but you should apply it before you go out. You should also re-apply it when you have been in the water, even if it says water-resistant. Skin cancer is no joke. It takes 5 minutes to find out information about your flight. You should look up the terminal, security time, any delays, and anything you think would be useful for your journey. The last thing you want to do is arrive at the wrong terminal then have to travel 20 minutes to another terminal, especially if you are running late. Just look up the information before and be prepared. One of the biggest mistakes people make in life is judging others. People bring this trait with them when they travel and realise that they shouldn’t have. People are people and unless you get to know someone you shouldn’t judge them. This goes for travellers judging other travellers and locals. Popularity, looks, background, and all of that stuff doesn’t matter when you travel. I made the mistake of judging two people I met travelling and they became two of my best friends, it taught me a valuable lesson. I know that so many travellers would have been in a situation where they have gone shopping for groceries and then realised the struggle of carrying it all back. Tote bags make life so much easier, they are cheap, and they fit right in your pocket. You might think that the destination where you are going will never see rain, but even in the hottest locations, there are tropical storms. Take a rain jacket, it can be a really thin and compact jacket to avoid inconvenience. Have you seen the sunrise in Australia or the sunset in Bali? Did you know that you are more likely to see dolphins at sunrise times? You should wake up early and see the things that most others miss because they are laying in bed until mid-day. If you arrive at tourist destinations early in the morning too, you will get an undisturbed picture opportunity of the most iconic locations. Throwing your dirty, stinking clothes in with all your fresh new ones when you have to travel is one of the worst things. One of the best travel tips people don’t realise is to bring an extra bag for your dirty laundry. Some suitcases have one built-in, if not purchase one online. If you rent a car, do road trips, or drive a lot, a car charger is a lifesaver. You can always keep your phone plugged in when using Google Maps for directions so your phone doesn’t die. You can also charge your GoPro or any other devices you need to. It’s a handy item to have so you don’t miss out on any photo ops or get lost. Some people are scared to use public transport in a new country because they don’t understand the language, don’t want to get lost, or are scared of talking to people. Aside from walking, public transport is probably your best way of navigating a city. If you are unsure, ask someone for help. What’s the worst that can happen, really? When some people decide to go on a vacation or travel, they think that everything must be booked straight away to get the best price or avoid losing out. If your heart is dead set on a place/flight then book it. But the first thing that should get booked is the flight. From there you can even leave everything else until the day before you fly or even the day of arrival to book. So don’t book everything straight away, shop around a little and look for good deals/locations. If you really are compelled to booking all in one go, book with free cancellation so you can have the freedom of changing your mind. When I travelled to Iceland, I booked my Airbnb on the same night I arrived everywhere I went. This might not work everywhere but it was cheaper for me and it gave me more freedom, I wasn’t panicking about trying to drive 12 hours to the next city to make my Airbnb, wherever I wanted to stop I just booked a place. If you are walking around looking for tours to book, flights online, accommodation, or anything you want to spend money on. Don’t always go with the first option, even if someone grabs you in the street and tells you it’s the best price, tell them you will keep it in mind and shop around a bit more first. Don’t be pressured into buying. I recently had a tour operator tell me that I could only book this tour through them and not directly at the location. I already knew that I could book it directly at the location and she was lying to get me to pay for the tour there. Even if you have to park outside the city and walk in, there are lots of different places where you can park for free. City parking can be very expensive. Research online for free parking spots and see what other bloggers and travellers are saying. If you have to walk an extra 10 minutes but save $50 it makes more sense to walk. It’s not a good idea, it never has been, don’t do it. Just remember that you have the opportunity to travel the world and see things that some people could only dream of. Never take that for granted or complain about anything. There are certain situations where it is much better to pay for skip the line tickets online. Normally it’s when you visit really popular tourist destinations. I had to wait 4 hours in the freezing cold to get into the Catacombs, Paris because I didn’t book a ticket in advance. Knowing how to get to your accommodation is a valuable travel tip. It’s not very nice to arrive at the airport at 3 am when you are exhausted, to then have to look up how to get to your hotel and probably end up paying $50 for a taxi. If you research before if there is a train, bus, Uber, and how much they cost, what time they run, you can have an understanding of what you need to do when you arrive. Due to visa requirements and country laws, you can be denied boarding if your passport is going to expire in 6-months. Some countries allow 3-months, but it’s not worth the risk. If you have flights booked and renew your passport, remember to contact the airline and tell them the new passport number and details too. Airlines in different countries will have their own websites. You should check these for flights and potentially save money. You can still book the flight from your home location, it will just be in a different currency. Use Chrome to translate the page for you which will make it easier, then you should purchase with a credit card that has no international transaction fees. Obviously, convert the currency to your local currency first just to make sure that it is cheaper. This isn’t the best travel tip, but it’s fun to do. How many times do you scroll through your hard drive full of 100,000 pictures and look back over the memories? There are too many to do that. Make an Instagram page just for you, post all your favourite pictures, then you have that account to look back on whenever you want to reminisce. One of the most annoying things about travelling with cables is when they all get tangled up in yo ur bag. That’s why this is the best travel tip. Get a cable organiser travel case for all your wires and electronics. It makes life so much easier. It’s important to always remember why you left to travel in the first place. Some people leave and then a week later miss home so much, they go back and regret it. Take a moment to remember what gave you the urge to travel and what you will miss out on. This also applies to doing things you want to, if your dream was to parachute in Australia, then you should pay the money and do it. Don’t stop yourself because of money or other people. There are so many people I know and have met that regret not having their photo taken at famous locations. No one ever takes offence to you asking if they will take your photo, most will probably ask you to take one too. One thing that makes a photo more interesting is a subject, which would be you. I have mentioned this a couple of times already but it deserves to have it’s own “best travel tips” spot. You will meet a variety of people as you travel to different locations and will probably join and form groups where you will do everything together. This is one of the best experiences you will have when you travel but it’s important not to miss out on the things you want to do. Just because others want to do something, if you don’t want to, then don’t do it. Remember it’s your trip that you have paid for. This mainly applies to hostels and motels, but it depends on where you are and if you don’t ask, you don’t get. There are lots of locations that will let you stay for free for working the reception desk or cleaning rooms. A good way of travelling cheap. Not only is this fun but it can save money. Organise a food night or something where each person brings an ingredient and someone cooks something. It’s a great way of making friends, saves money on food, and gives you a great night. Each country will have their own sim cards that offer data, texts, and calls. Your best option is to get a pre-paid sim card where you pay money for 28–31 days worth of data and allowances. Once your time is up, it expires and you have to “top-up” to get more. Be aware that you will need a passport or I.D. and an address (use a hotel address). Do not purchase any of these devices online that offer 10GB data for $150, they are a rip-off. You can get 60–80GB in countries for $50. For those of you that don’t know, 10GB is not very much. Especially if you watch a lot of Netflix. Batteries for things like the GoPro and Drones do not last for very long at all. Purchase a couple of spare ones and keep them charged so you never miss out on the perfect photo or video opportunity. Rarely do situations occur when you travel that cannot be resolved. If something goes wrong, don’t panic or worry about it because that will cloud your judgement and affect your decisions. This is why it also helps to have a backup plan. If something goes wrong, just think about the most logical thing to do and if you are unsure, Google it. People may approach you and talk to you, just because you are in a new country it doesn’t mean that they are going to hurt you or take your money. You should always be sensible and aware of your surroundings but also go into situations open-minded and see where it leads. Just because you haven’t heard of a place it doesn’t mean you shouldn’t go there. There are 195 countries in the world, you will probably only hear about 15–20 of them. That’s not even counting the cities. The tip I can give here is to research the location before you book, just check that there isn’t an active war or outbreak of Ebola and you should be good to go. You don’t need the latest MacBook, iPhone, Nike trainers, and any other expensive items to travel. This is only asking for them to be stolen. Keep everything cheap, when you travel no one cares about “image” you should relax and spend your money on things to enjoy when travelling. This is similar to trying new things. If an opportunity arises to do something, then do it. Even if you aren’t sure, as long as it’s not life-endangering just live your best life. The most important travel tip you can take is not to rush. You might want to get around the world as quickly as possible but there are so many things you will miss out on. Take your time to experience each city and enjoy it. I have given so much advice on road trips, I have driven in Italy, Switzerland, Ireland, the UK, America, Australia, and others. When you look at the maps and see the driving distance, it’s more than likely going to take you longer. You should allow extra time for stopping off and enjoying views or attractions along the way. Also, stopping off and eating or using the restroom. There is so much to consider when driving from one location to another, I would always add an extra 2 hours on to the longer trips just to be sure.
