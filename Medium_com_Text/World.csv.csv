alidou Beidou Rachidatou rose early on a steamy May morning in Niamey, Niger’s capital, to prepare for the journey ahead. It was already 104 degrees, but the heat and fasting for Ramadan did not slow down this determined champion for public health. Equipped with a GPS tracker and her motorcycle, Rachidatou joined teams of data collectors on an important assignment to map Niger’s unmapped roads on behalf of the U.S. President’s Malaria Initiative (PMI). They were working to determine how long it takes for health facilities to receive shipments of malaria medicine and other commodities. The data collectors spent three weeks traveling to and from more than 300 health facilities, recording the health facilities’ locations and average travel time to arrive there. They also collected information on 130 supply chain performance areas, such as storage conditions, capacity, and connectivity including electricity and internet. R
achidatou is a woman on the move. At just 26, she has already seen most of Niger and traveled to six of its eight regions for her work. Even in her spare time, she can often be found walking the streets of Niamey or cruising around on the trusty moto her big brother Abdoulaye taught her to ride a few years back. She knows the country’s infrastructure challenges all too well. When asked about the most challenging aspect of her job, Rachidatou answers without hesitation, “The state of the roads! The place you’re going may not be far, but it takes forever to get there.” This makes delivering health commodities to remote communities one of the most difficult aspects of the public health supply chain in Niger. R
ural health facilities in Niger struggle to maintain enough health commodities to meet the needs of their patients. Health workers at these facilities will often resort to any method they can find to get commodities, whether it’s by taking public transport or using their personal vehicles, pulling them away from their primary responsibility of providing health services to patients. Sometimes they receive their commodities, sometimes not — it’s neither reliable nor predictable. For the supply chains that serve them, these challenges are compounded by maps that lack accurate information on the location of health facilities. This lack of information became evident after Niger became a PMI focus country in 2018 and USAID, on behalf of PMI, started working with the government of Niger on plans to distribute malaria commodities to communities as part of a USAID supply chain project. “Google Maps had some roads, but not all,” said Eric Coulibaly, USAID’s PMI resident advisor. “Some facilities looked like they were islands in the middle of a desert.” W
ithout accurate maps, it was impossible to plan delivery routes, estimate costs, or schedule deliveries. So using the data collected by Rachidatou and her colleagues, USAID mapped roads and geographic coordinates for all sites. Then they entered the information into OpenStreetMap, an open-source and editable world map used for the production of paper and electronic maps, geocoding addresses and place names, and route planning. In addition, team members worked with senior government officials to demonstrate how the data can identify more efficient and strategic models for last-mile delivery. The data collected and the modeling sessions are a first step in identifying efficiencies and solutions for warehousing and distribution that can be used to inform Niger’s national supply chain strategy. “The data create new levels of rigor and transparency for decisions related to distribution, whether it be health commodities, food, and even school supplies. It represents an investment in the country and the people of Niger, who can now accurately plan and oversee distribution based on accurate data.” — Eric Coulibaly, USAID’s PMI resident advisor As
for Rachidatou, she’s back on the road and gathering data for USAID. Passionate about her work, she appreciates the insights she’s gained in her travels on how to address the needs of small, disorganized facilities with untrained staff. She’s making sure that the Government of Niger, international donors, and local stakeholders have the information they need to make informed decisions to improve services for the people of Niger. Without her, we’d — literally — be lost."
Medium.com,Society,"Why I left the Labour Party, or: How identity politics left me questioning who to vote for at the…",World,https://medium.com/@TheParrhesiaDiaries/why-i-left-the-labour-party-or-how-identity-politics-left-me-questioning-who-to-vote-for-at-the-4e2c7d70c157?source=topic_page---------2------------------1," Much has been written about the crisis in the Labour Party and of progressive politics in general. I’m adding to it not because I claim to hold any authority on the subject, but from a compulsion to share my personal experience, and, as an ex-Labour member, because of my deep frustrations with the current situation in the party. I first voted Labour in 1997 when I was eighteen. The year a New Labour landslide general election victory ended eighteen years of Conservative rule, winning 418 seats in the House of Commons — the largest victory in the party’s history. At every general election since I’ve voted Labour, eventually joining the party in 2010. Although far from the most committed member in my local constituency, I was an active campaigner. I canvassed every other weekend and for several years participated in my local branch and constituency meetings. Being on the left of the party, I was an enthusiastic supporter of Jeremy Corbyn’s leadership challenge and joined his campaign team during the run-up to the 2015 leadership election. In the months that followed Jeremy Corbyn’s coronation, Labour tripled in size as the party attracted hundreds of thousands of new members, creating a mass movement of inspired activists ready to implement Corbyn’s bold vision for change. Many traditional Labour supporters and seasoned left-wing activists who had for years felt disenfranchised by the New Labour project either returned to or joined the party. However, the vast majority of incoming members were young, fresh to politics and ready to get involved. In early 2016, for personal reasons, I stepped away from politics for a short while, returning to party activities six months later. It was at this time with the clarity of view that only a period of absence can provide, I started to notice some unwelcome changes in the party. Looking at the new crop of activists, I could see that since Corbyn became leader, in the throng of members was an army of identitarians with a liberal agenda, who saw in Corbyn a useful blank canvas onto which they had begun to project their vested interests. The problem with identity politics is that it is inconsistent with the class politics, values and purpose upon which the Labour Party was founded. To me and to those with whom I share a political affinity, the Labour Party is first and foremost a platform for building a wide progressive consensus and a practical political vehicle by which to win elections and improve the lives of working people. Rather than uniting us under a shared vision, identity politics does the complete opposite. It puts people in boxes according to biological traits and emphasises subjective experience and personal choice above universal ideals like class solidarity. The crusade around identity politics and its encouragement of separation contradicts the unity required for the Labour Party to be an effective political force able to bring about meaningful change. Identity politics and its obsession with our differences, instead of bringing people closer together, creates barriers, whether between party members or in society in general. Identity politics is entirely antithetical to class solidarity and reduces class to just another identity, considering it only in its intersection with race, gender and sexuality. Identitarians fail to understand class is different, that class is a social relation which can bring people together regardless of their differences, biological or otherwise. For the identitarians in the Labour Party, the identity crusade is the number one battle they want to win. It replaces class politics as the primary motivation for party membership. They preoccupy themselves with language-policing and virtue-signalling, rather than striving to implement the party’s historical purpose of representing working people in government. To these activists, a fair economy that “works for the many, not the few” is a secondary consideration. By fetishising identity politics, while at the same time obfuscating on Brexit and the seeming inability to deal with its internal anti-Semitism crisis, Labour appears as if it is ignoring electorate’s desire for cultural security and has alienated much of its support base, particularly in the party’s traditional heartlands. Under Jeremy Corbyn’s leadership, the Labour Party has become unrepresentative of large chunks of Britain — particularly those parts of the country that were once the bedrock of Labour support. It has resulted in working-class voters abandoning the party and members like myself leaving, as I did in 2017 after seven years as a party member. Labour will next week release the most radical and potentially transformative left-wing manifesto in decades, promising nationalisation of the “big six”, progressive tax reform, a structured investment programme, a Green New Deal and the reversal of the austerity measures implemented by the Tories since 2010. At this “most important election for a generation”, I will vote Labour on the promise of the manifesto I’ve waited for my whole life. But I will do so with a heavy heart, knowing a vote for Labour is for a party believed to be unelectable by many of its traditional base and full of unsavoury elements more interested in challenging attitudes towards identity than in changing the fortunes of working people."

ith the following words, the President of Bolivia, Evo Morales, closed a chapter that had for the last three weeks divided the nation: “I resign from my position as president so that (Carlos) Mesa and (Luis Fernando) Camacho do not continue to persecute social leaders...” The reader can hear from afar the fear and despair that the now-former president of Bolivia experienced for the last three days. Almost all of the media outlets, including The New York Times, BBC, El País, reported this piece of history as the “resignation” or “stepped-down” of Evo Morales from power in Bolivia. For the casual reader, it might seem like the factual heading. But, the reality is immensely different, when you count the pressure that the Bolivian military and the police inflicted to the government this past weekend. Make no mistake about it, what we saw in Bolivia was a Coup d’état by the military and the police. The basis of the anti-government protests against Evo Morales was his victory in the presidential elections some weeks back (October 20). The election featured a 24-hour halt of the election results and the surge of Morales in the votes when the news came back on. The media exploited the polemic victory and were already referring to the elections as “rigged”. For Morales, it included widespread protests in the country, especially in the cities. The consensus was the following: Morales had established an anti-democratic attitude when he attempted (and fail) to change the constitution in 2016 (he wanted to run for a fourth term). Morales' ignorance of the referendum that emphatically proved that the citizens of Bolivia denied such rights and the reliance on the Supreme Court’s decision to favor him on running again, created the perception that the president was acting like a dictator. With Morales victory, the Bolivian right, and outside forces began to regroup their strategy. As a political figure, Morales was massively popular. He lifted people out of poverty, improved the economy, and made social integration in his government a priority since he came to power in 2006. But still, his anti-democratic practice with the constitution in 2016, hydrocarbon nationalization and damage to the environment proved to be good enough reasons for some form of the toppling. The first signals of such toppling where shown by the magazine The Nation before this weekend even started. Mark Weisbrot reported: On October 20, Bolivians went to the polls to choose their president and congress. Evo Morales, the country’s first indigenous president in a country with the largest proportion of indigenous people in Latin America, was on the ballot for reelection. His main opponent, former president Carlos Mesa, is vastly preferred by the Trump administration. Since Morales was elected in 2005, the US government has been hostile, and Bolivia has not had ambassadorial relations with the United States since 2009. Morales is one of the last remaining members of a cohort of independent, left presidents who have been opposed, and in some cases removed with the help of, the United States. Weisbrot goes on, in describing how the opposition, even before the elections had ended, was already crying foul. The opposition then concentrated its efforts with the Organización de Estados Americanos (OEA or OAS in English), which was already investigating the possibility of fraud in the elections. The later days proved to be decisive in the strategy of the opposition: Long before the votes were counted, Mesa had already indicated he would not accept the decision of the electoral authorities if Morales were to win. What is more surprising, and disturbing, was the press statement from the OAS the day after the election. It expressed ‘deep concern and surprise at the drastic and hard-to-explain change in the trend of the preliminary results after the closing of the polls.’ But it did not present any evidence for its questioning of the election results. As the reader might already suspect, the report that was being prepared by the OEA was the firm catalyst the made Bolivia burned for the last three days. The mere intent on investigating the accusations that the opposition was making — the blackout and sudden rise of Morales after the power came back on — ignited the right-wing apparatus to distort the news and start the massive anti-government protests. As Weisbrot reports in his astonishing article, the opposition and the anti-government protesters ignored various facts: For those who bothered to look at the data (the 34,000 tally sheets, signed by observers, are on the Web), it was clear that the increase in the share of Morales’s votes in later returns was simply a result of geography. In other words, Morales’s support is much stronger among rural and poorer populations, whose votes came in later. Such a geographically driven change in vote margins is not that uncommon in elections — as anyone who has watched election returns on television in the United States knows. And this change wasn’t even that big of a shift. The official data show a gradual change in the margin between the candidates as the mix of returns changed over time. The OAS mission pointed to a pause in the “quick count” as though it was cause for suspicion. This is an argument that no election observer should ever make. The quick count is not an official count, and does not have the same safeguards. It has never been promised nor intended to give a complete result. It is done by contractors who take photos of the tally sheets once they’ve been publicly certified by local electoral jurists, and upload the results via a mobile application so as to get partial results out faster. Still, chaos ensued, and the protests were massive. The police abandoned the government and joined the citizens. By Sunday, only the military, who Morales tried to bring to his side (remembering the long tradition in Latin American of the military fulfilling coups), was standing alongside him. Bolivia became polarized in mere days, with the opposition attacking those who favored the government and Morales. The OEA confirmed that there were irregularities in the votes and that the results should be annulled; another election must be done. Morales, trying to appease the opposition and looking for a democratic exit in this decision, decided to celebrate another election in some unconfirmed date. But the opposition wasn’t satisfied. By Sunday, the main candidate that opposed Morales in the elections, Carlos Mesa, was asking for his resignation. For the right-wing and others involved in this ousting, Morales was too popular to hold another election. The pleadings for Morales’ resignation grew in social media, while the incineration of the country continued. Various members of the president’s cabinet resigned. While opposition mobs burned the houses of governors and even Evo Morales’ sister, Esther Morales. Some sources claimed that $50,000 dollars were offered to the personal guard of the president “if they turn him over.” (This is not to say that members of Evo Morales’ Movimiento Al Socialismo haven’t done any wrongdoing. There were reports of MAS members destroying TV Stations and other properties.) The final blow to Morales' reign came from the military. Williams Kaliman, head of the armed forces asked: “After analyzing the internal conflict situation, we suggest the president of the State to renounce to his presidential mandate, allowing the pacification and maintenance of stability for the good of our Bolivia.” With the military turning its back against him, with right-wing mobs causing chaos in several sectors; plus, the head-on conflict between anti-government and pro-government protesters, the decision of the president was clear. What ensued later has been already widely reported. A power-vacuum now reigns in Bolivia, and the only ones to get a hold of it are right-wing sectors in the government and some might call fascist-like militant groups. For many in the media, the word “coup” seems illogical, for the past assures us that coups were the ones in Chile in 1973 or in Argentina in 1976. The past coups were orchestrated by the military wing of South American countries, taking power by force and establishing a reign of terror. The memories of Pinochet, Videla, and the formation of “Operación Cóndor” seem foreign to the press and to those who witnessed the resignation of Morales on Sunday. The reality, sadly, is other. It was indeed a classic case of coup d’état, with the US backing the counter-government forces, the media playing possum with the facts right in front of them and the military delivering the final blow. The military coup on Sunday varied in some distinct aspects; the military didn’t look like a last resort, who takes power by force. On the contrary, they stayed beside Morales, until the last moment. The media, with its obsession with Russia, didn’t take into consideration the US meddling in this conflict and the possibility of some backed insurgency against Morales. It is clear that Morales was — and is — afraid for his life and those close to him — by the various violent episodes that have been taking place in the country. These are the facts that make the media and some sectors of the population confuse Sunday’s coup with a “resignation”. But, on the passing moments of this glaring Monday, Veteran’s Day, the news keeps coming in, and horrors of the anti-government forces keep pouring into social media. After the Morales resignation, the former president was alerted of an “illegal” order for arrest. Even when the former leader had resigned, the right-wing forces wanted his head. Videos of several arrests have surfaced, the message is clear: those who worked favoring Morales are destined for imprisonment and torture. The “Whipala” flag, a symbol of indigenous resistance has been burned (There’s a video of the police stripping away that same flag from their uniform and proclaiming that the sole Bolivian flag is the real Republic of Bolivia). In other instances, a bible, by the religious fanatics of the opposition, has been placed over the flag. That last fact is not surprising if you consider the profile of one of the main opposition to the government, Luis Fernando Camacho. He fills all the blanks of an authoritarian leader with religious fetishes (the BBC proclaimed him as the Bolsonaro of Bolivia). Keep in mind all of these emerging facts when any news outlet wants to call this episode a “resignation” by the president. The supposed solution that those who clamor for democracy in Bolivia involves the backing of a violent, militant, and religious force, who has all the aspects of old-school Latin American dictatorship."
Medium.com,Society,The Hong Kong Protest: A Misplaced Sense of Entitlement,World,https://medium.com/@kaliminali/the-hong-kong-protest-a-misplaced-sense-of-entitlement-2c6c2e04093a?source=topic_page---------6------------------1," T
he turmoil in Hong Kong is still going on full steam. Is an end in sight? Backgrounder: During the Qing Dynasty, European countries pursued commercial opportunities in the Middle Kingdom. In order to balance its trade deficit, Great Britain aggressively introduced opium into the country. The Chinese effort to curb the widespread addiction led to battles, known as the Opium Wars, with the British. Defeated, China signed several Unequal Treaties with European countries, America and Japan, two of which involved Great Britain’s acquisition of Hong Kong Island in 1841, and Kowloon in 1860. These were followed by a 99-year lease of the New Territories in 1898. The history of China in the 19th century is replete with a great deal of territorial concessions to foreign invaders, which it has since reclaimed. In 1997, as part of the handover of Hong Kong back to China, a policy known as one country, two systems, was instituted. According to it, Hong Kong, for the next 50 years, was to be allowed a measure of liberties, like the right to free speech and assembly, while China takes responsibility for its national defense and foreign affairs. The present crisis was set off by a proposed bill that would allow charged criminals to be extradited back to China. The bill was temporarily shelved as the protests turned more volatile. That gesture proved not to be enough to quell them, so it was then altogether withdrawn. Instead of being pacified, the protesters ramped up their demands for, among other things, pro-democracy reforms and universal suffrage. On the surface, this sounds like a marginalized group of constituents mobilizing to restore its recently violated voting rights. The reality though is that there were no directly elected seats on the Hong Kong legislature until just before its handover to China. Throughout colonial rule, the governors were appointed by the British, not elected by the locals. Not only does Hong Kong not submit to the decisions of the executive government, China’s long-overdue right to rein its judicial system into the national fold is met with vociferous outcries of aggrievement. Yet, until this happens, the demonstrations will likely continue unabated. The press is giving short shrift to the curious coincidence between the liberal leanings of its judges, many of whom were educated in the U.K., and the, at best, token slap on the wrist that the agitators are almost assured of getting away with. China proposed the mini-constitution to prep the handover because it was dependent on the colony’s bustling economy to fuel modernization in the rest of the country. Although the Basic Law was ratified in 1990, all decisions have to be approved by the central government. The standing committee not only has the ultimate power to interpret the Basic Law, it has unilateral right to coordinate it with the national platform. Deng Xiaoping, its Noachian helmsman, did vouchsafe the continuance of the colony’s capitalist system. Yet, although it is semi-autonomous, historically, Hong Kong belongs to China and was never an independent country. Even Margaret Thatcher (British prime minister leading the negotiation) who sought to extend the 99-year lease, conceded the issue of sovereignty.[i] China’s sovereignty over Hong Kong in effect triumphs over any other legalese and pro-democracy rhetoric. This means the assembly has plenary power to define the range of the territory’s autonomy so that it can play its proper part in the nation. Hong Kong’s special status, conferred due to the turn of events during China’s colonized past, is not ipso facto irrevocable. The claim of the erosion of civil liberties is predicated on Hong Kong’s entrenched view of itself as especial. It is an imperious posture that positions itself as more privileged than its disdained mainland counterparts, and therefore entitled to leapfrog over the political will of the central authority with impunity. It hijacks the narrative that all local governments across the country are subject to the same prescribed common law. Sovereignty is the most compelling, consequential, and irrefutable of all the points in discussion. No amount of elegant buzz phrase posturing as “freedom” or “liberty” can sweat down this principle upon which a nation is built. At any rate, the mini-constitution was meant to last for only 50 years. Even if its scope were broadened to accommodate Hong Kong’s interpretation, it will be fully integrated into China in 2047. The protesters are merely postponing the inevitable. Although the protesters deny that they are crusading to secede from China, an activist, Andy Chan, had called for just that in a talk hosted by the Foreign Correspondents’ Club of Hong Kong last year.[ii] ………. The unrest draws the ire of the majority of those in Southeast Asia, especially in countries like Malaysia and Singapore where there is sizeable Chinese population (but generations removed from China, and who otherwise has no affinity to them.) They are disturbed by the conduct of the rabble. These are their takes: a) The rationale for the initial uprising had been removed, i.e., the government gave in and retracted the extradition bill. Instead of being appeased, they switched tactics, ratcheted up their demands and escalated the violence. Whatever tenuous justification they might have had, it is smirched by this defiance. b) The claim of police misconduct is not only outrageous but laughably hypocritical, if not for its irony. How many other police forces in the world, Asians muse, dispatch advance warnings, not once, not twice, but three times, before firing teargas into the mob? In fact, the protesters are complicit in perpetrating brawls and provoking the police into retaliation. Then they turn around and cry police brutality. They stand the call for “investigation of excessive police response” on its head, for, in the majority opinion, they are the ones holding the law in contempt. To further demand amnesty for arrested participants takes them beyond the pale of reason. c) Their smear campaign against China is a disgraceful fishing expedition to secure outside intervention on their behalf. Groveling for foreign sympathy (e.g., waving American flags en masse) is beyond humiliating. This point is especially distasteful to the Chinese community, which takes the concept of “losing face” seriously. d) Many major American media outlets are distortive in their reporting of the unrest, presenting a biased narrative to fit their own pro-democracy agenda. Freedom of press is not a license to obfuscate the facts. In a public display of censure, the U.S. is steadfastly taking Hong Kong’s side. Americans love to cheer on the underdog standing up to the exploitative tyrant. But maybe we should pause to reflect on the import of these popular opinions. Our support for Hong Kong is rooted in our deep misgivings about China. So we use the uprising to parlay our animosity into stinging criticism. We look at China with collective suspicion, a rare source of bipartisan unity. Instead of evaluating the merit of the protest in the light of China’s historical legacy, we muddy the debate with our broader grievances. We see the unrest as a potential leverage to be used to our advantage, say, during trade negotiations. It is motives such as this that hardens South East Asians’ attitude toward us. In their eyes, we have forfeited the right to criticize China. How can we accuse China of manhandling the crisis when our stratagem is to jump into the fray and denigrate our adversary? Aligning ourselves with Hong Kong in this regard is analogous to inflaming the recalcitrant child of a rival to undermine said rival. China’s sovereignty cannot be overstated. If Texas were to demand secession, would we let international opinions sway our course of actions? Isn’t it then not only naïve, but patently unreasonable to expect China to relinquish its hold on Hong Kong, or even just to tamp down its authority? We oversimplify the matter when we frame the protest as a struggle between freedom and authoritarianism. In China, no concept is free-floating on its own, but taken into consideration within a larger context. Thus, freedom is not an isolated abstraction, elevated to the exclusion of all else. Its relevance in the milieu is but one component for consideration for the broader good. Water rises or falls to its own level. For all the claim of opacity, China’s policies have done much to bring millions of its citizens out of deep poverty. Its meteoric ascent to a world-stage economic power is a phenomenon to be reckoned with. The success of its free-trade zones refutes the notion that robust economic growth is contingent on absolute freedom. But if it proves true going forward, then let China rehabilitate itself with structural reforms or risk the consequence of losing its prominence. Freedom thrives only in soil ready for it. It is not an issue for us to force. The vast majority of mainland Chinese is not complaining about any perceived lack of freedom; nor does it pose an obstacle to their pragmatic enterprise. Freedom spreads over a wide continuum. How much of it does one need in order to thrive? The Chinese are quick to point out that it is secondary to other considerations, like, e.g. peace and security. In giving up a degree of freedom, they are not passively giving up a notion without which their life is meaningless. On the contrary, unfettered freedom, in their opinion, leads to chaos. By letting buzzwords like “freedom” or “democracy” drive the conversation, we are in essence falling into a language trap. Our magnanimity renders us susceptible to just such a manipulative lexicon. But if we shake off the propaganda, we see that the protesters’ actions belie their rhetoric. Their initiatives are at war with, and fall far short of, their proclaimed objective. There is a limit to rights. In any country, the right to assembly does not extend to illegal occupations of malls, the airport and disrupting flights. It is not a permission to surround police stations; set up blockades and strikes that bring the city to a standstill; invade a government building; vandalize shops and subways; and decimate public properties. How are they advocating for democracy if they are trampling dissenters opposed to their violence, and doling out vigilante justice to vulnerable bystanders perceived to not be in total agreement with their opinions? There is a yawning gap between what they claim to believe in, and what they do. Democracy cannot work unless a point of view is not gagged for being contrary. Instead of affirming the values of democracy, they violate its central tenet. We ought to be deeply disturbed by the fact that our sympathy emboldens them on this misguided and unrealistic endeavor. We ought to be cautious about endorsing their indefensible, lawless conduct, thereby tacitly normalizing a questionable uproar. Significantly, no one has stepped up to claim leadership position, so there is no quorum to hold accountable for the out-of-control atrocities. And there are no personal narratives of hardships documenting how the alleged attrition of civil liberties stymies their daily routines. We can learn to match the Chinese — and this includes the people of Hong Kong; for all their protestation, they are ethnically and culturally one of them — in the fluidity of their thinking, and not limit our options through grudge-induced short-sightedness. We are uniquely positioned to beacon our sense of fair-play to the world. Let’s reaffirm the role. [i] Burns, John F. “Hong Kong Accord Is Signed in Peking.” The New York Times 20 Dec. 1984.

Medium.com,Society,Bolivia in Crisis,World,https://medium.com/@jimshultz716/bolivia-in-crisis-4ef2f25471ed?source=topic_page---------8------------------1," Bolivia, that country that most people never think about until it is thrust into the news, has been thrust into the global news once again. Evo Morales, the nation’s first indigenous president has been ousted from office and is in transit to self-exile in Mexico. How did it come to this? What will happen next? A set of elaborate conspiracy theories have bounced across the left wing press and social media at the speed of sound, most all of them from foreigners who have never lived there and who have no real knowledge of the country: It was a military coup engineered by Donald Trump and Marco Rubio. It is part of a secret imperialist plan to seize control of the country’s lithium. None of these reflect the actual reality of an authentic public uprising with deep roots. I lived in Bolivia for nineteen years and wrote about that nation a good deal. It seems time to write about her again. “We Don’t Want to Become Venezuela” If you are really looking for a one word explanation for what is happening in Bolivia right now, it is this word: Venezuela. For years Bolivians across all economic classes have been watching the nightmare of Venezuela — the government of authoritarian clowns, the shortages of food and medicine, the fleeing of more than four million people from the country in desperation. They have watched all this and worried how much Morales planned to send Bolivia down the same authoritarian path, and they began to see dangerous warning signs. One was what seemed like Morales’ desire to serve as President for Life. When his political party, MAS, wrote a new constitution in 2009 they lifted the long-standing one-term limit on presidents and paved the way for Evo to run for a second term. In 2014 he broke a long-standing pledge not to seek a third term, claiming that his first term didn’t count because it was served under the old constitution. He won once more. Soon after, he announced that he wanted to run for a fourth-term as well, which would extend his time in office to an unprecedented twenty years. Recognizing that the constitution prohibited him from doing so he said he would let the people decide and forced a public referendum to change the constitution once more. His amendment was defeated at the ballot box. Backtracking on his promises once again, he engineered a ridiculous decision by a packed Supreme Court that said the constitution of the nation took a backseat to Evo Morales’ ‘human right’ to run for the presidency as many times as he wished. For Bolivians across the spectrum, including many former Morales allies and members of his government, all this smelled like a blatant power grab akin to the tactics of Maduro in that failing state to their north. For years Morales and his Vice-President, Alvaro Garcia-Linera, had worked to undermine any voice of opposition from the social and indigenous movements. They sent police to repress communities marching to protect their lands. They prosecuted former allies who crossed them. In the aftermath of the court decision there were huge protests but Evo continued with his insistence on seeking another five-year term. That election was held on October 20 and as the votes were counted Bolivians saw all the signs of political manipulation once again. To avoid a runoff against his chief opponent, Carlos Mesa, a moderate and former President, Morales needed a victory margin of 10%. Suddenly, in the midst of the vote count, with Morales just under the margin he needed, the reporting stopped. Election officials would later explain that they were ordered to stop the reporting by Morales’ appointed elections chief (who would later claim she was told to do so from higher up). The vote counters also later revealed that their internet and electricity were cutoff to discontinue the counting. When the reporting began again Morales’s margin of victory had suspiciously climbed to just over what he needed to avoid a second round. The company under contract to supervise the vote cited so many irregularities that it called the results “corrupted and nullified.” A later audit of the vote by the Organization of American States concluded that the results could not be validated. A Nation Shut Down by Protest In the aftermath of the election and its tarnished vote count, Bolivians poured into the streets, effectively shutting down the country for two weeks. Schools were closed and children were at home. Roads were blocked and businesses shuttered. Tens of thousands of people filled the streets in the cities, in Cochabamba, Santa Cruz, La Paz and beyond, to demand a new vote. Thousands of Morales supporters from the countryside made their way to the city and where the two sides met there was violence. A teenage boy in Cochabamba protesting against the government was killed. A Morales-allied Mayor in a small town was pulled from her office by opposition thugs who covered her in red paint, cut her hair and marched her barefoot through the streets. Morales, instead of seeking peace, egged on the violence, calling on his rural supporters to cut off the food supplies to the cities. I think that he and Alvaro thought it would all die down but the anger against them only grew as more details of election fraud came forward. I believe that under it all, Bolivians in huge numbers began to see that this might be their last chance to not head irrevocably down Venezuela’s dark authoritarian path. Seeing his political survival at stake, Morales turned course and suggested negotiations and the possibility of new elections. But it was too little too late. By Saturday the opposition’s call for new elections became a widespread call for Morales’ resignation. Rank and file police across the country mutinied against the government and refused to protect it against protests that included their own families. Ally after ally turned against him calling for resignation, including the powerful national labor federation (COB). Meanwhile the violence was escalating. On Sunday morning the general in charge of the Bolivian Army announced that he too thought Evo needed to resign, that it was the only way to restore peace to the country. Hours later Morales made that resignation official. As I write this he is winding his way to self-exile in Mexico, fearing prosecution or attack. What Happens Now? Bolivia has spent two days as a nation without a leader, and how it will get a new one remains complicated. All three of the people in constitutional line after the President have resigned their posts — the Vice President and the heads of both houses of Congress. The Vice-President of the Senate, a member of the opposition, is seeking to claim the office but the MAS party majority in the Congress is refusing to take their seats for the session required to make Morales’ resignation official. Once a new interim President takes office the Bolivian constitution will require new elections within ninety days. In the meantime, violence is quickly absorbing the country as mobs of angry Morales supporters have mobilized around the country. I am being bombarded by reports and photographs from friends across Bolivia — houses and factories set on fire in El Alto, marchers with sticks en route to the center of Cochabamba, Sacaba in open conflict. Other Morales supporters have also seized control of a major power facility. More cities will blocked off by blockades. Evo’s backers, who remain a sizeable portion of the nation and fiercely loyal, can make Bolivia ungovernable if they wish and that seems the plan. It seems only a matter of time until the Army moves into the streets to quell the violence (and it is saying just that). Bolivia borders on the edge of chaos and the dangers are more than one. There is a danger that the violence will spread beyond control. Civil war or some low version of it is not out of the question. The country’s old right wing, equipped with new faces, is seeking any opening it can to retake power. The road from here to peace is long and uncertain. A Powerful Legacy Lost As I watched Evo’s resignation on Sunday what I felt was deeply sad. It was just so joyously hopeful in the beginning. He was the charismatic charmer who, at a party in my office weeks before he was elected, grabbed my toddler daughter’s cheeks. She asked him to dance. He was the first indigenous President of a nation where an indigenous majority had long been living in the disrespected margins of their country. As a symbol he was Bolivia’s Mandela. He came from the nation’s poor and he woke up every day caring about them. He built schools and paved roads. He established a cash bonus system for students to keep them in school. He did many great things for a time, aided by many great people, including some of my friends. But behind all his soaring rhetoric were harder facts. His professed love for Mother Earth covered up relentless destruction of the environment in the name of resource extraction. There were giant cases of corruption and petty acts of vengeance. He succumbed to what one former ally called, el borrachero de poder, the drunkenness of power. Like another president in another country drunk on power, he became convinced that ‘only he’ could lead his country. It could have been different. Evo could have lifted up new leaders to take his place, but instead actively undermined any who might do so. He could have served out his third term, left office with a grand legacy, and even run again in five years if he wished (the term limits only apply to consecutive terms). But instead he was willing to plow through the basic rules of democracy to hold onto power, and the people knew it and in the end they rebelled as Bolivians so often have. The chorus of foreigners who don’t know Bolivia have called this a military coup. Bolivians know first hand what such coups look like: Tanks roll into to Plaza Murillo in the capital with their guns pointed at the Presidential Palace, the President is removed (or in one case hung from a lamp post), and a man in a crisp green uniform takes over the chair. That is not what happened here. This was a popular rebellion to preserve a democracy that the nation saw under threat. Evo’s end in power is much the same as that of another President that Evo himself helped send into self-exile in 2003, the right-wing Gonzalo Sanchez de Lozada. Then as now, protests filled the streets, the anger became too much to survive, and Bolivia watched as its President flew away. It didn’t have to come to this. It shouldn’t have. But let’s never confuse a popular rebellion to protect democracy with a coup staged by an army. Evo and Alvaro brought this on themselves and now Bolivia teeters on the precipice as a result. An Update on Friday November 15th A good deal has happened in Bolivia in the last three days. On Tuesday, after 48 hours of having no President, a series of resignations in the line of constitutional succession led to the swearing in of Jeanine Añez Chavez, a 52-year-old religious conservative who was the Vice President of the Bolivian Senate and is deeply entwined with the conservative opposition. With declarations such as “the bible is back in the Presidential Palace,” she did not exactly signal her intentions to be a neutral, interim president. That was followed by the installation of a cabinet plucked from the most conservative corners of the country’s politics and then a declaration by the new Minister of Communication that the new government was ready to bring sedition charges against journalists spreading news it considered to be false. I think that the best way to judge this new and temporary regime is to measure it against the way former President Eduardo Rodriguez handled a similar interim presidency in 2005 when Carlos Mesa resigned. Rodriguez, the President of the Supreme Court, took over in a similar succession to the fourth in line. It was clear that he had a focused mission, the be an utterly neutral actor between the competing forces at the time and to deliver clean elections that all in the country would accept as legitimate. That is what he did and those were the elections in which Evo Morales won his historic first victory. In the meantime, in the streets, violence has continued and much of the country lives under a cloud of ongoing fear. The chief battlegrounds are in El Alto, where large crowds demanding Evo’s return to office chant “Civil War” and have burned and destroyed homes, businesses and a garage of buses. In the small city of Sacaba, pro-Evo marchers from the Chapare have been blocked by police from marching onward to Cochabamba. Cochabamba and El Alto/La Paz are going to continue to be the centers of any ongoing conflict, because that is where there are large numbers of pro and anti-Evo communities nearest to one another. In Santa Cruz, for example, the traditional center of anti-Evo politics, life is reportedly getting back to normal. Earlier this week the U.S. Embassy issued a warning for U.S. citizens to leave Bolivia and is evacuating families of Embassy staff and non-emergency personnel. This is the first time the Embassy has taken such a move in the thirty years I have been associated with Bolivia. They may just be being overly cautious. From Mexico, Evo Morales has been using Twitter to switch back and forth between encouraging his supporters to take to the streets and supporting efforts at negotiation. The United Nations Secretary General has sent a personal representative to mediate those negotiations between MAS and the other factions of the moment. Here is what to watch for in the week ahead: Does the violence subside? Is a date set for the required election? How will the make-up of the candidates change? Will the right-wing abandon its election alliance with Mesa and run someone of its own? Will someone like Manfred Reyes Villa, the self-exiled former Cochabamba governor return? Who will MAS run if it cannot run Evo? Will Bolivia find its way back to a peaceful and constitutional way forward or will the country fall apart? # # # Jim Shultz is the founder and executive director of The Democracy Center.

Medium.com,Society,It’s when not if China’s Middle Eastern tightrope snaps,World,https://medium.com/the-turbulent-world-of-middle-east-soccer/its-when-not-if-china-s-middle-eastern-tightrope-snaps-45b2dee490c7?source=topic_page---------9------------------1," By James M. Dorsey A podcast version of this story is available on Soundcloud, Itunes, Spotify, Stitcher, TuneIn, Spreaker, Pocket Casts, Tumblr, Podbean, Audecibel and Castbox. China is manoeuvring to avoid being sucked into the Middle East’s numerous disputes amid mounting debate in Beijing on whether the People’s Republic will be able to remain aloof yet ensure the safety and security of its mushrooming interests and sizeable Diaspora community. China’s challenge is starkest in the Gulf. It was compounded when US President Donald J. Trump effectively put China on the spot by implicitly opening the door to China sharing the burden of guaranteeing the security of the free flow of energy from the region. It’s a challenge that has sparked debate in Beijing amid fears that US efforts to isolate Iran internationally and cripple it economically could lead to the collapse of the 2015 international agreement that curbed Iran’s nuclear program, accelerate Iran’s gradual breaching of the agreement in way that would significantly increase its ability to build a nuclear weapon, and potentially spark an unwanted military confrontation. All of which are nightmare scenarios for China. However, Chinese efforts so far to reduce its exposure to risk are at best temporary band aid solutions. They do little to address the underlying dilemma: it is only a matter of time before China will have no choice but to engage politically and militarily at the risk of surrendering its ability to remain neutral in regional conflicts. Israeli intelligence reportedly predicted last year that Iran’s gradual withdrawal from an agreement that Mr. Trump abandoned in May 2018 would ultimately take Iran to a point where it could create a nuclear military facility within a matter of months. That in turn could provoke a regional nuclear arms race and/or a pre-emptive military strike. That is precisely the assessment that Iran hopes will persuade China alongside Russia and the European Union to put their money where their mouth is in countering US sanctions and make it worth Iran’s while to remain committed to the nuclear accord. The problem is that controversy over the agreement is only one of multiple regional problems. Those problems require a far more comprehensive approach for which China is currently ill-equipped even if it is gradually abandoning its belief that economics alone offers solutions as well as its principle of no foreign military bases. China’s effort to reduce its exposure to the Gulf’s energy supply risks by increasing imports from Russia and Central Asia doesn’t eliminate the risk. The Gulf will for the foreseeable future remain a major energy supplier to China, the region’s foremost trading partner and foreign investor. Even so, China is expected to next month take its first delivery of Russian gas delivered through a new pipeline, part of a US$50 billion gas field development and pipeline construction project dubbed Power of Siberia. Initially delivering approximately 500 million cubic feet of gas per day or about 1.6 percent of China’s total estimated gas requirement in 2019, the project is expected to account with an increased daily flow of 3.6 billion cubic feet for 9.5 percent of China’s supply needs by 2022. The Russian pipeline kicks in as China drastically cuts back on its import of Iranian liquified petroleum gas (LPG) because of the US sanctions and is seeking to diversify its supply as a result of Chinese tariffs on US LPG imports imposed as part of the two countries’ trade war. China is likely hoping that United Arab Emirates efforts to stimulate regional talks with Iran and signs that Saudi Arabia is softening its hard-line rejection of an unconditional negotiation with the Islamic republic will either help it significantly delay engagement or create an environment in which the risk of being sucked into the Saudi-Iranian rivalry is substantially reduced. Following months of quietly reaching out to Iran, UAE minister of state for foreign affairs Anwar Gargash told a recent security dialogue in Abu Dhabi that there was “room for collective diplomacy to succeed.” Mr. Gargash went on to say that “for such a process to work, it is essential that the international community is on the same page, especially the US and the EU, as well as the Arab Gulf states.” Pointedly, Mr. Gargash did not put Russia and China on par with Western powers in that process. The UAE official said the UAE envisions a regional order undergirded by “strong regional multilateralism” that would provide security for all. Mr. Gargash made his remarks against the backdrop of a Chinese-backed Russian proposal for a multilateral security arrangement in the Gulf that would incorporate the US defense umbrella as well as an Iranian proposal for a regional security pact that would exclude external players. Presumably aware that Gulf states were unlikely to engage with Iran without involvement of external powers, Iran appeared to keep its options open by also endorsing the Russian proposal. The various manoeuvres to reduce tension and break the stalemate in the Gulf put Mr. Trump’s little noticed assertion in June that energy buyers should protect their own ships rather than rely on US protection in a perspective that goes beyond the president’s repeated rant that US allies were taking advantage of the United States and failing to shoulder their share of the burden. Potentially, Mr. Trump opened the door to an arrangement in which the United States would share with others the responsibility for ensuring the region’s free flow of energy even if he has given no indication of what that would mean in practice beyond demanding that the United States be paid for its services. “China gets 91 percent of its oil from the Straight, Japan 62 percent, & many other countries likewise. So why are we protecting the shipping lanes for other countries (many years) for zero compensation. All of these countries should be protecting their own ships…,” Mr. Trump tweeted. China has not rejected Mr. Trump’s position out of hand. Beyond hinting that China could escort Chinese-flagged commercial vessels in the Gulf, Chinese officials have said that they would consider joining a US-backed maritime security framework in the region that would create a security umbrella for national navy vessels to accompany ships flying their flag. Chinese participation would lay the groundwork for a more comprehensive regional security arrangement in the longer term. China’s maritime strategy, involving the development of a blue water navy, suggests that China already de facto envisions a greater role at some point in the future. Scholars Julia Gurol and Parisa Shahmohammadi noted in a recent study that China has already “decided to take security concerns in the (Indian Ocean) into its own hands, instead of relying on the USA and its allies, who have long served as the main security providers in this maritime region… If tensions continue to escalate in the Persian Gulf, Beijing may find it has no other choice but to provide a security presence in the Middle East.” Dr. James M.

Medium.com,Society,Why the World Got It Wrong with Bolivia,World,https://medium.com/@victoriapoon/why-the-world-got-it-wrong-with-bolivia-68c46843b07e?source=topic_page---------10------------------1," F
or many people, Bolivia is not a well-known country. It lies, landlocked, in the centre of South America in between Peru, Paraguay, Brazil, Argentina and Chile, with a population of 11 million. With diverse landscapes, from deserts and salt flats, to jungles and mountain ranges, it is a country of extremes. The capital, La Paz, is also a city with extremities. Their subway is not underground, but in the sky, with cable cars taking you up and down — enough to make you hold on tightly to the hand rails. But perhaps what is most striking are the people, multiethnic and multilingual, with an ethnic distribution of around 30% Quechua, 25% Aymara, and the rest white, Hispanic or mixed. Bolivia thus is a country of diversities, in land and in people. On a Sunday afternoon in Cochabamba, a city in the centre of Bolivia, I sat with my boyfriend and his mom in front of the television, watching the government unravel after three weeks of protests that rocked the country. We all sat in awe, and the country was holding its breath. Then the news came, Evo Morales, president of Bolivia, was resigning. Almost instantaneously, fireworks, crackers and rockets set off all around us as people celebrated the news. “We did it!”, everyone shouted. However, the same enthusiasm was lost on the international community. All over social media, many claimed that Bolivia’s democracy was under threat due to a coup d’etat by the national military. From U.S. Congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez’s tweet: “What’s happening right now in Bolivia isn’t democracy, it’s a coup. The people of Bolivia deserve free, fair, and peaceful elections — not violent seizures of power,” to damning statements that “Bolivia coup led by Christian fascist paramilitary leader and millionaire — with foreign support.” What became lost in translation? And why was the collapse of the Morales government met with such a huge misunderstanding? In 2005, Evo Morales, born to an Aymara family, became Bolivia’s 80th president. He promised a government in favor of the indigenous people, and a new, secular constitution to represent the diverse groups all around the country. Morales’ first actions and left-wing policies as president were encouraging. However, that facade over his 14 years of presidency, crumbled. As a socialist, Morales cut his own salary and those of his cabinet, yet, over the years, he and his administration had been criticized for failing to lead a clean government. As a former coca farmer, the ex-president has been criticized for his dealings with the coca trade in the El Chapare region, with the U.N. claiming that areas where Morales has empowered coca farmers continue to supply major drug trafficking schemes. “Trafficking of cocaine in Bolivia is fueled by a lax justice system that fails to hold traffickers to account.” — World Politics Review Many Bolivians question how it came to be, that a president earning $2000 a month, could afford luxuries such as a recently built $34 million residence in La Paz and a $38 million plane. “Public disquiet turned to outrage when it was reported Morales would enjoy a 1,068 sq metre suite fitted out with a jacuzzi, sauna, gym and massage room.” — The Guardian Though many cannot prove corruption within the Morales government, it takes just a short walk in the centre of La Paz, or a glance at the skies, for anyone to scratch their head and wonder how such luxuries came to be. It was not long ago that the world cried out at pictures of the Amazon rainforest burning, with the international community turning their attention to Brazil and their president, Jair Bolsonaro, criticized for his actions over the protection of the rainforest. However, overlooked was the role of Bolivia’s own government. Under the Morales administration, the Bolivian people have long demanded better policies and protection against the destruction of the Amazon, which makes up almost half of the country. Particularly controversial, was a new policy introduced, allowing farmers to clear more land than before by controlled burning— quadrupling the allowance from five to 20 hectares. “So there’s a policy by the Morales government — although it shows itself internationally as being incredibly environmental and supportive of environmental rights but their policy has been going the complete opposite direction.” — Jhanisse Daza, an environmental activist in Bolivia Aside from policy criticisms, many have also said that the government’s slow reaction time in fighting fires, and lack of investments into domestic resources such as firefighters, demonstrated negligence. “We need to hold Evo Morales to account for this situation. When is he going to account for all of this? He needs to be held accountable for all the times that the rights of the indigenous people have been violated, as well as those of mother nature.” — Alex Villca, an indigenous leader in the Amazon region According to the constitution, which only allows presidents to rule for two consecutive terms, Evo Morales was technically meant to step down in 2015 after 10 years in power. However, instead of resigning, Morales changed the constitution to run for a third-term. In 2016, the government convened a national referendum to let the public decide if the constitution could be changed again in order to allow the ex-president to run for a fourth-term. Morales lost in the referendum, but far from accepting defeat, he turned to the Bolivian Constitutional Court, arguing that his human rights would be violated if he were to be barred from running for the fourth time. The Court, which many believe was controlled by Morales, agreed and allowed him to run for the fourth time on the 20th October, 2019. “Evo Morales ignored the constitution that he himself asked us to vote for.” — Jorge Quiroga, former president of Bolivia After Morales secured his chance in running for a fourth-term, on the 20th October, 2019, the race began. Once votes were cast in local polling stations, the people of Bolivia returned to their homes and switched on their TVs at 8pm to watch the results. As the evening progressed, it was clear to see that Morales’ opposition, Carlos Mesa, was closing in, meaning the likelihood of both candidates going into a second-round run-off was high — this meant that the president would have a much lower chance of securing his presidency. At around 10pm, the vote count stopped at 83% of the population, with Morales leading at 45.3% and Mesa behind at 38.2%. The vote tally had been suspended. The then president assured the people that he was confident of winning the first-round once the rural areas were tallied, and there would be no need for a second-round. The next day, tallying resumed, and over the course of the few days that followed, the total count (100% of the population) was continued. On the 24th October, 2019, Morales declared an official victory following a count which gave him 46.83%, and his opponent, Mesa, 36.7%, just over a 10% difference to prevent a second-round run-off. For many, the 24 hour lapse in releasing results fueled strong suspicion of electoral fraud. Once Evo Morales declared his victory to run as president for the fourth consecutive time, peaceful protests erupted across Bolivia. The people refused to acknowledge the results. What transpired afterwards were three weeks of road blocks, a tactic used by protestors to shut down cities, and ultimately the country. Across La Paz, Sucre, Cochabamba, Potosi, Oruro and Santa Cruz, the major cities of Bolivia, people continued to block roads, paralyzing all activity. Town halls were held where masses of people gathered to protest and decide further action to stop Morales resuming power for the next 5 years. On many occasions, violence from government supporters, which many allege were paid by the Morales administration, rocked cities, ultimately leading to the death of 4 protestors. For days, hope was fading amongst the pro-democracy movement. On the 9th October, 2019, the tide turned when a police division in Cochabamba publicly denounced the Morales administration, joining the people’s protests in demanding the president to step down. As the day progressed, police all over the country joined the movement until every division across Bolivia had deviated. The following day, on the 10th October, the Organization of American States (OAS) released an election audit report of Bolivia’s election, showing a “clear manipulation” of votes. Shortly after, Morales called for a new election due to the irregularities found. However, the head of the military suggested that the president resign. At around 5pm that day, Evo Morales publicly resigned as he had lost the support of the people, the police and the military. Upon resigning, he declared that his government had suffered from a coup, prompting backlash against his resignation from the international community. Why did everyone believe that the ex-president’s resignation signaled a coup and a failure in Bolivia’s democratic institutions? Arguably, many people’s first line of sight fell on the fact that Morales and his government were left-wing and socialist, with many news outlets highlighting him as Bolivia’s first indigenous president, coming from humble beginnings. Because of this, an assumption was made that surely, ousting a left-wing, socialist and indigenous president equalled a coup d’etat and a failure of democracy. In many people’s minds, it was surely an attempt by the right-wing to overthrow government and gain power. However, this is far from the truth. It was not a coup, but simply a fight for democracy. If anything, what happened in Bolivia highlights how important it is to understand the details of a political situation that clearly, many people missed completely. It also highlights why we must take what we hear with a pinch of salt, instead of jumping to conclusions, which only served to drown out the voices of the Bolivian people on the ground, who in reality were fighting for their democracy all along. When I think of what transpired, the fable of the wolf in sheep’s clothing comes to mind, but instead, it was a power-hungry president in left-wing, socialist clothing."

Medium.com,Society,"Uighurs in NL, the forgotten refugees",World,https://medium.com/@vittoriamalgi/uighurs-in-nl-the-forgotten-refugees-4496445693bc?source=topic_page---------13------------------1," By Vittoria Malgioglio and Federico Campanile In Amsterdam, the mild autumn is giving way to the winter’s rain and wind, but despite the cold, the streets of the Neuwe Pijp district remain crowded. Along the narrow city centre streets, in the midst of a mix of Dutch postcard houses and hipster bars, there is also a small Uighur restaurant. Inside, the traditional music instruments fixed to the wall, the smell of spices in the hall, and a feeling of genuine conviviality tell the story of a nation, East Turkestan, which for the international community does not exist and for the People’s Republic of China is the autonomous region of Xinjiang. For Chinese authorities, the peculiar cultural identity of the Uighurs represents a factor of instability: different from the Han Chinese, the Turkish-speaking and Muslim Uighurs are organized on a tribal model and originated in the north-west of the country. Because of the policies of social control pursued by the central government, the Jordaan-based restaurant could soon be among the last remaining testimonies of the Uighur culture. Enver, editor for the Uighur Times, is thousands of kilometres away from his homeland in the west of China. In the safety of the Amsterdam restaurant, he can freely talk to 31mag about his people, without having to look around. And he can also give voice (in English) to the testimony of Obul Qasim: “I work at the East Turkestan Education Centre in Zeist, founded in 2009,” says Obul, who also works as a taxi driver in Utrecht. His organization has just purchased a new building and schools in four Dutch cities. Here students can spend weekends and holidays: “It is essential for our community to preserve the identity that the Chinese government is trying to erase in every way,” he says seriously. The problem of not dispersing traditions is very felt by minorities, but for the Uighurs it is a question of survival: “China is trying to erase our uniqueness, so in the Netherlands, where we are free, we try to pass on to our children the language and the traditions of our people”. Enver and Obul say that their wives and children are in the Netherlands, but that they haven’t had any news from the rest of their families in years. In Europe, the claims of this stateless people are being heard, but the claims of the Uighurs have not broken through — like those of the Kurds, the Sarawis, or the Palestinians. Yet the “re-education camps” — as described in the 2018 report by the UN Commission for the Elimination of Racial Discrimination — would be real lagers where about one million Uighurs are imprisoned. The camps would be set up in an attempt to assimilate the Muslim minority into the multi-ethnic Chinese nation. This makes the UN rather uncomfortable, but for Beijing, the problem does not exist. The Uighur governor of the Shohrat Zakir region describes the camps as “voluntary vocational training centers”. So the Chinese insist, no attempt to erase Uighur identity, just an effort to combat extremism and separatism. Obul has been away from home for a long time and has lived in Yemen and Turkey: a popular destination among the members of his community because of linguistic similarities and the shared faith of Islam. Then, from Turkey, he moved to the Netherlands. There are about 30,000 Uighur refugees in Turkey, and Turks have often mobilized for the cause despite Chinese pressure to lower Ankara’s profile of support. “The Uighur language is similar to Turkish, so it’s easy to communicate with Turks,” says Obul. In China, Uighurs can only study Mandarin, so few learn English. “Once in the Netherlands, some of us manage to learn Dutch and integrate, but for many other people, the language is a big obstacle and they end up interacting only with the Turks”. Apparently it is a necessity, rather than real cultural proximity, that pools the two communities together. But this is not just a matter of international politics: for Ankara the Uighur question is also an internal stability problem. “Unlike what happens with Syrian refugees, the cultural and linguistic similarity between the indigenous Turkish community and the Uighur minority requires the Turkish government to make greater efforts to support its nationalist claims,” explains Işık Kuşçu to 31mag.nl. She is Associate Professor at the METU in Ankara, specialised in Central Asian diasporas, she published an intriguing framework on the mobilization of the Uighur diaspora in 2017. Despite the small number of Uighur migrants in Turkey, this community may be an internal factor of instability for Ankara. At home, as well as in the Netherlands and Germany, Turks tend to mark a distinctive line between themselves and other Turkish-speaking populations: “Nationalism, as with Syrians living in Turkey, plays a central role. In Turkey,” says Işık Kuşçu, “the claims of the Uighurs are often being exploited not only for political reasons but also by the religious community as an example of anti-Islamic repression.” The Turkish authorities, in this sense, try to play on two tables: “On the one hand, Turkey does not want to create tensions with Beijing, on the other, it tries to divert the claims on a ground of religious brotherhood. For this reason, the emigration of the Uighurs towards Europe is a positive element for Turkey”, concludes Işık Kuşçu. This Machiavellian strategy seems to be aimed at avoiding dangerous ethnic juxtapositions that could undermine Erdogan’s nationalist propaganda. According to the professor, it would precisely be the deep-rooted presence of Turkish communities in Germany and the Netherlands that pushes the Uighurs to emigrate to these countries. “Surely the two communities are in contact. It would be interesting to study better the forms of interaction between Uighurs and Turks”. The increasingly widespread debate on the re-education camps in Xinjiang has led to a wider interest in the Uighur diaspora, says Prof. Kuşçu. “A growing number of Uighurs are planning to move to Europe, so governments have begun to ask questions. Why are they leaving their country? Should we grant them political asylum?” Obul welcomes the Dutch government’s attitude towards its people: the Netherlands would have supported their cause with conviction, especially after 2009. As Obul explains, “in 2009, during the Ürümqi riots, the Chinese government killed thousands of people. Only then did our cause gain notoriety in the eyes of the world.” Enver was in Ürümqi in those days and was trying to pick up his brother from the train station when rivers of Han Chinese invaded the streets of the city. The immediate consequence of the Ürümqi riots was an increase in asylum seekers from East Turkestan. The subsequent repression of Beijing resulted in the ramification of the Uighur diaspora into numerous associations around the world including the World Uighur Congress. As Obul explains, “this is the first association that brings together and represents the entire community”. The congress is led by Dolkun Isa, who fled China at the end of the 1980s and is now a German citizen, of whom Obul respectfully recounts: “Isa spends less than forty days a year at home and works day and night to talk about the Uighurs to the whole world”. Rebiya Kadeer, former millionaire now living in the USA is known as the spiritual mother of the Uighurs and another very respected leader. The diaspora would be progressively turning into a less elitist and more popular movement than the community of origin. Also, the participation of those involved in political activities would be growing. “Many Uighurs still have relatives in China and are concerned about their safety. Although most of the time they are not active in politics, these people help their people by giving language courses and by dealing with immigration procedures,” says Işık Kuşçu. Thanks to the advent of digital information the issue was brought to the attention of a wider audience. Moreover, the receptivity of European civil society is growing, and governments are opening up institutional platforms for discussion to diaspora leaders. Hence, the Uighurs feel more taken into account today than in the 1990s, when the first movements were born in Turkey. Yet, given its geopolitical and commercial weight, China is not just any country, and while the European Union is particularly active in promoting human rights, governments are still very cautious in criticizing the Middle Kingdom. “I don’t see a real interest in the issue [in part of governments] because of the risks of undermining the relationship with an extremely important country like China,” says Alessandra Cappelletti, professor at Xi’an Jiaotong Liverpool University. “The Uighur cause finds support more on a political level, rather than on an institutional one. In Europe, there certainly are parties that support the cause, but at the level of governments, I would be less convinced.” Further, the teacher does not see any clear and substantial pro-Uighur stance in the motion filed in July by 22 UN countries against the alleged violation of human rights in Xinjiang: “I do not think that the arguments contained in the text are substantive”, she says to 31mag. In addition, the religious factor also plays its part: the Uighurs are Muslims and many Western governments, Cappelletti says, could find it inconvenient to openly support an Islamic minority. The expert, moreover, disputes the very use of the term “persecution”: “Does it make sense to speak of persecution if the population is within Chinese territory? Xinjiang is a territory annexed by China in 1759 and therefore, under international law, part of the territory of the People’s Republic. I think it is wrong to speak of persecution because religious restrictions apply to the entire Chinese population.” For the Italian teacher, religious cults are all treated in an equal (and harsh) way in China, regardless of ethnic origin. “We create the case, but for Beijing the Uighurs are Chinese like the others.” Another central question is that of the unity of the diaspora: is there a Uighur nationalism? “A true and proper nationalism has never formed in East Turkestan; the sense of Uighur belonging develops at a local level with a strong attachment to the oasis. Moreover, among the Uighurs, we can see a diversity of recognition of the leader. Rabiya Kader and Dolkun Isa are very quarrelsome among themselves, the community is not united, there is no leadership, especially because of the lack of political thinkers and leaders.”"
Medium.com,Society,Report from Ciudad Juarez,World,https://medium.com/@jimhightwrites/report-from-ciudad-juarez-3191861d5bcf?source=topic_page---------14------------------1," Under “Remain in Mexico,” thousands of Central American migrant families are trying to survive in Ciudad Juarez while waiting to face the harshest immigration judges in the United States across the border in El Paso. Non-profits, government agencies and individual Good Samaritans are stepping up to help them, but much more is needed. by Jim Hight At a refugee shelter in Ciudad Juarez last September, I looked at the half-dozen women sitting in a row of chairs waiting to talk to me and hoped that some of them had good asylum stories. Not just the usual extortions and assaults, the murdered relatives, the men with facial tattoos who threatened to kill their sons if the boys didn’t sign up as gang soldiers, but some persecution connected to one of the five “protected grounds” that could get them asylum in the United States: race, religion, political opinion, nationality or membership in a particular social group. But only one would talk about events that had a possible connection to a protected ground. She was a Mayan woman about 25 years old I’ll call Juanita. In a soft, tentative voice she told me she’d left Guatemala with her children after her estranged husband had tried to kill her. “Do you think your husband wanted to hurt you because you are Mayan?” I asked. “I don’t know.” “Did you go to the police for help? “The police? No, they wouldn’t have done anything.” “Did the police ignore your complaint because you’re Mayan?” “I don’t know.” I wrote “maybe” after the protected ground question. The truth was even more ambiguous. Along with a handful of other volunteers, I was interviewing asylum-seekers waiting in Juarez for U.S. immigration courts across the border in El Paso to hear their cases. Our interview forms would be reviewed by lawyers working with HIAS (an immigrant and refugee aid group founded in the 1880s as the Hebrew Immigrant Aid Society) and HIAS’s partner agencies in El Paso: Las Americas Immigrant Advocacy Center and Diocesan Migrant & Refugee Services. Those lawyers would decide which asylum-seekers had a potentially strong case and should therefore be prioritized for free legal representation. At the beginning of the week, I’d learned in a training session that the persecutor in an asylum case could be the government or any “entity” — including a violent family member — that the government was unable or unwilling to control. I’d also learned that in order for Juanita to get asylum on the basis of racial or ethnic persecution, she’d have to prove that her husband attacked her because she was Mayan, and that the police or other government agencies could not or would not protect her. But there was also another possible asylum opportunity for her: She was a woman feeling domestic violence in Central America, and an immigration lawyer could argue that as such she should be considered part of a particular social group (PSG). “In Guatemala, as well as in Honduras and El Salvador, there are deep-seated cultural values about how women are supposed to behave and how it’s appropriate for people to treat them,” said Rachel Zoghlin, national pro bono technical legal advisor for HIAS. “In those countries, patriarchy and machismo normalize men abusing women, whether the women are their female family members, wives, girlfriends, the mothers of their children, or even just female love interests.” Those societies are changing, even passing new laws to protect women — but those laws are still largely ineffective, according to Zoghlin. “And the fact that they’re legislating to protect women underscores the reality that women are recognized as a particular social group in those countries.” Before President Trump came into office, federal immigration policy supported the logic that Zoghlin articulates. But in June 2018, then-Attorney General Jeff Sessions changed that policy in an attempt to bar domestic violence survivors from Central America from establishing that they are part of a PSG. Still, individual immigration judges have discretion to decide that someone like Juanita should get asylum. “Many immigration judges across the country agree that given the sociopolitical context and the disparate treatment of women in Central America, they do constitute a particular social group,” said Zoghlin. “When they’re harmed or persecuted because they’re women, they deserve and qualify for asylum.” But Juanita’s chances of seeing an immigration judge who takes this point of view are very poor because of her unlucky timing. If she’d gotten to the border a few months earlier and met a few conditions—like proving to border officers that her child was hers and that she had a friend or relative in the United States willing to act as her sponsor—she would probably have been detained briefly then allowed to enter the country after signing a promise to appear at the ICE office nearest to her sponsor’s home. And once she was released in El Paso, the nonprofit Annunciation House would have helped her on her journey. I participated in that above-ground railroad in May 2019 when I volunteered for two weeks at an Annunciation House shelter. The migrant families arrived worn out from their travels and their time in detention, often sick with colds or flus. After meeting their basic needs, we’d work the phones to get their sponsors to buy bus or plan tickets as soon as possible. Most were on their way within a day or two to towns and cities all over America, where they’d live with their sponsors and seek asylum in the closest immigration courts. But because Juanita arrived after Remain in Mexico went into effect, she must stay in Juarez, where her case will be heard in El Paso by some of the harshest immigration judges in the nation — judges who are very unlikely to look favorably on the idea that she merits PSG status. From 2013 through 2018, immigration judges in El Paso granted asylum in only seven percent of the cases they decided. Nationwide, that “grant rate” was 42 percent, according to data from the Syracuse University’s Transactional Records Access Clearinghouse (TRAC). In Maryland, it was 56 percent; in Virginia, 61 percent; in New York, 80 percent. This seemingly unequal treatment is the subject of a complaint filed with the Department of Justice last April by the American Immigration Council and American Immigration Lawyers Association. These groups contend that El Paso judges use “unreasonable and unjust courtroom procedures” and create a “culture of contempt and hostility” toward asylum seekers. As of this writing, no decision has been made on the complaint. With this background in mind as I came to the end of my interview with Juanita, I told her: “The lawyers will review your information and decide if they might be able to help you, free of charge. But you should know that it is very difficult to get asylum in the United States, and it can take several years. It would be a good idea to figure out how to establish your family in Juarez in the meantime. The staff here at the shelter can help you with that. Do you understand?” She nodded blankly and stood up. “Good luck,” I said. I’d given that same message to most of the asylum-seekers I interviewed, both at the shelter and at a Mexican government office near the border. And most of them reacted with much more visible distress than Juanita did — especially those who’d already been victimized in Juarez. I met several people who’d been robbed; two families that had been extorted by Mexican police; a 12-year-old boy who’d witnessed a double homicide; and a mother who’d been kidnapped with her husband and four kids for two weeks — which was how long it took her to convince the kidnappers that $1200 was all the ransom her relatives could come up with. But in taking down migrants’ stories, I also learned that Juarez is full of Good Samaritans. The mother of the 12-year-old I mentioned told us they had been rescued from a life on the streets by a single man in his 50s who asked them to share his home. At first, she was suspicious of his motives, but she soon realized the man just wanted to help — and to have some company at home. Many migrants had secured jobs and found housemates to share apartments or houses. And for those who had jobs but nowhere to live, it was common for employers to let them bunk at work until they could find a place to live. Mexican state and federal government agencies were signing migrants up for health insurance and helping them get long-term visas to remain in Mexico. There’s litigation pending at the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals that could change the situation for Juanita and the more than 50,000 other asylum-seekers waiting in Juarez and other Mexican border towns. But weighing against them is the administration’s more recent policy requiring them to apply for asylum in Mexico before they apply in the United States. In September, the Supreme Court voted 7–2 to leave that policy in place while lower courts consider legal challenges to it. Given these realities, some nonprofits are retooling their border operations to focus on helping migrants in Juarez. HIAS recently established its first Juarez office, opened in late summer with the UN High Commissioner for Refugees. In addition to helping migrants with their US asylum cases, the office staff are also “trying to be a resource to refugees who want to seek asylum or some other forms of protection in Mexico,” said Sue Kenney-Pfalzer, director of HIAS’s U.S. Border & Asylum Network. HIAS plans to expand its Juarez programs soon to provide mental health and psycho-social support for adults and children in the migrant shelters, as well as services for survivors of gender-based violence like Juanita. El Paso residents are also working through a new grassroots nonprofit, Seguimos Adelante, to visit shelters and help migrants with medical and other needs. For one shelter, the group purchased a water heater. In another, it has sponsored art therapy to help children “express through painting what their feeling about migrating from their countries and living in Juarez,” said member Will Rocci. As winter arrived, Seguimos put out a call for donations of socks, winter hats and mittens—especially for babies. (To donate, see their wish list on Amazon and select “Lindy Morrison’s Gift Registry address” for shipping.) According to Rocci, most of the shelters in Juarez are set up to accommodate migrant families for the long term. While some move out within a few weeks, “many plan to stay in the shelters until they go through the entire asylum court docket, which could be years,” he said. Before leaving the shelter I visited, another volunteer and I spent some time talking with some children. While my colleague handed out all the lip balm she had in her purse— knowing that these migrants from humid Central America were suffering in the dry desert air—I bantered with a few of older kids. We quickly drew more attention, and pretty soon were surrounded by about 20 children and teens hungry for distraction from their 24/7 life in the shelter. At one point, I asked whether they had a soccer ball — una pelota. “We had one but we lost it and they haven’t replaced it,” said a lean boy of about 14. “Can you bring us one next time you come?” I said I couldn’t because I was going home the next, but that I’d ask someone else to do so. When our ride was ready to take us back to the border, the boy followed us outside and said in a low voice to remind me, “una pelota, una pelota.” Remain in Mexico has profoundly changed the facts on the ground for Central American migrant families seeking asylum in the United States. To carry on and build a life in Juarez and other Mexican border cities, they need resources and support — from soccer balls to heated water, from trauma counseling to elementary education. Last winter and spring, volunteers from all over the U.S., mostly from faith communities, flocked to El Paso and other border communities to help desperate asylum-seekers who were arriving by the thousands every week. Now the challenge is to organize a similar level of response south of the border, where logistics and security concerns are more difficult to manage. Groups like HIAS and Seguimos Adelante are showing the way, but many more must follow them."

Medium.com,Society,Several recent stories paint a patchy portrait of India,World,https://medium.com/@Rashmee/several-recent-stories-paint-a-patchy-portrait-of-india-47c9e8f2d3c1?source=topic_page---------16------------------1," Some sense of what is happening in India can be gleaned from four news stories. On Wednesday, the Indian Supreme Court decides on whether it should be bound, like other public agencies, by the Right to Information Act; the Indian rupee last week fell by 0.5 per cent after ratings agency Moody’s lowered the country’s credit rating outlook, citing growth concerns; the poor quality of Delhi’s air continues to make headlines around the world; and a long-running dispute over the holy site of Ayodhya has finally been settled. These developments tell an India story that is patchy, but it is fair to ask if they should even be taken together. Is it fair to link a court ruling on the right to information with an economic slowdown — not uncommon, and certainly not at a time of heightened global trade tensions and subdued growth — while throwing in air pollution and a judicial verdict on a contentious, decades-old land dispute? Does a common thread run through all of them? The answer is that it offers a portrait of India in 2019. It is fitting that its highest court and chief justice consider the serious matter of whether they should be covered under the transparency law. Their verdict will settle a discussion that goes back to 2010, when a three-judge bench of the Delhi High Court ruled that the office of the chief justice of India is a “public authority” and comes under the RTI Act. The judgment was challenged in the supreme court and now, it will pronounce on it. India’s problem lies in changing both too little and too much. So while there is an attempt to settle old disputes and address the challenges of today, more attention needs to be paid But what of the other matters? The noxious haze that shrouded Delhi earlier this month is an annual problem at this time of year, caused by construction dust and crop stubble-burning, and politicians have offered a rather inadequate response. Meanwhile, tourists are staying away and flights are disrupted. Then there is the slowdown — India’s finance minister recently acknowledged the “challenges” faced by the economy — and it is affecting everything from car sales to gold purchases, as well as the way investors view India. Not too long ago, India was the world’s fastest-growing economy, chugging along at more than 8 per cent. Now it is at 5 per cent, the weakest rate in six years. And finally, there is the Ayodhya verdict. The ruling by India’s highest court that Hindus should be allowed to build a temple on the disputed site and that Muslims be given another piece of land for a mosque throws up different opinions. Some see the verdict as a victory for Hindu hardliners. Others say it draws a line under the past and gives India the chance to move on from a deeply polarising period in its history. Six months into prime minister Narendra Modi’s second term, after a massive election victory, some say that India is falling short in terms of its national brand. It has a strong leader, but a weakening economy, institutions that appear to be increasingly fusing political, legal and religious considerations, as well as an estimated 22 of the world’s 30 most polluted cities. Others would argue that India is negotiating a changing world with some of the greatest possible advantages — domestic political stability, decisive leadership and a dominant narrative. Add to that India’s ability to build strong ties and manage delicate negotiations in the Middle East, maintaining relations with Palestine, Iran, Saudi Arabia, the UAE, Qatar, Turkey and Israel with careful diplomacy. How then to read some of the nuanced commentary on the state of India today? Kaushik Basu, a professor of international studies and economics at Cornell University and former chief economic adviser to the Indian government, recently suggested that the Indian economic slowdown “is mostly collateral damage, the result of an erosion of trust caused by the country’s drift toward illiberalism”. Indian academic Pratap Bhanu Mehta noted that the Ayodhya verdict was “a reflection on the state of India’s politics”. This is why no one expected that the country’s highest court would ask for the restoration of the Babri Mosque in Ayodhya, the 14th century structure that was razed to the ground by Hindu mobs on December 6, 1992, Mehta wrote. And researchers for the Energy Policy Institute at the University of Chicago in India described the problems in handling what they call Delhi’s “public health emergency”. Not enough people are properly aware of the harmful effects of air pollution, the researchers said, even as “wealthier households are able to avoid the outdoors, commute in air-conditioned vehicles, work in offices and invest in air purifiers”. The three opinions cover disparate fields — economics, the law and the environment — but the baseline is the same. Essentially, they say that India’s problem lies in changing both too little and too much. So while there is an attempt to settle old disputes and address the challenges of today, more attention needs to be paid to social and economic inequality, institutional strength and credibility, as well as what makes for business confidence among investors, both domestic and foreign. Former ad man and international policy adviser Simon Anholt once offered the following take on how nations can brand themselves: “The only remaining superpower is international public opinion”. This prompts the following question: what is India internationally known for at this point of time? Old-timers would still say it is the land of Gandhi but millennials will probably also associate India with the rise of nationalism, majoritarian politics and the weakening of the rule of law, all of which are apparent in Turkey, Hungary, Poland and the US as well. The point about a nation’s brand is that it should be a faithful, current representation. For years, India has had an unbeatable and attractive brand. Despite its poverty, it was a land of non-violence, peace and love; a country that strived, despite its communal divides, to elevate and dignify all citizens with equal access to the law and to the national narrative. I’m not sure that remains wholly true today. It remains to be seen how India builds brand value."
Medium.com,Society,Why Revolving Conveyor Belt Sushi is Fading in Japan,World,https://medium.com/one-table-one-world/why-revolving-conveyor-belt-sushi-is-fading-in-japan-5f3bd70adc34?source=topic_page---------17------------------1," By Jay (Publisher, Unseen Japan) I recently re-started taking Japanese lessons with my teacher on iTalki. In this week’s lesson, we read and discussed an online essay about the history of sushi. At the end of our discussion, my teacher talked about how, as a teenager, she had worked at a conveyor belt sushi restaurant (回転寿司; kaiten zushi). “But things are changing,” she said. “Revolving conveyor belts are going out of style.” “Really?” I asked. This was the first I’d heard of this. After our lesson, my teacher sent me evidence to confirm that yes, indeed — conveyor belt sushi was dying. It’s not that the idea of quick-order sushi is dying. What’s going out of style is the revolving conveyor belt gimmick. And it turns out there are good reasons why. (JP) Link: The Conveyor Abandonment Movement! Why “Non-Revolving Revolving Sushi” is on the Rise Sushi, as we know it today, is a fairly recent invention. The original form of sushi was narezushi (なれずし). Instead of using sushi vinegar as is done today, narezushi’s taste came from fermenting it with rice and salt. The fermenting process took about a year. Narezushi came of age in Japan’s Heian era (794–1192 AD). Because of the time and labor involved, people regarded it as high-end cuisine. Ordinary people used it to pay taxes, but only priests and nobility generally ate it. The start of the Edo era (1603–1868) saw the birth of hayazushi (早鮨). To make hayazushi, you push lightly pickled fish into rice that had salt and vinegar added to it. Hungry sushi-lovers could eat the dish after it had sat for a few hours. Compared to narezushi, it was, as its name implies, 早い ( hayai), or “quick.” But not quick enough. Near the end of the Edo period, hayazushi gave way to nigiri-zushi (握り寿司), in which chefs “grip” a regular piece of seafood (or another ingredient, such as cooked egg) together with a bed of vinegared rice. The dish became popular at 立ち食い ( tachigui) stands, where people could eat while standing. The form of nigiri in the Edo era was a little different than it is now. Most notably, it was about two to three times larger than the bite-sized portions we eat today. But what Japan (and the world) today enjoys as “nigiri-zushi” is more or less a direct descendant of its Edo ancestor. The conveyor belt was the brainchild of Shiraishi Yoshiaki ( 白石義明), who operated a chain of standing eateries in Osaka. After seeing a conveyor belt used in the production of beer, he created Genroku Sushi, the first conveyor belt sushi store, in 1958. Chefs standing behind a counter would prepare the sushi and place it on the belt. Customers would grab pieces as they came past. Shiraishi figured this would reduce labor costs as well as food waste. The novel idea was such a hit that it’s even spread outside of Japan. Recently, however, businesses have realized that the conveyor belt system isn’t as efficient as its founder intended. When conveyor belt sushi chain Genki Sushi did a survey, it discovered that the revolving lane only accounted for 15% of the sushi that customers ordered. There’s also a freshness issue. Sushi is best eaten right after it’s made. Customers who take a piece off of a conveyor have no idea how long it’s been making the rounds. And every time a store has to toss a piece of uneaten sushi, it takes a monetary hit. (JP) Link: Non-Revolving Revolving Sushi Boom?! The Merits to the Introduction of the “Express Lane” So it’s not surprising that many large chains are converting into 回らない回転寿司 ( mawaranai kaiten-zushi), or “non-revolving conveyor sushi.” Stores owned by chains such as Genki Sushi have replaced the round conveyor belt with a “conveyor line.” Customers order their sushi on a touchscreen. Their orders are made for them fresh and sent to them directly on the line. Some customers online express disappointment at watching this novelty walk slowly towards the sunset. Others, however, appreciate the made to order approach. And given the vast amount of waste involved in conveyor belt systems, I can only imagine that this trend away from pre-made, rotating sushi will accelerate. I’m the publisher of Unseen Japan.

Medium.com,Society,America is not a right-wing outlier,World,https://medium.com/discourse/america-is-not-a-right-wing-outlier-e080cb4af334?source=topic_page---------18------------------1," I am often told that the United States is a right-wing nation, that we should catch up to the rest of the world. America should be more like Europe is a common refrain among many reformers in this country as well as many, well, Europeans. As someone born and raised in Europe, I lived on the continent for around thirty years altogether, I confess to some sympathy with this idea. There are many things that Europe just does better than the US — if nothing else, European bread puts America to shame, especially Ħobż Malti but I’m naturally biased towards the Maltese. I’m not saying you can’t find good bread in the US but you do have to find it, great bread is the default in *most of* Europe. But my little bread digression begs the question: which Europe are we talking about? Which Europeans? Contrary to popular belief, America is not a global outlier, western Europe is not the political standard, and the USA is far, far less conservative than American liberals and many European observers would like to admit. One significant measure of liberal attitudes is tolerance to individuals and groups of different races or religions. Now, while the US has a big problem with racists — and with racist cops — we are not even close to the racist attitudes shown by the rest of the world. America consistently scores better on tolerance for those of other races than most of the world, including nearly every country in western Europe which, as we will see, is what most people mean when they say “Europe.” Europe as a whole, not the arbitrary fifteen or so countries of the west, does not score well when we measure racist attitudes. Europe has never grappled with their blatant anti-gypsy (Roma) attitudes and there is plenty of evidence that Antisemitism is growing pretty much all over the continent. That Americans are far more accepting of those different than them, both as a matter of policy and public attitude, than Europeans is further demonstrated by their respective views on immigration. The majority of Americans (63%) think that immigration is a net positive and think the country should accept more immigrants while over half of Europeans think the exact opposite. America accepts more immigrants and refugees than any other country on Earth by a very large margin, far surpassing any European country or even Canada. Events of the last few years have been changing laws and attitudes in both the US and EU, largely negatively in both, but even now Americans are more willing than nearly every other country on the globe to accept immigrants. Related, the US stands out from most western nations, most nations around the world in fact, in having racial and gender based affirmative action policies to attempt to eliminate employment and education discrimination. Some countries in Europe, like France, have gender-based affirmative action policies but in just about all of them there is no racial or ethnic equivalent. Reasonable people can disagree as to the ethics, efficacy, fairness, or constitutionality of racial affirmative action in the US but there is no reasonable way to shoehorn America’s view on race into the category of conservative. We at least try to address the issue of racism in employment and education through government policy. Gay marriage is legal in all fifty of the United States with 63% of the general public in favor of it. Twenty-one states, plus Guam, Puerto Rico, and DC, have laws prohibiting sexual orientation and gender identity discrimination in employment in the public and private sector. Gay marriage is not only illegal in most of Europe, including roughly half of the European Union, over half of Europeans are not in favor of it becoming so, including many EU countries. In 2012, fully two-thirds of LGBT residents of the EU said they were scared of holding hands in public versus while 69% of Americans support federal legislation protecting LGBT people. This makes the US vastly different than most of the world, where being gay is a literal crime. Gender equality? The US ranks higher than most of the world, most of Europe in fact, including half of the EU. Much is made of the recent resurgence of anti-abortion laws in certain US states but when it comes to abortion rights, America is one of the most progressive places in the world. Europe as a whole is extremely permissive towards the subject but even the most conservative US state’s abortion laws pale in comparison to the laws in Poland, Cyprus, and my own Malta. Even the abortion rules in the UK aren’t as lax as you’d find in most US states and Ireland only legalized it last year. Many people say that the overt religiosity of our politicians and voters sets America apart from the world but only if the world extends from Austria to Portugal. Pretty much every country in eastern Europe, Africa, South America, the Middle East, and most of Asia is far more religious and conservatively religious too. Just like western Europe, the fastest growing faith in the US is “None. “ So why do we hear the constant refrain that America is such a global outlier? Three main reasons: guns, climate change, and health care. We stand apart from nearly every industrialized nation in not providing European-style universal health care, our political discourse about climate change is the most divisive in possibly the whole world, and we definitely are unique in our approach to self-defense and the right to own a gun. But is this enough to place US politics as a whole outside the mainstream? I would say no. Politics is much more complicated than that, reductionist arguments that ignore 75% of a party platform, that pretend America is some sort of political monolith, can be safely ignored. The USA is a good global citizen, responsible (mostly) to her citizens who are (mostly) not the crazy Florida-man stereotype that the world loves to read about. Americans, and Europeans, who like to tell others how different we are really should travel more. And not to Reykjavik, or Madrid, or Glasgow, or Vienna. Go to Manila, Moldova, Cairo, Buenos Aires, or Qingdao. The world is not represented by a dozen western European countries; we’d all get more things done if we quit pretending it’s so.

Medium.com,Society,Hong Kong police violence escalates dramatically: unarmed protesters shot with live rounds,World,https://medium.com/adinkra/hong-kong-police-violence-escalates-dramatically-unarmed-protesters-shot-with-live-rounds-c8cecd7f8503?source=topic_page---------19------------------1," By Hong Kong Free Press The following post is a round up of a series of reports written by several contributors of the free online news platform the Hong Kong Free Press at different dates. Those include: Kris Cheng on 11 of November and 9 of November, Holmes Chan and Jennifer Creery on 9 of November and Holmes Chan on 9 of November. It is published on Global Voices under a content partnership agreement. We warn our readers some of the videos in this article include graphic content. The Hong Kong police, often regarded as the most trusted in the region, have lost their reputation as several serious instances of violence and violation of their own rules are now coming to the surface, while Hong Kong enters its eighth month of protests against government policies curbing democratic rights. On November 11, a Hong Kong traffic police officer fired three live rounds at two unarmed protesters in a district located in the east of Hong Kong island early morning during a city-wide strike action. Protesters were blocking roads outside an exit of the Sai Wan Ho subway station. At around 7:15 a.m., a police officer tried to chase pedestrians, then pulled out a service pistol and pointed it at them, according to footage captured by Cupid Producer. He then grabbed a protester in white, and shot another black-clad protester in the stomach at close range. Another protester in black then appeared to try and grab the officer’s gun, as he fired two more shots. Bloodstains were seen on the ground as the two were subdued. One protester appeared to be conscious, as he responded when he asked his name. The other protester, however, was unresponsive. Passersby then argued with police and riot police fired pepper spray. A woman tried to get close to the unconscious protester, but was wrestled down by another riot officer. The two protesters were later taken away in an ambulance. Protesters across Hong Kong tried to disrupt the morning commute on Monday November 11 as part of a wider plan to mobilise people for a general strike. Arrests were made across Hong Kong, including in Tuen Mun, Wong Tai Sin and Sha Tin. Mass Transit Railways (MTR )services were disrupted on several major lines, including the Kwun Tong Line, Tung Chung Line, East Rail Line, and the Ma On Shan Line. Light rail services were also affected. Demonstrators have vowed an escalation following the death on November 3 of 22-year-old Alex Chow Tsz-lok, who succumbed to his injuries after falling one storey in a car park. While the cause of Chow’s death remains unclear, riot police were conducting dispersal operations nearby at the time of his fall on November 3 around 1 a.m. A number of medical workers commented that Chow’s injury was suspicious as all fractures appeared on his head and hip bones. A prominent brain surgery doctor believed that Chow might have been unconscious during the fall as the height of his fall was just four meters, and a conscious jump or fall would have more likely resulted in fractured bones on his arms and legs in a standard situation. On November 9, thousands of people gathered outside the government headquarters to mourn over Chow’s death. They expressed their belief that the government and the riot police should be held accountable for his death. A 40-year-old office worker told HKFP at the vigil: This shouldn’t have happened. I want to know the truth. Even though the police tried to say it had nothing to do with them, I don’t believe it, I don’t buy it at all. They have really lost their credibility. Outrage grew as the public heard for the first time of an accusation of a gang rape inside a police station in Tsuen Wan back in September. The police force have since confirmed that they had received such a complaint on October 22, but claimed that the allegations did not match investigation results. Details of the gang rape allegations were first leaked online, and were later followed up and unveiled by Apple Daily news. The alleged victim is a 18-year-old woman who received an abortion at the Queen Elizabeth Hospital on November 5. Reportedly, the woman was stopped when she was walking past the Tsuen Wan district police station in mid-September. Despite the fact she did not wear black (most protesters wear black clothes to express their political views) and did not perform any act of protest, she was allegedly taken inside the station and gang-raped by four masked men. The Apple Daily report said the woman displayed symptoms of depression after the incident, and was initially hesitant to file a complaint to the police. She discovered she was pregnant after a hospital visit in mid-October, and told medical staff about her experience while accompanied by her mother. A Facebook page, HA secrets, administered by public hospital workers leaked that fetal DNA had been gathered as evidence to identify the perpetrator. On October 26 — four days after the police complaints office was notified of the incident — a police spokesperson said that it “had not received any complaints of sexual assault” at the San Uk Ling Holding Centre, a separate facility which has come under fire as notorious for inmate abuse. At the time, police did not say whether they had received any complaints of sexual crimes in relation to Tsuen Wan Police Station or other police facilities. Surveys show that the majority of Hong Kong people do not trust the police force and demand an independent investigation on police’s abusive use of force. Professor Clifford Stott, Dean for Research Faculty of Natural Sciences of Keele University in the United Kingdom, is one of the five members in the international experts panel which was set up in early September to assist IPCC in its thematic study of the protests. On November 9, Cliff Stott, one of the five members of the international experts panel for Hong Kong Independent Police Complaints Council (IPCC) that was set to assist the IPPC itself spoke up. He made a statement on Twitter saying that the current mechanism under IPCC lacks power, and urged for a more comprehensive investigation by an independent group with requisite powers: Originally published at https://globalvoices.org on November 11, 2019."
Medium.com,Society,"Following Time Cover, India Retaliates.",World,https://medium.com/@ScottNover/following-time-cover-india-retaliates-8ca16b17a526?source=topic_page---------20------------------1," This essay was originally published in PRESSING, a press freedom newsletter, on Friday. You can subscribe to get the newsletter in your inbox on Tuesdays and Fridays by signing up here. In early May, Aatish Taseer wrote something that got him in trouble. Taseer’s article, “India’s Divider in Chief,” criticized India’s Prime Minister, Narendra Modi, and expressed concern for five more years of Modi’s rule. “As India gets ready to give this willful provincial, so emblematic of her own limitations, a second term, one cannot help but tremble at what he might yet do to punish the world for his own failures,” Taseer concluded the piece. Later that month, Modi was reelected. But, the article wasn’t just anywhere. It was on the cover of Time Magazine’s international edition. Say what you will about Time’s presence in the United States. But, it’s staying power in India is undeniable. To paraphrase what an Indian-born friend recently told me, “My parents in India don’t care about The Washington Post. But, they very much care about Time.” Let’s fast forward to September. The Indian Ministry of Home Affairs sent Taseer’s parents a letter saying that they were revoking his Overseas Citizenship of India (OCI), a permanent visa that allows Taseer to live in the U.S. while retaining his Indian citizenship. “India doesn’t recognize dual nationality and the OCI — a permanent visa for persons of Indian origin — is the nearest equivalent to dual citizenship and provided to millions of Indians around the world,” Taseer wrote in Time yesterday after the incident came to a head. The government gave Taseer 21 days to respond, contesting their claims. He says he responded immediately. After all, he hadn’t received the letter until day 20. Yesterday, The Print, an Indian news outlet, reported that the government was considering taking away Taseer’s OCI card. The article noted that Taseer has been “under attack” from BJP leaders, those in the prime minister’s party, since the article came out. The government referred to Taseer as a “Pakistani national,” which Taseer strongly refutes. He was born in London and raised in India, though his father was Pakistani. But, his relationship with his father was always complicated. Here’s Taseer’s explanation: “Not only was I not a Pakistani, but my relationship with my father — who was Governor of Punjab in Pakistan when he was assassinated in 2011 — had been complicated. Born out of wedlock, I was not in contact with my father until I was 21. I was born in Britain and have British citizenship, but since the age of two I had lived and grown up in India, with my Indian mother, who is a well-known journalist. She had raised me on her own in Delhi and was always my sole legal guardian, and the only parent I knew for most of my life. It was why I had always been viewed as Indian in India and why I had been granted an OCI.” Taseer found out his OCI card had been revoked yesterday, through a tweet. (Yes, in the sense that Modi’s regime tweets out news before the people affected have been given notice, there’s a striking similarity with the Trump White House.) “Mr. Aatish Ali Taseer, while submitting his PIO application, concealed the fact that his late father was of Pakistani origin,” the Ministry of Home Affairs spokesperson tweeted yesterday. “Mr. Taseer was given the opportunity to submit his reply/objections regarding his PIO/OCI cards, but he failed to dispute the notice. Thus, Aatish Ali Taseer becomes ineligible to hold an OCI card as per the Citizenship Act, 1955. He has clearly not complied with very basic requirements and hidden information.” Taseer disputes that a.) he had concealed his father’s origins and b.) that he failed to respond to the government’s letter. For the latter, he has receipts. While the government denies they are retaliating against Taseer for his article, the personal attacks on him have not subsided. Vijay Chauthaiwale, the BJP’s foreign policy chief, called Taseer a “rabid Islamist” on Twitter yesterday. The writer Sadanand Dhume replied, “If @AatishTaseer is an Islamist, I’m the crown prince of Liechtenstein.” There’s a sobering tone in Taseer’s latest piece. Beyond the absurdity of the incident, there’s deep pain: “I read the letter, which in bland bureaucratic language informed me that the country I was raised in and lived in for most of my adult life was no longer mine… India is my country. The relationship is so instinctive that, like an unwritten constitution, I had never before felt it necessary to articulate it. I could say I was Indian because I had grown up there, because I knew its festivals and languages, and because all five of my books were steeped in its concerns and anxieties.” Just about every press freedom advocacy group has condemned the Indian government’s actions. Taseer and, well, anyone with eyes can see that this is clearly retaliation for publishing the Time article. But now, Taseer is in exile: a man unable to return home. Is there no greater punishment than being separated from friends and family, from your sense of “home,” from the soil, and storefronts, foods, and scenery that make most sense to you? In New York, where he lives and work, Taseer may not be a “stranger in a strange land,” but when you know you can’t go home, to your real home, nothing can really replace that pain."
Medium.com,Society,Is Britain’s Jeremy Corbyn a Marxist?,World,https://medium.com/@luketmurphy/is-britains-jeremy-corbyn-a-marxist-f5e07de802d2?source=topic_page---------21------------------1," Are you a British voter? Have you heard that Jeremy Corbyn is a Marxist but unsure what that means? If yes then it might be worth making up your mind so you can vote on 12th December in good faith. To get to the bottom of this we must understand capitalism. Capitalism brings things that are not in the market and makes them marketable. The classic example is your ‘work’. Before capitalism, you just worked on a farm for food or produced something artisanal and exchanged it for other things you needed. The magic of capitalism was to turn this work into a commodity called labour. You could sell your labour to someone else in exchange for a wage. Now you earned money and what you did with it, whether saving it in the bank, buying stuff or giving 45% of it to your landlord, meant you could have a surplus or deficit of money. If you ended up with a surplus of money — or ‘capital’ then you were a successful capitalist. Well done. As the industrial revolution gathered steam in the 1800s, Karl Marx wrote in detail about the success of capitalism. He asked, what motivated capital? Can we control its behaviour? How do people selling their labour for a wage feel? In answering these and many other questions, Marx concluded capitalism was dynamic and constantly reinventing itself but also unstable and regularly in crisis. He predicted a new system of socialism would take its place. Marx was a journalist and historian by trade. Although he passionately advocated socialism he probably wrote more to analyse the capitalism he saw around him. After all, it is easier to pick faults in what you see then it is to design and articulate an alternative. It’s easier to be a pundit on Match of the Day than it is to be a football manager — and Marx was excellent at identifying the faults at the heart of capitalism’s defence. Here there is a line in the sand. Because Jeremy Corbyn doesn’t want to be a criticising pundit. He wants to be the British Prime Minister. Corbyn describes himself as a democratic socialist. It is likely he sees Marxism as a great way of diagnosing the instability going on around us. But he doesn’t want to abolish money. He probably sees Marxism as offering the most obvious answers to why the financial crisis happened, but he doesn’t want to destroy the banking system [in fact he wants to create a National Investment Bank]. He likely sees Marxism as a great way of understanding why workers without representation in an Amazon distribution centre may want something different. But he doesn’t want to nationalise Amazon. What Corbyn wants is to use the power of government to bring political and economic decision making to the public. What does that mean? Since Thatcher’s radical transformation of the economy, two big things happened. First, the power of workers’ representation was destroyed. And second, the economy moved to an 80:20 balance for services over industry. Without trade unions to represent workers, people had less say over their jobs. They became free individuals, perhaps with enough courage to negotiate a salary raise or convince their employer they should be given time to go to the toilet. Or perhaps not. And since the service sector is dominated by London, the UK became extremely reliant on the economy of a single city. Corbyn’s Labour Party is proposing to push back on this status quo. It wants to increase the rights of workers to negotiate collectively. It wants to shift economic balance to parts of the country that are not London and the South East. This push back is about balance. Before Thatcher, Britain was also out of balance, symbolised by the winter of discontent in 1978. Her revolution was to shift economic power to individuals. Now more than ever, individuals have the right to express themselves, negotiate, start a business, take money out of the country, buy a house and set up their own school. But if a group of people live in a tower block they feel is unsafe they need a communal way to achieve a safer home. If a group of workers at Amazon dislike having to urinate into plastic bottles they need to negotiate as one to force change. If 75% of British people live in areas poorer than the European average but constantly hear how great London is doing, maybe there should be some intervention to grow the economy across the country. If children who live in a poor place are not allowed to enter playgrounds built for children who live in rich place then maybe the local council should be pressured to provide universally excellent playgrounds for all children. What do all these four problems have in common? The answer is by existing they allow someone somewhere to increase their surplus profit. This is a Marxist analysis of the economy — Welcome. For some, this debate is not welcome. The newspaper The Daily Telegraph started its election campaign on 6th November with a huge quote from their colleague and best friend forever Boris Johnson. The quote looked down on you, even if you read it from your lap: “The tragedy of the modern Labour Party under Jeremy Corbyn is that they detest the profit motive so viscerally…they point their fingers at individuals with a relish and a vindictiveness not seen since Stalin persecuted the kulaks.” This is a substandard level of journalism from a publication itself collapsing under the weight of its inability to make a profit. It is also is a good example of why ‘Corbyn is a Marxist Full Stop’ is bad for our political language and our culture. It is a dog whistle. Worse, it’s lazy. Do you know what would increase profits for business? Abolishing the weekend. But at some point bosses agreed to allow up to 2 entire days off a week. In 1870 the concept of the weekend was still novel and defined by ‘Food Journal’: ‘Week-end,’ that is from Saturday until Monday, — it may be a later day in the week if the money and credit hold out, — is the season of dissipation.” Have some time off, they said. Organise football matches on Saturday and go to church on Sunday. Then come back on Monday raring to go. Is this Marxist? Surely The Daily Telegraph would say ‘Yes’ and equivalent to the murder of Russian kulaks. The weekend is Marxism in action, an example of countervailing pressure against the profit motive. But since the victory of Thatcherism, other countervailing pressures like trade unions, housing associations and collective bargaining have been neutered. The entire economy has been one unending green light to the demands of business. This is bad for capitalism because it needs a competitor to make it think twice, push back and make it pay taxes. Otherwise, with no other power to keep it trim, capitalism will become fat and lazy, make bad decisions, divert money out of the economy into tax havens and forget about what made it great in the first place. A monopoly for capitalism in the market of ideas is bad for business. There still exist a few examples of Marxism in action in our society. Now, we will disagree on this but, have a look through these examples and see which ones you think are an obstacle to the profit motive of private companies and could be considered Marxist: If these things had not already happened and Jeremy Corbyn’s Labour Party proposed them, then they might be called ‘Marxist.’ And that would be correct. Because sometimes we see reform or regulation of capitalism as more like common sense. But we’re actually unconsciously thinking like a Marxist. This is not to apologise for the negative or unintended consequences of what Marx wrote. The Soviet Union, Venezuela and China are, or were, brutal, even totalitarian, dictatorships, guilty of the worst crimes. They are far worse than what we have created in the UK. But this article, at its heart, is an attempt to understand the meaning of words so we can all avoid becoming as lazy as the people at The Daily Telegraph. Marxism provides far less satisfactory answers on how best to organise the economy than capitalism. And we should challenge Corbyn as we would any other politician about their actual policies. But to call him ‘Marxist’ and retreat will not do. The Daily Telegraph strategy is to hope this works like a dog whistle for ‘Communist Murderer’. This behaviour insults the intelligence of its readers who likely will never vote for Corbyn anyway, but are patronised by its editors by their deliberate denigration of the English language. Corbyn’s opponents would do better to find his real, not cartoonish, weakness. They would do better to investigate the rise of antisemitism in the party and understand why that has happened. And they would do better to acknowledge the possibility that Marxism could bring them some fresh insight. If City bankers or regulators had read more Marx over the past 20 years rather than thinking they were ‘masters of the universe’ or had ‘abolished boom and bust’ perhaps the financial crisis we have failed to shake off for more than ten years may have been avoided, if only in its severity. People forget, Marx was a person. He was a journalist, documented well in ‘Dispatches for the New York Tribune: Selected Journalism of Karl Marx’ by James Ledbetter and celebrated by Christopher Hitchens in a 2007 essay. He advocated socialism, but he was a supporter of Abraham Lincoln, the American revolutionary experiment, with its democratic checks and balances and separation of powers. It was as a journalist that his repeated defence for the freedom of the press led to his expulsion from Germany. Emerging from the haze of caricature, we can see a picture of a person with ambiguities who is worth our rational thought. To be Marxist is to diagnose capitalism. But not to diagnose is to endorse our current economy in all its absurdity, pain and glory and without need for any change. Yes, for as long as Corbyn has been in the Labour Party he has wanted it to move leftwards. But in 2019, the British economy is so far unbalanced to the right and lacking in countervailing pressure against the forever demands of a one-sided free market, that by moving it leftwards we arrive only at the employee-owned John Lewis model or the successful state energy companies like EDF Energy who we pay to build our infrastructure. Now we have concluded that Jeremy Corbyn is a Marxist but perhaps this isn’t as bad as we once thought, we should give the last word to Jonas Fossli Gjersø, a Norwegian historian who wrote: “As a Scandinavian who has spent more than a decade living in Britain, nothing has made me feel more foreign than observing the current Labour leadership election. From his style to his policies Mr Corbyn would, in Norway, be an unremarkably mainstream, run-of-the-mill social-democrat. His policy-platform places him squarely in the Norwegian Labour Party from which the last leader is such a widely respected establishment figure that upon resignation he became the current Secretary-General of NATO. Yet, here in the United Kingdom a politician who makes similar policy-proposals, indeed those that form the very bedrock of the Nordic-model, is brandished as an extremist of the hard-left and a danger to society.” So, it turns out in life there are ambiguities. And maybe you are more Marxist than you think."
Medium.com,Society,How Would This Be For A “Thank You”?,World,https://medium.com/@ericjscholl/how-would-this-be-for-a-thank-you-6b050db8d004?source=topic_page---------22------------------1," President Trump’s often explained his decision to go easy on Saudi Arabia both on its murderous campaign in Yemen and its murder of journalist Jamal Khashoggi on the fact they’ve pledged to buy billions in U.S. military equipment. Though those huge contracts have yet to materialize. (And also some real or perceived relationship where he can call up King Salman and get him to keep gas prices down.) But now the Saudis are apparently considering actually spending some billions on Russian-made equipment. Specifically the S-400 missile defense system; same as Turkey (a NATO member) just agreed to buy. (And will almost definitely be a topic of conversation when Turkey’s President Erdogan visits Trump at the White House this week.) The U.S. has a perfectly good missile defense system it sells: Lockheed-Martin’s THAAD. But the Russian system is supposed to be as good, and maybe better depending on what you’re looking for in a missile defense system: because it’s apparently really good at defending against U.S. made missiles. So might actually be the wise purchase if you’re a country that wants to be prepared for any political eventuality or regional configuration. And with the U.S. becoming decidedly less consistent and less trustworthy under Trump, that makes perfect sense. We have to be a little careful about this story, because Russia is clearly trying to plant and/or promote it in U.S. media, through several channels it’s used before. For whatever reason. Maybe just to prove the competitiveness of its defense system, or assert its superiority. Or to cement an image as modern-day problem solvers in the Middle East. While we are sensitive to that, it doesn’t mean the basic story isn’t true. And, there’s little or no risk anymore in Putin running to the Saudi royal family after Iran-backed missiles seriously damaged a major oil facility back in September. Who’s gonna challenge him on that? In fact, according to Saudi news organization Al-Arabiya, Saudi Arabia had agreed “in principle” to buy the Russian made system a couple of years ago. (Just like it’s agreed “in principle” to all the big buys Trump keeps touting.) So Putin’s recent re-offer was also very much a “told you so”… Would it be a slap in the face to Trump who just recently authorized sending 1,800 troops to Saudi Arabia, while bragging he got the Saudis to pick up the bill? Of course it would. (And if the Saudis are footing the whole bill for the U.S. presence there, it would be reasonable for them to not feel so much that they owe America a favor). But more than that, if a Saudi/Russia missile defense deal in particular goes through, it will drag Trump’s handling of foreign policy down to a level of naïveté and ineptitude the likes of which we have never seen. Hasn’t happened yet…And a strong U.S. President would never allow it to. We’ll see…"
Medium.com,Society,Betraying Allies Is Not the Way to Avoid Being the World’s Police,World,https://medium.com/@JustinWStapley/betraying-allies-is-not-the-way-to-avoid-being-the-worlds-police-9ce9571bee56?source=topic_page---------23------------------1," In early October, the White House announced that US forces would no longer be in the immediate area of Northern Syria. It was apparent the Trump administration had granted tacit approval for an invasion of the region by Turkey. Turkey has long spoken ill of the autonomous region of Iraqi Kurdistan and its highly effective Peshmerga brigades, who were critical allies in the fight against ISIS. Peshmerga means, “Those who face death.” They are often poorly armed and outfitted with outdated equipment. They have a weak medical corps and lack consistent communication abilities. Despite these realities, they did not run from the initial ISIS foray into Iraq. Meanwhile, the Iraqi Army retreated and left much of their advanced equipment given to them by the US to be captured by ISIS. Throughout the conflict with ISIS, there were no more stubborn and determined fighters against the caliphate than the Kurdish Peshmerga. Trained and assisted by the US forces in the region, the Kurds took stronghold after stronghold from ISIS until the caliphate completely collapsed. Realities on the ground demonstrated again and again that without the Kurdish fighters, there is no way ISIS could have been defeated without a much more significant commitment of US personnel. The fight against ISIS demonstrated the effectiveness of deploying US personnel in support of local allies. This strategy allowed for the US and its allies to defeat the caliphate without a significant commitment of combat divisions to the region. It also provided local control of defeated areas, thus avoiding the necessity to police the streets in an overwhelming presence as happened in Iraq. But this strategy cannot prove successful into the future if we don’t keep faith with our allies. The Kurds have been our most consistent allies in the region, from their support of the Invasion of Iraq to the fight against ISIS. The Peshmerga brigades have proven to be dogged fighters in the name of freedom and one of the only capable secular forces (Muslims and Christians) in all of the Middle East. Iraqi Kurdistan is awash with pro-American sentiment. It is unfortunate, but understandable, that the geopolitical realities of the region keep the US from supporting an independent Kurdistan. However, it is a travesty and a betrayal to retreat from the region and allow the vacuum to be filled by those who bear ill will to the Kurds. We don’t know what will come next in the volatile region of the Middle East. But it should be evident that we should keep faith with those who fought so hard, and at such high a price, alongside us and against our enemies. It should also be apparent that we are going to need allies in the future. For good reason, the goal of current US foreign policy is to protect US interests abroad without becoming the world’s police. But betraying our allies is not the way to go about accomplishing that goal."
Medium.com,Society,Russia’s new “sovereign internet” law gives the government sweeping power over the internet,World,https://medium.com/@themillennialsource/russias-new-sovereign-internet-law-gives-the-government-sweeping-power-over-the-internet-87b6c5383416?source=topic_page---------24------------------1," Russia’s amended law on communications, information, information technologies, and information protection came into effect on November 1, allowing greater control over its citizen’s access to online information. Also known as the “sovereign internet” law, it was approved in April this year, despite widespread criticism, protests, and online campaigning in the country. According to Radio Free Europe, the legislation was created in response to the US cybersecurity strategy adopted in September 2018. The US said that this strategy aimed to “identify, counter, disrupt, degrade, and deter behavior in cyberspace that is destabilizing and contrary to our national interests while preserving America’s overmatch in and through cyberspace.” Russian President Vladimir Putin has said the law would ensure the Russian internet is able to function if the United States attempts to cut off Russian access to the global web, Radio Free Europe reported. The new law gives the Russian government “virtually unlimited ability and authority to continuously monitor all internet activity to identify possible threats,” Human Rights Watch explained. Russian internet service providers (ISPs) are now required to install deep packet inspection (DPI) tools within the country, which examines and manages network traffic, allowing providers to locate the source of web traffic and reroute and block it accordingly. According to Human Rights Watch, blocking can range from a single post to an entire network shut down — which means that the Kremlin now has the power to cut Russia off from the World Wide Web. In Moscow and Ingushetia, a southern region that has experienced mass protests, the Russian government has allegedly experimented with turning off mobile internet connections during these protests. The “sovereign internet” law can also limit Virtual Private Networks (VPNs), a popular tool to bypass website blocking by filtering individual VPN traffic. Russia already has existing legislation that limits internet anonymity, whereby VPN providers cannot provide unidentified users with access to banned sites and “organizers of information dissemination” — including social media and messaging apps. Although the law came into effect on November 1, Putin’s internet advisor Dmitry Peskov told the Financial Times that the technology to make this a reality will not be ready until at least 2021. However, Reuters Russia has reported that it is already being tested in several cities in the Ural mountains and Tyumen. The law requires ISPs to route Russian web traffic through state-controlled exchange points, effectively creating a national domain system. This will act as an address book of the internet, translating a URL address into a numerical IP address, which can be used to look up the address of the server(s) that hosts a specific website URL. Human Rights Watch says that this power will allow Russian authorities to lead internet users to the wrong internet address or no address at all, potentially manipulating search results and information sources. The BBC reported that under this system, the Russian government could switch off all internet connections to other countries in an emergency. However, Human Rights Watch said that “the vague definition of security threats leaves it to the authorities to decide which situation requires tracking, rerouting, or blocking,” adding that this law will “open the door to abuse.” The BBC said that the law was an attempt to increase censorship and curtails freedom of expression and privacy. The Russian government is now allowed to block content without judicial consent or having to tell internet users about what information is blocked and why. “Now the government can directly censor content or even turn Russia’s internet into a closed system without telling the public what they are doing or why,” Rachel Denber, Human Rights Watch’s deputy Europe and Central Asia director, said in an official statement. Reporters Without Borders say that “[The law] proves that the Russian leadership is ready to bring the entire network infrastructure under political control in order to cut off the digital information flow whenever needed.” The Russian government justified the law by saying that it was needed to prevent US cyberattacks. The BBC quoted Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov, saying that Russia has no intention of closing its internet off from the rest of the world. “No one is suggesting cutting the internet.” According to the BBC, Russia has recently approved several laws to restrict freedom of speech. Earlier in 2019, the Russian parliament passed two legislations to outlaw “disrespecting the authorities” and what the government deems “fake news.” In 2018, Russia attempted but ultimately failed to block the messaging app Telegram for refusing to provide encryption keys to Russia’s Federal Security Service. According to the independent watchdog organization Freedom House, the country’s Freedom of the Net score in 2018 was 67/100, indicating it is “not free.”"
Medium.com,Society,The Diet That Was Supposed to Feed the World Forgot to Factor in the Poor,World,https://onezero.medium.com/the-diet-that-was-supposed-to-feed-the-world-forgot-to-factor-in-the-poor-cd0e223d6945?source=topic_page---------25------------------1," January, 37 of the foremost experts in nutrition science recommended a diet meant to improve the health of the planet and the humans living on it. The EAT-Lancet diet, named after the commission that created it, recommended that people everywhere eat more vegetables and that most — except those in developing countries — eat less red meat. The commission, which published its suggestions in the medical journal The Lancet, claimed its diet was designed to sustainably and nutritiously feed the estimated 10 billion people that will be alive in 2050. It framed the diet as the first major attempt to universally address the global issues of malnutrition and climate change. But there’s just one big problem with the diet — more than 1.5 billion people can’t afford it today. When researchers not involved with the EAT-Lancet Commission analyzed the diet for affordability, they found that up to half the population of Sub-Saharan Africa and more than a third of the population of South Asia can’t pay for it, given their income level and the food systems in their region, according to a report published in Lancet Global Health this month. Will Masters, a food economist at Tufts University and senior author on the study, tells OneZero that the EAT-Lancet commission overlooked the economics of their diet “because they’re not interested in economics.” (The EAT-Lancet study was funded by the Wellcome Trust and Stordalen Foundation, a private organization led by Norwegian billionaire Petter Stordalen.) “They’re interested in guiding opinion about the health and environmental impact of diet choices,” Masters says. The economic analysis, funded by the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, showed that the highest costs of the EAT-Lancet came primarily from fruits and vegetables, followed by legumes and nuts. Meat, eggs, and fish together with dairy made up a smaller proportion of the cost. “This diet costs a small fraction of average incomes in high-income countries but is not affordable for the world’s poor,” the authors wrote. Kalle Hirvonen, a co-author and senior researcher at the International Food Policy Research Institute, says the findings point toward a deeper issue in global nutrition. “If some of these healthy and sustainable foods are too expensive or unaffordable, it just indicates that we — researchers and policymakers — need to work harder to alleviate poverty and fix our broken food systems,” he tells OneZero. “Food can’t be prescribed as a homogenous global menu.” Though this is the first academic analysis of the EAT-Lancet diet, other skeptics have criticized the commission’s recommendations. Dr. Sylvia Karpagam, a physician and public health advocate in India, argued that much of the food recommended as part of the EAT-Lancet diet, like pulses, fruits, vegetables, and nuts, are “mostly unaffordable” to the poor in India. The new study backs up her argument, finding that more than a third of people in South Asia could not afford the EAT-Lancet diet. Karpagam tells OneZero that the EAT-Lancet recommendations are “racist.” “They reinforce age-old caste prejudices in India, where cheap vegetarianism is anyways being pushed on a majority of people, especially from marginalized communities,” she says. “Food can’t be prescribed as a homogenous global menu. It has to factor in local cultures and practices.” She says that poultry, eggs, and livestock — consumption of which we should drastically reduce, according to the EAT-Lancet commission — have helped poor, nomadic, and pastoral communities get through times of income and food insecurity. Discouraging red meat, she says, “will be disastrous for these communities.” Many other countries face similar scenarios. While Hirvonen says the diet would be a “great improvement” to the nutritional needs of most people in Ethiopia, where he is based, following the commission’s recommendations is simply not possible for people there right now. “Our research shows that access to good food markets, high and increasing prices of nutritious foods, and low incomes, coupled with limited awareness about the health benefits of nutritious foods are the main barriers why Ethiopian households are unable to consume healthier diets,” he says. For people living in Ethiopia and other developing countries in Sub-Saharan Africa and South Asia, the EAT-Lancet diet would eat up at least 42% of their daily mean household income. In some areas of the world, people would have to fork over 173% of their daily mean household income, money they clearly don’t have, in order to afford the diet. The EAT-Lancet Commission hasn’t responded to the recent affordability analysis, but some researchers on the commission have commented on previous criticism. Dr. Tara Garnett, principal investigator at the Oxford Martin Programme on the Future of Food and one of the contributors to the report, told The Guardian in May that she has “reservations about aspects” of the report and that not all 37 contributors to the report agreed on every part of it. An estimated 820 million people are going hungry in the world today, and culturally relevant solutions to the dual problems of climate change and food insecurity are desperately needed. “Our research reveals how the same human needs, which vary somewhat among people based on age and sex and other factors such as pregnancy and breastfeeding, can be met in wildly different ways, depending on local food systems and preferences,” Masters says. “A necessary first step is affordability, and after that, a wide range of other actions are needed. The food system offers so many entry points for people to make a difference, wherever they live and whatever skills they bring to the table.”"

Medium.com,Society,Pirates Attack Cruise Ship,World,https://medium.com/@anastasiaandandrew/pirates-attack-cruise-ship-fb8a23db1277?source=topic_page---------27------------------1," On a cruise a few months ago a band of pirates in several speed boats hurtled at full speed towards the cruise ship as we sailed off the coast of Somalia. Their goal: to hijack the vessel, crew and passengers for a handsome ransom. It was mid-afternoon on a clear day, when between 8–13 speed boats could be seen clearly zig-zagging in front of the 102,000 ton, 273 m long vessel carrying 2,720 passengers in a bid to slow it down and attempt boarding. Another attempt was reported to have happened at around 11 pm the next night. As passengers we were aware that we were in dangerous waters and had been sent a letter advising us what to do to prepare. The letter instructed that in the event of pirates boarding the ship, we should follow the loud speaker instructions to go to a lock down area. I don’t want to name the cruise liner, but it is European and every announcement, from bingo to shipping info was made in four languages, so I can only imagine the confusion that could cause in a high stakes pirate situation. Meanwhile other precautions were taken. Blackout conditions were imposed on those with outside cabins, outside decks were readied with water cannons and out of bounds to all passengers. While the upstairs decks, usually the hub of night time frivolities, was quieter than a church on Tuesday. Initially the thought of pirates conjures images of Hook, Sparrow or even those fellows from Penzance, but just like the real pirates of old these modern pirates mean business and they play hard. These are desperate, angry young men with AK-47’s and attitudes to match. They get into their little speed boats head out onto the high seas and take on ships of more than 150, 000 tons. But to view them as just a small band of mercenary opportunists looking to hornswaggle piles of booty is simplistic. Modern piracy is a multi-million dollar, highly organised enterprise that relies on investors to pull off the high-risk operations. Somali piracy started in the early 1990's in response to the devastation left after the civil war. When the fighting stopped the Somalis realized that while had been distracted fighting each other, their fishing waters were being pilfered. Some Somalis took umbrage with these fishermen from other nations helping themselves and fought them off. Eventually they discovered they could get money out of these trespassers, even more if they towed the said trespassers back to the coast and hold them for ransom. Since then the operations have developed into sophisticated enterprises. There are an estimated 72 pirate groups, or “maritime companies” (according to Oliver Taylor of Listverse, Jan 2019). Investors pay in money, or equipment like guns, in the same way public companies do in the hope of a big dividend. If a hijacking is successful the bulk of the money goes to these investors, not the foot soldiers in the speed boats who stare down the barrel of a cargo ship. The foot soldiers stand to get a measly $30 -$75 thousand. An extra $10 thousand allowance is paid to those who bring their own ladder and gun. This kind of money goes a long way in a place like Somalia but is dwarfed next to the millions paid in ransoms. There are six possible outcomes when a ship is attacked: · failure to capture, · attack repelled, · release after ransom is paid, · release without ransom, · rescue, or · ‘unknown’ — a bit sketchy, but we’re talking pirates, international high finance and corporate reputation here. But let’s say a “maritime company” has secured investors and sent out it’s foot soldier pirates who have spotted a likely target. The pirates, often working in packs of speedboats take a two-pronged approach. Some of them will work to slow the target ship down by running zig-zag in front of the vessel, while the rest approach from the side to board. If the pirates capture the vessel they will take it back, close to the Somali coast where they will start ransom negotiations. These guys can play a long game and have been known to hold captives for up to six months. The hostages are fed by way of ‘donations’ from investors. Ultimately though, the pirates know the cargo is worth more than the crew, so they are quite happy to bump people off if necessary, or if they become ungrateful guests. Having said that though, they are just as likely to release their hostage crew and vessel. If a couple of these “maritime company” representatives turned up on Shark Tank looking for a new investor, apart from being strangely appropriate, their proposition would be seriously considered. Although the risk is high for the front-line personnel, from an investor POV, the outlay for a hijack attempt is only the cost of the fuel, and with the prospective payoff in the millions there is the promise of enough booty to keep investors in hot cars and fast women for some time, which apparently how most ill-gotten gains are spent. However, the chances of hitting the ransom jackpot are quite slim. The results of the 230 recorded attacks since 2005 are: · 42 attempts failed to capture the vessel, the pirates just gave up and left, · 16 attacks were repelled by crew and/ or passengers, · 84 were released after capture with no ransom paid, · 27 come under the ‘unknown’ heading, and · 40 have resulted in a pirate pay day, 17.4% success rate. This means there’s an 82.6% chance of no return on your investment on any given pirate raid, but when it pays it pays big. According to a Board of Innovation article $148 million was paid in ransoms to pirates in 2010. But the real winners are the insurance companies who get 10 times more than the pirates, with $1.85 billion paid in piracy cover in the same year. Interestingly, the International Marine Bureau reported that 1181 people were taken hostage in Somali waters in 2010, but according to this article only one ransom was paid to Somali pirates in that year. So, someone hit pay dirt. Cruise ships have a low risk of pirate hijack. Cargo ships are the primary target for pirates given their valuable load and minimal crew. Cruise ships pose a far more complex scenario; however, pirates have attacked a broad range of vessels with varying results. But where you sail also impacts the risk of hijack, or attempted hijack. All the statistics quoted in the article relate to incidents in Gulf of Aden, (AKA Pirate Alley) as it is the most treacherous stretch of water in terms of piracy. The map below highlights the danger zone of the area. Only six of the 230 recorded attacks were against cruise ships. None have resulted in capture. A well-known incident occurred in 2005 when the Seabourn Spirit was fired at in a hijack attempt. The attempt was unsuccessful but is famous largely because of the footage of the event. You can see it here, or read the CBS report about it here. It was by no means the most dramatic attempted hijacking. Other cruise ships, you can read about here, also experienced gun fire, one was even dealt a hand grenade, but pirates have never breached a cruise ship with passengers aboard. There was one case in 2009 when pirates captured a cruise ship, but quickly released it when they realized there were no passengers aboard. Private yachts are more vulnerable than cruise ships. Eight yachts have been attacked, some resulting in fatalities, but often they are rescued or released after a period of captivity, usually without a ransom. There was one amusing incident when the crew of a Taiwanese yacht fought back against an attack in 2011, throwing all marauding pirates overboard and making good their escape. Even military vessels have been subjects of attack. A few pirates have even gone so far as to board and attempt capture, but that didn’t end so well for them. In a 2006 case a US Military ship was breached, 12 pirates were captured, and one killed. Generally, once pirates realize they’ve boarded a military vessel they quickly make their excuses and slip out the back door. Another reason the chances of being attacked on your next cruise are slim is that piracy levels have dropped significantly in recent years. Between 2008 to 2011 there were 200 recorded pirate attacks in the Gulf of Aden. It peaked in 2009/10, the same time Captain Phillips upset his crew by sailing too close to the Somali coast. In that year 75 other vessels also had a brush with pirates. The waters of Pirate Alley are now policed by task forces staffed from international navies, which seems to have put the pirates off a bit, with only two reported incidents in 2017 and just one in 2018. The International Maritime Organization suggests that: “Planning and training must be on the basis that an attack will take place and not in the belief that, with some luck, it will not happen.” Cruise ships protect themselves using a range of tactics that broadly fit into defensive or offensive strategies. Defensive strategies generally entail minimizing the opportunities for the pirates to successfully capture the ship. These include camouflage through blackout conditions, deck closures, and low noise emissions. In the event of capture, passengers are corralled into lock down in the theatre and restaurants to keep them away from direct pirate contact. A sliding scale of offensive strategies that escalate depending on the severity of the situation are available. At the less severe end of the spectrum the captain will engage a zig-zag manoeuvre and/or speed up the ship to outrun the pirates. Next is the high-pressure hoses used to dislodge would-be attackers from their ladders. These are set up ready for action before entering the Gulf of Aden. If that doesn’t work a Long Range Acoustic Device (LRAD) is used. This device, utilized by naval troops, sends out sonic waves so powerful that it can cause permanent hearing damage from a distance of 300 meters. More dramatically cruise ships also carry two snipers on board. The night of our reported hijack attempt, a sniper was seen on the top deck in full black ninja gear carrying a large gun. He scurried out of sight when he realized passengers could see him. There are also a number of the everyday crew with specialized combat training, although you’ll never know who they are until they need to kick into Jackie Chan action. The first response to being approached by pirates is full speed ahead, as well as adopting a zig-zag manoeuvres. These tactics are usually enough to send the pirates packing, this was the case for the Seabourn Spirit. In the closest pirate vs. cruise ship shave in 2009, passengers on the MSC Melody emerged from a gala night concert to spot a skiff heading towards the ship. The crew were alerted and the passengers, dressed in their finest fripperies, flung tables and chairs at the attackers to prevent them boarding the ship. The pirates fired at passengers, but eventually gave up and left. No passengers were injured. This vigilantism is not recommended or expected of passengers. So, what happened in the case of my recent cruise? Needless to say the Aussie contingent of the ship, true to the ANZAC spirit, had already identified the bread rolls as the most lethal objects to hurl at any offending pirates and were ready to roll into action, but our services weren’t needed in the end. The captain sped up the boat, forcing the pirates to get out of the way and they buggered off. The attempt however was never formally admitted by the cruise liner, or crew, except one. When questioned directly about the incident most crew members replied that it was just gossip and asked if there was any photographic evidence. Well, we weren’t completely honest either.

Medium.com,Society,Britain at the crossroads: why we should take heed of rightwing nationalism’s tightening grip on…,World,https://medium.com/@PhilMShirley/britain-at-the-crossroads-why-we-should-take-heed-of-rightwing-nationalisms-tightening-grip-on-cd59c5ec95fe?source=topic_page---------29------------------1," The December 12 general election will determine what sort of country Britain will become over the next generation. The populist right has a vision of the future it wants. This vision is intolerant, exclusionary, and backward-looking, but it is presented as a strong, nationalist alternative to the current liberal status quo, and it is disturbingly compelling. Down a flight of stairs on a street in South Kensington, West London is the temporary office of a self-styled climate activist by the name of Felix; a native of Berlin, former hospital porter, member of the Alternative for Germany (AfD) party, and organiser of popular informal talks on how eco-fascism can save the planet. Felix stayed on in London after taking part in the Extinction Rebellion London Protests and his ‘lectures’ about how “greater surges of migration will accompany the rising waters of climate change,” are extremely popular among South Kensington’s well-educated, but disenfranchised, fearful and uncertain young voters. Felix offers a compelling, empathetic narrative, talking about the need to support those who are displaced by climate-induced migration; the millions of people who have been forcibly displaced by weather-related sudden onset hazards — such as floods, storms, wildfires, extreme temperature — each year since 2008. “The World Bank estimates that Latin America, sub-Saharan Africa, and Southeast Asia alone will generate 143 million more climate migrants by 2050,” Felix says, with unerring authority and contagious passion. He talks about how climate migration has a direct impact on cities — cities like London, which, according to Felix, is increasingly the prime destination for displaced persons and refugees. He reels off statistics about asylum seekers arriving in the European Union; the high numbers fleeing war zones in Afghanistan, South Sudan, and Syria, and the increasing percentage of migrants fleein economic deprivation in Nigeria and Pakistan; and political instability in Somalia. “We have these individuals coming from all over the world that have some of the most extreme medical care in the world, and they are coming in with diseases such as smallpox and leprosy and TB that are going to infect our people in Europe, and that includes all of you here, in South Kensington. “They’re pouring into your country,” Felix says. “They are pouring into my country. And the governments of Britain and Germany are doing nothing to stop them. In fact, they have encouraged them, just like they encouraged business, industry and the consumer to damage the planet. The blind leading the blind.” Behind this swell of climate crisis, extinction and complete environmental breakdown rhetoric is a rising tide of angry right-wing nationalism, and a well-funded network of right-wing civil society organisations campaigning around the world to roll back civil rights advances. Make no mistake, the far-right has constructed a powerful narrative of victimisation that is fast moving into the mainstream. And if you believe the UK is resistant to rightwing nationalism, you should heed this warning. No country is immune to the far right. In the space of two months this spring, Nigel Farage rebuilt the fledgling Brexit Party, blitzed the country with a social media campaign, and captured the largest share of the UK’s vote in the European elections. Several other right-wing populist movements; Marine Le Pen’s National Rally in France, Viktor Orban’s Fidesz in Hungary, Matteo Salvini’s Lega in Italy, also captured the most votes in their countries. The rise of the anti-immigrant far-right party Alternative for Germany (AfD) — running on an anti-Islam, Euro-skeptic platform — is benefiting from fears of foreigners, picking up protest votes by those who feel left behind by the centrist parties that have long dominated German politics, including Angela Merkel’s Christian Democrats. October’s regional elections in the eastern state of Thuringia sent shock waves throughout the country when Merkel’s Christian Democratic Union was outvoted by the socialist left-wing party, Die Linke, followed by the AfD, which gained 23% of votes. The majority of voters under age 30 chose the AfD, according to official polling statistics, suggesting a new, younger generation that hasn’t lived through the division of its country is in agreement with the far-right party. The fact that Thuringia’s AfD party leader, Bjoern Hoecke is currently under investigation by federal intelligence agencies for extremist speech, which has included questioning Germany’s culpability in World War II, has not seemed to detract from his success. He has denied the existence of Nazi speech when questioned about using words associated with the Third-Reich, including “Lebensraum” or “degenerate,” as in a recent interview with German broadcaster ZDF. Right-wing nationalism is infectious and is going around the world right now like a chronic disease. The far-right has not only declared that “another world is possible”; it is busy building that world, just like Felix in that improvised basement political theatre in South Kensington; the so-called natural preserve of a moderate, pro-remain Conservative-style candidate, but in truth a population of contrasting millionaires and celebrities in South Kensington, Holland Park and Notting Hill with the deprived communities of North Kensington, where residents are still profoundly marked by the Grenfell fire. The inhabitants of South Kensington, irrespective of race or creed or social standing, are, like many people in the UK, are facing the future with fear and trepidation, as solid certainties crumble apart and the fabric of society becomes ever more fragile. And it is into this underlying unease that pedlars of right-wing nationalism such as Felix are injecting potentially lethal doses of anxiety laced conjecture. “The old way of doing things — consensus politics, carbon-hungry consumerism, a reluctance to challenge corporate and government authority, or to address the shadow side of mass immigration, are coming into question,” Felix said. “You must know by now you can’t trust your political leaders. They cannot build the new world you deserve.” Not since the early 1980s has the gap between the two major political parties been so wide, the different visions on offer so distinctive. On one side, Boris Johnson’s Conservative Party is now a long way right of the political centre, intent on whipping up Britain’s deep social divisions to help him win this election. Cracking down on migration and going hard on “law and order” are top of his agenda, which will also be wrapped in a “parliament vs the people” narrative which attempts to demonise elected representatives for frustrating his attempt to leave the EU. Already he has compared Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn to Josef Stalin. On the other, Corbyn’s Labour Party is committed to reversing years of free-market economics which has laid waste to British society. He will try to steer the conversation away from the divisions created by Brexit by promising massive investment in public services and the regional economy, a “green new deal”, and a commitment to tax and regulate big business, including by clamping down on tax havens and introducing a financial transactions tax. In the marginal, Labour held South Kensington, it is virtually impossible to see how that voting pattern can continue. Middle-class professionals have leaned Labour since the 1980s. But the anti-Semitism, conspiracy-mongering, and economic chauvinism of Corbyn’s Labour Party seem anathema to such professionals. So when rightwing internationalists, in disguise as nationalists and climate activists, start talking about climate crisis and extinction and complete environmental breakdown, the irony is overwhelming to the point of rationale paralysis. Climate change is both the radical right’s Achilles’ heel and window of opportunity. On one hand, rightwing nationalism has no effective response to climate change other than to pretend that it doesn’t exist. On the other, though, this is the first time in human history there is a single issue on which all of humanity can hopefully agree, and if you can get disillusioned and politically disfranchised people to believe that immigrants are to blame for climate change, then it becomes much easier to sell the entire far-right narrative of victimisation into mainstream thinking. Make no mistake, ‘ecofascism’ is a delivery mechanism for the full white nationalist manifesto. Following the mass shooting in El Paso, Texas on August 3 this year, which claimed the lives of 22 people, the suspected shooter 21-year-old Patrick Crusius reportedly uploaded a ‘white nationalist manifesto’ to the website 8chan, also called Infinitechan. Amongst the four-page document, he made reference to how his ideology was partly inspired by a desire to improve the environment and ‘get rid of enough people’ to make the ‘American lifestyle more sustainable.’"
Medium.com,Society,How social media propelled ethnocentric disinformation and propaganda during the Nigerian elections,World,https://medium.com/adinkra/how-social-media-propelled-ethnocentric-disinformation-and-propaganda-during-the-nigerian-elections-759a1bba90f1?source=topic_page---------30------------------1," By Nwachukwu Egbunike This story is the first in a two-part series on online ethnic hate speech, disinformation and propaganda during the 2019 Nigeria elections. You can read the second part here. Nigeria went to the polls to elect a new president and a national parliament on February 23, 2019. With two main contenders vying for the presidency, incumbent President Muhammadu Buhari obtained 15 million votes and triumphed over his closest rival, Atiku Abubakar, by a “ margin of 56 percent to 41 percent.” Buhari was sworn-in for a second term of four years on May 29, 2019. Read more: #NigeriaDecides2019: Everything you need to know for this year’s general elections However, the election campaign was fought on different fronts, including social media. There was widespread dissemination of ethnic hate speech at the service of disinformation and propaganda online, particularly on Twitter. Nigeria’s multi-ethnicity — over 250 ethnic groups and 500 languages — has at times been a source of conflict instead of strength. This becomes particularly obvious during elections when politicians use these divisions to campaign for votes. Naturally, online conversations in Nigeria have not been devoid of ethnic-induced hate. Read more: Nigeria: Curbing the tide of ethnic hate — online and off During the 2015 elections, for instance, Twitter Nigeria descended into a bitter and binary sparring match between supporters of the then-two major contestants, Goodluck Jonathan (PDP, an Ijaw Christian) and Muhammadu Buhari (APC, a Hausa, Fulani Muslim). Twitter became a tool for propagating ethnic hate and party politics. Some thought 2019 would be different because Buhari from the All Progressive Congress (APC) and Abubakar from the People’s Democratic Party (PDP) are both Hausa, Fulani Muslims, but that was not the case. Their vice-presidential candidates — Yemi Osibanjo (APC), a Yoruba, and Peter Obi (PDP), an Igbo, are both Christians- but from different ethnic groups. It seemed like a repeat of 2015 but now with different protagonists. The political atmosphere became ethnically-charged in 2017, two years before the elections, creating the conditions for an atmosphere of distrust. The Indigenous People of Biafra (IPOB), a secessionist organization in the southeastern part of the country led by Nnamdi Kanu, also added to the heightened ethnic tensions brewing. Read more: As ethnic hate speech rises, Nigerian writers push back Desertification in predominantly-Muslim northern Nigeria led to a southward migration of Nigeria’s cattle herders that ignited violent conflicts with farmers. The southern Christian communities’ resentment of the influx of Muslim Fulani herders was “ portrayed in some narratives as an ‘Islamisation’ force.’’ The failure of the Nigerian government to investigate these clashes and “ bring perpetrators to justice” resulted in the death of about 4,000 people from 2015 to late 2018, according to Amnesty International. Hence, ethnocentrism was already at an all-time high before the presidential elections in 2019. The prevailing distrust was a fertile ground for false information — online and offline — during the elections. The number of internet users in Nigeria grew from 98.3 million in 2017 to 100.5 million in 2018. Facebook maintains the lead as the social media platform of choice with 22 million users, followed by YouTube (7 million+), Twitter (6 million) and Instagram (5.7 million). The majority of Nigerian voters are young. Out of the 84 million registered voters for the 2019 General Elections, over half — 51 percent — are young voters aged between 18 and 35, whereas nearly 30 percent are between 36 and 50 years old. These two groups of voters, which include both digital natives and digital immigrants, form the majority of Nigerian voters who are digitally savvy. Therefore, it was not surprising that digital media was one of the prominent battlegrounds for election campaigns in 2019. As a result, the credibility of online information during the 2019 elections suffered great attrition. False and misleading information, promoted as gospel truth, was amplified by supporters of the two major parties in Nigeria: the All Progressive Congress (APC) and the People’s Democratic Party (PDP). Based on ethnographic participant observation conducted between October 28, 2018, and May 29, 2019, ethnic hate was employed as a tool for disinformation and propaganda by both sides of the political divide on Twitter Nigeria during the 2019 presidential elections. These observations were captured as screengrabs of tweets or saved URLs collected over this period. In terms of ethnically-charged disinformation, some APC supporters accused Obi of being a bigot for purportedly deporting northerners while he was governor of Anambra State, in southeast Nigeria. Tweets went viral that claimed that Yoruba people were burning shops of Igbo traders in Lagos. Both stories were false and will be explored further in Part II of this essay. In another example, a photograph was used to misconstrue facts. On October 28, 2018, Festus Keyamo, then-media director of the Buhari Campaign Organisation, tweeted an image (Figure 1) of a tree growing between an apparently abandoned Nigerian rail track: “This is how trees grew in-between rail tracks between 1999 and 2015… Now, this is the ‘Completion Era’ as the tracks are beginning to roar back to life.” The PDP government was in power between 1999 and 2015. However, a Nigerian Twitter user later traced back the image to an original Arabic-language tweet (Figure 2) posted earlier that same month. According to the tweet, the photo is from Lebanon. Keyamo’s intention may have been to show that the Buhari government had surpassed previous administrations on the revamping of the morbid rail lines in the country. However, the use of an image from a different country made the so-called “gains” questionable. Online ethnic hate speech was also pronounced before, during and after the elections. In an ethnic slurred tweet (Figure 3) Bashir El-Rufai, son of the Kaduna State Governor, inferred that the Nigerian Civil War was ignited by the Igbo vengeance. Between 1967 and 1970, Nigeria fought a bitter civil war with the secessionist state of Biafra inhabited mostly by the Igbo in the southeastern part of the country. Hence, according to Bashir El-Rufai, the result of the 2019 elections which was won by his party, the APC, should also be taken as a sweet “revenge” from the Hausa, Fulani. He later apologized, after a backlash, for his previous “insensitive” tweet as shown in Figure 4. He also deleted the earlier tweet (Figure 3). Ethnic-motivated false information on social media during the elections falls into two categories: disinformation and propaganda. Miroslav Tudjman and Nives Mikelic, communication scholars at the University of Zagreb, Croatia, define disinformation as “intentionally deputed mistaken information with the purpose to mislead the user.” Hence, the intention to pass across inaccurate, distorted and false evidence as true, distinguishes dis-information from misinformation. Tudjman and Mikelic assert that propaganda is much more than disinformation or misinformation. This is because propaganda “aims to manipulate the attitudes of the user” through an “accidental or intentional handling with information in [the] communication process.” Thus, propaganda weaponizes biased or inaccurate information for political interests and consequently manipulates perception. Justifiable fears emerged surrounding 2019 elections because online disinformation and propaganda incites electoral violence but also poses “a threat to reconciliation after the elections.” Part II of this essay will examine how this played out online, especially on Twitter, with specific examples. This article is part of a series of posts examining interference with digital rights through methods such as network shutdowns and disinformation during key political events in seven African countries: Algeria, Ethiopia, Mozambique, Nigeria, Tunisia, Uganda, and Zimbabwe. The project is funded by the Africa Digital Rights Fund of The Collaboration on International ICT Policy for East and Southern Africa (CIPESA)."

While Britain struggles to find an orderly way to exit the European Union after several years of attempting to do so, the country will highlight how other world problems affect ordinary people in its role as Security Council president in November. That focus definitely means avoiding the subject of Brexit! Britain, which has been in a stalemate for more than three years over its decision to leave the European Union, feels pressure now more than ever to define its foreign policy post-Brexit, as the deadline to leave has been extended to Jan. 31. Discussing that topic openly, however, is not happening much at the United Nations. Undoubtedly, the British mission to the UN, based in New York City, wants to help safeguard against meddling in its general election at home, on Dec. 12, so the mission is not going to talk publicly about actions embroiling the British Parliament or negotiations on Brexit in Brussels. To stay away from discussing its own sensitive politics, Britain appears to be using the Council presidency to concentrate on other countries’ problems. Nevertheless, Ambassador Karen Pierce did say in a media briefing (below), that British diplomacy at the UN is not “in any way hindered by anything, to be absolutely honest.” For November, Britain wants to remind the UN that civilians are the people most affected by conflicts across the world, hence its theme of the month: how international peace and security impacts ordinary citizens. To follow this focus, the Council just met — albeit privately — about the use of chemical weapons against civilians and hospitals in Syria and provided a follow-up session on women, peace and security. The Council will also be briefed on the G5 Sahel force in West Africa, Somalia and other problems in Syria. In addition, it will hold consultations on Yemen, where a fragile peace agreement concerning the south of the country has recently been signed. Britain’s foreign minister, Dominic Raab, is not scheduled to attend Security Council meetings this month. While Theresa May, the former prime minister, said last spring that Britain wanted out as a guarantor on the Cyprus issue, the Council is holding another private meeting — on Cyprus — on Nov. 25, the same day that UN Secretary-General António Guterres plans to meet with Greek and Turkish Cypriot leaders in Berlin. The goal is to have the two Cypriot leaders sign a memorandum of understanding to restart negotiations on the future of the island. David Clay, the political coordinator of the British mission in New York, whom PassBlue interviewed for this column, refused to comment on Britain’s role in any new negotiations on Cyprus by the UN. (Britain has military bases in Cyprus.) Each month, PassBlue profiles UN ambassadors as they step into the role of Council president and highlights important data about their countries, including their carbon-emission levels and maternal death rates. These data can signal a country’s commitment to improving domestic policies on social and economic conditions and its support of the Sustainable Development Goals. For example, the maternal death rate for Britain was 10 for every 100,000 women, according to the latest data, from 2015. By contrast, the rate of the United States that year was 26.4/100,000. This column follows others on the US, Bolivia, China, Dominican Republic, Equatorial Guinea, France, Germany, Ivory Coast and Russia, among others. The interview has been edited and condensed and includes information from Ambassador Pierce’s media briefing on Nov. 1 and previous interviews with her for PassBlue.

Britain’s Ambassador to the UN: Karen Pierce
Ambassador to UN Since: March 2018
Languages: English, Japanese
Education: London School of Economics (master’s degree in international strategy and diplomacy); Cambridge University (M.A. in English)
Her story, briefly: To know more about Ambassador Pierce, read our profile of her as Security Council president in 2018; our exclusive interview about how she dashes style with diplomacy; and our audio segment of this interview. Since she was not available for an interview, PassBlue met with David Clay, the country’s political coordinator since 2016. Before being posted in New York City, he worked in Egypt and Libya. Here is what he said: Ambassador Pierce told the media on Nov. 1, 2019, that Britain’s focus for the month is how international peace and security affects ordinary people. Why is it important for Britain to remind the UN of this issue; do you think it’s too-often forgotten? I think that the people should be at the core of what the UN does. And I think we will want to re-emphasize the importance of the UN’s role in serving the people during [our] presidency. How is Britain going to emphasize how ordinary people are affected by conflicts? One way that we will do this is through the briefers, who will be part of the meetings [in the Security Council], making sure that we bring to the fore the voices of civil society. One issue related to how conflict affects the general public is the alleged use of chemical weapons on citizens in Syria. Why did Britain keep the meeting (on Nov. 5) with the Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (OPCW) private but allowed some countries to observe and speak? How will a closed meeting advance the cause of UN transparency? When we were looking at the format for this meeting, there were a couple of things we had to bear in mind. Firstly, we wanted to promote an interactive and frank exchange with the DG [director general of the OPCW], and sometimes having meetings in the open chamber does not necessarily encourage a frank, interactive exchange. But at the same time, we did feel that it was important that there was a degree of transparency in how we were approaching it. So we wanted to find a format that would allow other UN member states to observe the meeting, and in the case of Syria, to speak at the meeting should they wish to do so. The regular format for the Syria chemical weapons meeting is usually in closed consultations, but we thought because the DG was there, we wanted to shift the format to provide that extra level of transparency. On Nov. 25, the Security Council will meet on Cyprus, where the UN has had a peacekeeping mission for decades. Cyprus is an issue close to Britain, as a guarantor to a peace process. A few months ago, however, your previous prime minister, Theresa May, said that Britain wanted out as a guarantor. Why? I’m not going to comment on the government’s position on the issue of being a guarantor. As far as the Council meeting is concerned, we are examining how it will work with the meeting with the [UN] secretary-general [in Berlin], and we want to find a way for the Council to support the secretary-general and his discussions with the parties. So Britain’s presidency is happening while your country is at a serious turning point internationally, given the uncertainty around your exit from the European Union. Without going into great detail, can you describe how Brexit is affecting your foreign ministry now and what it means for the future? Personally, I think it’s a very exciting time to be a British diplomat. There’s lots going on politically; there’s an election going on in the UK [Dec. 12], so I’m not going to make any comments on Brexit. But from the perspective of the UK mission in the UN, I think there’s lots to be excited about. And we have a great leadership at the mission with lots of ambition for the UK, its role in the UN Council and in the UN more broadly. Your country’s potential exit from the European Union means that Britain no longer has to abide by Article 34 of the European Union Charter, which means Britain is not required to speak as part of the European nations on the Security Council about politically related problems or agenda items. Are there specific issues that Britain may find challenging to speak about alone rather than as a member of the EU? It’s a difficult question; I don’t think there’s anything in particular that I would point to. It’s obvious we don’t quite know what the future relationship with the EU is going to look like. So it’s quite hard to answer the question. But I think there’s a lot that we currently cooperate with the European Union. And I think, in the future, if we do leave the European Union, then that will continue to work extremely closely with our European colleagues across the whole range of business, including the Security Council. In September, a UN report said that Britain, the US and France may be complicit in war crimes in Yemen by arming and providing support to the Saudi-led coalition, which has starved civilians as a war tactic. How does Britain balance its economic and political relationship with Saudi Arabia, considering its poor record on human rights in its own country and military attacks on innocent people in Yemen? The relationship with Saudi Arabia is a long and very important one for the UK. Obviously, economically, but also politically, so I think what that relationship enables us to do is to have frank and honest conversations with Saudi Arabia about a range of issues, and certainly including [Jamal] Khashoggi. But also we have a very deep dialogue with them on the situation in Yemen. Obviously, Yemen is something that we’re going to be discussing during our presidency of the Security Council in a couple of weeks’ time. [Nov. 22] We continue to be very, very supportive of the efforts of the [UN] special representative, and we’ll look for opportunities during our presidency to underline that. There’s no military solution [but there], needs to be a political solution. And Saudi Arabia will be an important part of any political solution in Yemen. Prime Minister Boris Johnson’s speech in the UN General Assembly in September, about artificial intelligence, was so fascinating for so late at night. (He said, for example, “Your mattress will monitor your nightmares; your fridge will beep for more cheese”). What did you think of his remarks and was the British mission involved in writing it? And why did Johnson talk about technology when there are so many other issues he could have talked about? I don’t think I’m revealing any state secrets when I say, the prime minister writes his own speeches. And so that was very much the perspective of the prime minister. And I think that you can choose a range of different approaches for speeches to the General Assembly. And I think, to be memorable, I think often, yes, focusing on a particular subject can actually be a more effective way to make a difference than covering a broad range of issues. Country Profile

Medium.com,Society,Surgeons Transplanted Living Pig Skin Onto Humans for the First Time,World,https://onezero.medium.com/surgeons-transplanted-pig-skin-onto-humans-for-the-first-time-607fc519eb56?source=topic_page---------36------------------1," a pathogen-free facility in Grafton, Massachusetts, a small town about 40 miles west of Boston, genetically engineered miniature pigs are being bred to donate their skin to humans. Their skin, which looks remarkably similar to the human variety and is referred to as Xeno-Skin, will be transplanted by surgeons at Massachusetts General Hospital to a small group of burn victims in an attempt to speed up the healing process. It’s the first experiment approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration to use living animal tissue in humans, a necessary step toward someday transferring entire organs grown in animals to people who need them — a process known as xenotransplantation. The need for such organs is dire. Each day, 20 people die waiting for an organ transplant. More than 113,000 people in the United States are currently waiting for one, while only 36,528 transplants were performed in 2018, according to government data. Every year, the waiting list grows, greatly outpacing the number of available organs. For decades, researchers looked to animal donors as a way to ease this chronic shortage, but transplants from animals have often failed. “As humans, we’re just a bag of fluids and our skin is the plastic bag.” Xeno-Skin, developed by Boston-based biotech company XenoTherapeutics, shows promise. So far, one patient has received the genetically engineered pig skin graft, and five more burn victims are slated to receive it. The grafts are meant to be temporary and will be removed once the patients’ own skin has grown back. Doctors involved in the trial say the donor tissue appears to be healing as well as a human skin graft, which was transplanted next to the pig skin for side-by-side comparison. The process also hasn’t caused negative reactions like provoking an immune response or transmitting animal viruses, two major issues in xenotransplantation. “We’re trying to replicate exactly the same mechanisms that are used in the standard of care, or the gold standard treatment, for severe and extensive burns,” Paul Holzer, CEO of XenoTherapeutics, tells OneZero. Typically, severe second- and third-degree burns are treated with allografts, or skin from human cadavers. Allografts help protect wounds from infection, prevent fluid loss from the body, and stabilize patients while their own skin grows back. “The skin is a really important barrier to all the things in the world,” says Dr. Curtis Cetrulo, a plastic and reconstructive surgeon at Massachusetts General Hospital who previously served as president of XenoTherapeutics’ board of directors. “As humans, we’re just a bag of fluids, and our skin is the plastic bag.” Skin stays alive for some time after death, which is why it can be preserved from both humans and pigs. But like other organs, cadaver skin is expensive and can be difficult to acquire from national skin banks because there aren’t enough donors. Skin banks have strict criteria and can’t accept skin from donors with cancer or viral infections like HIV and hepatitis because of the potential to transmit those diseases to graft recipients. Some banks also have age restrictions on skin donors. Pig skin could be an alternative when cadaver skin is scarce, especially on the battlefield and in developing countries, says Holzer. Skin from pigs and other animals is already used for wound dressings, but these are first treated with chemicals or radiation and essentially dried out so their cells are no longer alive. “It’s basically a piece of leather,” says Cetrulo. “It’s dead, processed tissue.” Xeno-Skin is made of living tissue and is intended to promote blood flow, or vascularization, a key step in the healing process that helps fight off infections. The first patient received a five-by-five-centimeter piece of Xeno-Skin, but subsequent patients will receive larger grafts. Five days after the first patient’s transplant, surgeons removed both the pig and cadaver grafts, replacing them with permanent grafts taken from the patient’s thigh. The patient is healing and is expected to return to work soon. Temporarily grafting pig skin onto burns is much less complicated than transplanting pig organs into humans for the long term, but Dr. Abbas Ardehali, a heart and lung transplant surgeon at the University of California, Los Angeles, who is not involved in the Xeno-Skin trial, says trying it transiently makes sense from a safety perspective. “I think the benefit of that approach is that if worst comes to worst, the pig skin fails and you’re back to square one. It’s not like you’ve undergone a major operation like a heart or lung transplant to find that the patient dies as a result.”"
Medium.com,Society,Whitewashed: When Erasing a Mural Emboldens a Message,World,https://medium.com/@elizabethswebster/whitewashed-when-erasing-a-mural-emboldens-a-message-2aa07902e152?source=topic_page---------37------------------1," Can Bogotá’s thriving street art scene survive the military’s censorship? Street artists know better than most that tags matter. A wall splashed with Banksy’s iconic stencil-work is immediately an asset to be preserved and valued, while one tagged by an emerging artist could result in criminal charges and hefty fines. To label something “graffiti” conjures indecipherable images of urban blight, while “street art” intends to engage and represent the public. While the art community increasingly recognizes the significance of street art, law enforcement still often remains empowered to shut it down. Fellow citizens can have similarly inconsistent reactions to murals and tags marking city streets. Where one individual worries for the threat of gang members claiming territory and plummeting property values, another will see beauty, commentary, and community renaissance as a plain wall transforms to a burst of color. There isn’t global consensus yet on how to handle street art, but there is a shift taking place as more cities recognize the art form’s legitimacy. Colombia has become a haven to street artists from around the world. After a police officer shot and killed 16 year-old street artist Diego Felipe Becerra, aka “Tripido,” protests erupted around Bogotá. City Hall responded by decriminalizing street art, downgrading it to a civil offense, and regulating its expression in certain designated areas. The decision to make peace with street art has had unexpected benefits for Bogotá. Colorful murals have transformed the city’s appearance, revitalizing depressed areas that had fallen into decay. Bogotá’s ever-changing outdoor gallery has also been a boon for its tourist industry. Street artists come from around the world to be inspired, exchange ideas with likeminded artists, and to make their mark on Bogotá’s streets. Numerous street art tours accommodate ordinary tourists seeking further insight into the city’s storied streets, offering further context to the political commentary and satire that often underpin the images. Businesses often commission works on their walls, both to add to their street credibility and to take control of a blank space before its tagged. What was once a form of vandalism has become a cottage industry, and the world has taken notice. Street art has given the world a new lens through which to view Colombia. Following years of conflict with (Fuerzas Armadas Revolucionarias de Colombia — FARC) FARC guerrillas, political corruption, and economic stagnation, its walls remind the world of its vibrant color and its scrappy spirit. Yet, street art is by its nature ephemeral, always at risk of erasure; it’s stunningly simple to whitewash a wall. And while Bogotá’s street artists have enjoyed a kind of détente from the attentions of law enforcement, their art depends less on the letter of the law than the attitude of those who would enforce it. In recent years, many locals have advocated for the preservation of street art in Bogotá. Artists and their supporters make the point that while tourists flock to street art, the murals also allow artists to be financially independent and cultivate creative expression in depressed areas of the city. Such positive developments for street artists in Bogotá doesn’t inoculate the work from repression, however. A mural illustrated with spray paint and etched in graffiti may very well always be under threat. In Bogotá however, the arbitrariness of enforcement has taken a new, dark turn."
Medium.com,Society,5 Ways the Hunger Games Dystopia Happened in Real Life,World,https://medium.com/@FEE.org/5-ways-the-hunger-games-dystopia-happened-in-real-life-1fcee240c5ef?source=topic_page---------38------------------1," By Jen Maffessanti It’s no secret that young-adult dystopian fiction had a very real moment recently with franchises like Divergent and Maze Runner making it to the big screen. But the most wildly successful has to be the Hunger Gamesseries by Suzanne Collins. The movie versions featured Hollywood darling Jennifer Lawrence among other big-name actors like Donald Sutherland, Philip Seymore Hoffman, Liam Hemsworth, and Elizabeth Banks. Dystopian stories are popular for sure, but you don’t have to turn to fiction to find them. We can see them in the socialist countries that existed and continue to exist in the real world. In The Hunger Games, the Capitol is the seat of political power in the nation of Panem. It’s also where you find all the good stuff. The protagonist Katniss, from impoverished District 12, is shocked by the beauty, the cleanliness, the opulence that she sees in the Capitol. The colors and varieties of clothes and jewelry, the quality and quantity of food, the grace of the architecture, the comfort of the furnishings. Cutting-edge holographic technology. Weapons. Even simply reliable electricity. Everything surpasses what’s in the Districts. It isn’t that such finery isn’t affordable to the people back home, it’s that it isn’t available at all, not even to the District mayor. The everyday folks back in the District are stuck with ramshackle houses, much-mended clothes, and low-quality food that is only sometimes enough. In the Soviet Union, it was a similar situation in the capital cities like Moscow, if less exaggerated. Since it was the seat of political power for the Communist Party, that’s where the majority of luxuries were. Luxury goods were very expensive and hard to find outside of the city, if they could be found at all. Big cities like Moscow were where you had the best shops, the best vehicles, the best clothes. Some of the goods managed to get out to the countryside, especially if there was a particularly important industry there, but the largest concentrations were in the capital city. Even today, the dichotomy of the capital having the good stuff (or at least the better stuff) while the countryside does without remains true. Check out this satellite image of North and South Korea. Relatively free South Korea is lit up throughout the entire country, not just the capital city of Seoul. In North Korea, Pyongyang (the capital city) is a conspicuous pinprick of light in a sea of darkness. Sure, in major cities in fairly free countries, you find a greater concentration of high-end goods and architecture, but New York City, for example, isn’t the nation’s capital, nor is it even the state capital. While in the Capitol, Katniss is stunned by the food available, the kind she’d never even dreamed of back home in District 12. In fact, during her pre-Games interview, when asked what she finds to be the most impressive thing about the Capitol, she answers, “The lamb stew.” Earlier, in chapter five, she tries to compare a single meal on the train to the Capitol with what she’d be able to come up with herself at home: I try to imagine assembling this meal myself back home. Chickens are too expensive, but I could make do with a wild turkey. I’d need to shoot a second turkey to trade for an orange. Goat’s milk would have to substitute for cream. We can grow peas in the garden. I’d have to get wild onions from the woods. I don’t recognize the grain, our own tessera rations cook down to an unattractive brown mush. Fancy rolls would mean another trade with the baker, perhaps for two or three squirrels. As for the pudding, I can’t even guess what’s in it. Days of hunting and gathering for this one meal and even then it would be a poor substitution for the Capitol version. Back in the real world, Soviet apparatchiks enjoyed exclusive grocery storesthat non-Party members were barred from using. Steaks, lobster, and caviar were secretly delivered to Party elites that never made it to the shelves of even the exclusive Party grocery stores while the common people were relegated to meager supplies of low-quality foods. But even the finest food in the Soviet Union couldn’t compare to what was found in grocery stores in the US. A more modern example is Venezuela. The average Venezuelan adult dropped 25 pounds in 2017 due to lack of food, and many are suffering from malnutrition. Meanwhile, Socialist Party loyalists receive “solidarity bags” of food and President Maduro can be seen feasting at a decadent table with his wife. In Panem, the Capitol enjoys luxurious, high-tech hover transports and slick motor cars. What motorized transportation that exists in the districts is for moving around production goods and inputs (and Peacekeeper troops). Katniss takes note of the District 12 coal miners walking to and from their shifts, exhausted. In fact, until becoming a tribute, Katniss has never ridden in a car. It’s a short ride from the Justice Building to the train station. I’ve never been in a car before. Rarely even ridden in wagons. In the Seam, we travel on foot. In the Soviet Union and East Germany, common people, if they managed to even get a personal car, paid a small fortune for low-quality junkers and another small fortune for garage space so the precious autos wouldn’t be stolen and/or stripped for parts. They were so precious, in fact, that they were rarely used lest they become damaged or break down. But at least the military had their tanks and the Party top brass got armored limos. In modern Cuba, the requirement that citizens have a permit to buy a car was only repealed in 2014. A recent episode of popular British car show Top Gear showed the hosts taking a trip to the island nation to get a feel for their car culture. Most cars were modified classic American cars that were imported before the embargo of 1959. Granted, the embargo was instituted by the US, not Cuba, but there ought to be European, Japanese, and Korean cars, right? Taxes and markups make buying a new car 4 or 5 times more expensive in Cuba than in Europe, so even extremely modest econoboxes are out of reach of the common Cuban, hence the prevalence of what Americans would consider very old cars. Many everyday Cubans with a car have it registered as a taxi so they can give rides to those without one. But El Presidente still has access to those pimpy armored convertibles and his cronies ride around in new Range Rovers. In Panem, every District has an assigned specialty. Our heroes’ home district, 12, mines coal. District 11 deals with agriculture. The closer the district is to the Capitol, the “nicer” their specialty. District 1, for example, makes luxury goods like jewelry and other decorations for the Capitol. District 3 creates its technology. Unless you’re a tribute or a coach for the Hunger Games (or you join the Peacekeepers), you’re forbidden to leave your district to do something you might like better. The Chinese social credit system you hear so much about is not a new idea. In China under the rule of Mao Zedong, the citizens were given a lifetime employment guarantee that came to be known as the “Iron Rice Bowl.” Knowing you’ll always have a job might sound nice, but in practice — since there was no private enterprise, only state-owned and state-run enterprise — your permanent employer was the government. People were divided into work units, which they tended to be born into, that controlled almost every aspect of a person’s life. The work unit administration had to grant permission before someone could move to a new city, and, of course, that permission was contingent on how “good” a citizen you were. The Chinese social credit system you hear so much about is not a new idea. Nowadays, North Koreans are still kept on a very short leash with only a very select few (politicians and athletes, most notably) being allowed to leave the country, regardless of their wishes. In Venezuela, as their economy continues to collapse, women who had been health care professionals, lawyers, and professors resort to selling their own bodies just to feed themselves and their families. What these people want, what they’ve studied and trained to do, is irrelevant when their main concern staying just ahead of starvation. The very basis of the Hunger Games is centered around punishing the already subjugated Districts for their failed rebellion attempt decades ago. The yearly reminder of who exactly is in charge is the foundation of the story itself. These Games are a pre-emptive form of dissent suppression. In the 74th Games, Katniss’s three-finger salute for Rue after covering her in flowers and her partnership with Peeta are viewed by the Capitol as dissent, and they go out of their way to attempt to kill her in the Games. In the very first chapter, Katniss remembers, I scared my mother to death, the things I would blurt out about District 12, about the people who rule our country, Panem… Eventually I understood this would only lead us to more trouble. So I learned to hold my tongue and to turn my features into an indifferent mask so that no one could ever read my thoughts. And let’s not forget the poor Avoxes, people deemed traitors who’ve been rendered mute and forced into servitude in the Capitol. The Soviet Union and East Germany may not have had Hunger Games, but they definitely had gulags and the Stasi. Any action or speech that didn’t fall within acceptable norms set by the Party was viewed as deviance and dissent and could net you a one-way ticket to “re-education.” There’s evidence that the Ukrainian Holodomor, a man-made famine from 1932–1933 that saw millions of Ukrainians starved to death, was instituted to punish perceived disloyalty. To this day, critics of the Chavez/Maduro regimes of Venezuela are imprisoned or simply killed. A Venezuelan friend and former co-worker can’t return home for fear of retribution for his political stances, and he’s far from the only one. And North Korea’s system of prison camps for those who dare to question Dear Leader’s authority is the stuff of nightmares. Masaji Ishikawa, who escaped from North Korea, writes, What if the local villagers came to realize that their standard of living was pitiful? Worse still, what would happen if they got wind of the concept of free thought from us? They might question the wisdom of Kim Il-sung. And that was verboten. To be clear, there’s no shame in enjoying dystopian fiction. Goodness knows I certainly do. Watching either on the screen or in our mind’s eye as our courageous hero or heroine topples the clearly evil regime is intensely satisfying. But these fictional stories gain a certain weight when we pause to think about the real-life dystopias that existed and continue to exist today. Granted, no government, no society, is ever perfect. Even the freest, most prosperous nations have room for improvement. All governments fall short of living up to their stated principles. That said, some are worse — much worse — than others. While the ones that trample the human rights of their citizens aren’t limited to the command-and-control regimes of socialism, all of those socialist states that fully embrace the ideology ultimately do. As we celebrate the 30th anniversary of the fall of the Berlin Wall on November 9, remember the real-life heroes and heroines who risked everything for freedom. But also remember those who are still suffering under the bootheels of those governments that seek to control them."

Medium.com,Society,Populism vs Populism: The Choice in the UK,World,https://medium.com/discourse/populism-vs-populism-the-choice-in-the-uk-d877af59075d?source=topic_page---------42------------------1," We’re all familiar, because in recent years it has become necessary that we are, with the “lesser of two evils” dynamic in elections. Whether you endorse the view of Boris, Corbyn, Trump, or Hillary as evil is largely irrelevant — that is how many people have seen their political “choices” as of late. But we haven’t really seen an election where the two main choices are populists with anti-establishment messages until now in the Western world. The UK general election will be unique in this regard, with two very different, but simultaneously very similar, election campaigns. The most interesting aspect of this election is that, with the two right- and left-wing parties heading largely for the political poles, political science suggests that a centre-ground option should be gaining large support and posing a serious challenge to the established duopoly. No such luck. The Lib Dems are still relatively centrist on most issues, but their passionate pro-European identity has led them to be viewed as an often unsavoury, extreme option. No matter where one stands on the Brexit debate, the Lib Dems aren’t presenting a centre-ground choice on the matter, and that is severely limiting any potential growth for them. So there will be no repeat of the French election of 2017, where Macron’s La République En Marche! centre-ground party challenged and ultimately dislodged the Parti Socialiste as the ‘left’ of the key political duopoly. Instead, the left-wing option is Labour, as it has been for almost a century. The last Labour government was decidedly centre-ground, though; there hasn’t been a truly left-wing Labour government since 1979 — and even then, that one was a bit weak. There hasn’t been, in truth, a socialist in Downing Street since Clement Attlee, elected after WWII. In a bid to end that trend, Corbyn is attacking the wealthy elite, the rich bankers and businessmen, and Boris’ friends in the City of London, who Corbyn believes are betting big on a no-deal exit in a financial establishment stitch-up of the British people. But Boris portrays MPs as those who are manufacturing an establishment betrayal of democracy and the referendum result; those who block and oppose Brexit at every turn, no matter how good and rightful the outcome. His is a “people vs. Parliament” campaign slogan. So fundamentally, the style and tone are the same, even while the content and substance — if, indeed, there can be much substance in a populist message — are very different. With this election, we can be sure of one thing: Bannonism has taken over Western democracies. It won’t stay forever — this might be, ironically, one of its last gasps. But this election will mark the peak of Trumpian populism. The dynamics of the electoral system and the weird world of the post-referendum purgatorial Britain will have much to do with the eventual outcome of Boris’ gamble, but, with such similar styles, one can’t help but see this election as little more than a litmus test for the centre of mass of politics in the UK. Does the country, after a decade of harsh austerity, blame bankers and capitalists for the failures of the NHS, the sorry state of the education system, and growing violent crime enough to stomach a radical brand of socialism? Or does the country feel like Corbyn and McDonnell in Downing Street is a step too far, and that we should instead back Boris, for a leaving the EU with a deal and creating a booming free market? Does it even believe that Boris can fulfil these two promises? I suspect that Boris will pick up more votes and more seats. But don’t expect it to be easy, don’t expect a large majority. If he does get the upper hand once more in Parliament, it will be granted to him reluctantly. But it will, nonetheless, be a mandate to govern, and the UK will see a populist return to Number 10."
Medium.com,Society,Twitter was a minefield of false information during the 2019 Nigerian elections,World,https://medium.com/adinkra/twitter-was-a-minefield-of-false-information-during-the-2019-nigerian-elections-7b20068b4231?source=topic_page---------43------------------1," By Nwachukwu Egbunike This story is the second in a two-part series on online ethnic hate speech, disinformation and propaganda during the 2019 Nigeria elections. You can read the first part here. In Nigeria, social media has a history of enabling ethnocentric disinformation and propaganda during elections. During the 2015 elections, Twitter Nigeria descended into a bitter and binary sparring match between supporters of the then-two major contestants, Goodluck Jonathan (PDP, an Ijaw Christian) and Muhammadu Buhari (APC, a Hausa, Fulani Muslim). Twitter became a tool for propagating ethnic hate and party politics. The 2019 elections were no exception. On February 15, Reporters Without Borders (RSF) released a statement expressing its concerns over an election campaign “polluted by disinformation.” Nigerians also expressed their concerns. Journalist Abdulbaqi Jari tweeted: A 2019 study by Dani Madrid-Morales, University of Huston and Herman Wasserman, University of Cape Town concluded that “mis- and disinformation campaigns have been used to influence political agendas” in Nigeria, Kenya and South Africa. The high exposure to disinformation in social media especially during electoral campaigns, leads to a “distrust” among social media users “because that’s where they find ‘fake news’ most often,” Madrid-Morales asserted. My ethnographic study between October 28, 2018, and May 29, 2019, that covered the 2019 Nigerian elections held on February 23 (to elect a president and a national assembly), and March 9 (to elect governors and state houses of assembly) revealed two major categories of false information: ethnocentric driven disinformation and political propaganda. Peter Obi, the running mate of the opposition People’s Democratic Party (PDP) presidential candidate Atiku Abubakar, was a victim of ethnocentric disinformation during the last elections. Obi was the former governor of Anambra State, in southeast Nigeria. A Twitter account supporting the Buhari-Osinbajo campaign, Coalition of Buhari-Osibanjo Movement, shared a tweet (Figure 1) which accused Obi of “deporting” northerners from Anambra State as governor. This charge was amplified by Nasir El-Rufai, Governor of Kaduna State and member of the ruling APC, who tweeted (Figure 2) that Obi was “a tribal bigot”. This, according to El-Rufai, made Obi unfit to be a vice president of Nigeria. What really happened? In July 2013, 67 Nigerians, mostly from the Igbo ethnic group, “were deported all the way from Lagos and dumped at almost the same spot at the popular Upper Iweka area” in Onitsha, Anambra State, reported the Nigerian Vanguard newspaper. Obi, who was then the governor of Anambra State, described this action by his Lagos State colleague, Tunde Fashola, as “illegal, unconstitutional, and a blatant violation of the human rights of the deportees.” Read more: Nigerian governor warns foreign governments: Interfere in our elections and ‘go back in body bags’ Following the public fury that this action generated, Premium Times reported that Obi was also guilty of the same action: In 2011, he repatriated child beggars back to Ebonyi and Akwa Ibom states, both in southern Nigeria. While Obi did indeed deport beggars back to states in Southern Nigeria, he did not deport northerners and the accusation tweeted (Figure 1) by the Coalition of Buhari-Osibanjo Movement Twitter account was inaccurate. Rather it was APC’s Tunde Fashola, who in December 2014, “ deported 70 northerners, found publicly begging” back to Kano State, according to the online investigative newspaper Sahara Reporters. However, this ethnically motivated disinformation was employed by APC supporters on Twitter to discredit their opponent. For instance, Jubril A. Gawat recently appointed as Lagos State’s senior special assistant on new media tweeted that (Figure 3) a vote for opposition candidate Atiku Abubakar “is a vote for Igbo.” Nigeria is a country where ethnic identities run deep. These divisions are usually exploited during elections by politicians because of the obvious need to pitch their opponents into opposing camps of “we” versus “them”. Hence, the allegations that Obi deported northerners was meant to re-ignite the ethnic animosities between the Igbo and Hausa, Fulani that led to the Nigerian Civil War. The aim of these disinformation campaigns was to paint Obi as a Biafran ethnic irredentist. Located in southeastern Nigeria, the breakaway Republic of Biafra, which lasted for three years through a bitter civil war between 1967 to 1970, is largely populated by the Igbo. Thus, Figure 3 proclamation that “a vote for Atiku is a vote for Igbo…” was aimed to revive the ghost of the acrimonious ethnic hatred that pitched Hausa against Igbo. In 2019 elections, this meant that Atiku is a supporter of the Igbo who had once tried to break away from Nigeria. Statements in Figures 1–3 convey strong emotions capable of reopening pent up memories, which in most cases have still not received closure, from both sides of the divide. The United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) maintains that disinformation like this targets the “vulnerability or partisan potential of recipients” by turning them into “amplifiers and multipliers.” Ethnically-charged electoral campaigns not only exploit deeply rooted prejudices but also morph recipients into disseminators of false information. Similarly, ethnocentrism was also used by PDP supporters on Twitter to drive votes against the APC in Lagos State. Figures 4 and 5 show tweets by a PDP sympathizer alleging that Yoruba had set Igbo shops in Lagos on fire. The stories were false and were quickly dispelled by the Lagos State Police. A Facebook post, using nearly the same words from Figure 4, and a picture depicting roads blocked by burning tires, circulated the same false claims. The photo used was from a February 24, 2017 protest that took place in a province near Pretoria, South Africa, reported African Check. On February 13, Twitter user Souljah tweeted (Figure 6) that Ballard Partners, a PR firm based in Washington DC, which was allegedly hired as a publicist for the Abubakar presidential campaign, had conducted a poll which predicted a loss for the opposition PDP presidential candidate. The result of the survey was conveyed in a letter signed by Brian Ballard, head of Ballard Partners, on February 5, and addressed to Olusola Saraki, the Director-General of Abubakar’s campaign. Souljah’s tweet went viral with over 1 million likes and 1 million retweets for obvious reasons. The presidential election was previously slated to hold on February 16 (later postponed to February 23) and, with this poll coming three days before the elections, would have been catastrophic for the opposition PDP. Read more: Nigeria postpones 2019 general elections hours before polls open, citing ‘logistics and operations’ concerns However, by the evening of February 13, Ballard Partners refuted the said survey (Figure 7) which they described as “fraudulent” and maintained that they had not “conducted any survey research on behalf of the People’s Democratic Party of Nigeria.” Ose Anenih, a PDP supporter reported some of the APC Twitter sympathizers who circulated the fake poll to the Twitter handle of the Nigerian police and the Independent Electoral Commission, the electoral umpire, for “criminally and illegally” trying to “interfere with free and fair elections.” But this was not the only case of weaponizing disinformation for political propaganda that was witnessed online during the elections. On December 4, 2018, Lauretta Onochie, presidential aide to Buhari [then incumbent presidential candidate] tweeted (Figure 8) a picture with food and 500 naira notes that was purportedly shared with the crowd that attended Abubakar’s presidential rally in Sokoto in northwest Nigeria, the previous day. Onochie’s allegations were completely false. In fact, the picture she shared “was taken in February 2017″ at an event unrelated to “electioneering”, Chuba Ugwu pointed out in a reply to her tweet. Onochie appears to be a specialist in disseminating falsehoods. The International Centre for Investigative Reporting (ICIR), an online news portal, analysed over 1,000 images shared on Twitter by Onochie between August 1, 2018, and July 31, 2019. The analysis revealed that “in at least 12 cases” Onochie “had used inaccurate pictures.” In March this year, Enough is Enough Nigeria (EIE), a youth-based movement and Paradigm Initiative (PI), a digital rights policy and advocacy group, instituted a court case in an Abuja court against Onochie and Gbenga Olorunpomi, an aide to Kogi State governor. The two organisations compiled instances of hate speech “gathered from online comments “ made by Onochie and Olorunpomiwhich they deemed to be in violation of Nigeria’s Cybercrime Act of 2015. Section 26 of Nigeria’s Cybercrime Act prohibits “use of threats of violence and insulting statements to persons based on race, religion, colour, descent or national or ethnic origin.” Convicted persons risk a five-year jail term or a fine not less than 10 million nairas [about $28,000 United States dollars] or both. Read more: How will propaganda shape Nigeria’s 2019 presidential elections? Most of the instances highlighted above were not mere happenstance. Rather, there was a deliberate and systematic effort to pass off lies as true information. This is not surprising considering that both APC and PDP engaged an army of online warriors to either “ neutralize adverse” social media reports or “fend off” attacks during the campaign periods. Each side engaged “ cyber troops” — “government or political party actors tasked with manipulating public opinion online.’’ This year’s elections were a repeat of 2015, where both APC and PDP engaged in “disinformation, misinformation, propaganda” campaigns on social media that were “carefully designed to hoodwink the unsuspecting electorate,” asserts Eshemokha Austin Maho, a Nigerian media scholar. They achieved this through the creation of “bogus social media accounts” from which “smear campaigns” and “doubtful information and propaganda” were disseminated. The resultant impact was that Twitter became a battleground of ethnocentric disinformation and political propaganda before, during and in the immediate aftermath of the 2019 elections in Nigeria.

Medium.com,Society,Who’s funding the campaigns of Athens candidates,World,https://medium.com/@nolanacramer/whos-funding-the-campaigns-of-athens-candidates-c4d65a4af3f0?source=topic_page---------44------------------1," The New Political obtained pre-general election campaign finance reports for most of the candidates running for City Council and mayor from the Athens County Board of Elections. The reports detail contributions candidates received and their campaign expenditures through Oct. 16. The general election in Athens is Tuesday. Damon Krane, Independent mayoral candidate: Damon Krane, a self-described democratic socialist and a food truck owner, is the challenging mayoral candidate. More than $6,000 of the nearly $7,900 of contributions made to Krane’s campaign were from himself. He received a total of 27 online credit card contributions ranging between $5 and $100 each, totaling in $891.60. The candidate also received $130 in cash donations. Just over $700 of Krane’s money came in the form of small donations from individuals outside Athens County. Contributions came from people who live in locations such as Columbus, Cleveland, Upper Sandusky, New York City, New York state, Maryland, North Carolina, Colorado and California. But more than $800 was donated to his campaign from Athens residents. Krane’s wife, Athens resident Ece Krane, made a $500 online contribution to her husband’s campaign. His campaign spent $635 on printing at Ohio University’s Alden Library. He also gave Independent City Council candidates Ellie Hamrick and Chris Monday in-kind contributions — non-monetary contributions in the form of goods or services — of spots in his campaign video advertisement, which he gave a fair market value of $100 per slot. A fair market value is the estimated worth of an in-kind contribution. Krane declared the advertising space on his Hot Potato Food Truck, where he placed a plethora of campaign literature, as an in-kind contribution he received with a fair market value of $550. The candidate spent over $1,200 on Facebook ads and more than $600 on campaign communications work done by a Columbus resident. Steve Patterson, Democratic mayoral candidate: Steve Patterson is the incumbent Democratic mayor of Athens, a former Ohio U professor and an Air Force veteran. Patterson received a total of $7,963 in campaign contributions. Of those contributions, $3,870 came from social or fundraising events. Robert Leslie Cornwell, the son of Les Cornwell — a landlord who owns the Palmer Place apartments and many other properties around town — donated $500 to the Patterson campaign. Alan McMillan, a businessman, Ohio U instructor and landlord, gave the candidate $250. Democratic members of Athens City Council also donated to the incumbent mayor. City Council President Chris Knisley contributed $50, and Sarah Grace, who is running for reelection, donated $50 to Patterson. Athens County Commissioner Lenny Eliason, who is married to Athens City Law Director Lisa Eliason, donated $250 to the candidate. The Ohio chapter of the American Federation of Labor and Congress of Industrial Organizations, a major labor union, contributed $250 to Patterson, and the National Association of Social Workers Ohio gave $200. While the vast majority of donations made to the candidate’s campaign came from Athens County residents, one contribution in the amount of $500 came from outside of the county. He received an in-kind contribution from the Athens County Democratic Party on April 7 for food, which had a fair market value of $100. The Patterson campaign donated $150 on Oct. 2 to the Athens County Democratic Party. Independent candidate Ellie Hamrick is an Ohio U graduate and a self-described socialist. Hamrick’s campaign received $2,128 in contributions. Notably, more than half the money the campaign raised — nearly $1,550 — came from donors who live outside Athens County, including in New York City, Virginia and Illinois. Nearly all contributions to her campaign were from online credit card donations. Her campaign also received a $200 online credit card donation from Krane. Hamrick spent almost $623 on Facebook ads, nearly $107 on SMS text message services and $75 on printing at Alden Library. The Hamrick campaign paid $588.26 in reimbursements to Ilya Kogan — who, according to her LinkedIn profile, is an Enterprise Application and Integration Architect for Ohio U — for T-shirts, stickers and the campaign’s SMS text message services. In the weeks before the election, Hamrick and Krane launched a text message campaign to promote their platforms to Ohio U students and to encourage voter registration. Her campaign received one in-kind contribution from a local videographer in the form of a campaign video with a fair market value of $50. Beth Clodfelter is the only Democratic challenger running for an at-large position on Athens City Council. Her campaign received a total of $7,362. More than $2000 of that came from a previous campaign. She received $5,012 from new contributions. The Ohio chapter of the National Association of Social Workers’ contributed $200. A total of $1,270 of her contributions were from social or fundraising events. Clodfelter received more than $1,900 from individuals outside Athens County, including members of her family who donated the majority of that sum. Athens City Councilmember Democrat Christine Fahl donated $100 and Lenny Eliason contributed $50 to her campaign. The Democrat’s campaign spent nearly $372 on supplies for a Fourth of July parade. This included one polo shirt for herself to wear, 12 T-shirts for her supporters, bags of candy and tags to go on the candy. Clodfelter’s campaign received one in-kind contribution of 175 business envelopes from the Athens County Democratic Party with a fair market value of $120.75. Sarah Grace is an incumbent Democratic candidate and landlord. Grace’s campaign received nearly $406 in donations. Of that, $55.89 were carried over from a previous campaign finance report, $250 were from new contributions and $100 were other income. The single contribution to her campaign was in the form of a $250 check from the Ohio chapter of the American Federation of Labor and Congress of Industrial Organizations. Her other income was a $100 cash contribution from herself. The campaign’s only expenditures included a $44.22 charge on Amazon for pinwheels for a parade and $290.88 for T-shirts. Grace also has one current loan out from herself in the amount of $1,350. The Athens County Democratic Executive Committee gave Grace’s campaign in-kind contributions for postage, printing and design work with a fair market value of $1170.78. Peter Kotses is an incumbent Democratic candidate and the owner of Athens Bicycle on Stimson Avenue. According to the campaign finance report from the Athens County Board of Elections, it received Kotses’ report one day late on Oct. 25; the deadline to file pre-general election reports was Oct. 24. Kotses’ campaign had $437.01 total funds available. Of that total, $237.01 were brought over from his last campaign finance report and $200 were from monetary contributions. The only contribution the campaign received was a $200 check from John Glazer, senior executive in residence for strategic development at Ohio U’s Voiniovich School of Leadership and Public Affairs. His campaign only had a single expenditure of nearly $177 to Minuteman Press, a local print shop, for printing. Additionally, the Democrat has a loan out from himself with an outstanding balance of $1,000. Kotses also received in-kind contributions from the Athens County Democratic Executive Committee in the amount of $1170.78 for postage, printing and design work. Independent candidates and Chris Monday are not represented because campaign finance law only requires candidates to file if they have contributions or expenditures greater than $1,000, according to the Athens County Board of Elections. Monday told TNP he received a small batch of donations totaling in $400, and he spent roughly that same amount on his campaign. Managing Editor Cole Behrens and News Editor Ben Peters contributed to this report. Editor’s Note: A previous version of this article misstated the locations of where some of Krane’s donations came from. The article was updated to clarify those locations."
Medium.com,Society,The Silent War in Mexico,World,https://medium.com/freeman-spogli-institute-for-international-studies/the-silent-war-in-mexico-e8e3c999f91b?source=topic_page---------45------------------1," The drug-fueled violence in Mexico long ago surpassed conventional definitions for civil war. So why aren’t we taking it seriously? Note: This article originally appeared in The American Interest on November 7, 2019. A war is raging in Mexico, but silence from newspapers, international organizations, and politicians has prevented most U.S. citizens — and indeed many publics around the globe — from taking notice. The war is not dissimilar from the violent conflicts in the Northern triangle in Central America. The immigration flows from Central America into the United States have, however, provided greater visibility for the plight of countries like Honduras, El Salvador, and Guatemala, polities beset by seemingly intractable wars between governments and drug trafficking criminal gangs. There is more awareness — even among those Americans who support the Trump Administration’s approach to Central American would-be migrants — of the insecurity that characterizes everyday life in places like San Pedro Sula, San Salvador, or Guatemala City. But in the case of Mexico, the combined effect of a Mexican foreign policy premised on “aquí no pasa nada” (nothing happens here), and a U.S. foreign policy establishment habituated to looking far beyond its own borders, has made Mexico’s plight somewhat invisible. For the past ten years, the government of Mexico has actively worked to downplay the seriousness of the security situation. Beyond national pride, these efforts were motivated by a perceived need to dispel any notion of Mexico being at risk of becoming a failed state. Back in 2009, when some analysts began talking about state failure in the Mexican context, then-Secretary of State Hillary Clinton made a trip south in order to display explicit U.S. support for the Mexican war on drugs and to dispel any notion of the lack of capacity of the Mexican state. The Mexican Ministry of Foreign Affairs regularly instructs its ambassadors and consular officials to neutralize discussions related to violence and drug trafficking, emphasizing that the vast majority of the national territory is actually safe, notwithstanding the detailed travel advisories issued by the State Department. And Mexican federal administrations have been reluctant to seek out help from multilateral aid agencies in fears that it may reinforce any image of state fragility. The downplaying strategy has worked in part because the security situation in Mexico is geographically uneven. A Level 4 State Department travel advisory — “Do not travel” — has been established for the Mexican states of Colima, Guerrero, Michoacán, Sinaloa, and Tamaulipas. Presumably these places in Mexico are as unsafe as the other countries in that category — namely Afghanistan, Central African Republic, North Korea, Iran, Iraq, Libya, Mali, Somalia, South Sudan, Syria, and Yemen. Yet U.S. and European tourists continue to flock to Mexican beach resort enclaves, to a large extent because they correctly perceive they are in no greater risk in those hotels and towns than in any island of the Caribbean. Similarly, business-as-usual continues among those involved in managing North American supply chains; major economic players in the region are not particularly interested in highlighting the current levels of violence. Indeed, the profound economic integration of the North American economies under NAFTA (now USCMA) has not been visibly disrupted by the drug war. Meanwhile, Mexicans who have done well for themselves live in their gated communities and hire private security to protect them. This is, after all, one of the privileges they get from living in such an unequal country: their incomes are high enough, while the salaries of their private guards are low enough, that they can afford to pay for their own protection. The war in Mexico has taken more than 200,000 lives in the past ten years, mostly young men in their prime. Mass graves dot the Mexican landscape, with tens of thousands of people gone missing, most presumed killed. Entire towns have been displaced. Among political scientists, a conventional definition of an interstate or civil war is when a conflict involves over 1,000 war-related casualties per year, with a minimum of 100 from each side. Mexico surpassed this conventional threshold more than a decade ago. The last few weeks alone have seen the deaths of Mexican law enforcement, community police, and soldiers numbering in the triple digits. Just a few weeks ago, at least 14 state police officers lost their lives in an ambush in Aguililla, Michoacán. In that same state, at the end of May, municipal police stations in the city of Zamora were attacked, leaving three police officers dead and ten seriously wounded. In Tepalcatepec, one of the most infamous Mexican drug cartels, the Cartel Jalisco Nueva Generación, clashed with the local militia in a declared war against their leader “El Abuelo,” leaving nine dead and 11 wounded. Although Michoacán is currently a hotspot of violence, the war is raging in many other states, including Guerrero, where a confrontation left 14 civilians and one soldier dead in the village of Tepochica three weeks ago. The Guerrero Violence Project offers perhaps the most comprehensive effort to document violent death in another Mexican state, where the now infamous resort of Acapulco is located. Chris Kyle and his collaborators document 372 violent deaths between June 1 and July 31 of this year, including dozens of police officers — most of them volunteer indigenous community police — as well as drug traffickers. There is also the collateral damage of the deaths of taxi drivers, peasants, students, car-washers, peddlers, tourists and their guides. This source also documents dozens of unidentified bodies found in the streets or in mass graves. In many other states in Mexico we simply do not have such detailed documentation of the death toll from the war. Violent death has become routinized for millions of Mexicans who live amidst the conflict. The administration of President Andrés Manuel López Obrador (AMLO as he is generally known) came into power a year ago with the promise of taking a different approach toward violence and drug traffic organizations than that of his predecessors. The hawkish administration of Felipe Calderón Hinojosa (2006–2012) embraced a callous stance against organized crime, responding with an escalation of a declared war on drug traffic organizations. The strategy was based on the faulty premise of believing that the best way to weaken drug cartels was by beheading the organizations, capturing or killing the leaders and lieutenants. The strategy turned out to produce even more violence, as fragmented and undisciplined criminal organizations competed for the vacuums of power left by captured or missing kingpins. The administration of Enrique Peña Nieto (2012–2018) did not shift the core elements of this national security strategy, except that it used a different approach of public communication, choosing to downplay events related to violence and public safety. AMLO has promised to change the strategy into one that seeks to emphasize peace, reconciliation and prevention. He has created a National Guard, mostly drawing form the military that were already carrying out police activities throughout the territory. But beyond the surface rhetoric and these symbolic moves, it’s hard to say if there is a more developed strategy waiting to be deployed. The scenarios for a more coherent security strategy in Mexico are not very promising, and there seems to be little room for maneuver. It is possible that violence will continue to gradually spread, while a few enclaves will concentrate federal manpower and security resources to ensure that their inhabitants are protected. This scenario would imply a normalization of the current violence. Mexico City, some of the main tourist resorts, and maybe some of the border cities would remain somewhat safe, while the rest of the country will bleed more and more profusely. That’s a projection of what maintaining the status quo would yield. But there is also a more catastrophic scenario, of which we recently got a foretaste in Culiacán, Sinaloa. There, a botched attempt to capture the son of “El Chapo” Guzmán led to an urban siege, shootouts, and the eventual liberation of the criminal — a controversial decision made by the Federal government on the argument that Guzman’s release prevented mass bloodshed of civilians and soldiers alike. The seriousness of what happened in Culiacán cannot be downplayed. It was not just one more episode of political violence, unrest, or the display of incompetence by the government. The Mexican state was unable to exercise its legitimate monopoly on the use of force. Criminal organizations may take the example of Culiacán as a signal that they can operate openly, with impunity, threatening mass civilian deaths any time their activities are challenged, terrorizing entire towns and cities, and bribing or killing public officials, police chiefs, mayors, and judges. Their extortion of economic activity would spread, threatening the everyday life of most citizens. Migratory flows to the United States would doubtless increase, due to the displacement of peoples typical of any war. The AMLO administration, however, could still avert the worst. And the United States could and should play a role. Mexico ought to accept more aid and technical support to sustain institutional reforms to strengthen the rule of law and train its police officers. The Mexican government should ask its northern neighbor to help with the sharing of intelligence, and the two countries should work seriously on better ways to coordinate the fight against organized crime. Of course, the temptation for the President of each country to pander to his own constituencies — to either bash Mexico as an electoral piñata or to play the nationalist anti-American card — unfortunately remains. Such shortsightedness, however, needs to be avoided. The costs of maintaining the status quo, and the very real danger of far worse outcomes, are far too real to ignore.

Medium.com,Society,Does the punishment fit the crime?,World,https://medium.com/@tlsuth/does-the-punishment-fit-the-crime-6e60bb7a692?source=topic_page---------47------------------1," A South African teacher has been accused of inappropriate relationships with school boys. As the story has unfolded, naked photographs and videos of her have gone viral. N
ever mind trial by social media, let's talk about vilification. It is a scandal that has captured the attention of even the most apathetic South African and went so far as to cross national borders to make headlines in The Daily Mail. A young, attractive teacher and sports coach, fairly newly wed and a member of an elite South African family has been accused of having an affair with a student — with allegations that this is not the first student with whom misconduct has occurred — coming to light. And of course the story has exploded. Memes have flooded the internet, many of them suggesting that these young men are incredibly lucky to have had the opportunity to have relations with a gorgeous, older woman. As I have never experienced life as an adolescent boy, I have no strong point of view on whether or not I would have felt victimized or empowered if my beautiful teacher had (allegedly) propositioned me or sent me sexy texts and racy photographs, but it makes sense that debates around the topic include the question: if this was a young (married) male teacher who had been accused of inappropriate relationships with school girls, would we feel the same way? As Tanya Farber points out in a salient write-up, “it has been a real litmus test for society at large about what happens when we flip the gender script of what we think a sexual violation looks like.” For those who are not familiar with South Africa, it has an adequate legal system — if any official charges were to be made against the teacher — and a school as prestigious as the one at the center of the scandal is no doubt investigating any claims of inappropriate behavior thoroughly. The media has also reported that the teacher has resigned from the school and that any school boys who have experienced anything other than a professional relationship with her are being asked to come forward. The bottom line is that the matter appears to be being addressed via all of the right channels and processes. Not to potentially undermine any negative experiences that the families of these school boys may be going through at the moment nor shy away from the obvious question of why?, but I believe that content around these topics should be teethed out only when there is more official information available on the subject. We just do not know enough at this stage to begin to imagine why a young woman who appears to have the world at her feet may risk it all, nor what the school boys who may have experienced her misconduct could be feeling. Regardless though, I think we can all agree that if these allegations are true, it is completely unethical to be in a teaching position and have anything other than professional conduct with school-going children. That said, what I would like to draw attention to, is how the photographs and video of this teacher have gone viral: A woman, not yet found guilty, at her most bare and vulnerable. With no knowledge of who the photographs or video were intended for and who initially shared them, it is difficult to label this “revenge porn”, but if it looks like a duck, swims like a duck, and quacks like a duck … The Business Insider South Africa reported on 24 October 2019 that the teacher´s name was one of the most searched terms and the number one global trend for a major online pornographic group, while South Africa´s News24 confirmed that a video allegedly of the teacher had been uploaded to a free pornographic site, before being taken down. The content was also reportedly shared across social media sites and whatsapp groups. The teacher´s lawyer released a statement shortly after the scandal broke to remind the nation that it is illegal to distribute any pictures or videos which may potentially have pornographic content. Media reports claim that the lawyer is also investigating the “leak”. In the USA, about one in 25 Americans are either threatened with or victims of nonconsensual image sharing. Activists have argued that we should be moving away from the term “revenge porn” in order to adequately capture the concept, which is far more complicated than someone posting a naked pic of you online in an act of revenge because you wronged them (victim blaming). As Sophie Maddocks writes, “We know it is a tool of control used by a range of people: from abusive partners and sex traffickers to hackers, scammers, and voyeurs. Whether it is distributed by leaflet, DVD, or WhatsApp group, we know NCII (Non-consensual Dissemination of Intimate Images) shames and silences countless victims every day.” In our public sharing of this teacher´s footage, and therefore exposing her, I wonder what the difference is between footage that goes viral and footage that we realize is disrespectful or inappropriate to view or share. I am left pondering how we thought it was okay to make this woman´s body public property. As Maddocks quotes in her story: ‘The solution is not technical, and it is not in the law. The problem is not the Internet and it is not Facebook. It’s not the forums, it’s not 4chan, it’s not Twitter, it’s not anonymity, it’s not freedom of expression. The problem is that we live in a culture of patriarchy that has many expressions on and offline’ — Activist, Latin America I wonder if it had been your wife or daughter or sister or friend, if you would have found it so entertaining. Do we feel vindicated by the fact that if this teacher did these things, and if that media content exists because she so wrongly sent it to school boys, she deserves this kind of public viewership? Furthermore, do the boys potentially embroiled in relations with the teacher not deserve to have the situation taken a little more seriously by ourselves? To Farber´s point, I wonder if we would be so glib if we, as society, truly suspected this as being about abuse rather than sex? Because that footage is symbolic of something far more complex than a naked woman. The act of sharing it, objectifying her and thinking it is funny seems to be a very poignant glimpse into our hunger for illicit content at the expense of other human beings. But hey, as long as media reports managed to mention that she used to be a model."
Medium.com,Society,Why the UK Election will not solve the Brexit stalemate,World,https://medium.com/@chribonn/why-the-uk-election-will-not-solve-the-brexit-stalemate-3e180777bf32?source=topic_page---------48------------------1," The road to an early election after the October 31st Brexit deadline was missed reminds me of the “I have a cunning plan” by Baldrick from the UK series Blackadder. For anyone who has not watched the series my only comment is that you don’t know what you’re missing. The Baldrick character was a run down sidekick who was downright stupid and naive. After parliament forced the hand of Boris Johnson, the UK’s prime minister, to seek [yet another] extension from the EU, Mr Johnson decided to call an election. Labour, out of a desperate desire to have its leader, Jeremy Corbyn, lead the country supported the bid to go to the polls. Is Johnson’s “cunning plan” going to result in the desired result? The United Kingdom is not interested in whether the Conservatives, Labour, Liberal Democrats, UKIP, SDP or any other group should be the ones forming the next government but a solution that will allow them to put this saga behind them and get on with their lives. An election will just repeat the cycle of economic uncertainty and political exhaustion the British people have had to put up with after Conservative leader David Cameroon landed them in this mess in June 2016. An election is the wrong choice because the outcome of this election will be a divided parliament and a divided parliament is a hung parliament. Rather than have John Bercow shouting “order” we will have Sir Lindsay Hoyle shouting out the phrase. Normally the electorate vote for a party based upon its agenda. This time round the agenda is based around the single topic of Brexit. Those participating in this election will fall into one of three groups: those who want a hard Brexit, those who want a negotiated exit and those who want to remain. It is highly likely that no single party will manage to secure a majority in parliament and would need to jump into bed with another party. When this happens, things will be even more complicated. Johnson’s conservative party has invited members it had expelled a few weeks earlier to re-join the conservative ticket. And when these elected members disagree with the stance taken by the [aspiring] prime minister they will be kicked out again, and we are back to square one. Rather than opt for an election, Prime Minister Boris Johnson should have pushed forward for a binding referendum. This referendum would have given the electorate a choice between remain, hard leave and negotiated leave options. Additional confounding matters that take focus away from the real blocking point would not factor in as they are with the election route. Anyone aligned to one of the three options would have been a liberty to lobby for that option outside the restrictions of their party. Parliament would find it easier to align with a referendum especially if this commitment is sought beforehand. The first referendum cannot be relied upon because those who participated in it were not made aware of the true consequences of the two options. The fact that the original two options have become three supports the fact that the first one was not well-thought-out. As mentioned above, a referendum may result in a three-way split in which no single choice secures a majority of the participating electoral pool. If this were a relatively minor topic, one could agree to go forward with the choice that secures the largest share of the votes. As the topic of Brexit will impact the life, livelihood and future opportunities and risks on a grand scale, this decision must require a clearly defined consensus. The referendum package would include a proviso that states that if no single choice secures a 50%+1 vote, the two highest options are polled against each other in 4 weeks time (after the holidays). The clear winner would be the popular choice. Political parties, having endorsed the referendum, would find it more acceptable to respect the sovereignty of the British public. As happened soon after Prime minister David Cameroon landed the country in the mess it is in, Prime minister Boris Johnson could announce his resignation or an early election if the will of the people turns out to be different from the position his party took. On the other hand if the results support the position the Conservatives lobbied for, he would take the country in the chosen direction with his head held high and a united parliament."
Medium.com,Society,The Dangers of Brexit Lassitude,World,https://medium.com/@simonnewman_12009/as-a-british-american-transformation-specialist-i-often-have-to-work-in-politically-charged-d5dd08973689?source=topic_page---------49------------------1," As a British-American transformation specialist, I often have to work in politically charged environments. Change causes emotions to run high, and in this environment Machiavellian constituents further their self-interested agendas by inflaming anger and fear rather than focusing on facts. When these manipulations happen, it always leads to bad outcomes. Brexit is magnitude larger and more complex than any corporate reorganization, but the unsavory psychological tactics employed by Vote Leave are similar to those used to thwart change in any institution. To resolve the Brexit debacle, it is necessary to understand and then unwind the manipulations used by Leave that made Brexit so divisive. Although there was exaggeration and fear mongering on both sides of the debate, there was no equivalency. The Vote Leave campaign sold UK citizens a false utopia of toasted snow, promising a bright economic future and a “take back of control” despite scant evidence to support their claims. Leave had no plan; they downplayed the costs of leaving and the unfavorable vagaries of the leaving process. The Sisyphean pursuit of Leave’s empty Brexit promises has, and will continue to, come up short. Whatever deal is on the table right now is about the best it will be. Leave deliberately over-simplified Brexit so many people had no idea what they were really committing to, but believed they did due a cognitive bias known as the illusion of explanatory depth. When we are familiar with something like a zipper, a door lock or the EU we become over-confident in our understanding of it, but if asked, we cannot explain how any of these things work. The referendum was designed to be deceptively simple with an “in or out” vote. The costly implementation of Brexit is anything but simple. Leave targeted angry, disenfranchised citizens with inflammatory narratives designed to falsely associate angst towards the EU, Brussels and immigrants as the true cause of their discontent, rather than unaddressed social, economic and political problems. Citizens acted on their emotions by voting, marching, tweeting, and sharing Facebook posts, which caused an escalation of commitment. These manipulations make people emotionally adamant, so they confuse strength of feelings with being right. One would think bringing facts to light would change people’s views. Not so fast! When a brain is emotionally hijacked, the normal send and receive of the brain gets shut down. People stop listening or taking in new information and get stuck on send. An emotionally hijacked brain is prone to confirmation bias because it cherry picks information that supports prior convictions and ignores or discounts everything else, even if the new evidence overwhelmingly suggests their original position was wrong. Corrective information can cause a backfire effect because if the new evidence is true, a person feels like a fool; but feeling a fool is dissonant with a positive self-image. To resolve the dissonance, people double down on their prior convictions. Lassitude is now the enemy. People are so worn down by the emotion, lies and frustrations of Brexit, they just want to get it over with. Lassitude is dangerous because it often results in the winner of a dispute being the loudest, most manipulative party. The stakes are too high for lassitude to win. There are some valid concerns with the EU but attempts to address these through Brexit need to be balanced against the consequences. For citizens to think it all through, the emotional temperature needs to be lowered so people can be open to hearing new facts and information. The extension, although not exactly a cooling off period, should be a time for citizens to ask pertinent questions that cut through any illusions such as: Hard though it may be, the ability for people to change their mind is critical to resolving any dispute including Brexit. Not all engagements end in marriage, and not all letters of intent result in a deal. Changing your mind even has biblical context. The King James Bible mentions the word “repent” or “repentance” over 100 times, but this word is a translation of the Greek word “Metanoia” which actually means to change one’s mind based on new information. So in addition to a general election, perhaps we should follow the advice of the Bible and allow people the courtesy to change their mind in a confirmatory Brexit or Remain referendum.

Medium.com,Society,Trump’s Actions Toward Ukraine Were Nothing Like Iran-Contra — They’re Worse,World,https://gen.medium.com/trumps-actions-toward-ukraine-were-nothing-like-iran-contra-they-re-worse-b5ce28066558?source=topic_page---------51------------------1," ith public impeachment hearings set to begin next week, Republicans are struggling to find a coherent defense that can withstand the new evidentiary blows coming their way almost every day. The days of arguing “no quid pro quo” have come and gone, and Trump’s repeated exhortations to “read the transcript” don’t help him, since the document, which was released by the White House, only confirms the allegations against him. Among the new administration trial balloons being floated is a constitutional argument: Trump’s actions amounted to the president crafting “foreign policy.” The theory of the case seems to be that the president has the power to unilaterally dictate foreign policy, and therefore Trump’s withholding aid for Ukraine, in sync with pressure to investigate the Bidens, cannot be a basis for impeachment. This defense is not only wrong as a matter of law and practice, it has the potential to backfire spectacularly against Trump. It’s true that among the branches, the executive has the most latitude and discretion in the realm of foreign affairs. This is spelled out in powerful language in the 1936 Supreme Court case United States v. Curtiss-Wright Export Corp., which notes the president’s “plenary” foreign affairs authority and his role as the nation’s “sole organ” in international relations. Not surprisingly, this case is a favorite for supporters of expansive presidential power — the sweeping language appears to suggest unfettered presidential discretion in foreign policy. What people often forget to mention is that Curtiss-Wright is actually a case where Congress delegated foreign affairs authority to the president. In fact, the legal question raised was whether Congress had unconstitutionally delegated too much discretion to the executive branch. The case is an illustration of how the president’s power over foreign affairs can be shaped, expanded, or constrained by Congress’ constitutional powers in this area. Consider, for example, the Senate’s authority to ratify treaties negotiated by the president — it can tank an agreement reached by the president with a foreign head of state. Congress also holds the power to regulate international commerce, under which it can impose sanctions on countries as a way of incentivizing or discouraging particular kinds of behavior. Trump’s signature travel ban was upheld by the Supreme Court under authority delegated to him by Congress’ immigration powers, not his own Article II authority. Of course, the most potent weapon in Congress’ constitutional tool kit is its appropriations power. On this front, Iran-Contra is an instructive comparison and counterpoint to the current Ukraine mess. To recap that convoluted scandal: In the ’80s, Congress passed the Boland Amendment, which prohibited the use of federal funds to support the Contras in Nicaragua, who were fighting against the Communist-backed Sandinista regime. President Reagan’s National Security Council tried to circumvent Congress’ prohibition by getting third-party funds to the Contras from the sale of arms from Israel to Iran. The congressional investigation that followed resulted in the indictment of 14 individuals — all of which were either vacated by courts or pardoned by Reagan with the help of one William P. Barr, now, as then, the attorney general of the United States. The entire reason this was a scandal was that the Reagan administration had contravened the will of Congress, thereby breaking the law. Reagan’s defense was that he had no clue what was happening. But, had he copped to being in on the plan, he might have had at least a colorable “foreign policy” defense. After all, it was the official foreign policy of the United States, with bipartisan agreement, to stop the spread of Communism. And given Nicaragua’s geographical proximity to the U.S., Reagan could have argued that he was justified in overriding Congress’ wishes in order to fulfill his duty to protect the U.S. from an imminent threat. In short, Reagan could have plausibly aligned his actions with both longstanding foreign policy goals and the security interests of the U.S. Calling his actions “foreign policy” won’t change the fact that Trump attempted to secretly subvert Congress’ constitutional authority by coercing a foreign government to investigate a U.S. citizen for his own personal gain. Trump, by contrast, can do neither. Let’s first take his assertion that his goal was to battle “corruption.” It’s not clear where there is a foreign policy interest in Ukraine investigating two U.S. citizens, who are already within the jurisdiction of the United States. This is especially so given that the U.S. criminal code has robust laws to fight corruption — including corruption by U.S. citizens in foreign business dealings — it’s called the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act. Apart from being unnecessary, it’s also diplomatically embarrassing: Outsourcing the investigation and prosecution of U.S. citizens to a foreign country is an admission that our own legal system is unequipped or too weak to deal with it. In fact, the U.S. has typically resisted foreign jurisdiction over U.S. citizens, precisely because we believe in the fairness and reliability of our judicial system. More importantly, Trump’s decision to withhold aid from Ukraine was against the national security interests of the United States. The foreign policy of the United States has been, with bipartisan agreement, to help defend Ukraine against Russian aggression, and, in turn, limiting Russia’s global influence — this was the entire purpose of the aid in the first place. To date, Trump has not articulated a single reason why withholding these funds would have benefited the U.S. — in fact, his donor and own political appointee, Ambassador Gordon Sondland, testified that Trump’s actions were “ill-advised,” echoing the sentiments of the rest of Trump’s career foreign policy team. The aid appropriated for Ukraine, moreover, did not provide Trump with the power to exercise this kind of discretion in withholding it. He was, to put it bluntly, merely the pizza delivery guy — a “covfefe” boy, if you will. Trump’s attempt to put a constitutional gloss on his actions will only highlight the self-serving interests of his attempted transaction. It will also illustrate that he sees Congress’ power of the purse as his personal piggy bank, to be ignored or exploited for his own ends — much in the same way that he did an end-run around Congress’ refusal to finance a wall by declaring a national emergency. Calling his actions “foreign policy” won’t change the fact that Trump attempted to secretly subvert Congress’ constitutional authority by coercing a foreign government to investigate a U.S. citizen for his own personal gain. A high crime by another name is still a crime."

On 23rd June 2016 ‘we’ (52% of those who voted in the referendum) voted to leave the EU. From where I sit, this appears to be when everything started unravelling. Since the results were announced we’ve had one general election, two Prime Minister resignations and a total of three Prime Ministers in office. The latest incumbent, Boris Johnson, has now called yet another general election. Clearly he learned nothing from watching the disastrous election campaign led by Theresa May — in which she not only failed to achieve the landslide victory she was hoping for, she actually managed to lose her majority. Maybe its an early Christmas present for the electorate since he was unable to wrap Brexit up quite as neatly as he’d planned!"
Medium.com,Society,"The ICC is only 21 years old, why is its future already in question?",World,https://medium.com/@vittoriamalgi/the-icc-is-only-21-years-old-why-is-its-future-already-in-question-2e685b8eb7ea?source=topic_page---------54------------------1," In 1998 the Rome Statute was signed and the ICC was born in the light of a new millennium: it was a glorious momentum of hope. 21 years later, the ICC faces new challenges to its legitimacy. New wars arise, migration intensifies, new powers sit at the negotiating table, populists and strongmen become “fashionable”. But the desire for accountability remains. The question is: will the ICC survive? “ We need to preserve the multilateral system from those who want to demolish international cooperation” says to 31mag.nl William Schabas, one of the world’s leading specialists in international human rights law, he has been writing about the ICC since its very creation. “The legitimacy of the ICC is being attacked by those who favour a world in which countries pursue merely their own interests.” says Schabas. According to the professor, international cooperation is threatened by those who want to demolish it for their own interests. But how can it be protected? Addressing the in-house problems of the ICC, while preserving the institution from external threats: in short- reform. Problem: 21 years after the first signature of the Rome Statute, the world’s most powerful countries still refuse to ratify it. Which means that crimes committed on the territory of Russia, China, Israel, and the USA cannot be prosecuted, at all. Kirsten Meersschaert is the director of programs at the Coalition for the International Criminal Court, an umbrella organisation which promotes the role of the ICC, “there is more to say about the number of states in the ICC than those out of it.” She says to 31.mag. that “ 122 countries are in, and this says a lot about the collective desire for accountability.” “Collaboration with international institutions such as the ICC often fluctuates with time and administrations in place”, Meersschaert says. The USA is the most emblematic example: a signatory of the Rome Statute -a Treaty it never ratified- the past American administrations have “positively and proactively collaborated with the Court.” This has obviously changed now, with Donald Trump rejecting and belittling not just the legitimacy of the ICC, but its authority, and its jurisdiction as well. But the International Criminal Court doesn’t only have to be protected by external threats; internal dynamics also contribute to weakening its mission: “there are issues of institutional culture that need to be addressed” within the Court, prof. Schabas says. Several judges are litigating against the Court itself, because their tax-free, six-figure salaries would be too meagre. Meanwhile, the Court is close to spending more on internal litigation then on victims’ reparations. “Judges are often really fractious and go in different directions. It would be great if there was more homogeneity among their legal opinions,” Schabas adds. Another common critique to the ICC is that of only prosecuting “easy targets”: former leaders that have been left behind and outside of those political circles that used to protect them. At the annual Assembly of State Parties of December 2018, the UK lamented how, after two decades and more than €1.5 billion spent, “we only have three core crime convictions “. On the other side, there’s more to it. As Meerschaert tells us, “the prosecutorial strategy is based on the idea that if you prosecute individuals at a mid level, you can gather evidence and build a more solid cases against leaders at a higher level.” Current prosecutions might and should serve as a build up to the investigation of more powerful circles. When and how that will happen is a question that inevitably remains unanswered. As Shabas tells us, the recent decision not to investigate Afghanistan “plays in the hands of those accusing the Court of double standards”. But, the professor does not think that the case is completely closed: he is confident that the prosecutor will appeal the decision or apply again. “I would like to see the ICC taking on more cases that challenge powerful countries,” he says “issues related to the conduct of Israeli authorities in the occupied Palestinian territories; of British soldiers in Iraq; of the Russian forces in Ukraine and in Georgia; and the torture charges against American officials in Afghanistan.” “I think that taking on hard cases such as this, is crucial to the Court becoming a meaningful and dynamic institution,” he concluded. The world is changing, and the ICC has to change with it. There is a great sense of urgency for internal reforms and a need for more effective international cooperation. Meanwhile, the conviction of Bosco Ntaganda to the maximum sentence of 30 years in prison can be considered (only) a partial victory of justice.

Medium.com,Society,"The Amazon is on fire, and European politicians want it to burn even more",World,https://medium.com/klub-jagiello%C5%84ski-the-polish-angle-on-politics/the-amazon-is-on-fire-and-european-politicians-want-it-to-burn-even-more-66cd2e563a63?source=topic_page---------55------------------1," The media reports from recent weeks might suggest that forest burning started in Brazil this year. The truth, however, is that one of the world’s most valuable biological regions has been burning for decades. There are many reasons for this, and of course, their common feature is the desire for profit. Amazonia is also on fire because European politicians, regardless of the consequences, had negotiated a trade agreement with South American countries. The new free trade agreement between the European Union and the Mercosur will make sure that the forests will keep burning for many years to come. by Adam Traczyk The image of Amazon’s gradual destruction, giving way to new arable fields, pastures, mines and oil fields, is a permanent part of our reality. Over the past 50 years, the arboreous areas of the Brazilian part of the forest have shrunk by one-fifth, and more figuratively — by an area two and a half times larger than Polish territory. The record-breaking and extremely dry year 2004 saw the loss of forests areas as large as Haiti or a large Polish province — 28 thousand km 2. Later on, deforestation was hampered significantly, but this year, for the first time in a decade, we are likely to lose more than 10,000 km 2of the Amazon again. To convince those who do not rely on statistics about the destruction of the forest, politicians and celebrities alike have filled their social media accounts with images of the burning Amazon. Emmanuel Macron and Leonardo DiCaprio published their alarming Twitter entries, with a picture taken by a photographer who had died in 2003. As the New York Times reported, Madonna, in turn, chose a photograph from 1989 and published it on her Instagram profile. Not only nature but also people fell victim of brutally tearing ever larger tracts of land by latifundists and big business representatives. The topic has also been raised in popular culture many times over. In 2013, a book by Artur Domosławski under the meaningful title Death in the Amazon was published on the Polish market, telling the tale of the heroic and tragic fight of nature defenders and the region’s inhabitants. Probably the most famous forest defender, Chico Mendes, murdered by latifundists in 1988, was honoured in a film, later awarded with three Golden Globes. Mendes was also made known thanks to the song recorded by the world-famous (due to collaboration with Carlos Santana) Mexican band Maná. Although this year’s Amazon fires are nothing special compared to the last half-century, it is not surprising that media images showing plumes of black smoke enveloping Sao Paulo have moved the public opinion deeply. Since the issue is being widely commented by society, politicians will not remain silent for long, even if speaking out would expose their hypocrisy. Words of outrage roll over Europe Carried by a wave of social outrage, European decision-makers began to publicly threaten to withdraw the European Union from the free trade agreement with the Mercosur, and thus with the economic bloc focusing Argentina, Uruguay and Paraguay in addition to Brazil. The agreement on this issue was only announced a few weeks ago at the G-20 summit in Osaka, following 20 years of negotiations. Regardless, a few days ago Irish Prime Minister Leo Varadkar announced that if Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro does not refrain from burning the Amazon deliberately, then the Irish government would block the agreement’s entry into force. Emmanuel Macron and Donald Tusk, among others, spoke in a similar tone. Angela Merkel, although she did not question the contract, stated that „our house is on fire and we cannot remain silent”. The criticism of the Brazilian government is facilitated by the fact that the President of Brazil Jair Bolsonaro is simply the perfect bad guy. The „Amazon Trump” cares little for environmental protection and climate change. He called the government agency data regarding the rapid increase in the pace of deforestation a lie, and had its head fired. He accused environmental organizations of setting fire to the forests, allegedly trying to discredit him. He urged foreign politicians not to stick their noses in the matter, because he said that Amazon belongs solely to Brazil. The Amazon forests in Brazil under Bolsonaro’s rule are to be replaced with arable fields, pastures and rare metal mines. Although the great latifundists have always had a strong grip of Brazilian authorities, now, thanks to Bolsonaro and his ministers of environment and agriculture — Ricardo Salles and Tereza Cristina — they are making decisions on their own, virtually without unnecessary intermediaries. Therefore, even if pressure from international public opinion resulted in the president sending the army to put out fires, it is doubtful that he wanted to solve the problem. Of course, European politicians know that the exploitation of the Amazon did not start with the Brazilian president’s coming to power and this year’s fires. Bolsonaro, on the other hand, is well aware of the fact that despite all criticism, European politicians are essentially his allies. Now they are wringing their hands about the destructive way of exploiting the Amazon rainforest and the catastrophic consequences for the climate, but the trade agreement they had negotiated between the EU and the Mercosur is based on the logic that leads to the destruction of the natural environment and drives forest burning. When the negotiations were finalized, however, there were no voices of concern for endangered nature. The President of the European Commission, Jean-Claude Juncker, even wrote about „positive effects for the environment and the consumers.” Meanwhile, the pillar of the new agreement involves liberalizing trade in agricultural products, whose industrial production is the main reason for deforestation. Already today, the lion’s share of goods exported from the Mercosur to the EU, worth over EUR 40 billion, is food, beverages and tobacco (20.5%), soy and coffee (16.3%), as well as meat and animal products (6.1%). In Brazil alone, soybean fields cover an area equal to Germany. Almost a third of all the world’s cattle — short of 300 million — are bred in Brazil and Argentina. The Brazilian government is counting on the „historic deal” (both Juncker and Bolsonaro have used this term) tripling the Brazilian economy’s exports to the European Union over the next 15 years. This cannot be done without — to use equally professional as euphemistic jargon — intensifying the economic exploitation of the rainforest. In practice, this means further burning and grubbing up the Amazon. False care Of course, the EU-Mercosur deal will include a section on sustainable development and environmental protection. However, unlike the lifting of trade barriers, these will not be binding. Despite the words of concern, European politicians are working hand in hand with local industrialists, rubbing their hands at the news of opening South American markets to European cars, machinery and chemical products. Likewise, Bolsonaro and the great landowners in Brazil are honing in on new, preferential beef export prices. The capitalist logic of a free market is once again triumphing over environmental protection and the fight against climate change. This will not be changed by more or less symbolic gestures, such as Norway and Germany suspending funds for the Amazon Fund, used for financing forest protection projects. So far, around one billion euros have been raised under the mechanism established in 2008. For comparison: the annual value of Brazil’s exports to the European Union alone is EUR 32 billion. If we want to save the planet’s green lungs, we need much more radical solutions than loose provisions on environmental protection in liberal trade agreements or modest (comparing to the size of the global economy) funds dedicated to ecological projects. The destruction of the Amazon is a threat to the whole world. To counteract it effectively, we must realize that forest fires are not a temporary crisis or accident at work, but much like oil spills into the oceans or mountains of toxic waste, they are part and parcel of the economic system we have created. To fix this, we need global solutions that go beyond calculating big business profits and political mock-action in times of crisis. What would this approach look like? In 2007, the then leftist president of Ecuador, Rafael Correa, announced the Yasuni-ITT initiative at the UN General Assembly. Its purpose was Ecuador’s withdrawal from oil extraction in the Yasuni National Park, which is part of the Amazon rainforest. It is estimated that the deposits there constitute about 20% of Ecuador’s reserves of this raw material. Correa wished for other countries to compensate Ecuador for the cost or refraining from oil extraction in the amount of half of its estimated profits, for the sake of protecting biodiversity and the climate. The idea was supported by the then UN Secretary-General, Ban Ki-Moon, as well as celebrities involved in climate protection, such as Leonardo DiCaprio. In the end, however, instead of $3.5 billion, only a dozen or so million were raised, along with declarations for another two hundred. The international community has concluded that saving the green lungs of the world is too expensive to be expressed in dollars, instead of words and gestures. Finally, in August 2013, Correa announced the project cancelled and the commencement of drilling, justifying his decision, e.g. saying that he would not let at least one Ecuadorian suffer in the name of protecting trees. This argument is often raised in Brazil as well. While expecting social pressure to force politicians to take decisive steps, we can also reach for individual forms of resistance. Paradoxically, Bolsonaro himself had suggested such a solution. When a journalist asked him if it was possible to reconcile driving the economic prosperity, fighting against world hunger and climate protection, he replied: „Just eat less.” Although the President intended to mock, he is quite right. We can limit our meat consumption by changing our eating habits, or by introducing legal regulations that would adjust its prices. All it takes is to take into account the actual climatic and environmental costs of production. Half of the Brazilian cattle nowadays are bred in areas that have previously been covered with tropical forests. Polish version is available here.

Videos are swarming all over twitter of spray canisters, rubber bullets being fired as protestors and mothers being separated from their children. For some reason, a wave of frustrated anger engulfed me. Once again, in an almost sadistic cycle of violence in this country, we are seeing vulnerable people being mistreated and disregarded by structures meant to protect them. This incident is one amongst the several that have taken place in 2019 alone, as there has been an overall increase in xenophobic attacks in South Africa this year. By no means is xenophobia a uniquely South African phenomenon. This is the reality we live in where complex social and economic issues are being compartmentalised into who deserves access and who does not, who belongs and who does not, who is a foreigner and who is not. But there is unarguably a high level of denialism by the South African government and a large part of the South African public, who refuse to acknowledge how hateful sentiments targeted towards specific groups of African immigrants have direct consequences on the livelihoods of their fellow brothers and sisters on the continent. Political statements made by leaders creates binaries of “good” and “bad” citizens, and stirs up tensions as a means to not only garner support, but enable structural violence to continue unchecked. Equating xenophobic rhetoric to dealing with issues of criminality is symptomatic of how South Africa has failed to redress not only how they treat others, but the structural legacy of policies that ‘othered’ their own not too long ago. The democratic transition after 1994 saw expansive promises to improve the lives of South Africans and that the country belongs to all those who live in it; but instead of critiquing the failure of policy implementation, blame is shifted onto a specific group for social and economic woes. Former Johannesburg Mayor Herman Mashaba has stated just over a month ago that it was “not necessary for South Africa to apologize for xenophobic attacks”, under the argument that criminality and lawlessness must be dealt with. What Former Mayor Mashaba and others fail to realise is that framing narratives around poor criminal justice frameworks and equating lawlessness to migrants enables an environment for vigilante justice. Furthermore, it erases the reality and nuances of South Africa’s socio-economic landscape. In 2018, a study conducted by the World Bank found empirical evidence that immigrants contribute positively to the labour market through diverse skill sets and having complementary jobs than competing ones. With the clear onset to prioritize the Fourth Industrial Revolution as a route for development, South Africa needs to acknowledge that issues of migration are not only a security issue, but a pressing developmental issue that must on different levels incorporate all those that contribute. By failing to see the humanity in the ‘other’, we set the precedent for low levels of social cohesion, create harmful narratives, and fail to recognise the reality of globalisation. But we know what the responses will be; a flimsy letter of acknowledgement will be issued by the South African government, or in this case a justification for “illegal” immigrants to be rightly dealt with. Task teams will be mandated, meetings will be had, and frustrated academics like myself and so many other stakeholders will be having conversations in echo chambers, with no real effective attempt from those that can make changes to redirect the narratives around African migrants in South Africa. From a personal perspective, it is deeply saddening to know that a place that I have called my home for the past 10 years fails to make me feel like I belong. Like myself and so many other African migrants that come to South Africa, it is a paradox to feel unwelcome in a country that has embedded ideologies of pan-africanism and decolonisation in its social fabric. Critical self-reflection needs to be done amongst South Africans to understand why there is a pervasive need to create physical and psychological boundaries between them and those that are not South African. Although it is true that everyone is a foreigner somewhere, let us reframe the discourse so that no one needs to be a foreigner anywhere. That way, a more inclusive and cooperative South Africa can be a space for their brothers and sisters to no longer be ostracized.

Medium.com,Society,Museums of the mind,World,https://medium.com/adinkra/museums-of-the-mind-f4bd6940716c?source=topic_page---------57------------------1," By Anna Luisa Daigneault In commemoration of the United Nations’ Year of Indigenous Languages (IYIL 2019) Mrs. Dora Manchado, the last speaker of Tehuelche, passed away on January 4th, 2019, at the age of 86. She was well known in her native community in Patagonia, and beloved by many. Linguistic anthropologist Javier Domingo worked with Mrs. Manchado during the last few years of her life, recording her speech and also becoming a close friend. Upon her passing, he noted, “Dora Manchado was regarded as the ‘last speaker’ of Tehuelche as well as the spirit of the Tehuelche ethnic recognition and revival. She knew perfectly well that language is not only about interaction, but also about trust, complicity […] and sharing with others. Thanks to the recordings she made, the rest of the community members now have, if they want, the possibility of affirming their past and reconstructing their identity.” Known locally as aonekko ‘a’ien, the future of the Tehuelche is now in the hands of several dozen community activists in Patagonia who seek to keep the language alive through local meet-ups, learning groups and immersive cultural activities. But without any remaining fluent speakers, the future of Tehuelche remains uncertain. Languages are a living manifestation of humanity’s long history on this planet.Reaching across time like a tapestry weaving generations together, languages transmit centuries of accumulated wisdom related to human adaptation and survival. They contain vital information related to land management, subsistence patterns, kinship and social relationships, local customs, cosmology and much more. Every language represents a unique way of interpreting and conveying the human experience in a specific cultural and environmental context. Languages are ever-evolving-they are shared museums of the mind. Nor are they static; they adapt and change over time, depending on the speakers’ expressive needs and social context. Each human language has its own rules, its own sound patterns and its own ways of structuring information for ease of communication and comprehension. A language is not only a lens through which one perceives the world, but a vehicle one actively uses to navigate it. A language is a doorway that accesses the human imagination. Sayings, poetry, song lyrics — all are possible because of the expressive power of language. Proverbs, idioms and jokes reveal the subtle nuances of a culture through rhythm, rhyme and punchline. A language’s creative potential goes beyond the lifespan of a single individual. It is the sound of a collective soul that lives and dies within each speaker. When a language is transmitted to a subsequent generation of speakers, its soul keeps on living. When a language ceases to be spoken and transmitted, its essence effectively fades away. Without systematic documentation, there is little evidence left that the language even existed at all. There are over 3,000 threatened languages in the world, many of which may disappear by 2100, or sooner. While it is natural for languages to come and go over time, we are currently living through a period of steep decline in linguistic diversity. Recent studies indicate that one language goes extinct every 3.5 months, which means that several times every year, the last speaker of a language passes away, and there are no new speakers to take their place. Once a language is gone, it is very difficult to bring it back, although it’s not impossible. Language reconstruction and revival can be accomplished through access to legacy materials and recorded resources. Why do languages die? Language shift and language death are complex processes that play out differently depending on the history, geography and socioeconomics of a place. For each language and its dialects, the story is a bit different, but many of the overarching factors are similar. Language endangerment is related to the loss of ancestral identity, resulting from the long-term impacts of colonization, systematic oppression and cultural assimilation by dominant groups. Language survival is therefore also about cultural survival and transmission from one generation to the next. But it can be difficult to overcome the heavy toll of subjugation by colonial forces, dispossession of traditional lands and lifeways and other factors such as infectious diseases and warfare. Also contributing to the erosion of languages over time are the ripple effects of racist and discriminatory policies that seek to stamp out cultural and linguistic diversity in favor of a unified national identity under one or few languages. We live in a crucial time for language preservation. With sustained grassroots efforts, public support and funding for language training and immersion programs, visibility in the media, and status recognition by local and federal governments, endangered languages may have a chance of reversing their decline and stabilizing. Sustaining endangered languages involves transforming the ways speakers of these languages are perceived in their own communities, how the languages are portrayed in the local and national media, and how the matter is treated by governments. Languages are a fundamental right and are the cornerstone of humanity’s diverse cultural identity. Speaking a dominant language does not mean that communities have to give up the right to maintain and promote their ancestral language. But for some languages whose last fluent speakers have passed on, adequate documentation is key for revitalization. In the case of the Tehuelche language, Mrs. Manchado’s recordings now provide a window into the past, but also lay a framework for the future revival of the Tehuelche language among her people. On one of the last nights that anthropologist Javier Domingo spent working with her, Mrs. Manchado said, “Aio t nash ‘a’ieshm ten kot ‘awkko “ — maybe tomorrow someone will speak in Tehuelche."
Medium.com,Society,"Are the Chinese Film Industry Censors Only About Controlling China, or Hollywood too?",World,https://medium.com/@loftusjoy/are-the-chinese-film-industry-censors-only-about-controlling-china-or-hollywood-too-585b3d11f8e4?source=topic_page---------58------------------1," People fled to see Todd Phillips’s Joker, which was released on October 4, to better understand the Batman supervillain apart from his other numerous appearances, including Jack Nicholson’s version in Batman and Heath Ledger’s portrayal in The Dark Knight. People were expecting this origin story to have all or at least some of the answers- a diagnostic of sorts explaining why he is the way he is. After having been dazzled by the surprising ’70s inspired theatrical mise en scene but then steadily disenchanted by the lack of a coherent and interesting storyline, I turned to a piece by the wonderful Forbes Hollywood & Entertainment writer, Scott Mendelson, to check-in on the film’s box-office results. And what I came to discover intrigued me more than any retrospective musing I devoted to the cause of Joker. Regardless of the very mixed critical reception, people around the globe are fascinated by the concept of a movie dedicating its full attention to the king of cinematic anarchy. The tally of Joker worldwide earnings has now surpassed $930 million- Mendelson was right on Sunday when he predicted that the film would probably top $ 1billion at the worldwide box office. This number competes with the likes of The Dark Knight Rises, Aquaman, and Harry Potter and The Deathly Hallows Part II. But there is a crucial difference between the global box-office success of Joker and these other phenomenons. With the release of Joker, China, the most important market in Hollywood overseas box office revenue, was left out. Hollywood has become increasingly independent of China for revenue. The new unspoken rule for breaching the Chinese market has become: take any necessary precautions to gain access. If parts of a script or a scene are too controversial to pass the censorship committee, edit it or cut it. It is not news that The People’s Republic of China has censored any and all content entering into the country and rejects all content seen to threaten its morals or hold on power; Cutting out movie scenes which do not adhere to party guidelines is a common occurrence. In fact, according to a statistic released last month on Business Insider, under an official quota, China can publicly screen 34 foreign films a year. In general, the movies come from countries with the largest film industries such as the US, the UK, South Korea, and India. Out of this annual quota, the US contributes approximately 85%-90% of these imported films. There are some Hollywood directors that will submit to the censor demands of the Chinese government, and then there is Quentin Tarantino. His film, “Once Upon a Time in Hollywood,” which largely pleased the critics, was originally supposed to be released in China on October 25 but was removed when he refused to re-cut the movie to fit into the mold of the government standards. The moral of the story: As Hollywood becomes more and more dependent on China’s market, and you are a director who does not have both Tarantino’s clout- his critical and commercial success as well as his cultish fan base- chances are you will have to adjust your artistic economy to fit the demands of Ji Xinping. But now back to the question of Joker. It has already set the record as the first R-rated film topping the $1 billion mark at the box office, so why not include China, and set the bar even higher? The message of “quasi-fascist groupthink” in the film, as A. O. Scott of the New York Times calls it, and the potential the movie implicates to inspire acts of real-life violence, are elements in themselves highly sensitive to the Chinese censor. But think harder and you may recall the ongoing protests in Hong Kong right now- the protests which strikingly resemble those entertained at the end of Joker. It becomes all too obvious why Joker was excluded from the Chinese market. According to BBC, the Chinese government has now banned protesters wearing face masks, but the protestors have defied this ruling. Similarly, in Joker, after Arthur Fleck, dressed in his clown garb, shoots the late-night comedian on air, the audience observes riots of people (who have somehow acquired clown masks within a matter of minutes) generate a violent protest in Gotham city. I’m left to wonder if the Hong Kong protests began in April, why China do you need to shield your people from an imagined version of the same sort of political resistance that has already been precipitating in your country for over six months? What difference does it make? Is it only about shielding mainland China from considering the events that are happening in the next state over, or are there other agendas at play? What concerns me most are the U.S. China co-productions- the movies the U.S. makes mainly to move around the Chinese film industry’s quota system and politically sensitive market. Most of the time the projects implode due to disagreements over either the script or the final cut of the movie. Hollywood does have the ultimate leverage over the cinema of China: technical expertise. However, as the Chinese market becomes a bigger player in regards to the scope of global Hollywood cinematic success, it becomes increasingly possible that Hollywood will make unfortunate filmmaking sacrifices in order to appeal to the Chinese film industry. The last thing I want to see happen in Hollywood is the trade of technical skills and bad movies for money."

Medium.com,Society,Are Iraq and Lebanon’s Protests the Result of a US-Iran Proxy War?,World,https://medium.com/citizen-truth/are-iraq-and-lebanons-protests-the-result-of-a-us-iran-proxy-war-536faee11cf1?source=topic_page---------60------------------1," Recent protests in Iraq and Lebanon, triggered by economic crises and poor living conditions, forced both Lebanese Prime Minister Saad al-Hariri and Iraqi Prime Adil Abdul Mahdi to step down. But the situation in Lebanon and Iraq has also fueled Iranian suspicion that the U.S, Israel and Saudi Arabia are to blame for instigating the unrest, raising concern that Beirut and Baghdad may be caught in a U.S.-Iran proxy war. The demonstrations in Lebanon and Iraq erupted in early October. In Lebanon, a struggling economy compelled the government to impose new taxes on tobacco, petrol and the communication application Whatsapp, angering the Lebanese people and ultimately sparking the protests. The Hariri administration eventually rolled back the proposed tax, but the concession did not defuse the tensions. Poor public services, wealth inequality and rampant corruption triggered Iraq’s anti-government rallies. Protests in Iraq have also turned violent than Lebanon’s protests. Transparency International , which works to combat corruption worldwide , ranks Iraq 12th on the list of the world’s most corrupt nations. More than 100 protesters were killed and thousands more injured in the first five days of rallies alone when Iraqi security forces opened fire on protesters. Recent demonstrations in Lebanon and Iraq turned into anti-Iran rallies, as protesters expressed anger at Iran for backing their respective governments. In late October, Reuters reported that Iran stepped in to block the dismissal of Iraqi Prime Minister Abdul Mahdi in the face of a call by popular Iraqi Shiite cleric Moqtada al-Sadr for a snap election. Sadr reportedly had asked Abdul Mahdi’s main rival, Al Amiri, to force out Abdul Mahdi until Iran stepped in to pressure al-Amiri’s Iranian supported alliance of militias to do otherwise. Abdul Mahdi ultimately agreed to resign as a successor is named. In Lebanon, Iranian-supported Hezbollah is the country’s most influential political party and is part of a political block that won control of Lebanon’s government in 2018. Hezbollah and therefore, Iran, would have much to lose in an overthrowal of Lebanon’s government. Protesters have criticized Hezbollah for not doing enough to stop corruption. Hezbollah has responded by trying to quell the protests while not losing its popular support. However, Iran claims the U.S and its allies are behind the turmoil in Iraq and Lebanon and accuses the U.S. of co-opting the peaceful protests, steering them towards violence and anti-Iran sentiment. The Arabic-language Lebanese newspaper Al Akhbar reported in October that sources close to the Iraqi prime minister told them Israel’s intelligence agency, Mossad, and the U.S embassy turned the peaceful demonstrations into chaos. “Based on the precise security intelligence collected in the past few days, the Israeli intelligence service along with agents hired by the US embassy in Baghdad used the popular protests in Iraq and led the peaceful rallies towards chaos and sabotage acts,” the unidentified sources told Al Akhbar. Meanwhile, a social media analysis by the Iranian Fars News Agency in early October reported that the majority of Twitter hashtags related to the anti-government rallies in Iraq originated inside of Saudi Arabia. They reported 79% originated from Saudi Arabia and only 6% from Iraq while another 1% came from the U.S. Additionally, just a few months before protests rocked Lebanon, Lebanese President Michel Aoun, while visiting U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, reportedly received a secret document detailing a U.S.’ and Israeli plan to foment unrest and civil war in Lebanon. Lebanese TV station Al-Jadeed aired photos of the document which was later translated by Geopolitics Alert . The legitimacy of the document and who handed the papers to Aoun is unknown. According to Geopolitics Alert’s translation of the document, the U.S and Israel were planning to destabilize Lebanon and spark a civil war that would “help Israel on the international scene.” The document also acknowledged Israel would plant false flags in Lebanon and detailed U.S.’ plans to splinter the Lebanese Internal Security Forces, a domestic institution separate from the Lebanese Army. “The plans involve Washington investing 200 million dollars into the Internal Security Forces (ISF) under the guise of keeping the peace but with the covert goal of creating sectarian conflict against Hezbollah with 2.5 million specifically dedicated to this purpose,” wrote Geopolitics Alert. Lastly, during a meeting with Lebanese officials in March, U.S Secretary of State Mike Pompeo pressed Beirut to depose of Hezbollah from the government and gave an ominous warning. “The US will continue to use all peaceful means, everything at our disposal to choke off the financing, the smuggling, the criminal network and the misuse of government positions and influence,” Pompeo warned last March in a joint news conference with Lebanese Foreign Minister Gebran Bassil. The United States is no stranger to proxy wars and attempts to instill regime change. According to the Washington Post, the United States government has attempted to change another country’s government at least 72 times. After 9/11, the U.S. may have turned its regime change and meddling tendencies on the Middle East. In 2007, U.S. General Wesley Clark, the former NATO Supreme Allied Commander during the Kosovo War, Clark infamously listed off a number of countries that were planned targets of the Pentagon during an interview with Amy Goodman of Democracy Now. Among them were Iraq and Lebanon. In a description of a conversation Clark had with a Pentagon official shortly after 9/11, Clark tells Goodman: “So I came back to see him a few weeks later, and by that time we were bombing in Afghanistan. I said, ‘Are we still going to war with Iraq?’ And he said, ‘Oh, it’s worse than that.’ He reached over on his desk. He picked up a piece of paper. And he said, ‘I just got this down from upstairs’ — meaning the secretary of defense’s office — ‘today.’ And he said, ‘This is a memo that describes how we’re going to take out seven countries in five years, starting with Iraq, and then Syria, Lebanon, Libya, Somalia, Sudan and, finishing off, Iran.’ I said, ‘Is it classified?’ He said, ‘Yes, sir.’ I said, ‘Well, don’t show it to me.’ And I saw him a year or so ago, and I said, ‘You remember that?’ He said, ‘Sir, I didn’t show you that memo! I didn’t show it to you!’ Shiite political groups took political control of Iraq after Washington-backed forces removed Saddam Hussein from power in 2003. Shia-dominant Tehran has supported Shiite militia groups and political parties in the oil-rich country, including Hashd al-Shaabi, a Shiite-dominated paramilitary institution. But things look troubling for Iran in Iraq and Lebanon as protests rock the country. Even prior to the protests, signs of Iran’s waning influence in Iraq became apparent after a 2018 survey by the research group Alustakilla. The study showed that the percentage of Iraqi Shiites supporting Iran dropped sharply from 88% in 2015 to 47% in 2018. With anti-Iran chants on Lebanon and Iraqi streets and Iraqi citizens attacking the Iran consulate in recent days and Iran battling U.S. economic sanctions and the falling apart of the Iran Nuclear Deal, Iran may very well be in a fight to maintain its sphere of influence."
Medium.com,Society,Cartel Killing Continues: Mormon Families Murdered In Mexico,World,https://medium.com/navigating-life/cartel-killing-continues-mormon-families-murdered-in-mexico-32e0965e2452?source=topic_page---------61------------------1," There’s more news from the ongoing Mexican Drug War. This time three women and six children (including two infants) were tragically killed in northern Mexico on November 5, 2019. All of the victims were dual citizens of the U.S. and Mexico and members of a longstanding Mormon community in Sonora, Mexico. And this comes on the heels of the disastrous incident less than 3 weeks ago, where narcos forced the government to surrender to them after a brazen attack on the city of Culiacan. Since the 19th century in fact. After the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS Church) outlawed polygamy due to U.S. laws, many Mormons that felt polygamy was an important part of their faith decided to move to Mexico. They went there to escape religious persecution and to practice their religion in isolation. At that time, the borders between Mexico and the United States were porous and in flux. Mormon leader Brigham Young chose to settle the church in Utah in part because the territory at the time was part of Mexico and had little oversight from the government. In 1848, Mexico ceded this territory to the United States; Utah became a state in 1896. Generations later, U.S.-Mexico border towns remain home to communities of fundamentalist Mormons. Many Mormons living in Mexico speak both English and Spanish and hold dual citizenship. - Miriam Berger, Washington Post So there have been communities of American Mormons living in Mexico for generations. They were traveling in three vehicles, driving in a caravan for safety. Each mother was driving a vehicle when all of a sudden they started receiving gunfire. They were ambushed by a storm of bullets. The seven-month-old baby Faith Marie Johnson survived hours without food and water in a bullet-ridden SUV in northern Mexico until her family members arrived. She had miraculously escaped the bullets flying around her. Her mother was among the three women and six children killed on Monday when gunmen ambushed their cars after they left a nearby Mormon community. Five other children survived being shot in the back, jaw, leg, wrist and chest. - Ioan Grillo, The New York Times The surviving children were able to escape by hiding in the bushes while one of them went to look for help, and eventually, they were found by search parties. A relative of one of the mothers who was killed in the attack gave an interview to Anderson Cooper on CNN. She’s also a U.S.-Mexico dual citizen living in Sonora, Mexico and she said she believes the cause of the attack is due to war between the Chihuahua and Sonora cartels. Cartels often fight over territory for the most lucrative drug smuggling routes. She stated the cartels and their sicarios(hitmen) are everywhere and keep an eye on who goes in and goes out of different areas they control. The Mexican people are oppressed. They’re being abused by these cartels, living in fear for their lives. We can’t drive public roads safely, we’re being threatened that we can’t even take some public roads or else we’ll have bad things happen to us. - Kendra Lee Miller, sister in law of one of the victims Unlike a lot of cartel violence in Mexico, this attack has been heavily publicized because these were U.S. citizens that were killed. Trump even tweeted about the attack and wants Mexican President Lopez Obrador to invite the United States to help them fight the cartels. However, a true discussion about American involvement in the Mexican Drug War has got to include not only American drug consumption and drug policy, but also the weapons that the cartels are smuggling into Mexico from the United States. With Mexico’s yearly murder rate rising to historic levels, the situation in Mexico continues to escalate. Women and children are being slaughtered with no justice being served, and the cartels are killing with impunity. Do you think the US government should get involved with fighting the cartels in Mexico? Please share your thoughts by commenting below."

oldiers marching in steady unison, the only sound ringing throughout the city was the dramatic thundering of their boots. Like a pendulum, the sound rang out with a rhythmic beat. The soldiers kept their faces held up high with a fair and stoic complexion. In the distance, one could hear the hum of tanks and trucks.

At Tiananmen Square, the country’s newest technologies were on show, first to be seen by the world. From modern autonomous drones to missiles to intercontinental ballistic missiles, able to deliver nuclear payloads around the world, the country’s next-generation weapons are on proud display, showing the might of new China under Xi Jinping. The parade was a real manifestation of the China Dream, representing China’s new power in technology, with many of the new weapons domestically developed. It signaled that China would no longer be allowed to be bullied by other nations. “On the bank of the Yellow River, gather the fine sons of the Chinese people; To liberate mankind, to defend our motherland, we’ll carry out our duty… Like the Yellow River, surging and sweeping forward, drive the Japanese invaders out of our land!” The chorus boomed as the parade marched through Tiananmen Square, the same place where 70 years ago, Mao Zedong declared the founding of the People’s Republic after having driven out the Japanese. The sun was blinding in the blue sky, yet the soldiers remained unblinking. They saluted in perfect unison, with their white-gloved one hand raising to their helmet and the other hand firmly gripping their weapons. As the military band continued to blow into their horns and sing, the audience gawked in awe at the country’s newfound military might, collectively taking a breath as the Chinese flag was flung out and slowly raised by the flag-bearer on the flagpole. Everyone began to sing. “Arise, ye who refuse to be slaves; With our very flesh and blood Let us build our new Great Wall!… Brave the enemy’s gunfire march on! March on! March on! March on, on!” Time was suspended at the final loud sound of the gong of the last beat of the anthem. The pomp and drama of the moment only amplified the tension as President Xi Jinping took to the podium on Tiananmen Gate, addressing the audience. This place was where Mao once stood, declaring the founding of the People’s Republic. Seventy years later, China is celebrating its 70th anniversary of the victory over Japan during World War II. Present were over thirty heads of state and leaders of government, such as the likes of Russian President Vladimir Putin, South Korean President Park Geun-Hye, and South African President Jacob Zuma, and many more (https://america.cgtn.com/2015/08/25/china-releases-list-of-world-leaders-attending-v-day-parade).

Before this grand parade, roads were shut down, public transportation was closed, hospitals restricted their activities, the stock markets closed, and parts of the city center were even placed under martial law by the government. Macaques and falcons were sent out to remove birds and birds nests to stymie the possibility of a bird collision with a plane (http://en.people.cn/n/2015/0901/c90000-8944059.html). Domestic satellite televisions stopped airing entertainment programs, and China Central Television only broadcasted programs and films about the Second World War. To reduce air pollution and ensure blue skies for the parade, half of Beijing’s cars were barred from the streets and nearly 10,000 industrial factories in Beijing and areas near and far (Hebei, Tianjin, Shanxi, Inner Mongolia, Shandong, and Henan) suspended or cut production to cut down on emissions.

This parade was the quintessential indicator of China’s rising nationalism. After taking power in 2013, President Xi Jinping has solidified himself as the country’s de-facto ruler, espousing his trademark “China Dream.” The China Dream is a dream of a Chinese renaissance, stressing economic, political, and cultural renewal, founded upon the Party-state’s rhetoric surrounding its founding legend of the Century of Humiliation and the unification of the country under the Communist banner at the end of the Second World War. In the field of economics, China has undergone a number of reforms since the Reform and Opening Up period of the 1970s and 1980s, spearheaded by Deng Xiaoping. The open endorsement of capitalism by policies would have been an unthinkable act before the time of Deng. In the 21st century, the ideology of the CCP has fundamentally changed, lowering the constraints on government policies and rhetoric. The government now has greater freedom in promoting progressive private-sector policies, causing an explosion in economic growth.

Today, there is also a resurgence in interest over Confucianism not only as a way to counter Western criticisms of the country’s political system but also as a source of pride in China’s ancient culture and the longevity of its philosophy. The China Dream is genius in its ambiguity. Though the conventional Western interpretation of the China Dream is a returning of China to the center of the world as the Middle Kingdom (translation from Chinese 中国), it also indicates a new age in China where individuals are now allowed to dream again after Mao’s dark era with a return of traditional Chinese values immortalized through the work of Zhuangzi (i.e., The Butterfly Dream Parable) and Confucius (The Meaning of Xi Jinping’s Chinese Dream, Winberg Chai & May-lee Chai). However, the central theme of national rejuvenation remains, and continues to stay consistent with the trend of Chinese’s increasing interest in bringing back Chinese imperial culture, so much of which was lost and buried during the tumultuous period of the Century of Humiliation. N
ation,” as defined by the Oxford dictionary, is “a large body of people united by common descent, history, culture, or language, inhabiting a particular country or territory. Consequently, the definition of “nationalism” is the belief that one’s nation is more significant than another’s. One can consider modern Chinese nationalism to be the perversion of patriotism — the devotion to one’s country and culture, politics none-withstanding. The Party has ramped up its rhetoric of national rejuvenation and the China Dream. From the perspective of Chinese nationalists now, criticisms of the Chinese Community Party by outsiders become criticisms of China itself, five thousand years of history and all. Even intellectuals who are wholly Chinese and patriotic are afraid of public retribution from their peers by speaking out. Instead of offering legitimate thoughts and analyses on the country’s future, these intellectuals self-censor in the fear of public backlash in a trial by the populus. If ethnic Chinese face backlash from their peers, what is the response to foreign criticism? Within the U.S.-China bilateral relationship, international media coverage has lost credibility in the eyes of Chinese nationalists. These nationalists are very much supportive of the China Dream, fighting against so-called foreign forces, fixating on territorial disputes and historical conflicts with other countries. Indeed, Chinese nationalism can be exhibited by a belief of superiority in not only the political system but also “descent, history, culture, or language.” Hence, it has engulfed the meaning of Chinese patriotism. The Chinese Communist Party, through its campaign of propaganda and nationalistic education, have long since changed the discussion around what it means to love one’s country. Due to the exaltation of the China Dream, anti-nationalism has become anti-government; and, anti-government is now also anti-patriotism. Necessarily, for one to love China and its history, one must also like the party as the two have become inseparable.

The belief in Chinese cultural and historical exceptionalism will become a significant issue in U.S.-China relations. How will the two countries manage this critical bilateral relationship without invoking the pains, and subsequent nationalism, of the past? Criticism of China should not be conflated with a wholesale attack on other aspects of the country.

Thanx.,World,https://humanparts.medium.com/can-we-please-stop-using-latinx-thanx-423ac92a87dc?source=topic_page---------64------------------1," recently came across a video about the Chicano Moratorium March of August 29, 1970. In case you’ve never heard of it, the march was a watershed moment in the Chicano Movement, in which the Los Angeles Police met a peaceful Chicana-Chicano-led protest against the Vietnam War with extreme violence. The ensuing police riot claimed three lives, most notably that of Journalist Ruben Salazar. It remains an important chapter in Chicana-Chicano history. Yet the video claims the Chicano Moratorium “sparked a movement in defense of Latinx lives.” Wait... what? I have to admit, this bizarre rewriting of Chicana-Chicano history caught me by surprise. While it may be in vogue to adopt trendy terms like “Latinx” in an attempt to be more inclusive, this video in effect erases a part of history that many consider very important. I am not alone in feeling this way. The participants in the Chicano Moratorium most certainly did not identify as “Latinx” or “Chicanx,” and no amount of historical revisionism is going to change that. After watching the video, I had many questions. Why did its producers feel entitled to effectively erase an identity that so many fought to gain respect for? Why did they feel the need to retroactively assign an identity to people who had never adopted it? But mainly, I wondered why the promoters of the term “Latinx” felt the need to cling to such a Eurocentric/anti-indigenous identity in the first place."
Medium.com,Society,Gandhi’s Unfinished Business — Call to a Nation,World,https://medium.com/@biku.kanungo/gandhis-unfinished-business-call-to-a-nation-51e99ec4d9d6?source=topic_page---------65------------------1," Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi or affectionately Mahatma Gandhi still shines luminously in the collective memory and imagination of India. Today, on October 2nd 2019, a nation celebrates his 150th birth anniversary, extolling his ideals and sacrifices. Understandably, some of these remembrances of the non-violent warrior may be borne out of pure devotion, some may serve as inspiration, some may come in the form of lament over the degradation of the social ethics and politics of today, and many will take the shape of perishable tokenism. I recall him for his unfinished business — -incomplete projects and ideas surrounding religion, environment, caste, and gender — -that implore a billion to collective action. That religious harmony is indispensable to the smooth functioning and prosperity of a nation-state is irrefutable. For India, where the savage history of communal violence and distrust weighs heavily on its statecraft, it gains even more significance. Needless to say, Gandhi was acutely aware of the importance of religious harmony, and had conscientiously made it an inalienable part of his struggle for Swaraj. While bouts of communal violence remained a regular occurrence throughout India’s freedom struggle, it was greatly abated by Gandhi’s efforts, through the sheer force of his moral authority and his satyagraha. His efficacy in disarming the violent masses and in comforting many a tortured hearts is best exemplified by a note from Mountbatten following Gandhi’s fast in Kolkata in early September 1947 that stopped blood-lust in city: “In the Punjab we have 55,000 soldiers and large-scale rioting on our hands. In Bengal, our forces consist of one man, and there is no rioting”. Even through his death (he was assassinated by a Hindu fanatic) he exposed the monstrosity of communalism and embossed the vitality of secularism onto the common psyche of India, affording a nascent democracy the public support for secularism. Regrettably, his unyielding commitment to secularism and religious harmony is dearly missed today. Independent India remains no stranger to communal tensions and violence. Today, with the menacing march of Hindutva into the power corridors of India, the regular mob lynching of Indian Muslims, the high clamor for Hindu rashtra, and the persistent vilification of religious minorities, Gandhi’s commitment to religious harmony remains more relevant than ever before. His spirit beseeches us to collective action of denouncing hatred, of identifying the veil of nationalism that communalism dons, and of cementing all the religious groups into a nationhood. Environmentalism has today assumed the place of one of the most distinctive movements of our age. Arguably, it also remains the most prescient of Gandhi’s credos. The oft-quoted statement “The world has enough for everyone’s needs, but not everyone’s greed” encapsulates one of Gandhi’s sharpest warnings against the destructive force of consumerism. He had, quite perceptively, recognized the inevitability of the violence embedded within market economies — that with finite resources an infinite hunger for wealth leads to conflict and violence. Unbeknownst of the term “environmental protection”, he had quite poetically laid out the moral compulsion for protecting the environment: “man has no power to create life, therefore, he has no right to destroy life.’’ His clarion call for swadeshi predates today’s growing demand for locally sourced products. He spoke of a new economic order wherein “true economics stands for social justice; it promotes the good of all equally, including the weakest and is indispensable for a decent life.” It’s a testament of his legacy that many of the environmental movements in independent, notably the Sarvodya movement, the Chipko movement, the Narmada struggle, have all remained unmistakably Gandhian, both in vision and practice. Unfortunately, India’s public policy has turned a blind eye to Gandhi’s advice. Today, India gradually descends into ecological squalor marked by massive deforestation, alarming levels of air pollution, an acute shortage of drinking water, loss of biodiversity, etc. As a fallout, India witnesses a heightened conflict between different social groups, and, more disturbingly, between the state and the people. The remedy, squarely, lies in Gandhi’s environmentalism, which calls upon us for conservation of our fragile nature, for community ownership and management of natural resources, for a collective endeavor to limit personal consumption, and for a new economic model that is premised on ecological balance. Gandhi’s position on caste still remains a hotly debated topic, given his initial inhibitions to attack the caste system as a whole and his various justification of the varna system. However, it is dishonest to assess Gandhi only through his early writings, while disregarding his various attempts at rooting out caste based discrimination. To him, the abolishment of untouchability was of no less consequence than the attainment of freedom. This is best exemplified by how community life was organized in his ashrams, where people of all castes and communities dined and mingled, much to the consternation of the mighty Hindu orthodoxy. The Vaikom temple-entry satyagraha of 1924 and his anti-untouchability tour of 1933, both bear witness to his moral and physical courage to challenge one of the most prevailing and militantly defended practices of his times. While he fails to live up to the revolutionary standards of Dr. Ambedkar, he still occupies the position of the most sincere reformer among the pantheon of nationalist leaders. Lamentably, despite the sustained Dr. Ambedkar and Gandhi, today, caste still remains the fundamental axis around which socio-economic life in India is organized. Inter-caste marriages are fiercely opposed and often answered with honor-killing of the defiant couples. Caste-related violence still remains one of the attendant evils of the rural India. In urban spaces, caste takes a more subtle form of economic stratification and ghettoization. Caste undercuts democracy, for what remains of democracy if caste-based inhibitions impair liberty, equality and solidarity? Today the life and message of both Gandhi and Dr. Ambedkar insist us to identify and reject the hideous institution of caste in both public and private spheres of life; and to seek upward mobility and fair representation of the marginalized castes, both within and outside the state apparatus. Viewed through the prisms of 21st century values, Gandhi remains a conservative. However, assessed in the context of his times, he shines as a feminist. From his sharp criticism of the purdah system to his promotion of girls’ education in his ashram schools to his promotion of charkha among women, Gandhi persistently challenged the traditional patriarchy of his time. A lesser known but equally laudable aspect of his life is that he never practiced any menstruation-related untouchability, a practice which still lingers in plain sight in Indian households. The gender-neutral character of his freedom struggle is best asserted through the large participation of women in the Quit India movement. With the advantage of hindsight, it won’t be incorrect to posit that it was the non-violent character of his struggle that could afford the wide participation of women. A violent struggle, as many a liberation army bear testimony to, would have discouraged the participation of women. Today, several of the prominent feminist and social justice leaders in India are expressly Gandhians — Aruna Roy, Ela Bhatt, Medha Patkar, Vandana Shiva, to name a few. Despite the tepid emancipation of women by way of state-sponsored reforms or the efforts of various civil society groups, subjugation of and violence on women still remain a harsh reality of India. A few examples may help underscore the state of women in India: the female labor participation rate in India remains one of the lowest in the world; access to formal credit and ownership of landholding still remain a far cry for most women; 40% of the girls are still married before they attain the legally marriageable age of 18; the practice of dowry still remains a silent custom in marriages. To this end, the simple yet potent Gandhian call for “swaraj for all” urges us to enthusiastically address the structural gender-bias prevalent in today’s India, be it at home, office, or place of worship. It implores us to wholeheartedly lend support to the various feminist movements of our times, and to create safe and conducive grounds for the social and economic upliftment of women in India. The above unfinished business of Gandhi renders India’s Swaraj incomplete. As a birthday gift, he deserves from us the completion of Swaraj."
Medium.com,Society,The UK Election Will Change Nothing,World,https://medium.com/discourse/the-uk-election-will-change-nothing-c29ed9b09a2d?source=topic_page---------66------------------1," The first thing to understand about this election is that it is, by and large, a Brexit election. The spectrum of the national parties’ positions on Brexit range from the Liberal Democrats, the party of cancelling Brexit altogether, to the Brexit Party — who, as the name suggests, are rather in favour of Brexit, preferably without a deal at all. The duopoly sit between the extremes, each occupying a different position. Labour is seen as the moderate Remain party, advocating a second referendum on a deal which they will negotiate. The Conservatives, meanwhile, is the moderate Leave party, offering their Brexit deal to the nation. This is significant because it means that both Remain voters and Leave voters will be split. In a First Past the Post electoral system which gives the seat to the candidate with the highest number of votes, that will be crucial to the election result. Boris has ruled out a pact with Farage, which would have guaranteed a majority for Leave but potentially created an unstable coalition without the numbers needed to pass his deal. However, the workings of a pact between Remain parties are there — the People’s Vote official campaign is attempting to coordinate Labour, the Lib Dems, the SNP, the Greens, and Plaid Cymru. But the viability of such a plan is questionable, and its scope will likely be limited. While Brexit (mostly) unites these parties, there are huge rifts over Scottish (and Welsh) independence and management of the economy — the biggest being between the Liberal Democrats and the Labour Party, extending back to when the Lib Dems entered into a coalition with the Conservatives. This means that, while the Remain vote may be united around one candidate in a handful of seats, the votes for both Brexit inclinations will be split. That could create some interesting results, leaving the election largely unpredictable. The Conservatives need to win one type of seat: Labour Leave seats. As the name would suggest, they are targeting working-class areas which voted Leave — so almost all working-class areas, particularly in the North. And until a few weeks ago, many predictions for an election had them winning a large number of these seats. However, Nigel Farage has said that the Brexit Party will run in hundreds of seats nationally, challenging the Conservatives directly in these Labour Leave areas. That will split the vote viciously: many working-class people won’t want to vote for the typically middle-class Conservatives if they don’t have to, and might prefer to vote for Farage — portraying himself as a man of the people. And the split — likely to be the Brexit Party taking about one-third or one-quarter of the Brexit vote from the Tories — could hand Labour narrow victories in these seats. The Remain vote won’t be as badly split in these seats, because working people of Northern towns aren’t generally inclined to vote for the Lib Dems, who have little appeal to the worker. And that might be compounded by a potential, uneasy, partial Lib-Lab electoral alliance in these towns, where the Lib Dems know an election challenge will be entirely futile and potentially embarrassing. So, while there will be incredibly narrow margins involved, and only a tiny swing on election day for the Conservatives required, these towns might well ultimately find themselves, perhaps begrudgingly, in Labour hands once more. Old habits, it seems, really do die hard. That leaves the Conservatives with very few other target seats, and with a potentially fatal challenge to their 13 seats in Scotland and their 21 seats in London from the SNP and Liberal Democrats respectively, they might well take roughly what they lose. I have little doubt that the Remain vote will translate into three large but divided parliamentary blocs, with Labour probably losing quite a few seats, but, even if they can’t take any seats themselves, the Brexit Party will probably deny the Conservatives of many of their target seats. It’s still incredibly close to call, and it’s feasible that the Conservatives hold in London and Scotland, and gain in the North. But it’s not at all likely — and we might be right back to square one in resolving Brexit."

It is “injustice and neglect” Sea-Watch summarizes, giving an update on a case of 53 rescued people from last summer. While many of them were relocated as promised, all of them were detained in the hotspot in Messina, Sicily, and were denied free lawyers until lawers helped them. Eleven people are still forced to stay in Messina, with “little to no access to medical or psychological care, and lack clarity about their legal status”. Germany promised to relocate them, but nothing has happened yet. Additionally, Sea-Watch criticzes a lack of monitoring opportunities for the relocation process, which makes it seem intransparend and arbitrary."
Medium.com,Society,China is much stronger on climate action than western media asserts,World,https://medium.com/the-future-is-electric/china-is-much-stronger-on-climate-action-than-western-media-asserts-8f0f55cd1e02?source=topic_page---------72------------------1," A friend and on-and-off collaborator on IPOs and technical innovation initiatives returned recently from a month in Beijing, where he was applying machine learning against video to speed training in sports. He’s a walker, so he covered up to 20 kilometers a day on the streets of the city. He made two observations that rung true for me, as someone who has been paying attention to China, but from afar. The first is that the air was clean and the sky was blue. While my friend was there during the cleaner air summer rather than the winter when the air quality is typically at its worst, the improvement in air quality in Chinese cities has been extraordinary over the past decade. The second was that the streets were incredibly quiet, much quieter than the streets of Vancouver outside the coffee shop we were in as he told me about his trip. It wasn’t that the streets were empty. Quite the opposite. They were packed with cars and people. But virtually all the vehicles were electric. No engine noise. No diesel trucks rumbling past. No motorcycles revving. Just tire noise, which at the lower speeds typical to city streets is very quiet. So clean air and quiet streets in the capital of China, a city of almost 22 million people. And that’s true of most other major Chinese cities as well. But a lot of people’s perspectives on China are stuck in the past, on this subject as on many others. Right now, the US is embroiled in a trade war with China, with President Trump frequently attacking China. Infamously, he tweeted that “The concept of global warming was created by and for the Chinese in order to make US manufacturing non-competitive.” One of the key arguments many climate change deniers return to over and over again, when all of their other arguments are rapidly debunked, is that it doesn’t matter what the US does because China is the largest emitter of CO2 in the world and is still opening up coal plants. And that’s not just a Republican or climate change denier talking point. Joe Biden’s climate change action plan spends most of its foreign policy section pointing fingers at China, from its Belt and Road Initiative to its coal subsidies. In Canada, we had an election in October — for Americans, here’s my snarky guide to understanding the six week federal election — and the big action plan from the conservative leader (who lost) on climate was exporting natural gas to China to displace coal generation there, but not much action in Canada. Yes, that’s as dumb as a box of hammers, but it’s consistent with North American perspectives on China. It’s not quite as bad as the Australian government saying that shipping coal to India was a climate plus, but it’s close. But there’s another story on China, one consistent with my friend’s observations, and one that’s not being told in its entirety or understood in the west. China is likely on track to achieve its (relatively light) emissions targets a decade early. It’s bending the curve on emissions faster than any country in history, just as it ramped them up faster than any country in history. Yes, China produces about twice as much CO2e annually as the US, but about half as much per person. The US is responsible for twice as much CO2e historically in total as China, with only a quarter of China’s 1.4 billion citizens. While China has been catching up and is the leading country by emissions, let’s ensure that we understand that it’s 18% of the world’s population and the second biggest economy in the world after the US. 15% of the world’s GDP is from China right now. Now that we understand the per capita and GDP aspects, and that China isn’t the primary nation responsible for global warming, just the one emitting the most CO2 today, let’s look at what China is doing about it. China is turning on more low-carbon electrical generation annually in the form of hydro, wind, solar, and nuclear than any other country globally, and for each of those categories typically more than the next 2–3 countries. While its nuclear program has been less effective than its wind and solar programs, every TWh of nuclear generation displaces a TWh of coal and gas generation and should be welcomed. As Biden’s climate plan points out, China invested $3 in renewable energy for every $1 the US invested in 2017. In 2012, China commissioned the Three Gorges Dam, the largest capacity hydroelectric dam in the world, capable of generating about 100 TWh of low-carbon electricity every year. And it is building more high-voltage direct current transmission than any other country in the world to get that renewable electricity to major population centers with low losses. China has over 400,000 electric buses on its roads which are already displacing 270,000 barrels of oil demand a day, and naturally that means that all electric bus manufacturers with any global market share that registers are Chinese. Most countries with ‘big’ electric bus fleets have well under 270, three orders of magnitude fewer. China’s citizens also buy 50% of all electric cars sold in the world every year, and they have more car companies devoted to electrification than any other country or region in the world. China has about 30,000 kilometers of electrically powered high-speed rail with plans to extend that to about 38,000 kilometers, sufficient to girdle the Earth. No country is anywhere close, with Europe having a third of China’s high-speed rails and the US and Canada having exactly zero kilometers. And naturally, China is building most of the world’s electric bicycles and other small electric vehicles such as skateboards and scooters. China’s transportation electrification strategies surpass every country in the world, including electric car leader Norway. China has the most aggressive reforestation program in the world, having planted an area the size of France with about 38 billion trees since 1990. As the recent trillion trees study pointed out, planting trees is one of the simplest and best mechanisms to draw down atmospheric CO2. Project Drawdown puts afforestation at #15 on its list of the top 100 methods of tackling global warming, ranked by cost vs benefit. China pretty much owns the global solar panel market. Eight of the largest 10 manufacturers of solar panels in the world are Chinese. Goldwind, the Chinese wind turbine manufacturer, is the second largest by market share in the world, recently taking over second spot from GE but still trailing Denmark’s Vestas. And, of course, China, unlike the US, is signatory to the Paris Accord and is on track to vastly exceed its 2030 pledge, and meet or exceed its 2020 pledge. Of course, those pledges are inadequate to curb global warming, but China is likely to increase its targets radically, just as it is expected to double its solar and potentially wind generation targets for 2030. And it’s very worth pointing out that while China’s emissions rose 2.3% in 2018, the US’ emissions rose by 3.4% in the same year. And China has done more to address fossil fuel subsidies than the US has as well. In other words, as US politicians point fingers at China, the US is actually going in the wrong direction faster and doing less to bend the curve in the right direction. While a lot of fingers are being pointed at China by people committed to both inaction and action in North America, the actual climate story in China is much different than most people realize. It should be looked to for inspiration in the fight on global warming and encouraged in its effort, not attacked and definitely not used as an excuse for inaction. This story originally appeared in CleanTechnica."
Medium.com,Society,Iran Regime Privatises Education Sector,World,https://medium.com/freedom-star/iran-regime-privatises-education-sector-5cc5597316bd?source=topic_page---------73------------------1," A few weeks ago, the Iranian education ministry has been tasked with managing all sectors of education until the end of the current academic year. Different factions of the Iranian regime have been in disagreement regarding the private and public sector within the educational system. Like many areas of life in Iran, the regime sees the education sector as another way to exploit resources and enrichen itself to the detriment of the people. This new bill has not been popular. While the bill was being discussed, not a single official questioned the government’s responsibility to provide free education to all. The Iranian government has a duty to provide education to all Iranian children until they finish high school. This new bill is taking the management of schools away from the government, but it is just providing the regime with another way to take away resources from the people. Without looking into the situation too closely, it could easily be thought that the regime is putting measures in place to improve the education system that is failing because of a lack of funds. However, basically privatizing the education system is not helping matters. In fact, it is harming the already struggling economy and it is further marginalizing the poor and already marginalized. The government is shirking its responsibility and passing the responsibility of funding the education system across to the people. A professor at Tehran University spoke about the problem, saying that rich Iranians would prefer to enroll their children at private schools and ensure that their children receive an education separate to poor children. The professor also said that the aim of some wealthy people is to “eliminate the poor” from the education cycle. Of course, many of these wealthy people have ties to the regime. Regular families are struggling as it is to afford to send their children to any school. More and more Iranian children are not able to go to school. It is a basic right that children all over the world take for granted. However, in Iran where families are falling deeper into poverty, many children have been unable to spend a single day in school. Some families rely on the income from their children, while some families cannot afford school supplies. The exact number of children not able to attend school in Iran is unknown. The regime estimated that there are approximately 3 million children not in education, but more reliable estimates indicate that the exact figure is around double this. The People’s Mojahedin Organization of Iran (PMOI / MEK) has pointed out that the children of Iran are the first victims of the regime. This privatization of the education sector is just one more example of the regime’s corruption and mismanagement. The Iranian opposition supports the people in their quest for regime change. It is clear that the regime is never going to put the people first, hence the massive protests and anti-government demonstrations taking place across the country. The people are taking their future into their hands."
Medium.com,Society,Houthis Blame Saudi Arabia for Deaths of Thousands of Sudanese Soldiers in Yemen,World,https://medium.com/citizen-truth/houthis-blame-saudi-arabia-for-deaths-of-thousands-of-sudanese-soldiers-in-yemen-f302826697fa?source=topic_page---------74------------------1," In a televised press conference over the weekend, a spokesperson for the Yemen-based Houthi rebels announced that more than 4,000 Sudanese soldiers have been killed in Yemen since 2015. Brigadier General Yahya Seri’i, a spokesperson for the Houthi-led Ansar Allah forces, said that 4,253 Sudanese soldiers which have been a part of a Saudi Arabia-led Arab military coalition against Yemen have been killed and around another 4,000 wounded. “The total losses for the mercenaries of the Sudanese Army since the beginning of the aggression exceeds 8,000”, Seri’i was reported by the Almasdar News website as saying. The spokesperson also accused the Saudi Arabian-led coalition of dragging Sudanese soldiers into the front lines of the Yemen War and claimed that Sudanese soldiers have not been given priority in arrangements for prisoner swaps. The televised conference also showed multiple videos of captured Sudanese soldiers speaking in front of cameras and assuring their families about their well-being. In response to the Houthis’ claims, a spokesperson for the Sudanese army, Amer al-Hassan, told Russia Today (RT) that the Houthi’s numbers were false. “The death toll, announced by the Houthis is not supported by any logic. The Sudanese army had fought a 21-year-long civil war in home, and it did not lose such a number of deaths,” al-Hassan told RT. According to Sudan Daily, al-Hassan claimed the Houthi statement was an attempt at psychological manipulation — to turn Sudan’s citizens against the Saudi-led coalition in Yemen and the involvement of Sudan’s troops. He also denied a leak that 10,000 Sudanese forces were being removed from Yemen, stressing that “the Sudanese forces can not be withdrawn from Yemen in any way.” Fighting in Yemen began in late 2014 when Houthi rebels took control of large parts of the country, including the capital Sana’a. Mass protests and the Houthi rebel group forced the internationally recognized government of President Abd Rabbuh Mansur Hadi from power in 2015. Since then, Hadi has resided in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia. The civil war has its roots in the 2011 Arab Spring, which led to a 2011 Yemen uprising that eventually forced the end of the 32-year-long regime of Yemen’s late president, Ali Abdullah Saleh. The uprising grew into a military conflict in 2014 and has since caused the deaths of thousands of people and the displacement of hundreds of thousands more. Since 2014 the separatist Houthis have engaged in a civil war with the government. In support of the government, Saudi Arabia has led an Arab military coalition against the Houthis along with the support of nine other countries from West Asia and Africa, which includes the Sudanese soldiers. The Houthis have attempted to attack Saudi Arabia on its own soil in return mostly through drone strikes. Most recently, the Houthis allegedly launched missiles and explosives-laden drones against the Saudi oil refinery, Aramco. Saudi Arabia has yet to respond to a Houthi truce offer that depends on Saudi Arabia stopping its military attacks on Yemen.

Medium.com,Society,"Margot Wallstrom’s Feminist Foreign Policy for Sweden Catches On Globally, She Says",World,https://medium.com/p/3acfba5024b3?source=topic_page---------75------------------1," by Barbara Crossette. This article originally appeared on Passblue. Margot Wallstrom, as Sweden’s newly appointed foreign minister, announced in 2014 that her priority would be the creation of the world’s first feminist foreign policy. The concept left some in her diplomatic corps “gasping for air,” she said. Now, having recently completed a hectic five years in office despite numerous global crises, she is confident that her pro-women policy is here to stay. In the five years since taking charge of Swedish foreign policy, Wallstrom, now 65, has been drawn into major international roles. Among these were the Trump administration’s negotiations with North Korea, during which she worked with Rex Tillerson, Donald Trump’s first secretary of state, whom the president sidelined and later fired. Sweden, with a diplomatic presence in North Korea since 1971 is the “protective power,” or go-between, in Pyongyang for the United States, Canada and Australia. Of Tillerson, Wallstrom said in an exclusive interview with PassBlue in New York on Oct. 31: “You could always talk to him. He wanted to learn things, and that’s why he could also listen. So many of these guys, they never listen.” Trump’s “diplomacy” on North Korea has stumbled ever since. In a show of diplomatic skill and tireless campaigning, Wallstrom had earlier beat back strong challenges from Italy and the Netherlands to win Sweden a two-year elected Security Council seat for 2017–2018, a story documented in the 2018 film “The Feminister.” (Italy and the Netherlands won the second open seat, splitting the two-year term between them.) On the downside, Wallstrom ran into trouble with Saudi Arabia and Israel over criticisms of their human and political rights records. Diplomatic crises followed. Wallstrom, who recognized Palestine and accused Israelis of abuses, including killings of Palestinians, received death threats from Israelis in 2017, though she was never attacked. Asked if she was fearful, she replied in the film that fear only diminishes a person’s energy. Wallstrom resigned as foreign minister in September to spend more time with her family — her husband, two sons and three grandchildren. Suffering from a thyroid condition that needed medication, she has relaxed and retreated to her home on a Swedish country lake where, she said, she swims almost year round. What’s next for Wallstrom? “Well, of course, my political engagement will continue with me from now on, but I can choose more carefully what I want to engage in,” Wallstrom, a Social Democrat, said. A former UN special envoy on sexual violence in conflict, primarily concentrating in the Democratic Republic of the Congo in 2010–2012, Wallstrom wants to continue work on women, peace and security as well as nuclear issues and climate change. She was the European Union commissioner for the environment from 1999 to 2004. Wallstrom also wants to stay engaged in a debate growing more acrimonious among feminists globally about a widening, well-funded campaign to repeal laws everywhere against prostitution for both buyers and sellers of sex. The decriminalization campaign has drawn critics among many feminists who work among the poorest and most vulnerable girls and women, not only in developing countries but also in Western Europe, who are trafficked into the sex industry. “To me it’s so clear: how can we continue to work toward gender equality as long as women can be bought as a piece of meat?” Wallstrom said. She believes that UN Women, the agency protecting women’s rights (which says it is neutral in the sex trade debate) needs to bring the issue into more open discussion among feminists and others with clashing views of how to deal with the multibillion dollar sex industry. “I really think UN Women are struggling,” Wallstrom said. “They have to consider how best to deal with the fact that here there are really two camps [on prostitution]. At the moment they are at war, and that’s never a good thing, because it would hurt the whole cause for women, the whole agenda. They have to find a way to move on. This cannot be allowed to overshadow everything else.” Sweden pioneered what is called the Nordic legislative model, which makes buying — but not selling — sex illegal, putting the law on the side of women who are often victims of violence and sex slavery. Wallstrom has gone out at night with police officers and social workers to study how the policy works in Stockholm, where women are given a hotline number if they need help. She compares that system to the freewheeling situation in Germany and other European countries where prostitution is more or less completely legal and megabrothels flourish. “The official figure today is that 400,000 women were working as prostitutes in Germany,” she said. “Do you think that they are Germans, middle class women, who think that this looks like a nice job — something that I would recommend to my daughter? Of course not.” Among the women in brothels, she added, “98 percent come from Ukraine, from Moldova, from Nigeria — from poor countries around the world. They’re all trafficked there, and it’s like hell on earth,” she says, quoting from a 2018 study by Ingeborg Kraus, a scholar in Germany, where prostitution has been legal since 2002. Wallstrom says that more public attention is needed on “sugar daddies,” who often provide the entry point into prostitution. “Young girls, they would very much like to have a thousand-dollar handbag or a trip somewhere, and they believe that they will get that from rather wealthy older men they meet on sites that you can find on the Internet. Of course, this is just prostitution in disguise.” On how she institutionalized her feminist foreign policy and whether she is confident that it will survive her departure as foreign minister, Wallstrom was upbeat in the interview. “Absolutely,” she said. She built a comprehensive, concrete program for the Swedish ministry and its diplomatic corps, she noted, and its gender equality focus has been emulated to one extent or another in dozens of countries or communities, according to Swedish figures. She explained the formulated policy in detail (in English) in a speech at Lund University in March 2017. In the interview with PassBlue, she said: “Our whole diplomatic corps, our embassies around the world, they had to understand, what did we mean by calling it a feminist foreign policy. First of all, why does it belong to foreign policy? They say: What do we have to do? What do you expect from the embassies? “At its center, it was a policy built on solid research and observation, and always with one question in mind: Where are the women? “Because when they started to ask, How many girls are married away before they are even 15 in their countries?, they were shocked,” she said. “It’s not something that would be announced or used as an explanation to why it’s so difficult to fight poverty. They started to look at the statistics, and one ambassador said to me: We started to ask ourselves how often do we invite women to our embassy? To the meetings? To the lunches? When we listen to civil society, do we make sure that also the women come? Then we started to look and we started to measure or count. “So it changed their attitudes,” Wallstrom said. “I think what we’ve achieved in Sweden, we’ve set a norm. We have provided a kind of benchmark. We are also made accountable to respecting that norm. Everybody in the ministry has to go through an online training on this issue. So we have the system, and I don’t think there’s a way to go back on that.”"
Medium.com,Society,Global protests: Russia and China risk ending up on the wrong side of history,World,https://medium.com/the-turbulent-world-of-middle-east-soccer/global-protests-russia-and-china-risk-ending-up-on-the-wrong-side-of-history-ecc0949d20d5?source=topic_page---------76------------------1," By James M. Dorsey A podcast version of this story is available on Soundcloud, Itunes, Spotify, Stitcher, TuneIn, Spreaker, Pocket Casts, Tumblr, Podbean, Audecibel, and Castbox. Widespread perceptions see Russia together with China as the rising powers in the Middle East as a result of America’s flip flops in Syria and US president Donald J. Trump’s transactional approach towards foreign policy as well as Russian and Chinese support for regimes irrespective of how non-performing and/or repressive they may be. Russia has sought to capitalize in other parts of the world, particularly Africa, on its newly found credibility in the Middle East as part of its projection of itself as a world power on par with the United States and China. African leaders gathered in late October in the Black Sea resort of Sochi for the first ever Russian African summit chaired by president Vladimir Putin. China has hosted similar regional summits. Mr. Putin has proven adept at playing a weak hand well and for now, Russia alongside China, that has the financial and trading muscle that Moscow lacks, are basking in their glory. Yet, Russia and China could find themselves in tricky situations with protests across the globe from Latin America to Hong Kong threatening to put the two powers on the wrong side of history. Iran, Russia’s partner in supporting Syrian president Bashar al-Assad and a strategic node in China’s Belt and Road initiative, is already struggling to come to grips with being in the bull’s eye of protesters. Protesters in Iraq have denounced Iranian influence in the country while Iran’s Lebanese Shiite ally, Hezbollah, is part of the elite that protesters hold responsible for their country’s economic malaise. Russia and China are well aware of the risk. Not only because of the resilience of protest in Hong Kong but also because of past popular revolts in former Soviet republics that constitute Russia’s soft underbelly and in some cases border on the strategically important but troubled Chinese north-western province of Xinjiang. Recent protests in Kazakhstan were as much about domestic governance issues as they were about Chinese influence in the country and the crackdown on Turkic Muslims, including ethnic Kazakhs in Xinjiang. Central Asia, moreover, is potentially for China a black swan. It is together with Southeast Asian nations Laos and Cambodia, home to countries most indebted to China. A recent study by scholars at Harvard University’s Kennedy School, the University of Munich and the Kiel Institute for the World Economy concluded that about half of Chinese overseas lending remained unrecorded leaving Central Asian and other nations with no precise oversight of their debt. “These hidden overseas debts pose serious challenges for country risk analysis and bond pricing,” the study warned. The risk of ending up on the wrong side of history looms even larger with Russia seeing prevention and/or countering of popular revolts as one of its goals in attempting to stabilize the Middle East, a region wracked by conflict and wars. Russia, as part of its stabilization effort in the wake of its intervention in Syria, has proposed replacing the US defense umbrella in the Gulf with a multilateral security arrangement. “Russia is seeking stability which includes preventing colour revolutions,” said Maxim Grigoryev, director of the Moscow-based Foundation for the Study of Democracy, using the term employed to describe popular revolts in countries that once were part of the Soviet Union. Echoing Kremlin policy, Mr. Grigoryev said Syria was “a model of stabilizing a regime and countering terrorism.” Russian military intervention in Syria has helped president Bashar al-Assad gain the upper hand in a more than eight-year long brutal war in which the Syrian government has been accused of committing crimes against humanity. Russia has denied allegations that its air force has repeatedly targeted hospitals and other civil institutions. Russia’s definition of stability with Syria as its model is unlikely to go down well with youth-driven protests that have already affected twelve of the Arab League’s 22 members. In some of the most dramatic incidents, this year’s popular revolts forced the leaders of Algeria, Sudan and Lebanon to resign. Iraqi prime minister Adil Abdul-Mahdi is next in line. Latin America and Africa, like the Middle East and Central Asia, home to often poorly governed, resource-rich countries with youthful populations, are in many ways not that different. Some Latin American leaders, including Argentine Foreign Minister Jorge Faurie and Luis Almagro, the secretary-general of the Organization of American States, have denounced what they see as interference in protests in Chile, Ecuador, Bolivia and Haiti by two Russia and China-backed countries, Venezuela and Cuba. Ecuador’s interior minister, María Paula Romo, said last month that authorities had arrested 17 people at an airport, “most of them Venezuelans . . . carrying information about the protests.” Policy analysts Moisés Naím and Brian Winter argued that irrespective of whether Venezuela and Cuba have sought to exploit continental discontent, “Latin America was already primed to combust.” Messrs. Naim and Winter attribute popular anger to disappointing economic growth, stagnating wages, rising costs of living, mounting inequality, and corruption on the back of a commodity boom that significantly raised expectations. Russian and Chinese support for embattled regimes at the risk of alienating protesters, who have proven in among others Chile, Iraq and Hong Kong undeterred by repressive efforts to squash their protests, will have paid off if it helps engineer the kind of stability Mr. Grigoryev is advocating. Russian and Chinese leaders may be banking on a development akin to what Messrs. Moses and Winter describe as the emergence of repressive Latin American regimes in the 1970s and 1980s as a result of leaders’ failure to tackle slowing economic growth. The failure fuelled a decline of faith in democracy and the rise of populists. “The same gears may churn toward mayhem and division, sown from within Latin American countries and without. Venezuela and Cuba may not be the main reason for the current protests. But if the region continues down its current path, it will be vulnerable to the next conspiracy, whether from Havana, Caracas, or somewhere else,” Messrs. Moses and Winter warned. Events elsewhere in the world may well unfold differently. Yet, Russia and China could ultimately find themselves on the wrong side of history in an era of global breakdown of popular confidence in political systems and incumbent leadership and increasingly uncompromising, determined and resourceful protests. Said Timothy Kaldas, a senior fellow at the Tahrir Institute for Middle East Policy, commenting on the protests in the Middle East: “This isn’t a revolution against a prime minister or a president. It’s an uprising demanding the departure of the entire ruling class,” the very people Russia and China would like to see remain in place. Dr. James M. Dorsey is a senior fellow at Nanyang Technological University’s S. Rajaratnam School of International Studies, an adjunct senior research fellow at the National University of Singapore’s Middle East Institute and co-director of the University of Wuerzburg’s Institute of Fan Culture"
Medium.com,Society,Three Reasons why a Corbyn Government would Threaten Jewish life in Britain,World,https://medium.com/@rob.mindell/three-reasons-why-a-corbyn-government-would-threaten-jewish-life-in-britain-cbe20cbd813d?source=topic_page---------77------------------1," If, like me, you are a member of Britain’s Jewish community, you will have your mind made up about the prospect of Jeremy Corbyn as Prime Minister. A recent Survation poll of Jewish voters found that an astonishing 94% would vote in the upcoming General Election for a party that is not Labour, with 87% of respondents believing Jeremy Corbyn is antisemitic. In the days since parliament voted to go to the polls, I have been challenged by those outside of the Jewish community on what exactly makes Jeremy Corbyn antisemitic and what exactly is it that Jews fear about him as Prime Minister? Why is it that nearly half of the UK’s Jewish community would seriously consider emigrating were Corbyn to win this General Election? It is a reasonable question to ask what is this perceived persecution from which we would be fleeing — so I shall summarise it in three themes. 1. Kosher Living Under Corbyn The first threat a Corbyn-led government poses, is the ability to keep to Jewish religious customs — the most obvious of which is kashrut (kosher), the laws around Jewish food and products. A significant proportion of kosher produce is imported from Israel, and this is a trend that is only set to increase with debate across continental European authorities considering bans on Halal and Kosher food. Given Jeremy Corbyn’s past advocacy of a boycott of goods from Israel — and the Labour Party policy adopted at its 2019 conference to single out Israel as a State with which a Corbyn government would not do a trade deal — how conceivable is it that a majority Corbyn government would pass through a law that bans the import of Israeli produce? And in the situation that such a law was passed, how would it be policed? Would there be checks and audits of Jewish shops and businesses to ensure they weren’t stocking Israeli produce? Or what about Jewish homes, would the same apply to them? Modern antisemitism on the Left of politics very rarely starts with a direct attack on Jews, but if a legitimate concern can be made against Israel — which now stands as the world’s safe-haven for Jewish communities across the globe — direct action on the issue can very rapidly can be turned to make Jewish life difficult. 2. Security of Jewish Community Buildings It is a horrifying reality that in 2019, Jewish communities across the world live in fear of violent terror attacks. The traumatic scenes outside of the Tree of Life Synagogue in Pittsburgh, or the recent attack on the Halle synagogue in Germany, are ones we fear being repeated in the UK. When a kosher shop became a target in France’s wave of terror attacks in 2015, it struck a raw chord with many in Britain’s Jewish community. I recall the Friday night sabbath dinner conversation — what if I had been one of those hostages? How worrying that it is only the small English Channel separating us from the wave of terror against Jewish communities in Europe? This fear only increased with the stabbings of Jews outside a synagogue in Marseille later that year and the subsequent murders in Paris of Sarah Halimi and Mireille Knoll in further antisemitic incidents. I recently enrolled my daughter at a nursery school based at a synagogue. Upon visiting the nursery — as much as I wanted to meet the staff, see the space and learn about the daily schedule — the thing I spent the most time checking-out was the security set-up for the building. From the age of one, my daughter will be attending daycare with a guard at the front door and constant security presence. That is not the desires of an over-protective parent — it is a necessary precaution of 21st century Jewish life. In this environment, the Jewish community relies on a supportive government who understand and sympathise with these very real security threats — a government that will help overcome any administrative or regulatory hurdles to protecting Jewish community centres, schools and places of worship. I can recall hearing this support loud and clear from successive political party leaders over the past decades, whether Labour, Conservative or Lib Dems. I have never once heard Jeremy Corbyn utter his commitment. In fact, when I searched out looking to find and consolation that Jeremy Corbyn might understand the nature of anti-Jewish terrorism, I only found the opposite. Down the road from my home is a Jewish community building named Balfour House. I recall visiting it as a teenager when taking part in a youth volunteering programme. In 1994, the building was bombed in an antisemitic incident, and one backbench MP spent the subsequent years campaigning for the release of two of the terrorist attackers. His name was Jeremy Corbyn. 3. A Hostile Environment for Jews This final point is more subtle, but is no less important the concerns about security and kosher living. As a backbencher, Jeremy Corbyn was very happy to welcome to Parliament individuals who were sworn to killing Jews. He spoke at rallies and conferences alongside those who would seek to diminish the atrocities of the Holocaust, or use that horror to stir up anger against supporters of the State of Israel. He did not do this one or twice, but dozens upon dozens of occasions as part of the norm of his campaigning. It is no surprise that as Leader of the Labour Party, Corbyn’s era has seen its increase in membership coincide with a rise of antisemitic incidents — with many members repeating the same lines heard at those rallies and marches where Corbyn himself was up on stage. It is now commonplace in Labour circles to witness conspiracy theories about money, power and control by Jews to persecute others. Whether these antisemitic tropes are raised at a rally in Trafalgar Square with Jeremy Corbyn in the front row, or in a Facebook group with Jeremy Corbyn as an active member, or on Twitter from accounts with the hashtag #JC4PM — Corbyn’s instinct has continually been to stand by silently. A chilling moment transpired after last year’s local elections in England. Labour polled worse than expected, but it was subsequently revealed that Corbyn had planned a victory parade through Barnet Council — home to the UK’s largest Jewish population. Thankfully there was no cause for parade in Barnet, which did not vote in a Labour council — but could you imagine the scenes of Jeremy Corbyn and his momentum activists sprawling through the streets of Golders Green? The message of hostility it would have sent to British Jews echoes the tales of what we now know to be the precursors to some of Europe’s darkest days in history. This is Corbyn’s Labour, and after this General Election it will either be a brief moment in Britain’s history or a troubling future ahead for all of us. For many in the Jewish community, a Corbyn-led government poses such a threat to our existence and way of life that the only option is to flee. For many outside of the Jewish community, these fears may seem farfetched. But we have particularly sensitive radars to situations of rising antisemitism. My grandmother was born in Leipzig, Germany. She escaped in 1939 with her mother and sister, first to Switzerland, and then to Britain. Had they waited a few more months, they may not have survived and I would not be here today. I really do not want to leave the UK — the country I love and the place I have always called home. But when the stakes are so high, how could I stay in a Britain that elected Jeremy Corbyn as Prime Minister?"
Medium.com,Society,"Iraq is Healing: The October Revolution, Systemic Change and Intergenerational Trauma",World,https://medium.com/@WATM/iraq-is-healing-the-october-revolution-systemic-change-and-intergenerational-trauma-2d8bc798901e?source=topic_page---------78------------------1," by Sundus Abdul Hadi I am writing this as a daughter of the Iraqi Diaspora, in English, to bridge the gap between what is happening on the ground in Iraq and the international community. The lack of media coverage is in stark contrast to the plethora of powerful content circulating from Iraqis on the ground on social media. The stories, the images, and the symbolic centres of the revolution need to be heard, seen, held and celebrated because they have the potential to inspire all of our collective struggles. They deserve our support. The revolution under way in Iraq is highly symbolic, because it is greater than the sectarian narrative that we have been fed throughout the years. The Iraqi narrative, since the illegal US-led war and occupation in 2003, has been crafted by the people who benefit from its instability, and made into a complicated mess that is difficult to articulate. This time, however, this is not the case. There is something deeper brewing, and it has to do with all of us. It has to do with the deep impact of colonialism, imperialism, and corrupt systems disguised as democracy. It has to do with systemic change, from the inside out. Since October 25, the people of Baghdad have taken over Tahrir square, the highly symbolic centre of the city, home to Jawad Salim’s iconic Nasb Al Hurriya (the Freedom Monument). Their demands are simple. Nreed Watan. We want a country. They are there to hold the government accountable. Ultimately, they want to break the system, because its already broken. The protests have been peaceful; the government response vicious. Over 320 protestors have been killed since the protests began on Oct 1, and tens of thousands injured. Demonstrations are happening all over Iraq, from Basra to Najaf. In Karbala alone, 18 protesters were killed in one night. In Baghdad, government Special Forces, dressed in black, have been attacking unarmed protestors with military-grade tear gas, expired since 2014, and the cans themselves have been killing and injuring scores of people by getting lodged in the head and other vital organs. The people have been responding by concocting home-made remedies and pepsi to soothe the eye burns, with some brave youth even throwing the fuming canisters back at the army. The iconic images of Iraqis old and young wearing blue surgical masks testifies to the overuse of this toxic gas to try to quell the demonstrations. It hasn’t worked, as millions of Iraqis are still taking to the streets demanding their right to live in dignity, in utter fearlessness. The people know how high the stakes are, both in terms of their own vulnerability to extreme violence, as well as the fragility of their corrupt government. In one of the most oil-rich countries in the world (Iraq has the 5th largest oil fields in the world), the quality of life is devastatingly low. The unemployment rate is high; poverty is extreme, and the youth need jobs. Electricity is powered for 5–8 hours per day, the water is contaminated, and a failing medical system are only a few of the issues Iraqi’s are frustrated with. Politicians never keep any of their promises; restoration and service amelioration projects come and get squashed before the ink even dries, and the money allocated to them evaporates into dirty pockets. Iraq is currently caught in a tug of war between foreign powers invested in controlling it’s political and economic landscape, between the US, Iran, Turkey, Saudi Arabia and others. Militias run amok, exercising a power rooted in violence. Iraq has great geopolitical significance, as well as its historic significance as the cradle of civilization, home to the earth’s first known civilization, the Sumerians. I believe that this land holds many keys in understanding our origin story, a history that has been continuously erased, ignored, and therefore repeated quite systematically. Ultimately, the Iraqi people deserve a better life. They deserve to live in dignity, with a calibre of services and a quality of life that reflects the richness of the land and the depth of its history. Contrary to the popular hashtag, #save_the_iraqi_people, the people have proved that they don’t need anyone to swoop in and save them; they are up to the task themselves. There are four main elements that have kept this revolution alive and pumping: 1- The peaceful protestors that have been flooding Tahrir Square day and night, night and day. In the hundreds of thousands, the people are feeding each other, cleaning the streets, dancing, singing, distributing blankets during the cold nights, and expressing a kind of community-care towards each other in a way never seen before. Besides the joyful energy, the protesters are holding space for the martyrs and the injured, holding vigils, lighting candles for them, and painting murals to immortalize the ones they have lost. There are calls for people to be respectful of the realities of the struggle, of the martyrs and the wounded, by not treating this revolution as a photo-op and party. There is prayer. There is hope. There are women, of all ages and backgrounds, documenting, chanting, praying, cooking, tending to the injured, accompanying teenage sons, participating in the revolution. Pockets of community are everywhere, from barbers offering their services to the protesters, mini libraries offering books, mini soccer matches, card games, street poetry, to artists painting and drawing on walls. Families go out together, from all classes and neighborhoods, defined by the hashtag نازل_اخذ_حقي# (I am coming down to demand my rights). Hoards of students have been leaving secondary schools and universities to join the protests, in uniform. Unions have joined the protest. Brave rescue workers and doctors are on the ground, with a young Iraqi female doctor, Selene Basil, coming home from France just to treat her people in the revolution. It is overwhelming, and many people are fainting and suffocating from the tear gas, needing oxygen and other urgent care. Birds are falling from the sky, poisoned by the fumes. There are stories on every face, every corner. Social media influencers like @alinajm3, @tattooedsuperman, @ayamansour11 @adhamadil, @tbark_mansour and more, otherwise known for culture and art, have now become vital information sources in the revolution for the youth that follow them. Iraqi photographers like @zaid_mohammed14, @ghaith_abdulahad, @abdullalii @haider_husseinii, @aimhazi, @3addn, @ak_abbas01, @afiaa_rasheed, @aymanalamiri and more are bringing powerful stories and a human face to our struggle, in a way never done before. The underlying message that I keep hearing is that “sectarianism is over”. The people have had enough of this tired rhetoric that has kept them divided for so long. It was a military strategy, after all: divide and conquer. A people, united, will never be defeated. This is civil disobedience at its finest. 2- The Turkish Restaurant building, the high rise tower that looks over Tahrir Square and the Jumhuriya bridge (which leads to the Green Zone — more on that next) has become a powerful centre of the revolution. The building, which is in fact a shell of its former self, with openings instead of windows, and scaffolding on the sides of the building, has been unoccupied since 2003, before which it was a popular Turkish restaurant patroned by Uday Hussein. It is said that the snipers who killed dozens of protestors in the first wave of uprising in the first week of October were shooting from positions inside the Turkish Restaurant building. Therefore, it is a key strategic site, and the fact that protestors have occupied it, and are refusing to leave, means that they are in fact protecting the protestors on the ground. They are truly “holding down the fort”, and won’t budge. Instead, they have worked out systems of getting provisions in and out of the building by suspending ropes on the sides of the building, and making requests via social media as per their current needs — whether it be blankets, food, or even cigarettes. They use lasers and lights as a way to deter any direct attacks at the building, and even use a loud speaker to communicate with the protestors on the bridges and on the ground. Most inspiringly, artists have taken to painting the walls of the building and it’s surroundings, prompted by young Iraqi artist @sajjadabbas2 and others, with messages and images from within the revolution, and dozens of banners with messages of unity drape off the sides of the building. The building has been dubbed Jabal Uhud — Mount Uhud, in Medina, was a site of a historic Islamic battle during the days of the Prophet Muhammad. In the context of the current Iraqi revolution, this building represents a shift of power towards a righteous struggle, a protector. 3- The two bridges leading to the Green Zone — the Jumhuriyya bridge and the Sinak bridge — have seen the worst casualties of this revolution. There is a no-mans-land between the protestors on one side and the military barricade upon the bridge, from which special forces have been shooting military grade tear gas canisters at any protesters attempting to cross it. The Green Zone represents the seat of power for the Iraqi government and its imperial puppet masters, as that is where all the government buildings and embassies are located. Protesters have been attempting to reach the Green Zone since the evening of October 24, and were faced with sclading water, rubber bullets, stun grenades and tear gas. It is important to note that the Green Zone is a controlled neighborhood at all times — meaning, the government has restricted its citizens from entering the Green Zone since the U.S. occupation in 2003. The Green Zone represents the breeding ground of corruption, and ultimately the protector of US imperial power, as represented in the massive US embassy, a symbol of American control of Iraq (and the region at large.) The 750-million dollar embassy employs 16,000 people, and covers 142 acres of prime Baghdadi riverfront real-estate. Limiting the peoples mobility within one of the most important locations in the city of Baghdad, which runs along the banks of the river Tigris, is symbolic of the pardoning of American crimes against the Iraqi people, generations deep. It is also symbolic of the pool of money that exchanges hands amongst Iraq’s corrupt political elite, never making its way to the people, the city’s heritage, and the services in dire need of restoration and maintenance. 4- The brave boys and men who drive TukTuk’s have taken on the role of being front line rescue workers, transporting the injured to ambulances waiting for them, organizing a rescue system amidst the chaos of Tahrir square. Many tuktuk drivers are protecting their 3-wheeled vehicles with wire, to keep the riders safe from tear gas canisters being shot at them. They are some of the bravest and most fearless Iraqis, and have become symbols of the revolution, with their unstoppable courage and unrelenting pride. They, most importantly, come from deep within the Iraqi struggle, many of them having lost parents in the various wars, having to learn to depend on themselves in a crooked system while trudging through poverty. Since this revolution began, many have been refusing any money for their services. One young Tuktuk driver, Allawi, says, “Keep your money. I will take my rights from the government.” They are the heroes of this revolution. Remixing Fairuz’s famous song “Tiktiktik Ya Um Sleyman”, the Tuktuk anthem of late is “Tuktuktuk ya Um Sleyman, our tuk tuk is in the heart of the fire, our tuk tuk carries our national pride, worth all of America and Iran.” Time to Heal Iraqi’s have been through so much intergenerational tragedy and pain. From Saddam’s brutality, the first Gulf war, the poverty of the sanctions, the “shock and awe” bombing campaign of the 2003 American war, the US occupation, the decade of civil war and militia control, to the ISIS chapter, there is a tragic story in every Iraqi. I have always been concerned for our mental wellbeing, and the psychology of our nation as a whole. Self-care is simply not championed in a society hardened by war(s). Its time for us to heal, both as individuals with the weight of the world on our shoulders, and as a nation. This revolution is a catalyst towards collective healing, a loud declaration that “Enough is Enough. We deserve better!” I believe this is the moment for us to embrace self-care as a political weapon, and to continue to practice widespread community-care, as we are already seeing. We need our protestors to be at their full health and capacity to continue in their struggle. On an emotional level, I have to reflect on the visceral reality of experiencing the revolution from abroad. I’d say that most of us in the diaspora have been completely absorbed, if not obsessed, with what is going on in our motherland. We are living it, body and soul, with the people in Iraq. If it wasn’t for social media, I don’t know what I’d do. It is giving us an opportunity to connect directly with people in Iraq, to share their vision and experiences. This is in complete contrast to the one-dimensional and one-sided images that came out of the Iraq war in 2003 from embedded journalists. I am very careful not to look at disturbing and traumatizing videos and pictures. I simply cannot. I find those videos to be very destructive, and I believe that, in many cases, they are undignified and irresponsible, especially to those of us who carry trauma in our DNA. Its time we start empowering ourselves and our people by showing the strength, courage, beauty and joy of our struggle. Whats interesting to me is that this struggle isn’t only significant for people who live their daily lives in Iraq. This revolution is also for those of us outside of Iraq, who are displaced or exiled, always longing to return, living in our nostalgias and traumas. It is for the Iraqis that have been robbed of a land to return to, of a homebound future to lay claim to. It is for the Iraqis, like me, who gave birth to children in far away countries, whispering into their ears that they are Iraqi despite the fact that Iraq is an illusory, mythical place plagued by war and instability. Just the other day, my 6-year old son asked me: “Mama, will you take me to Baghdad? Is the war over now?” That night, I sent him to sleep with a bedtime story based on the true events of the Iraqi revolution, and how our heroes are on the ground there fighting for their rights, and our rights too. Perhaps my dream of taking my small children to Iraq in my lifetime isn’t a pipe dream, after all. Within this collective consciousness that has been brewing, the joy is palpable, in the peoples smiles from beneath their blue surgical masks. You can hear it in the chanting of thousands of people in unison. You can see it in the care the countrymen and women are showing each other. Similarly, you can spot hypocrisy and smell corruption from a mile away. Things aren’t so difficult to understand anymore. The narrative isn’t complicated and blurred so as to confuse you. It’s simple. We want a nation. And no band-aid solution will do. Perhaps the system for us hasn’t been imagined yet, and it is brewing in the hearts and minds of the people in the struggle. This is historic; and Iraq is on the eve of a new independence day. There will be a lot of work ahead, and as in all healing work, things may get worse before they get better. Most importantly, I believe we need to hold space for the youth that are sacrificing their lives to this struggle. We need to honour the lives of the people killed, to know that their lives were not lost in vain. To give the last words to the beautiful young man Safaa Al-Saray, one of the martyrs of this revolution: “I want a beautiful Iraq A clean Iraq I want all of Iraq to live in peace with a life of dignity For I love my people, and I love that Iraq has come out. And I will go out, and go out.”"
Medium.com,Society,"Violence in Gaza as Israeli Army Wounds Dozens of Protesters, Gaza Rockets Hit Israel",World,https://medium.com/citizen-truth/violence-in-gaza-as-israeli-army-wounds-dozens-of-protesters-gaza-rockets-hit-israel-76c9ef0c59de?source=topic_page---------79------------------1," On Friday afternoon approximately 100 Palestinian border demonstrators in Gaza were wounded by live Israeli ammunition, rubber-coated metal bullets and tear gas canisters at five border locations in the eastern Gaza Strip, according to the official Arabic-language Palestinian News Agency (WAFA. More than 50 protesters were treated at local hospitals for injuries sustained from the live ammunition after the Israeli army opened fire on thousands of protesters during the 81st weekly protest since the launch of the Great March of Return in March of 2018. Border protests across the tiny coastal enclave, which is ruled by the Islamist Hamas party, have become a weekly practice for tens of thousands of Gaza residents. Demonstrators assert the Palestinian people’s right of return to historical Palestine and demand the lifting of a 12-year-long Israeli blockade of the Gaza territory. According to the Gaza-based Palestinian Health Ministry, the Israeli army has killed over 350 Palestinian border demonstrators and wounded about 30,000 others, since the Great March of Return’s launch in 2018. Israeli media sources confirmed that later on Friday in the evening several local Palestinian rockets were fired into nearby Israeli areas, including the adjacent Sderot town. The Jerusalem Post reported (JPost) that the Israeli defense system, known as the Iron Dome, intercepted at least seven rockets that fell on Sderot and other areas. An Israeli elderly woman in her sixties was injured and transferred to a local hospital for treatment, while a number of local Israeli residents were treated for shock, added the JPost. Meanwhile, the Israeli online website Ynet reported that several cars with shattered windscreens were seen in the town of Sderot, but no significant injuries were reported. “When we got to the street there was a lot of hustle and bustle, there were several cars with shattered windscreens,” Israeli paramedic Alex Kusinov, who was called to a home hit by the rockets, told Ynet. The current wave of violence in the Gaza Strip came less than 24 hours after the Israeli army’s artillery struck a border watch outpost that belongs to the ruling Hamas party in northeastern Gaza. Israeli army sources said on Thursday that the artillery fire on the Hamas post was in response to a rocket that was fired from Gaza into a nearby Israeli area. No Palestinian armed resistance group in Gaza has claimed responsibility for the latest rocket fire into Israel. Ynet reported on Friday that Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, who also serves as Israel’s Defense Minister, met with top security and military officials in order to weigh an Israeli retaliation to the present escalation. Israel held the Islamist ruling Hamas party, which does not recognize Israel, as responsible for the rocket fire from Gaza. For the past month, the region has been relatively quiet and seen a lull in violence, except this past Tuesday when the Israeli army knocked down a small locally-produced drone that hovered over Gaza. The outburst of violence comes only a few days after the ruling Hamas party expressed a readiness to hold Palestinian elections. The western-backed Palestinian President, Mahmoud Abbas, of the rival Fatah party, had earlier called for such elections in a bid to end a 12-year-long political split with the Islamist Hamas. “Hamas is ready for a partnership and alliance with all those who agree and meet with it in the face of the Israeli occupation and the advancement of our Palestinian national project,” Hamas’ spokesman Abdel Latif Al-Qanu said. One year after Hamas won 70 percent of the seats in the Palestinian parliament seats during the 2006 elections, Hamas took over Gaza and ousted the rival Fatah party from the coastal region. The two major Palestinian parties have signed several reconciliation deals, the latest of which was on October 2017 in Cairo. Yet, none of the deals have been realized on the ground. With both parties at odds, Israel declared Gaza a “hostile entity” and has imposed a blockade on Gaza since 2007. Israel has also carried out a series of major military attacks on the two million residents of Gaza, under the pretext of stopping rocket fire from Gaza into nearby Israeli towns.

Medium.com,Society,Iran:Khamenei confesses to the strategic deadlock of his regime,World,https://medium.com/freedom-star/iran-khamenei-confesses-to-the-strategic-deadlock-of-his-regime-d401965b5d02?source=topic_page---------80------------------1," November 4, 2019 -On Sunday, at a meeting with a group of students, Ali Khamenei, the supreme leader of the Iranian regime, made remarks on the current state of the regime and made policy recommendations for his officials. Interestingly, what Khamenei say-and didn’t say-tell much about the strategic deadlock that is closing in on his regime and the unsolvable crises he’s faced with. Remarkably, missing from Khamenei’s remarks were the ongoing uprisings in Iraq, where hundreds of thousands of protesters have been calling for the ouster of the Iranian regime. Last week, as protests raged in Iraq and Lebanon, Khamenei hastily called on the nations to “remedy the insecurity” and said, “The people of Iraq and Lebanon should know that their priority should be security. The peoples of these countries should know that their demands can only be met in the context of legal structures.” Predictably, Khamenei’s remarks only further enraged the people of Iraq, who have revolted against the meddling of his regime in their country. In response to Khamenei’s “recommendations,” the Iraqi youth and people set fire to his posters and pictures of Qassem Soleimani, the notorious commander of the terrorist Quds Force. Videos of protesters spitting and throwing shoes at pictures of Khamenei were widely distributed on social media. On Sunday, Iraqi protested stormed the Iranian regime’s consulate in Karbala, a Shiite-majority city that has been under the negative influence and meddling of the regime in the past years. Khamenei’s silence on Iraq in his Sunday speech speak volumes on the lesson the Iraqi people taught him in the past week. What Khamenei did discuss only underlined his desperation about the current situation his regime has found itself in. A considerable part of Khamenei’s remarks was about negotiations with the U.S., which has now become a serious issue for his regime. Khamenei confessed that in the current situation, if the Iranian regime enters negotiations and gives in to the demands of its international counterparts, the establishment will receive a serious blow. But in the same breath he admitted that not entering negotiations will mean that there will be no change in the current situation, and his regime will remain on the path of slow and painful suffocation under international sanctions. Regarding the U.S., Khamenei said, “They won’t give you any concessions. They will just force you to back down and claim that we forced Iran to kneel and the maximum pressure policy was successful.” Reflecting on the results of possible negotiations, Khamenei eloquently articulated the current deadlock of his regime: “If we entered negotiations, the Americans would push for the issue of our missiles… If our officials accepted this, the country would receive a serious blow, and if they didn’t, the current situation would continue.” But the supreme leader of the mullahs’ regime didn’t finally say what his decision would be, and whether he wants to enter negotiations or not. For the sake of having said something, Khamenei repeated his old mantra: “The key to solve the country’s economic problems is the prosperity of national production.” But how will Iran achieve prosperity in national production? Hassan Rouhani, the president of the regime, answered this question for Khamenei in October during a speech at Tehran University. “They say that, economically, we should stand on our own feet… Without any relations with the world, and while our banks and exports are locked down, we will have no development,” Rouhani said, implicitly mocking Khamenei. In Sunday’s speech, Khamenei, who has a talent in speaking vaguely, tried to distance himself from the failure and consequences of the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA), the nuclear deal the regime reached with world powers in 2015 and committed to setting caps on its nuclear program. “Recently, although I knew it wouldn’t work, but to try it out and make everything clear to everyone, I said that although the Americans have erred in withdrawing from the JCPOA, if they remove all sanctions, they can take part in the JCPOA. But I knew they wouldn’t accept, and this is what happened,” Khamenei said, implicitly admitting that his influence within his own ranks is waning. The U.S. withdrew from the nuclear deal in May 2018 on grounds that it doesn’t do enough to prevent the Iranian regime from obtaining nuclear bombs and curbing its destructive policies in the Middle East region. The withdrawal happened as the past few years have shown that the Iranian regime has used the economic benefits of the nuclear deal to fund its ballistic missile program and ratchet up its terrorist intervention in the countries of the Middle East. The U.S. has imposed sanctions on the Iranian regime’s terror and weapons development apparatus and is calling for an agreement that will ensure peace and security. On the same day that Khamenei was discussing his regime’s crises, Javad Zarif, the foreign minister of the regime was busy giving his own account of the unsolvable problems of the regime in the Majlis (parliament). Responding to MPs about the lack of progress on the JCPOA and negotiations, Zarif said, “What I said was nothing less than what [Khamenei] said. If he wants, we will negotiate. I do not speak of my own will.” Zarif also reiterated his devotion to the regime and its leader, saying, “Look at what the U.S. Secretary of State has said. I’m renowned for being a defender of the establishment. You have heard what the U.S. State Secretary has said about me, which is my honor… After years of living in the west, I’m not enamored of negotiating with the westerners. “ Meanwhile, Zarif warned that not negotiating will result in the return of pre-JCPOA UN Security Council resolutions, and he implicitly blamed Khamenei for anything that happens to the regime, saying, “If you have any concerns, you should criticize the policies that have been defined. I only carry out the policies of the establishment.” The supreme leader and foreign minister incriminating each other and issuing contradictory remarks on the same day is just the latest manifestation of a regime that is in the throes of collapse. While Khamenei tried to dissociate himself with any failure pertaining to negotiations, his record paints a totally different picture. In 2015, while Zarif and Rouhani were in the midst of hammering the final details of the JCPOA, Khamenei tried to take credit for the entire process and presented himself as the initiator of the negotiations through “one of the respected members of the region.” He also described the nuclear negotiations as “heroic flexibility” and claimed to have managed every single detail of the entire process. But now that the JCPOA and the idea of negotiating with the west is falling apart, he’s trying to lay the blame on the president and his foreign minister. This effort will only drive a wedge through the widening rifts in his regime. The other reality is the regime’s collapsing hegemony in the region, especially in Iraq and Lebanon, countries that Iranian officials have described as the “strategic depth” of the regime. As the avalanche of protests continue to bear down, Khamenei and his regime find themselves increasingly cornered and without a way out."
Medium.com,Society,The Century of Humiliation: the Shaping of Modern Chinese Nationalism,World,https://medium.com/@dennis.writing/the-century-of-humiliation-the-shaping-of-modern-chinese-nationalism-27dfb361fa87?source=topic_page---------81------------------1," L
ord George Macartney and his entourage, weary after having braved the oceans for almost a year, finally set foot on the emperor’s summer quarters. With as much order and pomp they can muster, the entourage paraded up the stairs to a small wooden palace, marching up the eight significant steps leading to the structure. They clutch the many gifts and wares in hand and waited in the sizzling summer heat as sweat dripped down their brows. It was only after many hours that their will wavered, and they returned to their quarters.

During the following days, mountains of gifts were exchanged by the English to the Chinese. English wares included rugs, wool, and many scientific and mechanical wonders that the nation had to offer — backed by its burgeoning industrial might. China provided many of its coveted goods such as velvet, silks, jade, porcelain, and tea. However, despite this outward show of pomp and friendship, Macartney’s China expedition would be doomed for failure.

Central to this encounter between the East and West were the contradictions in culture and expectations. Macartney departed Portsmouth, England, aboard three ships in 1792 to start his expedition in the hopes of negotiating with China to open up long-term trading opportunities for the English East India Company (The Immobile Empire, Alain Peyrefitte). For the Chinese — on the other hand — this visit was simply an ordinary foreign embassy, which arrived in Beijing to give gifts to the great Qing Empire.

The Qing officials, dressed in long robes made of silk and decorated with motifs of animals, wearing a red hat and hair tied up in a queue, greeted Macartney and his priest interpreters. The two parties negotiated at the emperor’s summer residence (Yuanming Yuan), a majestic oasis representing the zenith of Chinese imperial garden and palace design 800 acres in size.

A sticking point for Macartney’s embassy is a matter of ceremony. Notably, Macartney insisted that he would not perform the “kowtow” to the Qianlong Emperor. Despite his great admiration for the prosperity and civilization of the Qing Empire, he viewed Qianlong as an equal to the king of England, entitled only to the same show of respect. He insisted that he not prostrate himself before the emperor as to distinguish powerful England from a small tributary state like Korea. Faced with the stubborn Macartney, the Chinese officials agreed.

It was, for example, expected that Chinese tributary states like Vietnam and Korea come to the throne not to impress, but to give gifts in exchange for legitimacy. By prostrating oneself to the powerful Qing empire, foreign visitors, in reality, strengthened the Qing’s right to rule China. By recognizing the supremacy of China — the eminent power in Asia — the ambassadors would recognize the dominance within their own smaller countries. Lord Macartney and his entourage did not hold these expectations. The day arrived when Macartney was to have an appointment with the Qianlong emperor. Macartney entered his hall, carrying above his head a jewel-encrusted golden box containing a letter from King George III. By his account, he ascended the steps to the throne and knelt on one knee as agreed, instead of performing the kowtow. Qianlong’s eyes were “full and clear, and his countenance open,” much to the surprise of Macartney, who expected a “dark and gloomy” demeanor (Imperial Twilight: The Opium War and the End of China’s Last Golden Age, Stephen R. Platt).

Macartney felt overcome by the elaborate spectacle of the audience tent, with its rich tapestries, carpets, and lanterns, “disposed with such harmony,” he wrote in his journal. This encounter reflected what he wrote as “that calm dignity, that sober pomp of Asiatic greatness, which European refinements have not yet attained” (Imperial Twilight: The Opium War and the End of China’s Last Golden Age, Stephen R. Platt).

However, Macartney had no idea how deeply he had offended the emperor with his negotiations. Shortly after his embassy with the Qianlong emperor, the emperor would send an edict expressing his “great displeasure” with the British, declaring that he would no longer show them any new favors and that they will be escorted out of Beijing (Imperial Twilight: The Opium War and the End of China’s Last Golden Age, Stephen R. Platt).

“When foreigners who come seeking an audience with me are sincere and submissive, then I always treat them with kindness,” Qianlong wrote. “But if they come in arrogance, they get nothing.” Macartney’s and all of Britain’s requests were doomed (https://chinachannel.org/2018/05/18/macartney/). Trade, to Qianlong, was in exceptional hands, and there was no need to change more than a century of precedent to please one country. In words that would sting the British for a generation, he added, “Strange and precious objects do not interest me. . . . We possess all things. I set no value on objects strange or ingenious, and have no use for your country’s manufactures.” Our Celestial Empire possesses all things in prolific abundance and lacks no product within its borders. There is, therefore, no need to import the manufactures of outside barbarians in exchange for our own produce. — Qianlong Emperor, Second Edict to King George III of Great Britain, 1792 Since imperial times, the Chinese have viewed the outside world as barbaric, including Macartney and his company from England. China was the center of the universe, and it demanded the respect that was fitting for its wealth and abundance. European countries had, throughout the 19th century, wished to gain access to Chinese goods, but was abrogated by the Chinese. The West’s frustration with China’s non-conformist attitude continues today, with countries like the United States condemning the Asian giant’s trade policies. Similarly, Britain in the 18th century was increasingly frustrated with its trade deficit with China. Driven by the country’s obsessions with tea — one of China’s main exports — the trade gap was seen as problematic by British policy-makers (British Foreign Policy in an Age of Revolutions, 1783–1793, Jeremy Black).

During this time in the 1800s, tea was the rage in the English market; however, the East Indian Company struggled to find a product that would pique the interest of Chinese traders — that is until they discovered the usefulness of opium. British traders soon arrived in troves to Canton with ships loaded with opium, slowly fueling an epidemic that would engulf China. The East Indian Company was able to supply the drug to China backed by its host country’s vast colonial domain. The English finally found a good that the Chinese wanted — and the Chinese wanted it at an unprecedented scale.

The opium crisis would spur the emperor to appoint viceroy Lin Zexu to eradicate this national malady. Lin quickly arrested Chinese opium dealers, demanding that foreign firms turn over their stocks with no compensation. When they refused, he stopped trade altogether and forced the merchants to surrender their opium, where Lin destroyed some total of 1,000 tons in a process that took 23 days. Tensions slowly rose until a series of events led to Britain firing upon Chinese civilians, using gunboat diplomacy, and starting the country’s century of humiliation. C
hina’s humiliating defeat during the First and Second Opium Wars was a wake-up call for the country’s intellectuals. Despite having existed for thousands of years, never has the nation’s cultural history been threatened to this extent. This event was the start of China’s Century of Humiliation (百年国耻), forever printed in the Chinese historical and political psyche. The Opium Wars were started by Western nations because they wished to exploit China’s abundance of resources. Their incursion is truly a seminal moment in Chinese history — a dividing line between the country’s imperial past and revolutionary future. Aroused with nationalism in the face of foreign invasion, intellectuals within the country advocated for a series of new political and technical modernizations to catch up with the advancements of the West. Only through modernization could the country protect its people, culture, and resources. The self-strengtheners were a group of individuals who, appalled by the incursion of British influence over China, envisioned a stronger homeland. They dream of national rejuvenation propelled by the integration of new technological knowledge so that the country can fend off the West’s gunboat diplomacy. However, they were mostly unsuccessful as China plunged into even darker depths after the first two Opium Wars.

As head of the Grand Secretary during China’s Self-Strengthening Movement, Woren believed Westerners to be evil. They should not teach Chinese youth because they “not only set fire to the [Yuanming Yuan] and destroyed it but also indiscriminately murdered civilians.” (Sources in Chinese History, Atwill). He continued by writing that Westerners “have always been [China’s] enemies,” causing “humiliation [that] [was] unprecedented.” (Sources in Chinese History, Atwill).

After a terrible defeat by the British during the First Opium War, Chinese leaders were forced to sign a series of so-called “unequal treaties” that put the country into greater subservience to the West. The very identity of the Chinese civilization was at risk. The unequal treaties were only the start of the series of humiliations that China experienced. Later in the century, China would experience higher numbers of foreign incursions as well as internal revolts. After the end of the Opium Wars, China underwent other historically significant events such as the Taiping Rebellion, defeat during the Sino-French War, Defeat in the First Sino-Japanese War, the British Invasion of Tibet, and many more. All of these events resulted in losses of resources, culture, and territory for the Chinese government. Most important at all, these defeats stung the ego of Chinese society; having once been a great civilization, these humiliations were unthinkable. It was only until the end of the Second World War and the ascendance of the Chinese Communist Party over the Nationalist Party (that fled to Taiwan) that the country slowly regained its footing. In the 1920s, Chinese nationalists began spinning the arrival of Western gunboats as the cause of all the country’s problems. Chairman Mao also blamed Western aggression for China’s decline. And so emerged the narrative of China as a victim that can still be heard today, even as the country casts off its loser status (https://www.economist.com/books-and-arts/2011/10/29/be-careful-what-you-wish-for). China has turned the Opium Wars into a founding legend of its struggle for modernity. The Century of Humiliation serves as the basis for much of China’s political rhetoric and Chinese nationalism. The Chinese pride themselves in China’s long history and centrality in world affairs. Only until the rise of the Communist Party did the country start to regain its footing on the international stage. For Chinese, instead of calling the country’s meteoric rise as the “rise of China,” they see it as the “return” of China. Any future developments and conflicts between China and the West (especially the United States) should consider the historical memory of the Chinese. Nationalism arising from history can be a constraint or catalyst for political decisions. When faced with a tough political choice, for example, nationalism may force the government to take hardline or hawkish attitudes in its foreign affairs. Domestic nationalism is an attitude that needs to be balanced by political leaders.

Notably, in recent history, events concerning tensions between China and its East Asian neighbors have sparked dramatic events in Chinese cities. Vigilantes and mobs took to the streets in protest of the installation of missiles in South Korea, boycotting Korean goods. In another case, during a time of animosity between China and Japan over island territory disputes, Chinese mobs took to the streets to smash Japanese-made cars.

During the age of Xi Jinping, Chinese nationalism is on the rise. State-sponsored patriotism is very much a resource dispensable to the state, and in no way is it in short supply. In the context of US-China tensions, nationalism is a tool used by both the Chinese party-state and American governments to galvanize the populus, galvanizing the public to strengthen its resolve.

Chinese people may see political pressure from the United States as a new form of incursion by a foreign power, evoking memories of the humiliation that the country suffered during the Opium War. Not only is the United States a foreign power, but it is also one that has fought two wars with China in the last century (the Korean and Vietnam Wars). Chinese citizens are starting to discuss more the relevance of these two wars in public discourse midst the current tensions between the two countries (in Chinese, called the War to Resist America and Aid Korea 抗美援朝战争).

How will political leaders from both sides of the pacific reconcile with Chinese nationalism, and will the hardline attitudes of citizens become a roadblock in reconciliation? This question remains to be answered by experts."

Medium.com,Society,Should data analysis help determine foreign policy decisions?,World,https://medium.com/@Rashmee/should-data-analysis-help-determine-foreign-policy-decisions-587d2dfdb360?source=topic_page---------83------------------1," In 1998, Madeline Albright, then president Bill Clinton’s secretary of state, described the United States as “the indispensable nation”. In 2019, Russia is said to be becoming an indispensable nation, particularly in the Middle East. And last week, a new Atlantic Council report titled Global Risks 2035 defined a “new bipolarity” — the result, it said, of competition between the US and China. All of the above are valid in terms of a superficial assessment of the shifting contours of global power. But empirical means — that is to say, data analysis — can throw up a slightly different picture of international relations. Some of the metrics of foreign policy data analysis actually suggest that America had less power, even during its era of unquestioned dominance, than is generally thought. What is more, data analysis shows that some of the foreign policy tools used by the US for more than 70 years were neither particularly sharp nor forceful. Consider some of the work done by CPost, the Chicago Project on Security and Threats at the University of Chicago. CPost’s founder, political scientist Robert Pape, researched economic sanctions and examined the outcomes of more than 115 cases of economic sanctions since the First World War, not just by the US but other countries or regional blocs as well. He found that sanctions worked very well for easy goals such as trying to cut a trade deal. But for tough foreign policy aims such as regime change or requiring a country to pull back a military offensive, Mr Pape found sanctions worked less than 5 per cent of the time — and in about 5 per cent of cases, they resulted in “catastrophic failure”. He cites the example of Japan in July 1941, South Vietnam in 1963, Iraq after 1990 and Iran’s current defiance of the US. Tuesday marked a year to the day since the US imposed what it described as “the toughest sanctions regime” ever on Tehran to “alter Iran’s behaviour” and persuade it to change its policies, including support for regional militant groups and the development of long-range ballistic missiles. It could be argued that Iran hasn’t changed its ways very much in the months since the reimposition of sanctions. Data-analyst political scientists might even say that the tough curbs on Tehran’s economic activity have actually moved the needle closer to risk-taking actions that Mr Pape sees as similar to the desperation of Tokyo in 1941, before the Pearl Harbour attack. All of which suggests that data analysis could help inform difficult foreign policy decisions, simply by showing that the usual tactics do not necessarily produce the desired outcomes. So, why isn’t data analysis more of a factor in the 21st-century practice of diplomacy? The inertia of habit, perhaps. Or, more particularly, the mindset that regards data analytics technologies and techniques as best suited and most useful to commercial sectors, in order to enable organisations to make informed business decisions and maximise profits. Change is underway, even if it doesn’t make headlines and certainly not the front pages. CPost itself has been around 15 years and other governmental and think-tank initiatives have come to incorporate data analysis in foreign policy. One of the more significant examples is the Finnish government’s support for something it calls “the potential of big data’s contribution to diplomacy”. In 2017, Finland organised two events in Geneva, over the span of several months, with the aim of generating dialogue about “the potential, limitations and challenges related to big data for foreign policy”. One of the reports summarising the deliberations acknowledged that “big data can be extremely helpful for international affairs [because it] can pinpoint trends, patterns and correlations”. But it also cautioned against the “limited predictive power” of data. “The volatility of international affairs,” the Finnish foreign ministry report noted, “can hardly be summarised into all-explanatory formulas and causal patterns are generally hard to uncover.” It said this was mostly because of confirmation bias and because data often “over-represents those who have access to the internet and digital devices”. Caveats are all very well, but the Finnish data-in-diplomacy venture throws up interesting insights. For instance, Graham Nelson, head of the Open Source Unit of the UK Foreign and Commonwealth Office, offered examples of how data helped identify trends in world affairs, helping his unit corroborate or challenge long-held assumptions. And Rafael Prince, a secretary at the Brazilian embassy in Helsinki, who holds a doctorate in the area of big data analysis, highlighted his work on large-scale text analysis to better understand multi-stakeholder negotiations in the Internet Governance Forum. Both argued for data analysis in the realm of international policy, even though Sini Paukkunen, the Finnish ministry’s head of policy planning and research, stressed that diplomacy will continue to adapt but the average diplomat “is most likely better with narratives than with numbers”. Data merely adds another element to the traditional approach to history ­- dates, people in power, wars, treaties — the required knowledge base of those who practice diplomacy What all of this means is obvious. Nearly 60 years ago, EH Carr delivered six lectures at Cambridge University on the question: “What is history?” The series was later published in book form. Carr examined historians’ influence on our understanding of the past, the nature of historical facts and the subject matter of history. He too offered caveats about bias but because he lived in a different time, Carr didn’t suggest data analysis as a tool to understand historical trends. But data merely adds another element to the traditional approach to history ­- dates, people in power, wars, treaties — the required knowledge base of those who practice diplomacy. Data uses numbers to compute correlation, but not necessarily causality, from historical events. It is not foreign policy by numbers but it uses a different statistical language to highlight the previously unregarded lessons of history."
Medium.com,Society,U.S. Military Admits for First Time That China Is Selling Lethal Autonomous Drones,World,https://onezero.medium.com/u-s-military-admits-for-first-time-that-china-is-selling-lethal-autonomous-drones-b5c02f4b1329?source=topic_page---------84------------------1," .S. Secretary of Defense Mark T. Esper spoke out against China’s sale of highly autonomous drones on the international market for the first time today, calling into question China’s previous position that autonomous robots were dangerous and posed a “humanitarian concern.” “As we speak, the Chinese government is already exporting some of its most advanced military aerial drones to the Middle East, as it prepares to export its next generation stealth UAVs [unmanned aerial vehicles] when those come on line,” Esper said today during a conference organized by the National Security Commission of Artificial Intelligence. “In addition, Chinese weapons manufacturers are selling drones advertised as capable of full autonomy, including the ability to conduct lethal targeted strikes.” This is the first time a top U.S. official has spoken about China’s sale of lethal autonomous drones, even though it is suspected that the machines have been sold to countries in the Middle East since at least late 2018. Chinese state media has publicized the availability of autonomous lethal drones for months. The rhetoric highlights concern from within the administration about China’s military A.I. ambitions, and highlights the DoD’s sense of immediacy in grappling with how China is spreading its autonomous technology across the world. Two Chinese companies backed by government funds have been widely identified as vendors of lethal drones. Ziyan, which partnered with the Chinese ministry of public security last year, sells drones that can be outfitted with guns or bombs. State-owned Chinese Aerospace Science and Tech Corporation has also shown off its autonomous aerial weaponry. The Chinese government has not publicly endorsed the use of autonomously lethal robots and state officials partially endorsed the Stop Killer Robots campaign, a worldwide organizing effort to ban such machines. That said, China has not condemned the research and development of autonomously lethal drones, and never indicated it would ban the technology from use on the battlefield. The U.S. military has used human-controlled and semi-autonomous drone strikes in seven countries to date, sparking international outcry. The Department of Defense spent $7 billion of its 2018 budget developing the technology. It has also sold unarmed surveillance drones to allied countries in the South China Sea. Esper also cast China’s use of artificial intelligence as a tool to impose authoritarian rule over its population, especially Muslim Uyghurs. “All signs point to the construction of a 21st century surveillance state designed to censor speech and deny basic human rights on an unprecedented scale,” he said, urging the A.I. community to stop enabling Chinese firms’ unethical use of the technology. “Equally troubling are the outside firms or multinational corporations that are inadvertently or tacitly providing the technology or research behind China’s unethical use of A.I.,” he said. “Our collective security must not be diminished by a short and narrow-sighted focus on economic opportunity.”"
Medium.com,Society,Syria: Peacemaking or prosecutions?,World,https://medium.com/@hcobban/syria-peacemaking-or-prosecutions-b8ee1f1a2db2?source=topic_page---------85------------------1," On October 30, representatives of Syria’s government, opposition, and civil society came together in Geneva at the inaugural meeting in Geneva of the Syrian Constitution Committee (SCC), the most promising effort yet to negotiate an end to the country’s hyper-destructive civil war. But just the day before the SCC opened, a court in Germany charged two former Syrian intelligence officers, residents of Germany, with crimes against humanity for tortures they allegedly committed in Syria some five years before. Those prosecutions, and the possibility of other similar ones after it, raise the prospect that demands from non-Syrians for one-sided prosecutions for abuses committed during the country’s lengthy civil war could significantly block or delay the chances for ending the war. It is true that, at various stages of Syria’s lengthy, grinding conflict, many on the government side have committed heinous acts. As, too, have many on the anti-government side, including the Al-Qaeda-linked groups of the Hai’at Tahrir al-Sham (HTS), ISIS, the Free Syrian Army, and others. Civil wars are like that. I know. I lived and worked as a journalist in Lebanon for the first five years of the civil war there. In any prolonged (and often fratricidal) conflict of that nature, there may or may not be a strong imbalance of “propensity to be atrocious” between one party and another — but no organization that fights in such a conflict has clean hands. So any project to “seek accountability” for atrocities committed during a civil war is necessarily complex. Moreover, when such projects intersect with efforts to end the war in question — and to turn to building a more inclusive and accountable political order for the future — the results can be even more complex. First, the complexity of the accountability process itself. The case against the two Syrian officers in Germany has reportedly been built in part on evidence contained in the “Caesar” photos, a collection of thousands of photos from military mortuaries smuggled out of Syria by a defector in 2015, and on other Syrian government documents smuggled out by anti-government networks. That information-gathering operation has been centered at the Commission for International Justice and Accountability (CIJA), an organization funded by Western governments that have been strong backers of the regime-change project in Syria. There is no record that CIJA has also been collecting evidence of atrocities committed by anti-government forces in Syria, though extremely gruesome videos and other records of these atrocities are widely available on many different media. There is no record, either, that CIJA has been collecting documentation of the large role that despotic Gulf Arab governments, Turkey, and Western governments have played by sending arms, financing and ideologically motivated foreign fighters to aid the lengthy, violent anti-government campaign inside Syria. There is an evident problem of basic fairness and objectivity in any “Syrian war-crimes prosecutions” project that is dominated by supporters of the regime-change side. Then, there is the matter of how punitive “accountability” efforts interact with peacemaking efforts. Two crucial examples from the 20th century’s “World Wars” can illustrate this. (Both of these are, indeed, linked to Germany’s own history.) The first focuses on a series of events in Western Europe in September 1994. Three months after the D-Day landings, Allied forces were closing in on the German homeland from all directions in what was rapidly becoming a “race for Berlin.” In Washington, there was a heated discussion in the Cabinet over how to treat Germany’s leaders, combatants, and economy once the increasingly likely victory was won. Treasury Secretary Henry Morgenthau, Jr., wanted to shoot all Nazis on sight and destroy Germany’s whole industrial base. War Secretary Henry Stimson argued for a restrained, more forward-looking policy. Morgenthau seemed to be winning the internal argument, and that news got leaked to the Sunday papers. Immediately, the resistance of the German units fighting on the Western Front stiffened. They pushed back and, dealing the Allies a stinging defeat at Arnhem, succeeded in postponing the Allies’ victory by weeks, if not months. (Morgenthau then lost his argument in Washington. See below.) Many of the lessons from that episode in 1944 remain valid today, though with some key differences. Syria is not Nazi Germany. It has not been the expanding, aggressive party in this war, but the party whose terrain has been invaded by others. The Syrian government’s abuses have come nowhere close to the systematic, explicit genocides carried out by the Nazis. And Syria is today the party with the upper hand, militarily, in the war being fought on its national territory. But at a more general level it remains true that if during a hard-fought conflict you keep threatening to inflict harsh punishments on an opponent, then you are likely to keep tensions high and prolong both the conflict itself and the great suffering it imposes on the residents of the war-zone, civilians and fighters alike. (This is the main reason that, as U.S. negotiations with the Taliban in Afghanistan have proceeded, Washington’s previous attempts to punish the Taliban have nearly all been quietly — in my view, rightly — shelved.) It is impossible to have meaningful, successful negotiations over conflict termination with an opposing side on whom you are simultaneously trying to impose harsh punishment. That was true in the negotiations that ended Apartheid in South Africa 25 years ago. And it is still true, today. So, back to Morgenthau and Stimson in 1944–45… Morgenthau, as noted, lost the argument over whether to visit a harshly punitive peace on a conquered Germany and Stimson’s much more restrained and forward-looking vision of helping to rebuild and reform Germany was the one that won the day. Thank goodness. A harshly punitive “peace” had, after all, been the nightmare the victorious Allies imposed on Germany in 1919. And the misery that resulted from that “peace” did a lot to incubate the rise of Nazism… as Stimson and his colleagues in the War Department well knew. In 1945 and the following years, they were running the massive U.S.-led occupation of Western Germany. They worked speedily to rebuild the economy and society in the zones of Germany that they controlled. They implemented deepseated policitical reform. And to complement those moves they held some extremely limited and restrained war-crimes trials at Nuremberg. In the famous first trial at Nuremberg, just 24 top Nazis were indicted. Two had their charges withdrawn, three were acquitted, seven received prison terms, and 12 were sentenced to death. The sentencing and the executions were all completed in less than eleven months. Meantime, the rebuilding of West Germany continued apace, fueled by the large-scale investment Washington made in rebuilding Europe, under the Marshall Plan. And the vast majority of rank-and-file Nazis were reintegrated into the German workforce. (Among most human-rights lawyers, the Nuremberg trials are remembered for the cutting-edge international jurisprudence they pioneered. But for historians of the policies the U.S. occupiers pursued in that era like Bradley F. Smith, what stood out most was how “restrained” and “moderate” the war-crimes trial effort was. Reflecting on the Nuremberg trials in 1977, Smith concluded that the process there “graphically demonstrated that such war crimes tribunals have little of value to offer in dealing with transitions from war to peace.”) Then, there is the variety of roles that relative “outsiders” can play. At the time of the Stimson-Morgenthau disagreement in 1944, Morgenthau’s calls for retribution and punishment had been loudly echoed — or amplified — by the leaders of Britain, Soviet Russia, and France, all of whose peoples had suffered far more greatly from the war than had Americans. Winston Churchill argued that all Nazis should be summarily shot. Stalin wanted to see 50,000 top Nazis executed. It took a relative outsider not still smarting from the wounds of war to push those allies to lay aside their thirst for vengeance. So what lessons can Syrians and others who care about their nation’s wellbeing take from such historical examples? A first lesson is that reaching a robust political agreement that can end or radically de-escalate an ongoing conflict is in itself an immensely valuable goal, one whose contribution to the general human good far outstrips any good that a distant, polarizing attempt to prove a hotly contended moral point can achieve. The longer a war continues, the more destruction and suffering there will be — and also, within the festering petri-dish of war, the great the number of atrocities that will continue to be committed. Of course, for any peace agreement to be sustainable, there must be intentional efforts at inclusion and political reform, otherwise the peace will be brittle and likely to fail. But attaining inclusion and reform is very, very hard in an atmosphere of mutual finger-pointing and blame. In Syria today, as in the Europe of 1945, the role of outside powers is also significant. In today’s Syria it is undoubtedly significant that — though all participants in the SCC conference stressed that this peacemaking effort would be “Syrian-led” and “Syrian-directed” — in fact, the gathering had been convened as a result of the dedicated diplomacy of four key outside parties: Russia, Turkey, Iran, and the United Nations. Given that Russia and Iran are key backers for the Damascus government and that Turkey has acted as the indispensable supporter and backstop for all the regime-change parties, these governments (and the U.N.) all wield considerable influence on the SCC participants. We should therefore hope these governments, and all governments and peoples around the world who want Syria’s terrible internal conflict to be brought to an end, will use their influence to focus on the forward-looking goals of achieving peace and rebuilding in Syria, rather than on demands for endless retribution. Syria’s people have suffered enough from this war."

The UK — The Government should urgently resume attendance at EU meetings where irregular migration is discussed and seek to maintain a cooperative voice with EU partners after Brexit, a report of the Foreign Affairs Committee reads. It is criticizing the European response to the “migration crisis”, and sends strong and clear messages. “We are particularly concerned by the serious and systemic abuses perpetrated against migrants in Libya. EU deals with this country have achieved the short-term political “win” of cutting migrant numbers, but at the cost of fuelling human rights abuses, strengthening armed groups, and undermining stability in the longer term. The dominance of the Home Office in this area risks focusing policy on the domestic goal of limiting migration to the exclusion of broader UK foreign policy goals. The UK should address the wider, interlinked factors driving irregular migration — including climate change, conflict, repressive governance and corruption — rather than focusing narrowly on reducing the numbers reaching Europe’s borders in the short term. “ A policy that focuses exclusively on closing borders will drive migrants to take more dangerous routes, and push them into the hands of criminal groups. “The case of 39 people found dead in a lorry container in October — though detailed information is still lacking — is a horrific illustration of these dangers. It should serve as a wake-up call for the FCO, and Government more broadly, to reassess its approach to irregular migration.” Read the entire report here."

The northernmost point of Marsabit County has recently seen a boon in fortunes following the completion of the Isiolo-Moyale Highway in 2017 and strengthened Kenya-Ethiopia integration: what was once a troubled frontier town is becoming a focal point in the rising tide of East African trade. Outside of the town itself, Moyale and North Horr Sub-Counties are sparsely populated, largely by nomadic pastoralists. Societal norms in these communities — which have recently seen serious violence across the porous border — are often patriarchal. This creates a challenging situation for women and girls, whose education is not culturally prioritised and whose input in traditional forums is not always accepted. When water, pasture and security are urgent priorities, issues which adversely affect women are not always paid the attention they deserve. “The issue that is putting women behind, being a nomad way of life that we are living in Marsabit County, is the cultural context where a man can marry more than one wife. So, if he marries the second wife, he can leave the first one and his children without taking care of their needs, without taking them to school, without caring for them totally.” — Safia Ibrahim Safia Ibrahim, 29, is a paralegal with Alliance of Local Communities in Hardship Areas (ALCHA) and a local of Butiye Ward. Ms. Ibrahim describes how the combination of a religious perspective and both the place of women and lower literacy rate relative to men in nomad communities mean that when it comes to issues such as rape, abuse or neglect, women often suffer in silence. Beyond the headline-grabbing ethnic and pasture-driven violence, one of the less reported but highly damaging aspects of nomad life on the Marsabit frontier is paternal abandonment. Amina Ture of Odda, on the outskirts of Moyale town, is a mother of four. After relations broke down with her husband, Ms. Turre fell into financial hardship as he neglected to continue to support the family financially, whilst she struggled to balance both providing for and caring for her children. “I paid a visit to their offices and I shared my problems with them, and afterwards they called my husband and spoke to him about my four children… He was told by ALCHA to be paying the monthly bills, and I am now getting money sent monthly to the office. That’s how they have directly supported me.” — Amina Ture Promoting Legal Aid and Assistance for the Poor and Marginalized is a project run by ALCHA and supported by UNDP to address issues such as that faced by Ms. Ture. ALCHA trains paralegals from local areas and mobilises them to increase awareness of legal aid and assistance, run civic education programmes in rural communities, and conduct outreach visits to pick up on injustices faced by women and girls in particular that may be going unheard. Typically, ALCHA provides free services such as mediation or drafting of court documents and liaise with County Government authorities to solve problems. ALCHA’s impact in Moyale and North Horr Sub-Counties has been significant and varied. Including Ms. Ture’s case, 36 families where there were issues of paternal neglect are now receiving upkeep as a result of ALCHA mediation; over 300 secondary school pupils have been trained on human rights promotion and protection mechanisms; 274 community members received legal assistance through drafting of agreements by ALCHA paralegals; and significantly, 2 primary school-age girls in Golbo ward were rescued from early forced marriage and are now continuing their education. Hussein Borbor, Project Coordinator for ALCHA, has seen the best and worst of life on the frontier. Although his house was among the first to be burned down amidst intercommunal violence in 2013, Mr. Borbor stayed in Moyale to continue his work. Today, he speaks glowingly of the commitment and impact of ALCHA’s team of predominantly women paralegals, and stresses that the project’s work is far from complete. Hiring a private process server will increase the efficiency of legal assistance, Mr. Borbor says, and more office space will afford women who come forward the confidentiality they deserve. Both Ms. Ibrahim and Mr. Borbor are clear in their commitment: ALCHA’s presence as members of the local community, native Oromo-Kiborana fluency and knowledge of traditional power structures such as the Gada system means that they can promote access to justice for women and girls, even where others can’t."

Medium.com,Society,US to redeploy troops to Syrian oil fields,World,https://medium.com/@themillennialsource/us-to-redeploy-troops-to-syrian-oil-fields-9009205a56d2?source=topic_page---------89------------------1," On October 24, US Secretary of Defence Mark Esper revealed at a North Atlantic Treaty Organisation (NATO) press conference in Brussels that the US would redeploy troops to oil fields in North-Eastern Syria in order to defend them from ISIS. The announcement from Esper, who has been US Defence Secretary since July 2019 and previously served as United States Secretary of the Army, is a reversal of President Trump’s earlier command to withdraw all US troops from Syria and represents another fluctuation in rapidly shifting US foreign policy in Syria. Esper confirmed that there would be a US military presence at the oil fields in North-East Syria. The redeployment will include troops previously scheduled to leave Syria as well as ‘mechanized forces,’ which may include armored vehicles and tanks. The redeployment of the forces will supplement the existing force of approximately 200 lightly armed troops already stationed at the oil fields. “We are now taking some actions to strengthen our position and to ensure that we can deny ISIS access to the oil fields,” Esper added. Alongside the objective of guarding the oil fields against ISIS, Esper also claimed that a US presence would benefit the Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Force (SDF) by giving them access to the revenue and resources involved with the oil fields. “We want to make sure that SDF does have access to those resources in order to guard the prisons, in order to arm their own troops in order to assist us with the defeat ISIS mission,” Esper explained. When making the announcement, which came moments after President Trump tweeted that the troops were coming home, the US Secretary of Defence did not divulge the number of troops that would remain in Syria. The Wall Street Journal reported that as many as 500 soldiers could remain, which USA Today confirmed by reporting that US armored vehicles and 500 infantry troops have arrived in eastern Syria. Alongside additional troops stationed at the oil fields, Trump suggested that US companies could control and manage the sites. “What I intend to do, perhaps, is make a deal with an Exxon Mobil or one of our great companies to go in there and do it properly,” he said. Following the announcement by the US Secretary of Defence, Trump said that “We’ve secured the oil and, therefore, a small number of US troops will remain in the area where they have the oil.” The decision to redeploy troops to the oil fields appears to be part of a broader strategy to contain the threat of ISIS. Lindsey Graham, the Republican senator from South Carolina, said that “there’s a plan coming together from the Joint Chiefs, that I think may work, that may give us what we need to prevent ISIS from coming back around.” Kurdish forces, who were instrumental in stripping ISIS of its territorial gains and military power, suffering 11 000 casualties in the process, welcomed the redeployment of US forces. The Kurds were initially dismayed by the Trump administration’s willingness to withdraw troops from Syria and effectively greenlight a Turkish invasion, calling it a “stab in the back.” Speaking to reporters, Kurdish commander Mervan Qamishli said that “the US presence is good as it is cooperation to eliminate ISIS terrorism and stops foreign ambitions from Syria, Iran, or any others.” Further adding, “We stand with any initiative and from any entity, if it’s serving the north Syrian people.” Russia, a country with significant influence in Middle Eastern affairs, has strongly condemned the move. Foreign ministry spokesman Maj Gen Igor Konashenkov said: “what Washington is doing now, the seizure and control of oil fields in eastern Syria under its armed control, is, quite simply, international state banditry.” Following the redeployment of US forces to oil fields in Syria and the identification of Syria’s oil as a US national security priority, Trump’s suggestion that US companies could control and operate Syrian oil fields has raised concerns. While it is unclear whether the suggestion will become part of US foreign policy, US oil companies would face major hurdles in setting up operations in Syria. Exxon Mobil Corp and Chevron Corp, the two largest US oil companies operating in the Middle East, distanced themselves from the suggestion and declined to comment on the president’s remarks. Republican senator Lindsey Graham supported the suggestion and implied that any revenue or resources garnered from the operation would benefit regional allies. Graham stated that a US presence at the oil fields is a “win-win.” He added that if a US company could “modernize the oil fields,” the Kurdish-led SDF who captured the fields from ISIS “will get more money.” Others have condemned the suggestion. Ryan Goodman, a former special legal counsel at the Department of Defense, likened the suggestion to “the international crime of pillage.” Pillaging is illegal under international law, as per the Geneva Convention, which the US ratified as a treaty in 1955. Goodman added that “US military commanders who engaged in pillaging Syria’s oil would risk criminal liability under the US War Crimes Act.” The laws were designed “to deter nations from engaging in predatory wars to seize other countries’ natural resources.” The Act, introduced in 1996, made it punishable under US law to commit a “grave breach” of any of the Geneva conventions. The suggestion of a US company operating in Syria, coupled with the redeployment of US troops to protect the fields, received further condemnation by a former US general. Retired General Barry McCaffrey wrote on Twitter, “WHAT ARE WE BECOMING… PIRATES?” while highlighting that all oil in the area “belongs to Syria.” Before the offset of the Syrian Civil War, Syria produced approximately 385 000 barrels of oil a day. This number is comparable to the amount of oil produced in the US states of Illinois and Utah. This number plunged by 90% to just 40 000 barrels in 2015. Although Syria is an oil-producing country, it ranks 75th in the world amongst oil-producing nations. Although Syria is an oil-producing country, it ranks 75th in the world amongst oil-producing nations. The oil that it does provide is thought to be of low quality. The oil fields of Syria took on a new significance during the civil war. It is estimated that at least 75% of Syria’s estimated oil reserves of 2.5 billion barrels originate from the fields of North-Eastern Syria. These fields have played a critical role in financially supporting whoever controls them throughout the Syrian conflict. Following the expansion of ISIS in the region, the terrorist organization relied on the oil fields to fund their operations. A major factor in ISIS losing all its territory was the deliberate targeting of these fields by the US and its allies. “A big part of the strategy of defeating ISIS was actually to try to disrupt the oil supply chain, to take out tankers carrying oil, or to destroy any kind of refineries, any sort of ISIS oil operations,” said Jeff Colgan. This is not the first time Trump has shown an interest in the oil reserves of a Middle Eastern nation. During the Iraq War, Trump wanted the US to use Iraqi oil to offset the cost of the conflict. “I said keep the oil,” the president recounted at a press conference on October 27. “If they are going into Iraq, keep the oil. They never did. They never did.”"
Medium.com,Society,Failure to launch: Why Canada Avoided a Populist Turn,World,https://medium.com/@lukelaframboise/failure-to-launch-why-canada-avoided-a-populist-turn-ed764871a06f?source=topic_page---------90------------------1," So, as we are quickly trying to forget, we finished up our most recent election here in Canada a few weeks ago. It went about as well as you can expect for a race that saw the ruling party knocked down from commanding majority to a weak minority. This is despite their main competition being embodied by an outdated conservative stereotype in a cheap suit. As better writers than I have noted ad nasum, this was the Liberal’s election to loss and, well, they did not disappoint. Still, moving on to bigger and better things, I think it is time to have a chat about what was conspicuously missing in this years electoral proceedings, despite being a West-wide worry at the time of writing. Well, aside from all the other things missing that I did an article on a few weeks ago. (Turns out I was mostly right. Broken clocks and all that.) Yes, it is time to discuss the klan member in the room and ask: “Canada, buddy, how did you manage have an election without seeing the far right stream out of the woodwork like a horde of race realist termites?” Yes, it’s time to talk about the Peoples Party of Canada and how they managed to fail despite seemingly all the advantages an alt right party can have. (After this I swear I’ll talk about something other than the election. I promise.) To start with thought though, it pays to discuss how exactly elections work in Canada for those tuning in from abroad or otherwise confused by our northern nation. In Canada, we operate on a bicameral, or two chamber, parliamentary system modeled off of our colonial mother Great Britain with most of the benefits and drawbacks. The basic unit of our democracy is the riding which are individual political sub-groupings that are roughly equal in population to each other. These ridings are each represented by a single member of parliament who are voted in according to a winner take all system in which those with the most votes win. These representatives then serve their riding at their designated seat in the House of Commons, of which there are 338 seats in total. A majority of seats, or around 180 is needed to form an uncontested government, while anything less puts the majority winner of the election into a minority government. This is where the Liberals are now. So, why is this important to understand Canada’s lack of populist uprising? Well, traditionally it has been monumentally difficult to form a party from whole cloth and run it in an election successfully. As each party needs to run a candidate in at least a majority of the 338 ridings in the nation, one already needs a strong core of supporters and the funding to match. Difficult to come across for all but the most determined or rich. Not to say it hasn’t been done though, as the past success of the Reform party and the Bloc Quebecois shows. Still, it is quite a feat to achieve regardless. Of course, then the People’s Party of Canada was formed and did exactly that. I will not go too deeply into the background of the PPC and their herald of the End Times leader Maxime Bernier, as I believe that is best they sink back into the primordial muck that spawned them. Instead, I will focus on what they offered to the electorate before talking briefly about how they spawned. Broadly speaking the PCC offered a populist platform that was anti-immigration, pro-market with a not-so-subtle racist streak a kilometre wide. If any of my European friends are starting to think this sounds awfully familiar, yes you are unfortunately right. What was meant to make the party stand out was their leader, Maxime Bernier. Bernier was a former rising star in the Conservative party of Canada and well known as being that one outspoken member with the French accent. In 2015 Bernier came in second in the Tory leadership race losing to Andrew ‘I-couldn’t-be-relatable-if-I-tried’ Sheer. Instead of bowing out honourably, Bernier decided to start his own party, with populism and supply management abolition! Unfortunately for him, the party did not poll very well even at the time of its formation despite his seeming star power. But, by God, they would try to spread their message of hatred and vague libertarianism if it took them a whole election cycle! Thus, in the run-up to the election Bernier & Co. did there level best to get into to the news and get their name out there as best they could. They even managed to gather up enough candidates to run in every single riding across the nation. This, it must be said, is a notable milestone for a newly minted party, as only the big two parties tend to run that many candidates. It seemed that this would be the election that would see the far right finally make inroads into the Great White North and Mad Max would lead the charge! Unfortunately for the People’s Party, this did not happen. Despite their insistence they spoke for the silent majority and their purloined place in the three officially sanctioned leadership debates, the PCC’s polling numbers barely rose above 3%. If anything, they lost support, as not a single seat was won. Bernier himself was even kicked out of his seat in Quebec, which he had represented for nearly 13 years. His replacement? A conservative. So much for the popular alternative. So here we are asking the obvious question that has might be at the front of most people’s mind, which is why? Why did the PPC fail so badly? I think this is going to be a question that will be continued to asked well until the next election, but I believe it comes down to a number of factors, most of them subjective. Still, I wish to highlight three that most stand out to me. First and foremost, in Canada we have ten provinces and three territories with a population that would comfortably fit in a New York suburb spread across the second largest singularly held territory in the world. What this means is that priorities tend to vary wildly from province to province and the idea of having a uniting ideology is difficult to the point of impossible. What has managed to take root has been a kindergarten level belief system of kindness, politeness and political moderateness that defines our political landscape. Unlike the U.S. with a population to match its landmass, we have decided collectively that things are mostly okay and we would prefer to remain as things are thank you very much. As such new ideas, both good and bad, take much longer to proliferate and, by then, only the most directly harmless tend to remain. We are, in essence, a very conservative nation in socially liberal make-up. A connected factor to this is our policy of multiculturalism which, while it has been criticized on both sides of the political spectrum, has broadly taken root in the national consciousness and has become a key part of the Canadian experience. Even if it has not been fully implemented as it should, but that is another article. It cannot be understated how deeply and unconsciously this is held, but I think the most important facet of this is seen in the Conservative Party who has routinely appealed to new immigrant populations in their campaigns. As it turns out that this has been a winning strategy, with our previous Prime Minister Harper’s majority being built on this foundation. Conversely it was an attempt at being more xenophobically conservative that saw their support crumble in the same election that saw Trudeau’s Liberals rise to power. The and finally third factor that I think sunk any chances of the PCC coming to power in Canada was just simply the facts of the election. Canada, unlike most of the west, has not seen much in the way of political or economic turmoil in the past decade. Unlike the US we weathered the Great Recession reasonably well and quietly rebuilt quite soon after, meaning our foundation has remained relatively strong since. Unlike Europe we also have not seen a major influx of immigration beyond a small blip in 2017. As a result Canadians have not had to consider their political opinions in the same way as other across the West. The joy of a closed off system I suppose. Nothing much changes and, as a result, we do not change our ideas. Of course, all this is stated without bringing up my own home province, but that is a conversation for another day. And a few more drinks than is healthy when one is on a budget. Overall, Canada remains somewhat out of sync with political trends, which has been to our benefit in the past few election cycles. As a result the PCC never really had a chance at breaking into the mainstream in the same way as other right wing populist parties. We simply do not like change up here and our political system is designed to reflect this. Maxime Bernier certainly tried to emulate his peers across the Atlantic, but I think it might have served him better to look closer to home to find his actual influence. in 2016 there as an attempt by another seemingly charismatic leadership candidate, who rose to attempt to lead the Conservative Party after Stephen Harper stepped down. She also tried to bring far right rhetoric into the Canadian conversation. Her name was Kelly Leitch. She was duly laughed out of the party after barely registering once the first votes came in for party leader. Bernier should have remembered Leitch when he struck out to form his own party. Perhaps he would still have his seat in Quebec."

Hong Kong and Taiwan published their third-quarter growth figures very close in time, but the results were far apart. The two share the same global risks insofar as both are open economies affected by the US-China trade war and are heavily dependent on the mainland, whose economy is slowing down. And yet, while both economies grew at the same speed (2.9%), it was in opposite directions: Taiwan positively and Hong Kong negatively. It goes without saying that the Hong Kong economy has been bogged down by social unrest since mid-June, which explains the fast deterioration, but it is also true that both economies were already diverging before the social unrest started. The question, thus, is how was the Taiwanese economy able to perform better not only than Hong Kong, but also than other similar economies such as Singapore or South Korea (the four economies used to be considered the “Asian Tigers” in the 1980s and 1990s)? The first important difference is the absence of monetary and exchange-rate policies for Hong Kong compared with Taiwan. This is not only because of Hong Kong’s currency peg with the US dollar but also because the Taiwan dollar is not fully convertible while the Hong Kong dollar is. In other words, Taiwan has a tighter control of the flows of hot money and liquidity in the financial system. The second difference lies in fiscal policy, and not so much because Hong Kong does not have room to move but rather because it does not use it. In fact, the Taiwanese government, in the light of a worsening global environment, has introduced an Infrastructure Development Program as well as an energy reform plan to introduce renewables, thereby stimulating investment. Hong Kong instead has announced two tiny — especially the second — fiscal stimulus packages (all in all 0.7% of gross domestic product) that aim at reducing the pain that businesses are going through but not so much to invest in the future. Third, Taiwan has seen its foreign direct investment increase substantially this year in areas such as fifth-generation telecom (5G), semiconductors, data centers and new energy. In addition to foreign firms, Taiwanese companies have speeded up their repatriation of profits thanks to supportive government policies. The comeback of domestic investment means a displacement of outward FDI. Last but not least, Taiwan has conducted a conscious policy of diversification of its export structure away from excessive dependence on mainland China, which has helped cushion the impact of economic deceleration on the mainland. The key areas of expansion are the economies of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations and, more recently, the US. In the same vein, although the tourism industry has been hit by restrictions imposed by China, the growth in inbound tourism from Japan, South Korea and ASEAN has remained high. In a nutshell, social unrest is clearly harming the Hong Kong economy but policies exist to cushion the impact, especially fiscal policy. In addition, more structural policies can be used to increase Hong Kong’s attractiveness for foreign investors. The Hong Kong government might want to take note.

However, there are compelling reasons that urge the United States and China to end the trade war as soon as possible.

In other countries, it has also caused economic damage, although some countries have benefited from increased manufacturing to fill in the gaps. Governments of several countries, including China and the United States, have taken steps to remedy some of the damage. The United States mostly logs on private land, with the market determining the price. In 1982, the United States argued that Canada unjustifiably subsidized its softwood. The stalemate led to disputes over many years and continued duties (or levies). Consequences: While Canada should pay hundreds of millions of coniferous wood tariffs in 2018, US consumers faced record lumber prices as the housing industry boomed. Until the Trump administration took office, China had overtaken Japan as the main responsible for the United States. Trade deficit. The President has imposed tariffs and quotas on virtually everything under the sun. As a result, the US is deeply involved in a trade war with China. Ultimately, however, many mercantilist ideas are in favor, believing that the trade deficit is a problem caused by foreigners. For the mercantilists, Japan and China have been the biggest troublemakers in the US in recent decades, making the two largest contributions to the US trade deficit. Since the 1990s, however, China has overtaken Japan as the main cause of the US trade imbalance. As part of its escalation strategy, he threatened to extend his tariffs on 1 October and 15 December. If these changes came into effect, virtually all Chinese imports would be taxed and the average rate would be 24.3 percent, according to Chad Bown of the Peterson Institute for International Economics. It is only possible to guess how the stock market would react to this prospect. Given the interruption of talks this month, it is unclear when negotiations will resume. Both sides have strong economic incentives to make a deal, but every government is currently in a political corner and no side wants to be weak. To reach an agreement this year would be important in view of the upcoming US elections in 2020.

The Midwest states that Trump competed in the 2016 elections and that he must win the re-election. For example, Iowa is the largest producer of soybeans, and Michigan and Ohio have the largest concentration of car manufacturing. Trump wore all three states in the last elections but barely won in Michigan. — Higher risk pricing could lead to a significant diversification of financial flows, for example from emerging markets that are more trade-dependent and generally more volatile. According to the Bank of England, such secondary effects weigh much more on the UK economy than the direct impact of higher tariffs. Businesses should be aware of these risks to the global economic climate that has caused trade disputes, despite the seemingly modest direct impact on global GDP. In a world of global value chains, investment rules, including dispute resolution mechanisms that allow foreign investors to resort to political decisions of the homeland, are part of that set of rules that matter. 15Businesses need to be aware of the impact that these rules and regulations have on their costs as well as their competitive position vis-à-vis competitors. 15Unlike the tariffs, no profit is shifted to governments, but costs are incurred if certain national requirements are met. The entry into force of the Arms Trade Treaty at the end of 2014 further eased the relatively strict legal framework. However, it is the Federal Department of Foreign Affairs (DFA), which has the expertise to assess the human rights situation in the recipient country. If different federal offices come to different conclusions, SECO can submit export agreements to the Federal Council. At one point, the US was considering raising tariffs for car imports from the European Union (EU), but the plans have been postponed for the time being. In July, an agreement was reached by the US and EU authorities to lower tariffs and remove barriers to trade. The North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) was torn but now rescued in the form of the US, Mexican and Canadian Agreements (USMCA). — Until the Trump administration took office, China had overtaken Japan as the main responsible for the United States. Trade deficit. The President has imposed tariffs and quotas on virtually everything under the sun. As a result, the US is deeply involved in a trade war with China. When President Trump took office, one of his biggest economic goals was to reduce and eliminate the US trade deficit with the rest of the world, starting with the huge bilateral deficit against China. The trade report confirms with certainty that the escalating tariff war with China has contained the bilateral US balance of payments deficit between the two countries. However, the US trade deficit with the rest of the world continues to rise. Ultimately, however, many mercantilist ideas are in favor, believing that the trade deficit is a problem caused by foreigners. For mercantilists, Japan and China have been the biggest troublemakers in the US in recent decades, making the two largest contributions to the US trade deficit. Since the 1990s, however, China has overtaken Japan as the main cause of the US trade imbalance. At the Boao Forum in April, China signalled that tariffs on such goods are lowered. Shortly thereafter, China also announced that it would phase out foreign ownership restrictions on automakers. For its part, the US has signalled its readiness to ease sanctions on Chinese telecommunications giant ZTE. The Chinese have already found alternative sources of soybeans and also changed the way they find proteins for their diet, Maclennan Bloomberg said. Trump has introduced tariffs on imported steel and aluminium to rebuild the US metal industry. In other federal states, however, the costs for manufacturers using steel or aluminium in their production processes have increased by double digits. The result is higher prices for companies in the supply chain and ultimately for end users. — The most important imported goods include finished goods, motor vehicles and chemical products. Switzerland has traditionally been at the forefront of liberalizing and facilitating international trade, on which its economy is highly dependent. Other leading export markets are France, Italy, the USA and the United Kingdom. Historically Switzerland was a source of espionage for both sides and often mediated communication between the Axis and the allied powers, acting as a protective power. In 1942, the US Office for Strategic Services (OSS) was founded in Bern. The efforts of Allen Dulles created the first US intelligence service in Western Europe. The founders of the movement had left Germany and Romania to avoid the destruction of the war. At the Cabaret Voltaire in Zurich, they showed their aversion to the war and the interests that inspired him. The artists struggled with abstraction against the social, political and cultural ideas of those times that they thought would have triggered the war. USD 200 million revolving credit facility with DBS Bank maturing on June 30, 2020, as well as term loans from HSBC and Standard Chartered Bank, Singapore Branch. The company had already announced on August 21 that it would no longer pay the capital and interest on the term loans of HSBC and Standard Chartered Bank. Bankers and capital owners in both the surplus and deficit countries have benefited from suppressed wages, rising profits and increased mobility of international capital. Workers in the surplus countries paid the imbalances in the form of lower incomes and devalued currencies. Workers in deficit countries paid for imbalances in the form of higher unemployment and rising debt. Reversing inequality and other distortions in income distribution in both surplus and deficit countries are, therefore, the only sustainable way to end the trade war. — In the United States, the trade war has brought about struggles for farmers and manufacturers and higher prices for consumers. In other countries, it has also caused economic damage, although some countries have benefited from increased manufacturing to fill in the gaps. Governments of several countries, including China and the United States, have taken steps to remedy some of the damage. Since the beginning of the trade war, China has introduced higher tariffs for agricultural products from the US, with the pork tariff increasing from 12 to 62 percent. China hoped it would pressure Trump to inflict pain on US farmers to end his trade war. First, while US farmers are suffering and criticizing the trade war, their support for the president is growing. First, Trump publicly stated that he was worried about his escalation with China. Shortly thereafter, the White House press secretary reversed the course, pointing out that Trump regretted not raising tariffs on China. Then, perhaps to calm the financial markets earlier this week, Trump warned that the United States and China could soon return to the negotiating table. 18The economic importance of these next tariffs is in prospect. The entire manufacturing sector faced increasing uncertainty as to when or whether the trade war would be resolved. Since Trump issued serious threats in a moment and cut a fine figure with Xi Jinping in the next moment, it was difficult for anyone to figure out how things would turn out. The net result of all this was production cuts and shifts in capital investment. The only thing that moved China was the protection of intellectual property, something it did almost half a year before the first shot in the trade war. China has also opened its market to financial services providers, allowing full control over asset management in mainland China. But this was also in work and delayed for years. The main reason is that China does not allow cash flow here. The failure of the United States and China to reach a new agreement on trade would be compatible with this process. China owns just over 5 percent of all US government bonds. Government bonds were still about twice as high as Chinese government bonds during their quantitative easing rounds. The Chinese tariff we face when exporting cars will increase by up to 50 percent. For example, on 1 September the average duty on wood, paper and metal products will only increase from 22.3 to 22.9 percent and on 15 December to 25.7 per cent. In addition, tariff increases in this and most other sectors do not bring new products Chinese products, including medical devices for cancer, from the 25 percent tariffs added on July 6, 2018.

If we continue to believe that the world is better off with liberal democracy than an authoritarian surveillance state, that can not happen. When geopolitical advantage rather than low consumer prices is the desired goal, customs help us to get there. Out of patriotism, we must now be ready to eat our own bitterness."

The smog is generally caused by smoke from brick kilns and factories, farmers burning crop stubble, vehicle exhaust, and waste burning. On November 1, Delhi, India became the most polluted city in the world with an Air Quality Index (AQI) rate of 529. Lahore, Pakistan’s second-largest city, didn’t trail so far behind with an AQI of 300. The news updates of smog and air pollution from Lahore made the rounds on news websites and social media. #LahoreSmog became a trending topic on Pakistani Twitter for a week. Translation: Allah na karay = God forbid, #SaansLenayDo = Let us breathe The smog situation has been a recurring issue in the past decade and poses severe health threats to the population. It has become such an issue that it has been named the Indian Ocean brown cloud, or Asian brown cloud, which describes the layer of air pollution that recurrently covers parts of South Asia, especially in the northern Indian Ocean, India, and Pakistan. The Air Quality Index runs from 0 to 500, where 0 is the lowest measure of air pollution and 500 is the highest level. Any reading between 0 and 50 is an indicator of good air quality while anything above 300 is deemed hazardous. The Pakistani government uses the Met Department and SPARCO’s meter. Amnesty International, along with other international players, has declared a health emergency in Punjab province of Pakistan. It reported: Prolonged or heavy exposure to hazardous air can result in severe health issues including asthma, lung damage, bronchial infections and heart problems, and shortened life expectancy — putting at risk people’s rights to life and to health, as well as the right to a healthy environment. Abid Omar at TEDxLahore digs deep into the air pollution of Lahore, revealing that bad air quality is a problem almost all year round. Studies show that the poor and the lower middle class bear the brunt of the smog’s hazardous impacts as they have to work out in the fields and in the open. They also shoulder the most severe consequences, both economically and health-wise. However, Malik Amin Aslam, the Pakistani Prime Minister’s advisor on the environment, rejected the AQI readings of the international monitors: “The air quality index (AQI) of Lahore was much better than that of New Delhi.” Pakistan’s Minister of Climate Change Zartaj Gul even mentioned that the Azadi March led by Pakistan’s politician Maulana Fazlur Rehman was the top source of smog in Lahore and has negated the ratings of international organizations. “The influx of cars and vehicles coming to the city is the major reason of smog in Lahore”, she said in an interview with media. Social media users clapped back hard at the politicians and the State, accusing them of downplaying the impact of environmental degradation and climate emergency. Social media activists, civil society members, and environmentalists have started campaigning against what they see as the Punjab government’s negligence with the campaign #SaansLenayDo (#Let us breathe). Some are also calling out corporations and demanding they cease their operations. Concerns over the air quality in Lahore have had a snowball effect. Citizens from Karachi, Islamabad, and Peshawar have started questioning the air quality in their cities and are demanding action too.

While most people are tweeting and expressing concern over the grave situation, some are trying to find ways to mitigate the risks. A petition, created by environmentalists, scientists, and medical professionals, is floating around on the internet demanding the government to take corrective action. A group of children have filed a petition in Lahore High Court on November 5, 2019, demanding truth and pressing the government to share the severity of the situation. Many Pakistanis are wondering when the Pakistani government will realize the magnitude of the degradation of air quality in Pakistani megacities and take steps to solve it."

Medium.com,Society,WTO Tells China to Tax U.S.,World,https://medium.com/goods-services/wto-tells-china-to-tax-u-s-89590f25d627?source=topic_page---------96------------------1," On Friday, November 1st, the World Trade Organization (WTO) ruled that China is allowed to put $3.6 billion in tariffs on U.S. imports, bringing this six-year arbitration to an end. It is the first decision that China won in front of the WTO and the third-largest settlement awarded in WTO history. These tariffs are also completely outside of the ongoing trade war between China and the United States, and now everyone is watching to see how they will impact the negotiations. This ruling was not a surprise. In May 2017, the WTO made an initial ruling in favor of China. The WTO determined that the United States was unfairly taxing 40 Chinese products entering the United States market. In November 2019, the list was reduced to 25 items and the damages assessed totaled $3.6 billion. The United States and China are locked in a trade war that started in 2018. Since it began, the two sides imposed more than $735 billion in tariffs on each other, leaving global supply chains in shambles. Right now, the two sides are at the negotiating table working on Phase 1 of a trade deal that would at least prevent this trade war from escalating any further. The potential problem is that China is now legally allowed to put additional tariffs on the U.S., a move likely to upset President Trump. A misstep by China could lead to an abrupt ending to the trade discussions like in May 2019 when talks broke down. The White House said that it is disappointed in the decision because the ruling is not founded in economic principles, but that so far the decision will have no impact on the trade talks. At this point, it is still too early to judge the White House’s response because we don’t know what Beijing is going to do with the decision. If there’s one thing that’s likely about this trade war, it’s that the most likely outcome doesn’t happen. However, it’s important to discuss anyway. China does not want to upset Trump and re-escalate the trade war. Especially after reports came out on November 4th suggesting that Trump may remove some of the tariffs from the fourth tranche. Imposing new tariffs is not in China’s best interest and China always acts in its best interest. Instead, China will take a book from Trump’s playbook and use the tariffs as a stick and a carrot. Not imposing these import duties will be part of the list of concessions that China offers U.S. negotiators as part of the mini-trade deal being discussed. If the two sides reach an agreement, China will not enact these import duties. If the talks fall apart it is possible that China will follow through and find specific industries to attack. But, again, anything can happen. Presidents Trump and Xi were supposed to meet at the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation meeting in mid-November in Santiago, Chile. However, the meeting was canceled because of protests in Chile that are making it impossible for the group to meet. Right now, both sides are trying to finalize the text of Phase 1 of this trade agreement and find a new venue for the meeting and signing ceremony to take place. There is a sense of urgency because the next round of U.S. tariffs on Chinese goods are scheduled to increase on December 15th. These taxes will directly impact consumers and will put a damper on the Christmas purchasing season. Trump is using these new tariffs as a stick in the negotiations with China back and wants to avoid delaying them."
Medium.com,Society,How the Tories Can Win the Next Election,World,https://medium.com/@mahdiassan/how-the-tories-can-win-the-next-election-d2fec70e7b31?source=topic_page---------97------------------1," T
he UK is finally having an election. After months of speculation since Boris Johnson became prime minister, parliament has agreed to go to the polls in December. This time though, the Conservative Party will be keen to avoid the disappointment of the 2017 election. With Theresa May at the helm, the party lost 13 seats whilst Labour gained 30. In order to avoid a similar fate, the Tories will need to succeed with three important elements of their campaign. One of them, inevitably, will be Brexit. The strength of the Tories’ position here is that they have a deal with the EU waiting to be ratified; ‘oven ready’ as Mr Johnson . Thus, with a new Tory majority, the renegotiated Withdrawal Agreement and Political Declaration can be passed swiftly through the House of Commons to complete the first stage of Brexit without ‘dither or delay’. There is a twofold drawback to this. Firstly, opposition MPs can argue that the government was in a position to potentially pass the Agreement prior to calling for an election. The Withdrawal Agreement Bill, or the WAB, passed the second reading last month; this could be viewed as implicit approval of Mr Johnson’s deal. Conservative campaigners will counter this by arguing that opposition MPs were poised to throw down numerous amendments, potentially delaying the process and defacing the deal itself. The second drawback to the Tories’ position on Brexit is that Mr Johnson’s deal is far from perfect. This attack will be aggressively launched by the Brexit Party, whose leader, Nigel Farage, that the deal “reduces the United Kingdom to a status of a colony”. Only if the deal is ditched will the Brexit Party make an election pact with the Conservatives. But Mr Johnson the offer, and perhaps rightly so. Taking it up would rid the Tories of their simple and penetrating message that they can ‘get Brexit done’ with their ‘great new deal’. It may well be the case that Farage’s offer was designed to be rejected anyway, so as to construct the perception that the Tories are merely putting party before country. Furthermore, the current deal with the EU is likely the best that the UK will be able to get. The EU was previously adamant that the backstop, part of Mrs May’s original agreement, was the only way of keeping an open border in Ireland. Mr Johnson’s new deal flips this by turning the backstop into a ‘frontstop’ and an alternative arrangement in itself. This, combined with a consent mechanism supposedly consistent with the Good Friday Agreement makes it difficult to see how the EU could budge further. Yet fighting the election on Brexit alone would not be enough for the Tories. Such an attempt in 2017 failed because, at that time, the Brexit issued had been temporarily settled. The referendum had been held the year before producing a leave result, Article 50 had been triggered and negotiations were set to begin soon after the results. Accordingly, there was not much for the Conservative Party to offer on the issue other than to ‘deliver Brexit’, a pledge that most voters expected from candidates. It was therefore nothing unique, and the attempt to centre the election around Brexit exposed the Tories’ poor domestic offering. While the election may be somewhat different this time, Brexit is still in many ways a conglomerate of domestic issues rather than a single foreign policy issue. The Labour Party will try to break Brexit down into a number of sub-issues associated with the reasons why people voted for Brexit in 2016. This will include, among other things, the NHS, schools and the police. The more that the election focuses on these issues, the more comfortable it will be for Labour. As such, the Tories should give careful attention to their domestic offering to complement their position on Brexit — so far they seem to have done. An advantage has already been obtained by the Conservatives gearing up for an election for some time. Their commitments on Brexit and funding for the NHS have swirled around social media and the press for months. Such policies can also help to tackle the party’s age-old image as the ‘nasty party’ that does not care about ‘ordinary people’. This angle is something that Labour will be keen to promote. The final part of a successful election campaign was also missing in 2017: an effective digital strategy. Many commentators have pointed to Labour’s of social media to capture the imaginations of young voters during and after the 2017 election. This is largely due to the party inspiring its voters to become activists, greatly increasing Labour’s presence on various platforms by delegating much of the digital groundwork. This would certainly be one way to get around Twitter’s recent on political advertising. The Tories should look to do the same. Mr Johnson’s use of Facebook to livestream the “People’s PMQs”, where voters can ask questions of the prime minister directly, is a good start. But the Conservatives must be careful to not use too much of their online presence to attack Labour and the other opposition parties. Giving voters positive reasons to vote Tory in December will be far more useful. Plus, a successful digital strategy along these lines will be especially important since the winter months will likely reduce the frequency of political canvassing. Even with these three elements — a strong Brexit policy, a convincing domestic agenda and an effective digital strategy — an election is still highly risky for the Tories. But, as a fellow Backbench commentator has , an election now may be the only way to move the country forward. The Conservatives better make the most of it."
Medium.com,Society,Britain’s Long Goodbye to a Conservative Party,World,https://medium.com/@luketmurphy/britains-long-goodbye-to-a-conservative-party-8f743d240a6e?source=topic_page---------98------------------1," “Hanging on in quiet desperation is the English way The time is gone, the song is over, Thought I’d something more to say.” Pink Floyd, 1973 T
he Conservative Party is the most successful political party in modern history. They are considered by many, and nearly all within it, to be the natural party of government in Britain. If you were to guess the party of government at a random point in the past century then it would likely be the Conservative Party. It dominates. Today, the party has been in power for more than nine years. So as we enter a general election and the final year of the party’s most recent decade in charge we must ask ourselves a question: Was that it? There is something about the Conservative Party that other parties lack. The smell of competence clings to it. No matter the events that may occur, voters consistently feel the Conservatives would do a competent job of managing the country, protecting me and my family, ensuring adequate stocks of toilet paper, the dead to be buried and for the trains to run on time. This is the idea of competence and, when reviewing a government’s behaviour it sits alongside another idea — morality. Morality and competence. These two labels are how many will think about government. For example, some might say that Margaret Thatcher was ‘immoral’ to transform the economy the way she did because of the accompanying pain. But few would argue she was incompetent doing it. Ed Miliband had a few moral policies people might have agreed with. But he lost because he was considered something approaching incompetent. For a long time, the Conservatives were seen as competent enough to win four general elections in a row from 1979 to 1992. But morality soon caught up with them. During 13 years of opposition, the party, by its own admission, had an image problem: “There’s a lot we need to do in this party of ours. Our base is too narrow and so, occasionally, are our sympathies. You know what some people call us — The Nasty Party.” Theresa May MP, October 2002 They were perceived to be immoral. Competent? Probably. Moral? Probably not. And that was why they lost three general elections in a row from 1997 to 2005. David Cameron’s tried to change this. He changed the logo and didn’t wear a tie. He went sledging in the Arctic and suggested he wanted to hug a hoodie. But the party he led in government for six years and which Theresa May and Boris Johnson took over, lost both its morality and competence. Now, it is the nasty party and an incompetent party. Here is why. There has been a terrible sense of drift and decay since 2010. There has been no purpose in government, no vision and no direction. Cameron tried to conjure up something with ‘The Big Society’ but that was exposed as a slogan for the unpopular idea of getting individuals to do stuff for free that government used to do through taxation. The economy was the number one priority in 2010. The country was in danger of sliding into recession. This single danger was avoided. But the economy wasn’t transformed and it wasn’t improved. There was no innovation, it didn’t become more productive and despite near-zero interest rates, there was no serious or long-term investment or strategy. Instead, there was a single, deep and violent cut made down the economy and across society that strangled the lives of the vulnerable and stirred great anger in high streets, libraries, Sure Start centres, schools, hospitals, online and on the wet cardboard where spiralling numbers of homeless people live. This economic policy of the Conservative Party, known as ‘Austerity’ is shorthand for a state organised and top-down action of accelerating decay in a country that rots more now than at any point for forty years. 75% of British people live in places that are poorer than the European average. What can the Conservative Party say they have achieved during nine years in government? Often the headline is the upgrade of civil partnerships to gay marriage. But this law was passed only with the support of the rest of Parliament, and a majority of Conservative MPs voted against it. The passing of the gay marriage law was a Cameron passion project that actually revealed how un-modern the rest of his party was. The other headline policy was taking the lowest earners out of income tax. This was a Liberal Democrat policy. In nine years, the Conservative Party seemed most comfortable when participating in national pageantry such as Royal Weddings, various anniversaries of the Monarchy, creating a new 50p coin for 31st October Brexit which must now be destroyed, and suggesting that a serious response to Brexit would be to build a massive yacht so we can sail to China, ask to trade independently with them whilst somehow not reminding everyone of the Opium Wars. A 19th century, analogue and born to rule mindset defines most of the party’s thinking with the most exciting ideas simply a belch of the old, like grammar schools or fox hunting. For a party that shouts about its traditional Christian values, nothing was stopping Cameron accepting a number of child — or God forbid — adult refugees similar to other major European countries. But instead, at the height of the Syrian refugee crisis in late 2016, when refugees needed it most and leadership was paramount, the UK had given asylum to just 2,898 individuals, which was slightly higher than the average home attendance at Stevenage Football Club. Then after much kicking and screaming, Cameron announced the UK would take “up to 20,000 over five years.” Even a glance at the New Testament would suggest helping your neighbour would mean doing more — and not moaning about it in the first place. But there was no decision-making framework inside the current version of conservatism that suggested it was right or even competent to be more compassionate. As Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher famously and competently said: “You turn, if you want to, the lady’s not for turning.” When she did turn, over the Poll Tax riots, the party replaced her with someone they thought was more competent. The current Conservatives are the opposite. It was for this generation of Conservatives that the word ‘omnishambles’ was popularised after successive U-turns on its budget in 2012. When they finally achieved a majority in 2015, and the shackles of the coalition were thrown off, Cameron made the U-Turn his signature move making 24 policy reversals in 12 months. The Conservatives couldn’t make decisions because they had no ideas. They were incompetent. The story of incompetence and immorality in the current Conservative Party is longer than anyone would have liked: The list could go on. In the end, we can reflect that nine years of Conservative government has seen neither the forceful competence of Thatcher in the 1980s, the radical domestic reform of the 19th Century, or the consensus minded Conservatism of the mid-20th Century. The party has nothing to say and is happy with being in power for its own sake. It is intellectually and morally bankrupt. Maybe UKIP and The Brexit Party will go away. Maybe they will stick around. But these two parties have succeeded in filling the Conservative vacuum with its own ideas. Faced with these pressures, Prime Ministers David Cameron and Theresa May surrendered the most traditional and conservative of principles — pragmatism and non-dogma. For the first time since Corn Law repeal in 1846, the party built an altar. And on this altar, it would sacrifice everything else to a minor god called Brexit. There is no firm ideology to be conservative. There are feelings and traditions, like ‘small government,’ ‘freedom of the individual’ and ‘free enterprise’. Sometimes you might struggle to translate it into practice, but you know it when you see it. What has changed is the idea of Brexit has destroyed pragmatism and the feelings and traditions the party cherished. It has become what it used to ridicule — student socialists tearing their hair out over who has the most correct view. The Brexit crisis has come at the worst time with the party already asleep at the wheel. By destroying the last links between the Conservatives and ‘getting things done,’ Brexit has accelerated the long goodbye to a party that has given up on both morality and competence. This is not Conservatism. It is not even Thatcherism. It is the fundamentalist and extreme zeal shown, most dangerously, by late converts to the revolution that now compete with each other to be the midwife of the one pure idea — Brexit. Feeding off the ideas of UKIP and The Brexit Party, the Conservatives are shrivelling into the same tiny band of zealots that drive all revolutions towards the one right and glorious endpoint in history. And now, after more than nine years in power can we say the UK is a better, more efficient, more equitable, richer, healthier, safer, stronger, happier or more well-run country? Can we say that it is a place that benefited from the behaviour of the Conservative Party? At this Christmas election, they may well return to government. If so, we can all hope their idea-less and arrogant blundering mixed with their new and compulsory long march to Brexit somehow does not."

Not until 2018 did it publicly reveal the economic value of its socially conscious decision to its investors. That’s because corporations and investors often misunderstand the valuable relationship between investment performance and social impact, argue Harvard Business School luminaries Michael Porter, George Serafeim, and Mark Kramer in their essay, “Where ESG Fails.” Many companies operate on the faulty premise that the image of “doing the right thing” — irrespective of its material value — attracts more investors than the action’s impact on a financial bottom line, argue Porter et al. Likewise, socially responsible investors evaluate companies based on their Environment, Social, and Governance (ESG) rankings or a Socially Responsible Investment score. Yet the authors point out these measurements have been developed without regard to company growth or profits and consequently fail to make the causal link between a company’s social impact and its bottom line. “Much of the investment community,” say the economists, “still views social issues either as irrelevant to maximizing shareholder value or merely as a risk factor, not as an opportunity to drive alpha.” The authors propose a new approach: a deliberate profit-driven social impact, what they term “shared-value” to advance socially responsible investing. “Companies that successfully implement strategies to create shared-value can deliver superior shareholder returns,” the authors report. Shared-value strategies create a “virtuous cycle” where intentional decisions to improve communities and the environment generates higher profits for shareholders to reinvest in a self-reinforcing loop. What does this mean for development practitioners? The shared-value approach for investors presented by Porter et al. makes a strong case for private-sector engagement in the international development arena. Just as securities analysts and corporations misunderstand the valuable relationship between social issues and maximizing profits, many in the development community cling to a related myth that private sector, profit-driven objectives run counter to development and humanitarian outcomes. Below are five reasons why development practitioners should embrace market-based solutions with a shared-value approach to achieve greater development and humanitarian outcomes at scale: 1) Development is profitable — and that’s not a bad thing. The top performing Change the World companies listed in Fortune magazine from 2015 to 2017 did not have the highest ESG scores; rather, they intentionally tied the social and environmental causes they supported to their business strategy. As a result, they outperformed the MSCI World Stock Index by an average of 3.9 percent in the year following publication. 2) Corporate profits generate social benefits. Companies that create shared value can outperform their peers while delivering excellent returns, both to society and to their shareholders. For example, South Africa-based life and health insurance company Discovery offered economic incentives for customers to engage in healthier behaviors. Studies by the RAND Corporation and Johns Hopkins University confirmed that Discovery’s incentives reduced health care costs, increased life expectancy, and generated superior profits tied directly to the social impact wedded to Discovery’s business model. 3) Market-based solutions offer greater financial inclusion. MasterCard made the Fortune Change the World list by creating new products and entering new markets through its innovative financial inclusion initiatives. MasterCard partnered with the South African government to distribute social benefits to 10 million people through its debit cards. By tying financial inclusion to its business strategy, Mastercard created and secured a competitive position for itself in the industry. They delivered a social benefit directly tied to increased shareholder returns. 4) Shared-value investing drives innovation. Driven by a social commitment to reduce waste, Nike developed a running shoe unlike any other, with a top knit from a single strand of material. The shoe produced zero waste, and it was also less expensive to manufacture and lighter and more breathable than other shoes, delivering superior performance for customers and more than $1 billion in sales for Nike. 5) Enterprise-driven development expands opportunity for all. Increased private-sector engagement in the field of development could rejuvenate the social purpose of investment. Rather than extracting short-term profit for the few at society’s long-term expense, or invest via algorithm-driven strategies and trade on market movements as ends in themselves, a shared-value approach in the development field could reconnect the positive relationship between capital investment and the improvement of society. The future of international development is enterprise-drive. The creation of the U.S. International Development Finance Corporation (DFC) is based on this premise, and international development finance institutions around the world are also embracing more market-based solutions to development challenges. “When a social need can be tackled with a profitable business model, the magic of capitalism is unleashed,” the Harvard economists conclude. “Answers to the many deeply rooted societal problems we face become self-sustaining and scalable. Actual solutions to society’s problems are in reach.”"
Medium.com,Society,Is China An AI Security Concern?,World,https://medium.com/datadriveninvestor/is-china-an-ai-security-concern-393ff8ab604e?source=topic_page---------100------------------1," This past week, the Interior Department ordered the grounding of its drone fleet that was made in China or contained Chinese parts. This comes on the heels of similar actions taken by the Department of Homeland Security in May and the United States Army in 2017. While political pundits credit the ban to the Trump administration’s policy initiatives against the Asian superpower, many cybersecurity analysts cite legitimate security concerns. As a result, there is a bipartisan bill pending, The American Security Drone Act of 2019, to ban all federal agencies from using any Chinese-made aerial vehicles. As Senator Richard Blumenthal explains, “Like it or not, drones are our future. Without Congressional action, adversaries like China and Iran will use drone technology as tiny Trojan Horses to spy on our government, our critical infrastructure — even our hospitals and homes. This bill will ensure that we don’t send China and others a gold-plated, flying invitation to steal our intellectual property, undermine our domestic technology, and spy on our communities.” For years, China has manipulated the internet and mobile technologies to spy on its own citizens and restrict free speech. Akash Kapur of the Wall Street Journal reports that the communist power has deployed a policy of “digital sovereignty” to limit its citizens’ access to the global community which it deems as an existential threat. The “Great Firewall” strategy has been embraced by many other autocratic regimes in creating their own filters, such as North Korea’s Kwangmyong network, Iran’s “Halal-net” and Russia’s Runet. Vladimir Putin recently signed the “sovereign internet bill” that effectively implements a kill switch to block the public internet from Russian users. In response, many American tech companies have willingly complied with requests to limit cyber liberties. Last month Apple removed the “HKMap Live app” used by pro-democracy protestors from its app store at the request of the Chinese government. Tim Cook apologetically reasoned, “It is no secret that technology can be used for good or for ill. This case is no different. The app in question allowed for the crowdsourced reporting and mapping of police checkpoints, protest hotspots, and other information. On its own, this information is benign. However, over the past several days we received credible information, from the Hong Kong Cybersecurity and Technology Crime Bureau, as well as from users in Hong Kong, that the app was being used maliciously to target individual officers for violence and to victimize individuals and property where no police are present. This use put the app in violation of Hong Kong law. Similarly, widespread abuse clearly violates our ‌‌App Store‌‌ guidelines barring personal harm.” In May the conflict between the United States and China came to a head with the national emergency executive order signed by President Trump banning the government from using “telecommunications equipment that pose a risk to national security.” The initiative was a subtle reference to the accusations of spying by Chinese chip manufacturer Huawei on American and European users. For years, cybersecurity analysts have reported security holes and software errors in Huawei products that potentially enable nefarious activity. Many have reasoned that these backdoors are deliberate openings for China’s immense security apparatus to spy on Huawei users domestically and aboard. While there is no proof of specific acts, the CIA stated in April it has evidence of financial dealings between the manufacturer and China’s military. According to reports Huawei “has received funding from branches of Beijing’s state security apparatus… American intelligence shown to Britain says that Huawei has taken money from the People’s Liberation Army, China’s National Security Commission and a third branch of the Chinese state intelligence network.” The tension between China and the West has direct regulatory implications on the global innovation of unmanned systems, especially as more autonomous machines connect to the Cloud. According to the Office of the Director of National Intelligence: “We are going to have to figure out a way in a 5G world that we’re able to manage the risks in a diverse network that includes technology that we can’t trust (e.g., Huawei). You have to presume a dirty network.” The current state of tech paranoia started two years ago when Chinese President Xi Jinping presented his “China Dream” of world technology dominance by 2030, specifically in the areas of artificial intelligence and robotics. This has led to a spending boom by almost every Chinese agency in acquiring talent, research and intellectual property. Professor Amy Webb of New York University complains “We are being outspent. We are being out-researched. We are being outpaced. We are being out-staffed. We have failed and are continuing to fail to see China as a militaristic, economic, and diplomatic pacing threat when it comes to AI.” She further suggests that President Xi “sees artificial intelligence as an integral point in shifting geopolitics and geo-economics.” Webb points to the fact that the Asian superpower’s R&D budget is three times the size of the United States. Professor Webb’s sentiment was echoed by Elsa Kania of the Center for a New American Security who claimed, “the city of Tianjin alone plans to spend $16 billion on AI — and the U.S. government investment still totals several billion and counting. That’s still lower by an order of magnitude.” The investments made by the Chinese extend to US startups in the form of capital infusions into AI and mechatronic innovations, many that originated in the Defense Department’s grant system. An unclassified report entitled China’s Technology Transfer Strategy by the Defense Innovation Unit Experimental (DIUx) states that “Chinese participation in venture-backed startups is at a record level of 10–16% of all venture deals (2015–2017) and has grown quite rapidly in the past seven years” from 6% participation a decade earlier. The study asserted that “the technologies where China is investing are the same ones where U.S. firms are investing and that will be foundational to future innovation: artificial intelligence, autonomous vehicles, augmented/virtual reality, robotics and blockchain technology.” The DIUx authors caution the exuberance of founders whom receive Chinese cash as “these are some of the same technologies of interest to the Defense Department to build on the technological superiority of the US military today. The rapidity at which dual-use technologies are developed in the commercial sector has significant impact on the nature of warfare; mastering them ahead of competitors will ensure that we will be able win the wars of the future.” As Ms. Kania puts it, “[The People’s Liberation Army] is exploring the use of AI to enhance command decision-making capabilities, seeking to achieve decision superiority on the future battlefield.” The solution recommended by the DIUx is to upgrade the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States (CFIUS) to limit investment through systematic assessments of deals versus on a case-by-case basis. Furthermore, having strict export controls on technology transfer and investments to include early stage technologies could prevent adversaries from acquiring the “Crown Jewels of US Innovation.” While the Cold War between the Soviet Union and the United States ended in 1991, the recent federal edicts and boycotts should be seen through the prism of an “AI arms race.” As a Chinese government official affirmed, “By 2030, we shall make artificial intelligence theory, technology, and application at the world’s leading level. [China will] be the major artificial intelligence innovation center of the world.” Already, an Australian news service released a worldwide rating of country AI capabilities with the United States scoring 33 out of 100 and China rising to number 17. This statistic is compounded by the 2050 forecast that China’s Gross Domestic Product will be $105 trillion or 150% the size of the United States. However, I am reminded that the American success story is not necessarily a numbers game based upon our ability to churn out PhDs and engineers. US inventors should be invigorated by the narratives of Franklin, Edison and Jobs to paraphrase the immortal words of Robert Barr, ‘the American is most to be feared; he uses more ingenuity in the planning of his projects, and will take greater risks in carrying them out, than any other on earth.’"

Dorsey A podcast version of this story is available on Soundcloud, Itunes, Spotify, Stitcher, TuneIn, Spreaker, Pocket Casts, Tumblr, Podbean, Audecibel and Castbox. Shaping a new world order is proving to be about a lot more than power. The rise of the civilizational state and of civilizational rather than national leaders is calling into question the concept of sovereign nation states. That is evident in the consequences of the civilizationalist assault on minorities ranging from the Kurds in Syria and Turkey to Muslims in China, India and Myanmar to Islamophobia and mounting anti-Semitism in the United States, France and Hungary as well as sectarianism in the Middle East. Democracies legally enshrined yardsticks of non-discrimination and equality irrespective of creed, ethnicity, colour, gender and religion but never succeeded in truly enforcing those principles. As a result, civilisationalism’s assault spotlights the long-standing failure of the nation state, evident from the moment it was conceptualized by the 1648 Treaty of Westphalia, to give true meaning to guaranteeing the security, safety and rights of all its inhabitants irrespective of creed, colour, race, ethnicity, faith or gender. The rise of a critical mass of civilizational leaders, including China’s Xi Jinping, Myanmar’s Win Myint, India’s Narendra Modi, Russia’s Vladimir Putin, Hungary’s Victor Orban and US president Donald J. Trump makes a rethink inevitable not only of the functioning of democracy but also of the concepts of the nation state and sovereignty that have structured world orders for close to 500 years. Many of these leaders conceive of their societies and/or states as defined by civilization and its reach into akin Diaspora communities rather than by legally recognized borders, population within those borders, and language. Civilisationalism has allowed China to extend its reach in the South China Sea beyond internationally recognized borders at the expense of other littoral states as well as to Diaspora communities across the globe. It also provided the basis on which China has so far successfully imposed its views on others whether its acceptance of its one-China policy or silence, if not acquiescence, in repression in Xinjiang. Civilisationalism has further enabled Russia to recognize breakaway states in Georgia, annex Crimea, and spark violent conflict in eastern Ukraine. In some ways, the nation state, designed to put an end to religious wars in Europe, paved the way for a revival of civilisationalism by godfathering exclusionary politics that were based on a determination of who belonged and who did not belong to a nation, a question which civilisationalism answers by legitimizing supremacism, racism and prejudice. From the outset, newly conceived European nation states sought to build nations by not fully embracing those it believed were not truly part of their nation. The nation state’s exclusivity, rather than as a result of the Westphalia treaty pulling the curtain on an era of European wars, sparked another round of armed conflict intended to fortify newly found national identities. Today, reconceptualization of the nation state and the notion of sovereignty has become an imperative with civilisationalism adopting exclusivity as its battle cry and the nation state’s centuries-long inability and unwillingness to negotiate mutually workable arrangements that take account of aspirations and identities of societal groups that feel excluded. Reconceptualization would need to be geared towards guaranteeing individual and minority rights based on an international legal framework that is enforceable. Failure to do so would likely usher in an era of disruptive societal tension, marginalization and disenfranchisement of minorities, flows of mass migration, radicalization and increased political violence. A recent International Institute of Strategic Studies (IISS) report concluded that China was advising countries confronting political and economic instability, sometimes sparked in part by Chinese project-related corruption, to adopt its model of brutally cracking down on any expression of dissent like in Xinjiang. China, according to the report, is also advocating implementation of its system of social control, involving the use of invasive Chinese artificial intelligence-based surveillance technology, reducing media to parrots of government policy, and firewalling the Internet. China is further training governments in ways of disrupting opposition activity. China’s view of economic development as a way of countering what it sees as cultural drivers of extremism underlies its effort to Sinicize Turkic Muslim Islam in Xinjiang and is implicit in Chinese aid to countries in the Middle East. Mr. Xi announced in July of last year US$20billion in loans to Middle Eastern nations as well as US$106 million in financial aid for Palestine, Jordan, Lebanon, Syria and Yemen on the back of Chinese assertions that finance would help resolve the region’s political, religious and cultural tensions. “China is increasingly proactive in its response to instability in developing countries. It is now more forthright in its advice to partner countries and is proactive in promoting Chinese solutions to other countries’ problems,” said Nicholas Crawford, the IISS report’s author. China’s policy prescriptions, elements of which are being adopted across the globe, is likely to perpetuate problems inherent to exclusivism propagated by both civilisationalists and nation states that are more concerned about perceived threats to their territorial integrity or constructed collective identities than aspirations of groups that are part of their societal fabric. The rise of civilisationalists, autocrats, authoritarians and illiberals, including Mr. Xi, does not bode well for Eurasia, a region pockmarked by groups whose rights have been repeatedly violated by various civilizationalist leaders as well as exclusionary nation states concerned about challenges to their territorial integrity or constructed collective identities. “Geopolitics is no longer simply about the economy or security… The non-Western world, led by Beijing and Moscow, is pushing back against the Western claim to embody universal values… The rejection of Western universalism by the elites in Russia and China challenges the idea of the nation state as the international norm for political organisation… The new pivot of geopolitics is civilisation,” said political scientist Adrian Pabst. A tour of the world’s flashpoints proves the point. The flashpoints include predominantly Kurdish south-eastern Turkey, what is left of the Kurdish enclave in northern Syria, Rohingya rotting away in Bangladeshi refugee camps after fleeing ethnic cleansing in Myanmar; the plight of Turkic Muslims in Xinjiang and Catalan efforts to democratically decide whether they want to remain part of Spain. They illustrate the fact that the failure of the nation state to build truly inclusive and cohesive societies coupled with the rise of the civilizational state and civilizationalist leaders portends a new world order that is likely to be characterized by individual and collective rights abuse that heightens societal tensions and aggravates disputes and conflicts. “The global order provides more mechanisms for states to deal diplomatically with each other than with the people inside them,” noted scholar and author Malka Older. The civilizationalist threat to individual and minority rights is enhanced by its insistence on collective adherence to an overriding ideology whether that is the Chinese communist party’s concept of absolute control of anything and everything cloaked in ultra-nationalism and concepts of unique Chinese characteristics; Russian Orthodoxy cemented in the alliance between church and state; or Victor Orban’s conceptualization of a Hungarian nation that is homogenously white and Christian. In a recent study of religion and tolerance in the Middle East, widely viewed as perhaps the religiously most intolerant part of the world, political scientist Michael Hoffman concluded that it is not religion that in and of itself breeds intolerance and prejudice. Instead, Mr. Hoffman suggested that Muslim attitudes towards the other differ sharply between believers who pray collectively in a mosque and those who worship in private. Private prayer “does not contain the same sectarian content as communal prayer,” Mr. Hoffman noted, implicitly pointing a finger at autocratic authorities who in the Middle East often exercise tight control of what is said in the mosque. “The group identification mechanism is not present for private prayer; since private prayer is fundamentally an personal phenomenon, it does not cause believers to distinguish more sharply between their own sect and others and therefore does not produce the intolerant outcomes associated with communal worship,” Mr. Hoffman went on to say. Mr. Hoffman’s research, despite its focus on the Middle East, spotlighted in an era of rising civilisationalism the risks to universal basic human dignity as well as individual and minorities rights in directly or indirectly imposing collectivist beliefs that drown out the political, ethnic or religious other. The silver lining in what are bleak prospects may be Mr. Pabst’s conclusion that “neither the Western cult of private freedom without social solidarity nor the totalitarian tendencies among China’s and Russia’s elites can nurture resilient societies against the disruptive forces of technology and implacable economic globalisation… (Yet) across different civilisations there is an inchoate sense that the purpose of politics is the free association of people around common interests and shared social virtues of generosity, loyalty, courage, sacrifice and gratitude. The practice of such virtues can bind us together as citizens, nations and cultures beyond colour, class or creed.” Dr. James M. Dorsey is a senior fellow at Nanyang Technological University’s S.

Medium.com,Society,The UK seeks answers about 39 unidentified bodies found in Essex lorry container,World,https://medium.com/@themillennialsource/the-uk-seeks-answers-about-39-unidentified-bodies-found-in-essex-lorry-container-d8dfeea5b774?source=topic_page---------104------------------1," Thirty-nine bodies were found in a refrigerated truck in Grays, Essex, about 25 miles outside of London, in the early morning on October 23. The Essex police confirmed that eight of the deceased were female, and 31 were male. Thirty-eight victims were adults, while one body was believed to be a young adult woman. According to a statement from the Essex Police department, they were likely victims of human trafficking or smugglings. On October 24, the Essex Police confirmed the traveled routes of the truck. Its tractor unit left Dublin, Ireland, and entered the United Kingdom via Holyhead on October 20. The trailer had traveled from Zeebrugge to the port of Purfleet, where the tractor collected it and left at 1:05 on October 23. The bodies were found in the truck shortly after. The Essex police department has launched an investigation into the deaths and alleged human trafficking ring. So far, they have made five arrests and issued warrants for two others. The truck driver, whom the Essex Police identified as Maurice Robinson, 25, was arrested following the discovery. On October 28, he was charged with 39 counts of manslaughter, conspiracy to traffic people, conspiracy to assist unlawful immigration, and money laundering. The Essex Echo reported that he was not asked to enter a plea and did not request release on bail. On October 25, three others were also arrested — Joanna and Thomas Maher, a married couple, both 38, from Warrington, England, and another man who has not been named, 46, from Northern Ireland. The three were arrested on suspicion of manslaughter and conspiracy to traffic people, although it is unclear how they are linked to the 39 deaths. All three of them were released on bail on October 28. On October 26, Irish police officials arrested a 23-year-old truck driver at Dublin Port. The Belgian police said he had transported the refrigerated container from Ireland to Belgium before the bodies were found on its return journey to the United Kingdom. The Essex police confirmed that he was a person of interest in the murder investigation but did not provide further details. On October 29, the Essex Police identified two other suspects — brothers Ronan Hughes, 40 and Christopher, 34 from Armagh, Northern Ireland. They are wanted on suspicion of manslaughter and human trafficking. Essex Police initially claimed that all 39 victims were Chinese nationals, but later said that “it is now a developing picture.” On November 1, the Essex police announced that they now believed all victims were Vietnamese nationals. Up to 14 families in Vietnam have reported missing relatives, whom they fear to be among the victims, according to state-run news outlet Vietnam Plus. After the news from Essex, a screenshot of text messages that are believed to be a victim’s last words to her parents spread rapidly on Facebook in Vietnam. Hoa Nghiem, the account who shared the texts, is a coordinator with Hanoi’s Human Rights Space. She said that a family from Ha Tinh approached her for help to find news about their daughter, Pham Thi Tra My, 26, whom they fear to be one of the victims. The text said: “I’m sorry, dad and mom. The way I went overseas was not successful. Mom, I love dad and you so much. I’m dying because I can’t breathe. Nghen Village, Can Loc District, Ha Tinh Province, Vietnam. Mom, I am so sorry, mom.” The text messages were sent at 4.28 a.m. on October 23, Vietnam time (10.28 p.m. on October 22, UK time). At this time, the trailer was still in transit to Purfleet port, UK. Pham left for the UK on October 3, traveling via China and France. Her family has not heard from her since the text and said that they paid $38 000 to smugglers to get her to the UK. Since then, more Vietnamese families have spoken out, believing that their family members are among the dead. They have even held memorial services and erected family altars to remember them. CNN reported that the Vietnamese embassy in London has been working with British authorities to aid in identifying the victims. Vietnamese state-run news outlet Chinh Phu also reported that British authorities had sent files on four victims to the Vietnamese Ministry of Public Security to seek help in establishing their identities. According to their report, Vietnamese local authorities have taken hair and nail samples from families who have reported missing relatives for DNA verification. According to AP news, Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Geng Shuang said that China had asked the UK to provide more information on the victim’s identities. He also asserted that the claims of victims having Chinese passports were “speculation.” The British police have repeatedly cautioned that the formal identification of the victims and their nationalities would require thorough investigation, and answers will take time. British officials have called the Essex incident one of the country’s deadliest cases of human smuggling. In 2000, 58 Chinese were found dead in a tomato truck at the port of Dover. They had traveled to Britain from Zeebrugge. According to Britain’s National Crime Agency, citizens of Vietnam and China are often smuggled illegally into the UK for labor exploitation. The 2018 UK Annual Report on Modern Slavery found that Vietnam and China were two of the top countries of origin of potential modern slavery and human trafficking victims in the UK. On October 28, UK Prime Minister and Home Secretary Priti Patel traveled to Essex to share their condolences. “The whole nation and indeed the world has been shocked by this tragedy and the cruelty of the fate that has been suffered by innocent people who were hoping for a better life in this country,” Johnson wrote in the condolence book. “We mourn those who lost their lives. Our thoughts are with their families far away. In condemning the callousness of those responsible for this crime, we in the government of the United Kingdom resolve to do everything in our power to bring the perpetrators to justice.”"

It is well worth your time. It was worth mine, for it helped make me change my mind and re-examine a lot of preconceived notions about secularism and tolerance. Here’s the gist. Which brings us to Bill 21 in Quebec. We now have a law in this country, in 2019, that restricts what job you can have based on your faith. Exactly the opposite of what I believed growing up. There are those who say that this is about religious neutrality. Make no mistake. It is not. This is a law that targets three groups of people: Muslim women who cover their heads, baptized Sikhs and Jewish men who wear a yarmulke. No other sizable religious groups in the province have to wear anything as part of their religious faith. Those who wear modest dress can simply claim it is their personal style, not a religious garment. Those who have long beards can claim they are simply hipsters. A small cross can be worn under the shirt; a turban cannot. What this ban says is that people of certain faiths, and only these faiths, can’t be trusted to do their jobs. It tells schools and municipalities that they can’t hire the best people. It says that kids in public schools can’t be exposed to people different than them."
Medium.com,Society,AYS Special: Documenting human rights violations in Vučjak camp,World,https://medium.com/are-you-syrious/ays-special-documenting-human-rights-violations-in-vu%C4%8Djak-camp-923607ace85d?source=topic_page---------106------------------1," Bihać, Bosnia and Herzegovina, is a city in turmoil: located on the margins of Europe, Bihać is beset with a political and humanitarian crisis created by the EU’s externalization policies. Originally in Bihać from June to August 2019 to record illegal pushbacks, two independent human rights monitors found that people-in-transit had as much to say about the violence of Bosnian police in Bihać as they had to say about Croatian police along the border. These monitors began compiling the only comprehensive report on the human rights situation in Bihać. Utilizing interviews with and evidence from people-in-transit, journalists, humanitarian actors and officials and comparing against relevant national and international law, the authors evaluate camp conditions, the behavior of police and private security forces, eviction practices, treatment of minors and access to asylum and registration. This report reveals a consistently overburdened, inadequate and uncoordinated humanitarian effort in Bihać, one bolstered by state deficiencies, lack of political will and pervasive police violence and hostility, including violence from private security forces at IOM-managed camps. Since the writing of this report, the situation has become even more precarious: authorities have simultaneously halted funding and humanitarian aid to Vučjak and have re-strengthened efforts to take people-in-transit from public spaces to the now critically over-populated and under-serviced Vučjak, which is now deprived of medical aid and water. As this report shows, the crisis in Bihać extends past merely what is happening within Vučjak and is intimately tied to the EU’s border practices, particularly the illegal pushbacks that Croatia and Slovenia participate in. There is no political solution in sight other than pushing for two things: providing basic necessities and respect for human rights for people-in-transit, and reforming the European Union’s dysfunctional asylum system and the persistent lack of access to this system at the EU’s borderlands. The authors ask you to keep one thing in mind as you read: At the most fundamental level, this is a document about what it means to be a person-in-transit today in a Europe that has failed its commitments to uphold its own institutionalized system of human rights protection. Since Vučjak was created on the 14th of June in Bihać, the situation inside this camp on a former landfill has only deteriorated. Conditions are more drastic than ever: volunteers providing medical aid have been kicked out, leaving residents without healthcare. Health services and conditions are so bad that cases of Hepatitis B and C, Tuberculosis and now HIV/AIDS and Malaria have been identified among people-in-transit in the Una-Sana Canton. In October, Bihać Mayor Suhret Fazlić cut all aid to Vučjak, forcing the local Red Cross to halt their services in the camp. On October 21st, local authorities ceased providing water to the camp. At the same time, police have elevated their efforts to transport people to Vučjak, bringing the population to 2,400 in October, vastly exceeding capacity. Videos of police detaining and marching large groups of people proliferate on social media. On November 15, 2019, IOM will be closing both Miral (in Velika Kladuša) and Bira camps, kicking out over 2,000 people without having secured alternative accommodation centers, all while the temperatures continue to drop. Recommendations for locations for new reception centers have been consistently rejected by local authorities. As occurred last year, the situation will continue to be managed at the last minute in an ad hoc fashion. The key difference is that IOM, the Bosnian authorities and the EU had the entire year to plan for winter and to create lasting solutions to the migration influx in BiH. No such solutions are in sight. “On the Margins of Europe”, a special report published by AYS, traces the roots of this humanitarian disaster to the key period of summer 2019, when Vučjak was established and began gaining international attention. Two border violence monitors affiliated with Border Violence Monitoring Network (BVMN) have compiled the only comprehensive evaluation of human rights violations of people-in-transit in Bihać. Recording from June to the end of August 2019, this report was created by conducting interviews with people-in-transit, journalists, humanitarian actors and compiling data and evidence from official sources and the media. Beginning with an in-depth evaluation of camp conditions within Vučjak, this report evaluates all major aspects of life for a person-in-transit in Bihać: the behavior of police, private security forces and camp officials, the lack of access to food, healthcare and legal protection and restriction of movement. The deteriorated situation of people-in-transit in BiH is not new and to understand how to solve the current humanitarian and political crisis, we must understand how it has unfolded and the roles of people-in-transit, BiH officials and international actors in these crises. Below is a summary of their main findings and a link to a downloadable pdf of their report. An evaluation of the situation in Bihać reveals three overarching patterns of violence: violence during transport and outside Vučjak, violence during evictions and removals, and violence from private security forces. People-in-transit are reporting that they are most commonly physically assaulted outside and on the streets. The current data we’ve collected indicates consistent and apparently systematic attacks by the police while individuals are entering, exiting and being transported to Vučjak camp. “Police in the center tried to catch us and I ran. But they caught me and slapped me in the face. They took us to the jungle camp [Vučjak].” -Indian man, 27.08.2019 We believe these attacks on people-in-transit might be an attempt to instill fear in and intimidate people-in-transit into self-limiting their own freedom of movement, which many people have begun to do. “Near two months, always in Vučjak. I don’t try to go to Bihać because Bihać police beat [us]. Even here they don’t want [people-in-transit]…in Bihać. Not allowed to go to market. There is not too much difference between Bosnian, Croatian and Slovenian [police].” -HM, 26.08.2019 An anonymous observer who visited Vučjak told us this: “We saw migrants who…claimed they had been beaten. One…was on the asphalt of the street, crying in tears. Two Bosnian policemen reacted very aggressive towards us, telling us that we shouldn’t be here and they have the right to treat the migrants the way they want to.” -Anonymous, 02.08.19 Assault is not the only cruel and degrading treatment occurring during transport: “People come to market, buy groceries and wait. Wait [for] police to take them [to] Vučjak. Police understand. They say ‘I am not a taxi.’ Then they make them walk.” -Indian man, 27.08.2019 Beginning in July, we began to observe a disturbing pattern emerging: local officers, in their near-daily round-ups of people-in-transit in the city center, would now, instead of driving them to Vučjak, make them march in a line on foot to the camp. These groups of marchers often number in the hundreds. Sometimes, the police make them form a line holding each others’ shoulders. Sometimes, the police make them walk very publicly through the city center while other times they drive them outside of town before forcing them to walk. The police have done this in the summer heat and heavy downpours. This practice developed not out of logistical need but rather to punish and to degrade. Most recently, the police marched more than 1,000 people to Vučjak in October, 2019. The second venue for violence is during evictions. On the 14th of June, the Una-Sana Canton authorities, specifically the MUP of the Una-Sana Canton and the Cantonal Inspection Directorate, began to evict hundreds of people-in-transit out of abandoned houses, hostels and informal outdoor settlements. Law enforcement evicted people without ensuring the presence of essential services such as electricity, food, showers and toilets, moving them to Vučjak, which was only four tents set up for 282 evicted and removed people. In the weeks following the evictions, we received messages from dozens of people who reported being beaten and injured by the police during evictions and removals. We observed, both in direct testimony and in photographs, a litany of violences: bruised and battered bodies, black eyes, open wounds, split lips and teeth beaten out of mouths. “In one room there were twenty people sleeping, mostly on their stomachs, and when the police entered they walked on the backs of the sleeping people. For ten or fifteen minutes the police entered each room in the apartment and the respondent could hear people shouting throughout the three floors of the building.” -Reported by BVMN, 26.06.2019 “I was walking in the street when at least 5 police cars, both civil and official, drove past quickly. The scene was really quick: a policeman managed the traffic while police cars and policemen surrounded the house where people-on-the-move were paying to stay. I walked in front of this house and I saw one person sitting on the terrace with his hands behind his head. From the street, I could hear people screaming, shouting. I could hear slaps.” -Reported by BVMN, 14.06.2019 Several media outlets filmed the arrival of evicted and removed people to Vučjak, where we can see that they are visibly injured. “Even animals here have rights, […] They [police] caught us in the street, put us in a corner and they beat us.” -AM, 24-year-old, June 2019 “Me, they beat me in the van, but my friend, they took him outside, I could just hear screams. He was screaming. They beat him really strong. When he came back into the van, he looked like going out of a boxing ring.” -RK, 34-year-old Algerian, 24.06.2019"
Medium.com,Society,China: The New “Space Race” for Currency Leadership?,World,https://medium.com/swlh/china-the-new-space-race-for-currency-leadership-f5dcdfe2189?source=topic_page---------107------------------1," In a fairly dramatic reversal from their previous ban on cryptocurrencies (due to it being a method of moving money offshore), there is now a clear and sizable blockchain push in the region. President Xi has publicly announced that the country needs to “seize the opportunity” afforded by blockchain technology. Within a speech to the communist party committee, he touted the ability of the technology to affect a massive change in the country’s business sector and the broader economy. They are now onboard, new laws are being enacted and they are pushing ahead, quickly. This renewed blockchain interest in the East could be the behind the recent explosive rise in the Bitcoin price… Firstly, local sources note that adverts for blockchain courses have begun appearing on popular apps and social media sites in the country. Also, articles saying blockchain technology is “scam” have now been banned. The u-turn in the desire for positive public perception is loud and clear. Local governments around China are now funding blockchain ventures. For example, 70% of Bitcoin is already mined in China, largely due to the surplus of cheap hydro-power in certain regions with protracted rainy seasons. This power source is now likely to be government funded for the new blockchain projects in the region. This is a simple example, many other projects will be similarly funded. Importantly, the country will also be launching a state backed cryptocurrency next year. No specific dates have been given but its expected to be a “stablecoin” pegged to the local currency, i.e. simply a digital version of the renminbi. One of its goals is to replace cash. However at the same time, it would allow a level of visibility to the government which could help crack down on money laundering, tax evasion and the financing of terrorist groups. The advantages are clear, particularly in a country know for its surveillance. So whilst China is embracing digital currencies right now, the Western world is fighting them, as can be seen by the backlash on plans for Facebook’s “Libra” coin. China is moving towards a leading position in the blockchain industry whilst the Western world stands back and watches. It’s very difficult to say right now. Other countries may follow suit and tokenize their own currencies. Mark Zuckerberg recently stated that America needs to innovate, else the US dollar could be put at risk (though this is largely seen as an excuse to push his own currency). It’s very early days but this could potentially have implications for the reserve status of the US Dollar in the long term. I read an article on this subject which compared the potential outcome of this to a “currency race”, akin to the US vs Russia space race in the 1960’s. Could this be the beginning of a digital currency race? Is this a Sputnik moment for the Federal Reserve? Given China has the lead and has the necessary governmental control to ensure widespread adoption, does the U.S. needs to fast-track the launch of Libra or a similar crypto like currency? The world’s power that succeeds in adopting a stable currency that is easy to exchange across borders and used as a value peg for other currencies will lead the 21st century economy. It’s going to be very interesting to watch this play out. What we can say for sure is that the region which once posed a threat to the future of cryptocurrency adoption, has clearly switched sides. Bitcoin clearly still remains a threat to China, this should not be read as a push for Bitcoin adoption. However, the technology behind Bitcoin is clearly now moving further into the traditional financial system. The virus is spreading. Remember to subscribe to keep up to date with the noise coming out of China, as well as other important updates!"
Medium.com,Society,"Jack Ryan, Season 2 — Venezuela: Too Little Too Late",World,https://medium.com/philosophorum/jack-ryan-season-2-venezuela-too-little-too-late-df0fdc11d931?source=topic_page---------108------------------1," Note: Spoilers ahead. This is another sad depiction of South America as rendered by Hollywood; it took until the last two episodes of Season 2 of Jack Ryan (available on Amazon Prime), unfortunately, for the story to become the least bit realistic. Jack and the remaining members of an American armed team reach a covert Venezuelan government prison camp in the jungle, seeing a mass grave and the remaining political prisoners near death, collapsing even as they were being freed. Meanwhile, the President of Venezuela, Nicolas Reyes, played by Spanish actor Jordi Molla (whom some Westerners might remember as King Philip of Spain in Elizabeth: The Golden Age), in seeing that footage of the camp has been transmitted to media internationally, forces the closure of the polls for the presidential election, soldiers tasked with the duty claiming that his lead against his opponent, Gloria Bonalde (played by Colombiana, Cristina Umaña) is so “unsurmountable” that no more votes need to be considered. Terrorizing the voters with machine-gun fire, they clear the building. These are the sole scenes that rang the least bit true. Like Netflix’s Triple Frontier, which was supposed to have been about the tri-border region (the borders among Argentina, Paraguay and Brazil) but became a heist film featuring American retired SOF — when this area is known not just for its trafficking of various kinds (weapons, humans, narcotics) and its abject lawlessness, and which was a major hotbed of terrorist training camps back in the day (and perhaps even is to the present, including groups from the Middle East) —Jack Ryan in Season 2 missed one hell of an opportunity to tell a real story and instead went for the usual Hollywood machinations. Instead of mentioning Margarita Island off the coast of Venezuela’s mainland, which is the center of the most illicit deals imaginable among the usual suspects among the most powerful international criminal actors, governments, their proxies, and organizations — or the fact that what was originally Colombia’s oldest (if least covered in the Western press) major non-state armed group, the Ejército de Liberación Nacional (ELN) has taken over half of Venezuela in part as President Maduro’s proxy (only to be joined by FARC dissidents who did not stick around for a malingering peace process, including Disarmament, Demobilization, and Reintegration (DDR) in Colombia) — or that the Chinese, Russians, and Cubans deserved more than just cursory mention for their support of the Venezuelan president as long as he chooses to support their interests — this was only mentioned as some grudging, but brief context — Jack Ryan chose instead to make this a cliche of well-trodden ground Hollywood chooses consistently rather than getting to the heart of a more insidious, multi-faceted, multi-layered mire in which American interests are less about Democracy than a re-invigorated Monroe Doctrine for the purposes of U.S. multinational corporate interests. Never mind, no other world power’s interests are any different. (U.S. interests in Venezuela are far from benign— using human rights and a democratic face as often a cloying veneer — when the goal, ultimately, is actually to make easier international development (and associated debt bondage) and multinational corporate interests — including competing for natural resource rights among whom to the “winner” go the spoils.) While this season of Jack Ryan does mention some of these things in the first episode when Jack is shown giving a lecture on — you guessed it — Venezuela — and the interests by myriad actors in a massive capacity to tap the world’s largest oil supply as well as similarly massive mineral deposits — this is context glossed over ultimately for the sake of action and American benevolence and heroism, in which, once again, the U.S. saves the day for a developing country via the heroism of a few good men. As the daughter and great-granddaughter of veterans — the first Wetherholts fought in the American Revolution, and the last, my father, was a veteran of Korea — I want to desperately believe in this for its own sake. And I cannot and will not ever fault American veterans for the sometimes mercenary and ill-planned actions of the U.S. Government — which often serves itself and its allies more than fellow Americans. However, in having been in various developing countries in which the U.S. is not seen by the people of such countries since WWII in the most favorable light, the realities here needed to be just as pronounced. Enigmatic forces, spies, and mercenaries seem to be the usual fare for Hollywood, but the broad and simplistic strokes are solely good for entertainment — not for offering any sense of more nuanced reality, which is important in this day and age necessitating information integrity. For this, maybe it’s good to go back to John Le Carre — nuance at its best in terms of Western-proffered examinations of international reality in such film and television adaptations such as The Constant Gardener, or Tinker, Tailor, Soldier, Spy…or even the most recent, The Night Manager. Tom Clancy has written blockbusters for a reason — and Hollywood has responded in kind. Indeed, as an American who has been forced to contend with the realities of our presence and the interests of our government in far too many places, I would love for us to go back to founding principles of Natural Law and the Enlightenment; however, the 20th and 21st Century have shown that superpowers, when they give a damn more about self-interest of the few rather than the well-being of the many, are just as mercenary as any of the old colonial empires, and they act accordingly. They, like Hollywood, miss the point in being blinded, ultimately, to necessary context by its own behemoth interests. Power is not monolithic forever; it is made of shifting sands and the vagaries of various climates at any given moment, and what underlies its interests determines longer-term success — including the definition of such success. Lay waste to a people and/or support their oppressors for your own interests, and there will be consequences. People are ultimately tribal: they remember. Be a good guy once, and it will be quickly forgotten if you yourself forget and decide to commit acts of malfeasance in the instances following. And in this information age, no one ever forgets. To see Venezuela as it is shown in this season, it has, unfortunately, lost the plot in more sense than one, and for some of these reasons. Hollywood shouldn’t be so afraid of complexities, nor should they do a spit and polish on reality. Seeing Venezuela — happy kids playing in the street — relatively peaceful surroundings and clean neighborhoods — is nothing close to reality. Having been to the border in Cucuta in Colombia — across the bridge from San Cristobal in Venezuela — knowing that people are starving on the other side of the border, that the ELN and other factions are controlling illicit paths between the two countries — that very few are living in luxury, and instead inflation and violence are so endemic as to now be the daily, brutal reality— to see this reality among the millions whitewashed was disconcerting. I could see where Colombia was standing in for Venezuela, and even something as small as the accents among the actors speaking Spanish (the difference among Colombian, Venezuelan, and Spanish actors was obvious for anyone who has been to the region once a part of Gran Colombia), I wondered when Hollywood would try to get it right instead of being content with just letting it be good enough for what they believe to be the lowest common denominator among audiences who wouldn’t know the difference. Maybe many — or even most Americans— wouldn’t know the difference, but that shouldn’t mitigate the need to get something as essential as a desperate reality among millions of desperate people — right. That should be the point. Even for Hollywood if it wants to really serve more than itself as a master. Those last two episodes were important in even the minimal reality shown — but for someone who knows better, there was also still minimal suspension of disbelief by the end, in which once again, Jack Ryan takes down the bad guys — and no real spoilers here, given the usual tropes — there is more than one — and in more than one country in the Western Hemisphere. We need to have heroes perhaps now more than ever in this world, but with that need also comes an equal cynicism that they actually exist. As dynamic as Jon Krasinski as Jack Ryan may be, along with his fellow actors (Noomi Rapace, whose talent is epic, but who, however, seemed to be relegated once again by Hollywood to the now popular token “female badass”), it doesn’t make up for a superficial plot and setting when the reality is actually more important, complex, and dramatic. Next time, for Season 3: do better. K.J. Wetherholt is the Publisher/Executive Editor of MIPJ, Humanitas Media Publishing, and Humanitas.

Medium.com,Society,Taiwan hosts historic pride festival after legalizing same-sex marriage,World,https://medium.com/@themillennialsource/taiwan-hosts-historic-pride-festival-after-legalizing-same-sex-marriage-be4b0e6e39a9?source=topic_page---------109------------------1," On October 26, Taiwan hosted its 17th annual pride festival, the first since the legalization of same-sex marriage in May. Nearly 200 000 people marched through the streets of Taipei in celebration of this year’s historic win for the LGBT community. On May 17, Taiwan approved a bill legalizing same-sex marriage, making it the first country in Asia to legally recognize same-sex marriage. The law officially came into effect on May 24. Taiwan is home to a large LGBT community and has hosted the biggest pride parade in Asia for 17 years. Despite this, the decision was still a controversial move. In 2015, LGBT rights activist Chi Chia-wei filed a request to the Constitutional Court, asking to revise the definition of marriage in Taiwan’s civil code. A similar request was filed by Taipei city government in the same year after three same-sex couples filed an administrative lawsuit against the government when their marriage registrations were rejected. In 2017, Taiwan’s Constitutional Court ruled that the article in Taiwan’s civil code which said that marriage was between a man and a woman was unconstitutional. The Court gave the Taiwanese parliament a two-year deadline to amend or enact new laws regarding same-sex marriage. In November 2018, conservative and religious groups pushed the government to hold a referendum on whether the civil code should restrict marriage to between a man and a woman. Of the 55% of eligible voters who participated in the referendum, 67% voted against marriage equality. In May, conservative politicians put forward rival bills that introduced limited same-sex unions, but they failed in parliament. A week after the deadline passed, the bill recognizing same-sex marriage was approved. Although this new law was considered a win for LGBT rights in Taiwan, it still contained restrictions not faced by heterosexual couples. For example, same-sex couples can only adopt their partner’s biological children, and people can only marry foreigners from countries where gay marriage is also legal. Taiwan’s vote puts it among only 30 countries and territories in the world that allow gay marriage, according to the Pew Research Center. In mainland China, homosexuality was removed from the country’s official list of mental disorders in 2001. While homosexuality isn’t illegal here, same-sex marriage is not recognized, and there are still accounts of censorship, prejudice, and discrimination against the LGBT community. In 2016, China banned the portrayal of “abnormal sexual behavior” in TV and online shows, including LGBT relationships. In November 2018, a homoerotic fiction writer received a 10-year prison sentence for writing what the police in East China’s Anhui Province calls “obscene sexual behavior between males” set to themes of “violence, abuse, and humiliation.” Earlier this year in March, all scenes that portrayed or mentioned Freddie Mercury’s homosexuality were removed from the Queen biopic “Bohemian Rhapsody” in its Chinese release. Actor Rami Malek, who won an Academy Award for his lead role, was also censored for saying “a gay man, an immigrant, who lived his life just unapologetically himself,” in his Oscars acceptance speech. The Chinese streaming platform Mango TV replaced “gay man” with “special group” in its subtitles. Following Taiwan’s historic decision in May, Chinese state-run newspaper People’s Daily tweeted: “Local lawmakers in #Taiwan, China, have legalized same-sex marriage in a first for Asia, according to local media reports.” Chinese state-run tabloid Global Times joined in with a video showcasing gay social life in Beijing, featuring drag performances and praises from local advocates and foreigners. In response, the Taiwanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs tweeted a rebuttal: “WRONG! The bill was passed by our national parliament & will be signed by the president soon. Democratic #Taiwan is a country in itself & has nothing to do with authoritarian #China. @PDChina is a commie brainwasher & it sucks.” Taiwan is a self-governing island that has maintained an “uneasy truce” with mainland China for seven decades after their split at the end of a civil war in 1949, according to CNN. Mainland China won’t follow Taiwan in allowing same-sex marriage. An Fengshan, spokesman for China’s policy-making Taiwan Affairs Office, said they had “noted reports on the island” about the new legislation. “The mainland has a marriage system of one man, one woman,” he added, without further elaboration."
Medium.com,Society,Protests Continue Across Iran,World,https://medium.com/freedom-star/protests-continue-across-iran-8b67464b9fb6?source=topic_page---------110------------------1," Iran- 25 October 2019: Social unrest continues to spread across Iran with people taking to the streets in protest against the corrupt mullahs running the country. The situation in Iran is explosive and the regime has been unable to contain public anger faced with numerous crises — most notably with regards to the economic and social situations. The regime has no idea how to solve the difficulties that the people in Iran face, nor does it have the will to try. All of its efforts and resources are going towards its survival, which means spreading terrorism and chaos across the region so it can profit from instability. Public assets are plundered on warmongering activities, as is the country’s capital. The people are fed up with this corruption that is destroying their country. To make their discontent heard, Iranians are taking part in daily protests. However, instead of listening to the grievances the people have, never mind responding to them or taking action to remedy the situation, the regime is responding with violence, force, and suppression. There have been protests at the Azarab factory in Arak and protesters have clashed with the suppressive forces sent by the regime. The regime attempted to ban gatherings there, but the factory workers went ahead and organized a protest anyway. They were confronted by suppressive forces, both inside and in front of the factory. Several of the protesters were arrested, and in a later protest, the workers demanded the immediate release of their colleagues. On Monday, family members of those that were arrested the previous day also participated in the protests. They were met with tear gas which led to the protesting workers clashing with the regime’s forces that were present. The President-elect of the National Council of Resistance of Iran (NCRI) Mrs. Maryam Rajavi praised the brave factory workers for their resilience and determination. She also urged the people of Arak, in particular, the young people, to join the factory workers in their protests. She also called on international organizations and labor unions to condemn the Iranian regime’s suppression and mistreatment of workers. In addition to the protests in Arak, there have been protests in Ahvaz at the Telecommunication Office. Employees gathered in front of the head office where they demanded their unpaid salaries. The crowds grew and grew and the people were heard shouting for their rights. Kharadegh workers in Naghadeh were also demanding their unpaid salaries. They were striking and protesting. The workers have not been paid for more than seven months. In Mahshahr port, workers from the Farabi petrochemical company protested their unpaid salaries too. Anti-government demonstrations, strikes, and protests are happening with such great frequency across the country. The protests are no longer about economic issues — they are now loud and clear.

Medium.com,Society,Unintuitive trends in income inequality,World,https://medium.com/the-inequality-paradox/unintuitive-trends-in-income-inequality-ffa2e4761388?source=topic_page---------111------------------1," Professor Jonathan Bradshaw FBA Why are the UK official statistics not showing an increase in income poverty given the trends Peter Taylor-Gooby describes in The Inequality Paradox? The ONS historical series ‘The effects of taxes and benefits on household incomes’ shows the Gini coefficient of net disposable income increasing sharply in the 1980s, broadly stable in the 1990s and fluctuating downwards since around 2000. (The Gini coefficient is a statistical measure of the degree of variation represented in a set of values, used especially in analysing income inequality. It describes inequality in a single number between 0 and 1: the higher the number, the greater the degree of income inequality.) This is also true of original income (before taxes and benefits), gross income (after benefits) and post- tax income (after indirect taxes). The same series also gives us two alternative inequality measures: the 80/20 ratio — the ratio of the disposable income of the richest 20% divided by the share of the poorest 80% and the 90/10 ratio. They both show the same pattern the share of the richest has fallen since 2000. Trends in income inequality What are the possible explanations for this? The Family Resources Survey on which this data is based under-reports incomes at the top and there are very few top earners in the survey. The inequality measures are not very sensitive to the very top of the distribution — even the top 10% are not all rich. But we also know from Resolution Foundation work that benefit receipt is also under-reported at the bottom of the distribution. The series is not up to date — it takes us to 2017/18 when there was actually a slight increase in inequality and this may be the start of a trend given the freeze in working age benefits from 2016 and the roll-out of Universal Credit, the two-child limit, and the benefit cap. Indeed, we need to concentrate on benefits because they do most of the heavy lifting on redistribution. Work by the Child Poverty Action Group has shown that the redistributive effects of direct taxes are largely cancelled out by the negative effects of indirect taxes. But there have also been countervailing factors to the huge income increases for the ‘fat cats’. Unemployment is at a record low. Employment rates are at a record high, with a big increase in female labour supply and dual earning households. There has also been a big increase in lone parent employment and, despite the insecurity at the bottom end of the labour market, the minimum wage has risen faster than average earnings. Also, pensioner incomes have been increasing, partly thanks to the UK government’s pensions ‘triple lock’, whereby the basic state pension is raised by average earnings, inflation or 2.5%, whichever is higher. It may be that the Institute for Fiscal Studies Commission on Inequality chaired by Angus Deaton will get to the bottom of all this. There is very worrying evidence of increasing inequality of other kinds. As well as wealth, spatial and generational inequalities are certainly growing. So are life-cycle inequalities, with children the main victims of austerity. Child poverty is rising rapidly, both in terms of poverty rates (how many are in poverty) and poverty gaps (how far below the poverty line a person is). The evidence is there in the excellent report of the UN Rapporteur on extreme poverty. Perhaps most worrying of all is the increase in inequalities in life expectancy, partly driven by an increase in the infant mortality over the last two years, after decades of improving rates. This is mainly driven by increases for the lowest socio-economic groups and a growing gap in health outcomes. Like Taylor-Gooby I am not much motivated by the social mobility discourse. If we remake the welfare state as it was in the 1970s as a strong redistributive state, with effective taxation on the rich and high earners, and improved living standards for the poor through adequate wages, decent benefits and restored public services, then social mobility will follow. It has been done before and can be done again."
Medium.com,Society,Politicians dodging questions: How much do British politicians equivocate in online Q&As?,World,https://medium.com/swlh/politicians-dodging-questions-how-much-do-british-politicians-equivocate-in-online-q-as-358fd981bca1?source=topic_page---------112------------------1," This blogpost is the second in a two-part series which outlines the result of my dissertation on MP’s online Q&As sessions on social media. The first detailed the types of questions asked , and this second one covers MP’s answers. The dissertation received a Distinction from the University of Birmingham, 2019. The current British political climate can be described as bleak. Views on our political system are at an all time low. Feelings of political pessimism, powerlessness and disengagement are growing. In this environment politicians are normally seen as out of touch liars who cannot give straight answers. But how much do politicians evade or equivocate in their answers? Especially when asked by potential young voters? To answer these questions I conducted a study that investigated the extent to which British MPs did or did not answer questions in online Q&A sessions on Reddit. I did this by drawing on methods from political communication. Central to my analysis was the work of Dr Peter Bull of York University who has studied the political interviews and created schemes for identifying questions, replies and non-replies (Bull, 1994), and the ways in which politicians equivocate by evading giving answers (Bull and Strawson, 2019)."
Medium.com,Society,What type of questions do people ask British politicians in online Q&As?,World,https://medium.com/swlh/what-type-of-questions-do-people-ask-british-politicians-in-online-q-as-e8aaa2f6315f?source=topic_page---------113------------------1," This blogpost is the first in a two-part series which outlines the result of a study on MP’s social media Q&As sessions. This first post details the themes of questions asked, the second on the extent to which MPs answered said questions. The dissertation received a Distinction from the University of Birmingham, 2019. It’s rare for people to directly interact with elected politicians in the UK. It’s even rarer to ask questions and get a direct personal response, instead of a standard reply made by an intern, researcher or assistant. But that’s exactly what happened on Reddit. Reddit is a social media platform which is mainly anonymous (or pseudo-anonymous). It boasts 330 million active subscribers, and over 1.2 million communities known as “subreddits”, ranging from as little as several users to 18 million. And a website with a sizeable British userbase and number of subreddits. Several British MPs have conducted Q&A sessions with users of the site to date. These sessions are referred to as ‘Ask Me Anything’ (AMAs) on the website. These AMAs can give several insights. Firstly it shows the things people think are important and willing to ask politicians. Secondly it can show the priorities of certain sections of society since the userbase skews male and young (Pew Research Centre, 2016). Lastly it can show that communications between people and politicians can be less toxic and abusive on social media. In addition this work fills a gap in the political science social media literature, which has mainly focused on Twitter, and to a less extent Facebook, using what is called digital trace data, like @-messages, retweets, likes or #hastags (Jungherr, 2016). It also fills a gap in the wider “Reddit literature” I identified in my other work."
Medium.com,Society,Councils Should Raise their Resilience Against Cyber Threats,World,https://medium.com/ideas-that-matter/councils-should-raise-their-resilience-against-cyber-threats-eabf1e635d1c?source=topic_page---------114------------------1," A
cross the full spectrum of government activity, technology is absorbing the processes and infrastructure which keeps the country moving. Since 2011, the Government Digital Service (GDS) has sought to promote ‘Government as a Platform’ — a concept whereby the government shares a common set of digital systems, technology, and processes which enable it to develop services fit for the digital age. This has been a huge step towards leveraging the benefits which technology presents in order to make government more effective and more efficient. The Cabinet Office is clearly committed to standing by their ‘digital by default’ mantra and the transformation to digital at government level has considerable momentum. However, while central government is on the right path, local government needs to follow in its footsteps. In July, the Government Digital Service, alongside the Ministry of Housing, Communities and Local Government, has published the Local Digital Declaration which provides local authorities with the guiding principles to help them to deliver digital services and platforms that meet the needs of local communities. This is something which I hope every council will soon be signed up to, because it provides the right guidance for transforming local councils to improve services right across the spectrum of council activities, and can facilitate efficiency savings for council budgets in the process. However, as more council services are transferred into cyberspace, the threat of cyber-attacks increases. The Cabinet Office has recently awarded the Local Government Association (LGA) a grant to conduct a comprehensive stocktake of the cyber security strategies of councils across the UK. This is part of the Government’s 25 year National Cyber Security Strategy in recognition of the evolving cyber-threats faced by government, local authorities and businesses, and the need for a national plan to respond to this threat. It signals that the Government is concerned that many councils across the country are not taking the necessary steps to secure sensitive data and to protect critical infrastructure from cyber-criminals and terrorists, so-called ‘hacktivists’ and foreign state actors. This is because local councils present a unique cyber-security threat. The capacity for a malicious attacker to damage or to extract valuable information is particularly high with local councils, simply due to the sensitive nature of the information held. It is only a matter of time before councils could suffer significant loss of revenue as well as damaged trust with the public However at the same time, local councils are often not equipped with a commensurate cyber-security strategy. This means that there are unique incentives for certain attackers to target local government. Cyber-attacks on councils could expose them to the loss of personal data of thousands of residents; undermine procurement or legal proceedings by revealing strategic information; and even lead to widespread fraud or theft. There is a near certain chance that councils will be victims of successful cyber-attacks in the future. If the necessary precautions are not put in place, it is only a matter of time before councils could suffer significant loss of revenue as well as damaged trust with the public. This is why, alongside a £7.5 million injection from the Government to assist councils to transform online services, the Local Digital Declaration requires councils to “champion the continuous improvement of cyber security practice to support the security, resilience and integrity of our digital services and systems”. Through working for several cyber security companies on many public-sector projects, I recognise the risks and the necessary steps that must be taken in order to secure the digital services of local councils."

ladimir Putin has been having a good run. Over the last few years he’s disrupted democratic elections in key nations like Britain and the US and attempted to do so elsewhere. Militarily, his forces were an important factor in defeating ISIS and maintaining his proxy state in Syria and stabilizing Russian presence in the oil producing Middle East. Putin’s playbook ripped a page or two from Nikita Khrushchev’s in which the Communist party chairman sponsored “wars of national liberation” as a means of disrupting the post-war march of Western democracy and capitalism in emerging nations. Khrushchev wanted to convert hearts and minds in the emerging world as well as to keep his restive flank in Eastern Europe, the Warsaw Pact countries, safely in his orbit. The reason was fairly simple. The Soviet Union’s economy was largely mercantilist and focused on natural resource extraction. Russia’s economy has not changed much. Russia’s vast area offers a lot of resources to extract too but Khrushchev knew he’d need more resources from outside to continue his mercantilist shell game. Putin has the same problem. Russia has the eighth largest oil reserves and like all oil producers, it’s running out. That’s a problem for everyone but while other producers like Saudi Arabia are working to diversify their economies and invest in alternatives, Russia’s approach seems to be to attempt to corner the market on a diminishing commodity. It’s hard to say how much oil any country has in the ground because that’s a closely guarded state secret for most. But the US Department of Energy as well as the major oil companies and even the CIA have made well calculated guesses and the DOE concluded a few years ago that the total amount of crude oil left in the ground was 1.687 trillion barrels. It’s certainly a huge number but at current consumption rates it works out to only a 50-year supply. Consider what would happen if we got to the point several decades in the future when oil supplies got really tight. Putin, or his successor, could easily become the supplier of last resort able to charge whatever the market would bear and able to disrupt the global economy. Putin is working to consolidate strategic positions in places like the middle east and Venezuela, the country purportedly with the largest reserves, and a very unstable government. In the 1980’s the opposite occurred. The Soviets couldn’t sell their oil because the world was awash in cheap oil thanks to new discoveries in places like the North Sea. Those discoveries, plus Saudi Arabia’s willingness to increase production when needed, gave the West plenty of alternatives to doing business with the USSR. Western preference for this oil starved the USSR of oil revenues and was a contributing factor to its demise in 1989. Next time there won’t be a swing producer because most oil producing regions are tapped out even as demand is increasing. Techniques like hydraulic fracturing are already in use but they are designed to squeeze the last drops of oil from oil-bearing rock and do not represent net new resources. So, Putin is playing a multi-pronged long game. He’s happy to disrupt western democracies in the hope that they won’t be able to mount concerted opposition to using Russian oil as they did several decades ago. At the same time, he is strategically planting Russian forces astride of the West’s oil supply anticipating a time when he can dictate prices. There’s good news for the west though. There is plenty of life after oil and the tools and technologies needed to wean us away from petroleum are abundant and available. There is an ample potential energy supply in the form of solar and wind which most people are familiar with, but also geothermal generation and even space based solar farms. Together there is enough generating capacity to easily replace the petroleum paradigm by a factor of well over one thousand to one. Business and industry are now making the adjustments we’ll need but those changes will take on the order of 25 years and we need to show results sooner than that. The big stumbling point is how to wind down a big chunk of the petroleum industry. It has literally invested trillions of dollars in tankers, refineries, drilling platforms, pipelines, retail channels, and other infrastructure, all of which would become stranded assets. But winding the petroleum industry down without causing a severe global recession is a tall order requiring planning and smarts. There are tools and approaches for all of this, and they don’t include government handouts, but they do require a functioning government that understands the problem correctly. This understanding will need to incorporate a few incentives, partnerships, venture capital, and sensible mandates. The end result will be a world not threatened with climate collapse and, at the same time, one that is not in the clutches of Vladimir Putin."

Medium.com,Society,After ISIS,World,https://medium.com/@boldingg/after-isis-ede3899d1ba3?source=topic_page---------119------------------1," On
October 26th, 2019, the leader of Daesh (the Islamic State in Iraq and the Levant), Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, met his end while fleeing commandos of the elite US Delta Force. Cornered and outnumbered, the self-proclaimed caliph detonated a suicide vest, claiming his own life and the lives of two children he used as human shields. The death of this figure garnered much support in the United States and abroad. Multiple nations, from Russia to Turkey, expressed their gratitude for the operation, which ended the life of one of the 21st century’s most vile human beings. Unfortunately, over the period of two days, approximately 60 Iraqi protesters were killed in anti-government demonstrations that rocked the nation. By November 1st, it was reported that Iran was secretly advising the mainly Shi’ite government in their efforts to quell the protests. This — coupled with Turkish incursions into neighboring Syria — hints at the next phase in the never-ending drama that is the Fertile Crescent. Daesh is crippled, but the situation in the region, once known as Mesopotamia, is far from burning out — and it will likely take more desperate measures to extinguish the flames. Before October 26th, 2019 It should be noted that the individual known as Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi was born Ibrahim Awad al-Badri. To solidify his legitimacy as “caliph,” he selected his new name in honor of the prophet Mohammad’s immediate successor, Abu Bakr. As such a name is generally worthy of respect (along with the fact that the actual Abu Bakr used his own body as a human shield to protect Mohammad in battle rather than the other way around), it fits to refer to Ibrahim al-Badri by his actual name. The history of Daesh is complicated, but to briefly summarize, the group was born as a faction of al-Qaeda led by notorious terror leader Abu Musab al-Zarqawi and later Abu Ali al-Anbari. Following President Barack Obama’s decision to withdraw US troops from Iraq in 2011, the faction slowly expanded its influence throughout Iraq and Syria. This coincided with the disintegration of Syria as the result of the Arab Spring protests that same year. By 2014, the group accumulated enough members to launch full-scale offensives against the significantly weaker Iraqi and Syrian armies. At the helm of this movement was Ibrahim al-Badri, who rose through the ranks as a pious student of Islam from Baghdad University. After the US invasion of Iraq in 2003, al-Badri founded an Islamist insurgent group and was later captured by US forces in 2004. He would be released the next year from Camp Bucca as a rather unimpressive inmate. Almost nine years after his release, al-Badri made himself known at the al-Nouri Mosque in Mosul, where he openly declared himself the “caliph” of the newly christened Islamic state. The next five years saw the reign of the most vicious theocracy in modern times. There is no end to the list of atrocities committed by Daesh, from its genocide against Yazidis to the destruction of landmarks dating back to ancient Babylon. Ibrahim al-Badri himself played a role in his caliphate’s crimes against humanity, more notably by acquiring several sex slaves of which included an American aid worker. Daesh’s efforts to subdue the region — along with subsequent acts of terrorism abroad — garnered push-back from multiple nations. Major powers including the United States, Russia, and even Iran sought to reduce Daesh’s power and push them out of their captured territories. The neo-caliphate — primarily trained to butcher unarmed prisoners — lost most of its land in its five-year reign, and al-Badri was forced into hiding. The “caliph” spent the remainder of his career running from special forces units and airstrikes of which nearly killed him multiple times. After two decades of encouraging young men from around the world to fight and die as “shahids” (martyrs) against the enemies of Islam, al-Badri met his end while running away from said enemy. It is rather rare that figures such as Ibrahim al-Badri live to see a fitting end to both their empires and their lives. His neo-caliphate is a shell of what it once was, but the lands they occupied are shells as well — and the violence is far from over. A Week Later As of the writing of this article, roughly 250 Iraqis have been killed in what is now being dubbed — even this late in the year — the “Iraq Spring.” Crumbling infrastructure and an overall ineffective government forced thousands of Iraqis to take to the streets in early October. The current Iraqi prime minister, Adel Abdul Mahdi, has since reshuffled the Iraqi government and even agreed to resign from his position, mainly to no avail. Demonstrators have resorted to blocking off key streets throughout Baghdad while hundreds have occupied an abandoned high-rise building overlooking Tahrir Square as a home base for the protests. As Iraq spirals out of control, the nation remains wedged between the inferno of the Syrian Civil War, a cold war between Saudi Arabia and Iran, and Turkey, which has interests in the region at large. Daesh itself has mostly been reduced to fragments, but even hardened prisoners note more Baghdadis will arise in the long run. As largely artificial nations with borders drawn by Western powers in the 20th century, both Iraq and Syria will always remain fragile to the point of inevitable breakdown. In place of stability, the region will likely become a contested prize between local factions until one becomes dominant. What’s Next? The 2003 invasion by the United States opened the floodgates for regional powers to grab their slice of the Iraqi pie — and with the current administration of Donald Trump seeking an end to “endless wars” in the region, only one question remains: who will take the US’s place? In the absence of the US, two likely contenders will emerge for Iraq’s future. Contender #1, to no surprise, is Iran. As a nation locked between the Middle East, the Caucasus, and Central Asia, Iran has sought to secure buffers in these areas via proxies. The most notable proxy, Hezbollah, is based in Lebanon, allowing Iran leeway in the Mediterranean region while keeping nations like Israel in check. As for Iraq, Tehran’s main proxy consists of the Popular Mobilization Forces, which answer to elements of Iran’s Revolutionary Guard Corps. Unfortunately for Tehran, its efforts to secure interests have hit a severe roadblock. As the regime in Tehran pours funds into its proxies abroad, the nation itself remains plagued with protests as the result of rising prices on essential commodities such as eggs. As Michael Rubin of the American Enterprise Institute explains: We could be witnessing the death throes of the Islamic Republic. The Islamic Republic is in a perfect storm, and sanctions have hurt their economy…The Islamic Republic’s old guard is dying of old age, and Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei realizes he may not be far behind. Unlike in 1989 — the last time Iran had a leadership transition at the very top — there is no clear successor nor confidence within the system that transition will be smooth. More likely is a stalemate or even a military coup which would subordinate the clerics to the generals. Islamic Republic or not, that has been the norm throughout the bulk of modern Iranian history. In this respect, though Iran has vested interests in Iraq, it might be forced to cede ground in the future if it is to survive. Economic burdens and ever-changing demographics will be the primary opponents of the regime’s interests in the long run. The remaining contender, Turkey, fares far better by comparison. As with Iran, Turkey’s geographic position (as a land bridge between Europe and the Middle East) forces it to secure its interests both on its borders and abroad. However, unlike Iran, Turkey has a stronger economy and is a key member of NATO. It has also undergone several coups and protests in the past, but it continues to remain active in the region. More importantly though, the nationalistic program of sitting President Recep Tayyip Erdogan includes a significant redrawing of Turkish borders. Expansive in nature, said boundaries — according to revised maps released to Turkish media in 2016 — are projected to encompass portions of the southern Balkans, the Caucasus region, and both northern Iraq and Syria. The same year these maps were released, Turkey launched incursions into Syria to drive Kurdish and Daesh fighters away from its southern borders. Since then, thanks to a withdrawal of US forces from parts of northern Syria, Turkey has capitalized on the opportunity to seize and stabilize these territories along their borders. Erdogan has expressed his desire to create a “safe zone” along the southern border to relocate refugees, but as the body count rises, it becomes doubtful that Erdogan’s ambitions have a humanitarian bent to them. As of now, it is a waiting game to determine when and how Turkey will make its next move, but unlike Iran, Turkey is more prepared to play a stabilizing force in the region — and at some point, it might do so. It’s safe to say since Biblical times, the affairs of the Fertile Crescent have shaped the destiny of humanity. It was the birthplace of magnificent empires such as Babylon as well as a graveyard for empires such as the Ottomans. As a vital land bridge between East and West, Mesopotamia will likely be contested battlegrounds for centuries to come. The demise of Daesh is but one catalyst to the rise of a single hegemon in the region. Whichever this hegemon may be — whether Turkey or Iran — is up for history to decide."

He was going to be the man to withdraw U.S. affiliation in the Asian region. Despite the wishes of his cabinet and state department, Trump made good on that promise and promptly ended the still then being negotiated Trans-pacific Partnership Agreement that would secure free trade in the pacific. It was a pact that, by all accounts, would have strengthened ties of China’s closest neighbors with the United States. No sooner than when the act was cleared, did the China Prime Minster Xi Jinping step in to fill that void using diplomacy, financial strong-arming weaker nations, or outright threats. The move undoubtedly was a disappointment to some leaders in the Republican and Democratic parties who view China as a global competitor. And it was for them an incredible victory. This is why, and how they will begin to unseat the U.S. as a global leader. This island nation off the eastern coast of China was the refuge following the defeat of the Chinese Nationalists in 1949. Since then, Taiwan has kept and organized government and constitution. Nevertheless, Beijing has tried both carrot and stick methods to return the country under their official rule through any means. During the 1980s, China Dangled the temptation of”one country, two systems” at Taipei. It was a meant to offer some temporary control to the small country off China’s eastern coast, but still give mainland rule some legitimacy. The offer was answered with an extended middle finger. Things didn’t get better. In 2000, China became alarmed when Taiwan elected President Chen Shui-bian, who was a pro-separatist. That move was later responded to when, in 2005, China passed an anti-secession law that spelled out a threat to use, “non-peaceful means” against Taiwan if it tried to secede from China. Again, in January 2016, Tsai Ing-wen, another pro-separatist candidate, was elected. Again, just two years later, China responded by forcing companies that did business in China to list Taiwan as their girlfriend…ahem…excuse me… “territory.” China has been actively working to lock down the rights to the sea south of China. In 2016 an international tribunal ruled, declaring that China had no sovereignty over the sea. The complaint, which was brought by the Philippine government in 2013, was proclaimed by unanimous consent. The decision was ruled on the basis that both China and the Philippines were signatures of the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea, and they each only had exclusive economic access 12 nautical miles off their coastal waters. Following this, China made a subsequent meltdown and swore never to uphold the ruling. Instead, they continued their program of constructed man-made islands that now hold missile sites. Although China never indicated an expansionist intent, they said it was their historical property by right. The entire span of the sea, oil underneath, and fishing swimming in it — all of it was theirs. Meanwhile, the Philippines had elected self-proclaimed strongman Rodrigo Duterte. His accession came after years of corruption and drug violence that plagued the southeast island country. So when the Duterta ran on a platform of executing criminals, he was almost certainly going to win. However, his election would have severe consequences for the United States’ strategy to continue strategic influence in the area. Duterte was by no means fond of the United States. At one point, he even referred to then-President Obama as a“son of a bitch.” After strategically torpedoing any goodwill he had from a global superpower, Duterte found himself in a politically tricky situation. Even though the international tribunal handed the Philippines a resounding legal victory in the China sea dispute, Duterte didn’t exactly seem to want it. That may be because the preceding Philippines administration filed the complaint that led to the ruling. For whatever reason, he decided to abandon the verdict is truly known to him. In any case, recent events would seem that their suspicions of betrayal are being confirmed. He recently asserted that he would ignore the tribunal ruling so that he and China could move forward with an oil drilling deal in the now China Sea. But it hasn’t gone over well in the Philippines, with locals referring #DuterteDuwagas a sign of their anger. All this aggression might lead people to wonder why China would be so ready to pick a fight. For anyone who knows the Cold War, you will see the parallels like in borders and security. With these loose ends tied down, we now turn to their agenda for the future. Checkmate. China is looking to surround its main territory with countries that can absorb or deter any attack by a future aggressor. In eras like during WWII, capture and annexation of small states wasn’t tolerated — until it was."

During political campaigns, politicians and campaigners may misunderstand or misuse statistics — usually in pursuit of partisan arguments. Statistics are important in public debate. Accuracy matters. Throughout this election campaign, I will seek to check as many of these statistical claims as I can. Each claim will be checked, and given a rating with reasoning. I will use multiple ratings throughout this article series — to assess statistical claims. Previously, I only needed the first four categories, as I was assessing entries to the Statistic of the Year. Two more categories are added: Claim: “Opinion polls are now predicting a close win for the Liberal Democrats in the Chippenham constituency”.
Rating: Needs clarification.
Reasoning: Most public opinion polls measure current national vote intentions, across either Great Britain or the United Kingdom (including Northern Ireland). These polls do not make predictions — but sketch what public opinion looks like when the surveys were asked. A uniform swing from national opinion polls conducted prior to the 1st October would suggest: Apply these figures to Chippenham in 2017 yields a Conservative share of 45 points, and a Liberal Democrat share of 39 points. What model is being used to translate national vote intention shares onto individual constituencies? Is that model reliable? Which parties are being assumed to stand in this ‘prediction’? What time is being referred to as “now” — given the leaflet was sent before the election date was set?"

According to Peace Now, the Israeli Higher Planning Council of the Civil Administration originally approved 1,623 planned units in a first phase of the settlement building plan, while 719 other units were approved for a final phase, bringing the total units to 2,342. About 8,337 new Israeli housing units in existing Israeli settlements have been approved since the beginning of 2019. Such plans represent a 50% increase compared to the 5,618 units built in 2018. Since U.S. President Donald Trump’s election, the average number of housing units in existing Israeli settlements in occupied Palestinian territories has increased 50%, bringing the number of Israeli housing units during Trump’s administration to 6,899, compared with 3,635, three years ago, Peace Now revealed. Peace Now added that among the settlements that have been approved for expansion are the Jordan Valley’s outpost of Brosh, which serves as an educational institution for hundreds of staff members and their families. Another area, called the Kerem Reim outpost will expand with 140 housing units. Notably, the Israeli housing unit expansion comes during the Trump administration. Since his election, President Trump has provided support to Israel by declaring occupied East Jerusalem as the capital of Israel and downplaying a two-state solution that has been long-envisioned by previous U.S. administrations. This year, US Ambassador to Israel, David Friedman, hinted at what he believed to be Israel’s right to maintain a presence over some areas of the West Bank. Previous U.S. administrations have opposed Israel’s policy of settlement building, considering it a stumbling block to Palestinian-Israeli peace, noting that such settlements hinder the realization of a two-state solution. During campaigning for a second round of parliamentary elections, held in September of this year, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu promised voters that he would work on placing the Israel-occupied Palestinian West Bank under Israel’s jurisdiction. This would have meant seizing more Palestinian lands. However, Netanyahu couldn’t form a coalition government after the recent election, and his opponent Benny Ganz now has an opportunity to form his own coalition government. As of now, Israel doesn’t have a prime minister although Netanyahu is still nominally the PM. The West Bank areas are divided into three main parts: Area C, which is subject to Israel’s administrative and security control; Area B, where Israel has security control, while the Palestinian Authority maintains an administrative rule; and Area A, which is subject to exclusive Palestinian security and administrative control. Areas designated as C constitute 61% of the 5200-square kilometer West Bank territories. Israeli settlers who live alongside indigenous Palestinian residents occupy the areas. Yet, Palestinians in these areas suffer through segregation due to Israel’s separation barrier and home demolitions under the pretext of lacking building permits, in addition to the chase and arrest of Palestinian inhabitants by Israel’s military. Israeli housing settlement in occupied Palestinian territories, including the West Bank and East Jerusalem, are considered illegal by international players, including the United Nations (U.N.) and the European Union (E.U.). The E.U. and the U.N. have repeatedly called on Israel to stop such activities and prepare the ground for the resumption of peace talks between Israel and the Palestinians. In 2014 the Palestinian Authority, headed by Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas unilaterally suspended peace talks with Israel after Israel refused to halt settlement construction in the West Bank. Since then, the 26-year-old peace process has stalled. There are currently approximately 215,000 Israelis living in East Jerusalem while the settler population in Area C in the occupied West Bank, excluding East Jerusalem, is about 413,000. This brings the settler population to approximately 630,000 Israeli settlers in 143 settlement locations in the West Bank (132), including East Jerusalem and 106 outposts. During the Arab-Israeli War in June 1967, Israeli forces occupied the West Bank, East Jerusalem and the Gaza Strip. The U.N. Security Council at that time demanded an immediate withdrawal from those territories by means of Security Council Resolutions 242 and 338. In the 1970s Israel began building settlements in the occupied territories. Israel named the West Bank Judea and Samaria, which Israel believes to be exclusively Israeli land."
Medium.com,Society,Can Russia Disconnect From The Global Internet?,World,https://medium.com/high-key/can-russia-disconnect-from-the-global-internet-d83f855a9651?source=topic_page---------126------------------1," Today (November 1, 2019) Russia’s sovereign internet law went into effect. What does this mean for netizens? What are the hurdles to making the plan a reality? According to the Kremlin, the purpose of the law is to be able to protect Russia from potential cyberattacks from foreign powers. An estimated $300 million is being spent to implement it. Several sources have stated that this law also serves as a move to increase the state’s ability to monitor the activity of Russian citizens. Together with Human Rights Watch, nine other human rights organizations released a statement condemning the law in April 2019. News outlets like Bloomberg point out recent online restrictions in the country. According to Bloomberg, “A blogger was sentenced to five years in jail in September for a sarcastic tweet that the authorities claimed advocated violence.” A number of VPNs and encrypted messaging apps have been banned in Russia. LinkedIn has been blocked since 2016 for refusing to store data within Russia. While Telegram was banned in 2018 for refusing to provide encryption keys to the FSB, developers of the messaging app have used a technique known as domain fronting to partially get around the block. For most, the answer appears to be “no”. This is largely because Russia’s internet was engineered to be open to everyone from its inception in 1990. In contrast, China’s internet (commonly referred to as the Great Firewall) was intended to be censored from the start. Chinese officials did this through law in 1996, only two years after the nation first connected to the internet. Effectively, complete control of the internet in Russia is relatively difficult to master and costly to implement. Experts say that Russia’s technical implementation of its sovereign internet law likely won’t be fully ready until late 2020. It’s also not likely that Russia wouldn’t be able to shut off its connection the global internet infrastructure, particularly SaaS applications, e-commerce stores, and mobile apps. Compared to China, Russia is far more connected with international online businesses and internet infrastructure. The trend of parallel internets, also known as “splinternet”, is seemingly gaining more traction. This doesn’t necessarily mean that each country or region will one day have its own, separate equivalent to Google, Facebook, and Twitter as China does with Baidu, Renren, and Weibo. It just means that the way in which large tech companies treat users and form legal policies appears to be increasingly fragmented. As PC Mag points out, Google has several cases where it changed names and borders on its mapping products in certain places. GDPR regulation means that some websites have had to restrict content to users in European countries. Twitter is required by law to block hate speech in Germany but isn’t required to do so in the US. In conclusion, while Russia is showing how the internet is becoming more fragmented on a global scale, this is a continuation of a global trend that has been occurring for quite some time."
Medium.com,Society,US Foreign Policy Has Claimed More Innocent Lives,World,https://extranewsfeed.com/us-foreign-policy-has-claimed-more-innocent-lives-31b724b96249?source=topic_page---------127------------------1," “Something very big has happened!” wrote the President of the United States on twitter. The next day, he announced what that “very big” thing was: Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi is dead. He was the founder and leader of ISIS, the most ruthless and violent terror organization anywhere in the world. The United States has been searching for Baghdadi for many years….U.S. Special Operations forces executed a dangerous and daring nighttime raid in northwestern Syria and accomplished their mission in grand style. For the second time in roughly two months, the United States has carried out a mission abroad to slay a high-ranking, wanted terrorist. While some conspiracy theories about the success of the operation have emerged, four days after Trump’s announcement, the Islamic State confirmed al-Baghdadi’s death and named a replacement leader. Al-Baghdadi is, in fact, dead. During his announcement, Trump boasted that the US special forces “brought the world’s №1 terrorist leader to justice,” extolling the fact that “the world is a much safer place” as a result of the mission. There’s much to dissect from Trump’s 40-minute long, graphic, almost freudian monologue about the operation. But I’d like to call attention to two lines that many have taken at face value, ones that appear harmless while actually highlighting the distorted perspective of US war hawks. Both of these lines are problematic for similar reasons. The first is the claim that al-Baghdadi was “the world’s №1 terrorist leader,” the other that his death has made the world “a much safer place.” Because I think if one were to survey global citizens outside the borders of the United States, they may have a different view of who “the world’s” number one terrorist is. Take, for instance, a recent Human Rights Watch report which documents 14 cases in which CIA-backed Afghan strike forces committed serious abuses between late 2017 and mid-2019. They are illustrative of a larger pattern of serious laws-of-war violations — some amounting to war crimes. “These are not isolated cases,” the report warns. Among the atrocities in which these US-backed forces engaged are “extrajudicial killings, forced disappearances and attacks on healthcare facilities.” These troops targeted civilians, executed health care practitioners, and bombed villages — leaving one unfortunate soul to deal with the loss of twelve family members, including his wife and children. Is this a description of actions which make the world safer? Indeed not. And perhaps worse, this is but one of an innumerable number of US-sanctioned war crimes committed as of late. In fact, in the first half of 2019, the United States killed more civilians through air strikes alone than did the Taliban as a whole. Just a few months after this slaughter (or what we know of it) ended, Trump announced his decision to withdraw troops from Syria, essentially giving Turkey permission to move in and massacre the Kurds. A seemingly unjustifiable move, nobody to this day is quite sure why, despite bipartisan criticism, Trump decided to abandon the very allies in the region who were helping us locate al-Baghdadi. The result, as I wrote weeks ago, was chaos: Turkey immediately engaged in an offensive operation to remove the Kurdish people from the region. The Kurds, desperate for assistance and aware that the US would not lend its support, struck a deal with Bashar al-Assad of Syria, allowing Assad to deploy troops along the border and protect the Kurds from the Turkish offensive. Our national ego won’t allow us to admit that for decades, this has been the norm. Yes, the United States may boast the world’s mightiest military, strongest economy, and largest sphere of influence —indeed, we are undoubtedly a global hegemon. But we didn’t achieve that status accidentally. Decades of unnecessary military operations and destabilizing actions have allowed us to achieve our personal goals, often at the expense of foreign lives. It’s almost comical, in light of all this, that a President whose foreign policy has caused nothing but bloodshed and pain can even consider claiming that he has, in the pursuit of his own interests, made the word safer. And for an administration which uses our unmatched military power to carry out war crimes, his categorization of al-Baghdadi as “the world’s №1 terrorist” raises the question of what exactly he means by “the world.” Noam Chomsky wrote about this in Who Rules the World?. Terrorists Americans claim are “wanted the world over,” like al-Baghdadi, rarely cross the minds of, say, the innocent Afghanis we’re slaughtering abroad. To them, we are the terrorists wanted “the world over.” I don’t mean to draw a false equivalency here. But until we dispel with the fictitious narrative that all US intervention makes the world better off, our leaders will continue to receive praise for murdering suspected terrorists without capture or a fair, constitutionally-guaranteed trial. It’s time we stop pretending that the United States is innocent of atrocities on the global stage. We need to demand that our leaders stop exploiting, for political purposes, the vulnerability of those abroad. If all lives really do matter, then so do the Afghanis. And so do the Kurds. We have, as I said previously, unmatched military power. Perhaps we should start using it for good."

Medium.com,Society,Election time,World,https://medium.com/@efblake/election-time-2e9fcd50c88a?source=topic_page---------129------------------1," We’re fast becoming a nation of political junkies: wired into 24-hour political news culture, the armchair activism of social media, a background hum of Br*x*t and now it seems, we can no longer stay away from a polling booth. A fourth UK general election in 10 years is unlikely to give any answer as convincingly as the preceding four, which spanned the course of 18 years. The political landscape has become considerably more complex in the last decade, which has seen the outcomes of the Great Recession play out, the maturation of social media and the fracturing of the two-party system. Our democracy blithely asks voters to apply new rules to the old — and out-of-date system. The British electorate are being asked once again to decide on what path to the country will take over the next five years. Will an election fix a broken political system and a divided country? Despite the huge list of domestic issues that the UK is currently facing, the election is being framed in terms of a proxy referendum — a ‘Brexit election’ — just as it was in 2017. Labour’s position on Brexit is now clearer at any point in the last three years. The voters will now choose from the Conservative’s Withdrawal Agreement, Labour’s offer of a second referendum or the Lib Dem’s firm ‘Revoke and Remain’ stance. British politics is in crisis. A general election will not (likely) supply any party with a large enough mandate, and neither will a second referendum heal the gaping chasm caused by Brexit. Yet, in due course, both of these are required to fix the Brexit conundrum impasse and form a functioning government for the next parliament. The country is stuck in the mud. The next government must sooner-or-later ditch the first-past-the-post electoral system for proportional representation (PR) or the alternative voting (AV) system to galvanise our sense of democracy and give voters a sense that their vote is meaningful; PR was comprehensively rejected in a 2011 UK referendum, but this was still assumed the two-party monopoly was steadfast. The fracturing of political parties since 2015 — with the Conservative Party lurching further to the right, Labour moving further to the left, the rise and fall of UKIP, the renaissance of the Liberal Democrats as pro-EU and the stalking horse of the Brexit Party (and this is before mentioning the SNP in Scotland and Plaid Cymru in Wales), reflects the tribalism that is becoming entrenched in UK society. After nine years of power, it would seem logical that the Conservative Party has had its day. Yet, with most polls putting them roughly 11 points clear of Labour it’s likely they will be returned to power for another years with a small majority or a power share in a minority government. Much depends on the actions of Lib Dems voters at the ballot box: will they vote tactically in Labour/Conservative marginal seats to vote for a party least likely to offer Brexit? Corbyn’s Labour have failed to reach out beyond their base and many voters are unconvinced by the party’s hedged Brexit stance; the party has come in for huge criticism over its inability to deal with antisemitism, while Corbyn’s radical past has also been used to demonstrate his lack of suitability to lead the country. Labour have failed (so far) to amplify and persuade floating voters with their positive radical policies of public investment, and at times fail to demonstrate the easy charm of government-in-waiting. Despite being behind in most recent polling, the truth is that nobody knows how Labour will perform at the ballot box. Labour’s best hope for the keys to power remain not in increasing their share of the vote, but in the hope that moderate Conservatives across the UK give their votes to the Liberal Democrats. Having seen key defections from both the Tories and Labour and returned good results in recent European elections, Jo Swinson and Lib Dems have a swagger about them. Their strong pro-remain message masks an absence of their wider policy objectives, and will no doubt fight the election on their flagship pro-EU pledge. Questions regarding their political integrity remain, having helped push through some of the more odious reforms — such as tripling tuition fees and cutting disability benefits — during their coalition with the Conservatives. During the course of this decade the Conservative Party have been the architects of division and impoverishment. A scorched-earth policy under the pretence of balancing the nation’s finances has resulted in a bitterly divided nation. They have won the ideological battle, but failed to win the the war. In 2010 upon taking office, they framed the global financial crisis as an issue created by the previous Labour government and set about slashing social support funding, the NHS and the education system. Rather than decreasing the nation’s debt, it has nearly doubled from £1.03 trillion to £2.2 trillion, spent mostly on tax cuts for their voter base. Indeed, research suggests the Conservatives and not Labour are the biggest borrowers for the public purse. But massively increasing the national debt while promising to reduce it, is among the lesser transgressions of the Conservative government. The cuts to the UK’s public services have almost exclusively been aimed at the country’s poorest and most vulnerable citizens. The last nine years have been an ideological attack by the Conservatives on a significant proportion of their own country. These include: This is by no means an exhaustive list of the way that the incumbent government has chipped away at civic society and led us to the current point, where we now blame the European Union for our social ills. This of course also fails to highlight the many ways and means it has also actively misled and lied to the public about the Brexit process, and the implications of uncoupling from the world’s largest trading bloc, and the second biggest economy after the United States. It is an astonishing fact that a deeply unpopular government have a double-digit lead in the opinion polls. The number will change over the coming weeks but it remains a troubling reality that a political party that has played so fast-and-loose with the truth — and public money — is not staring down the barrel at electoral annihilation. In less febrile times, this should would be the case. A winter election will suit the Tories, as turnouts are often lower during the winter months as will the fact that many students will have returned home for Christmas and might not be able to register to vote. However, a surge in younger voters registering might be good news for Labour: For the Lib Dems to to return a positive result and a gain in seats, they will hope for an informal positive alliance with Labour voters in Lib Dem — Conservative marginals. Neither Corbyn nor Swinson have any desire to formalise that pact, so it’s unlikely they will make the huge returns they’ve optimistically set. However, a huge factor that will come into play will be those eligible voters who have not registered. Political apathy and perhaps Brexit fatigue, might play some small part. Yet, with average household debt in the UK now reaching £15,400 per household (excluding mortgages), there are hidden thousands of eligible voters who live in fear of being traced by bailiffs and who have not registered themselves on the electoral roll. Needless to say, these people are unlikely to be Conservative voters. The insecure housing situation that many now face, might also play some part. There has been a 63% rise in the number of people using the private rental market, and nearly two-thirds of those have spent less than three years in the same accommodation. The precarious nature of private rented accommodation means that people are now moving with increasing frequency, which is likely to impact on electoral roll registration. A government that does so well out of a broken housing market is of course, going to be in no haste to change it: nearly a quarter of Conservative MPs have a property portfolio and are active landlords. How can society be fixed when the solution is to enrich those who are breaking it? The cronyism prevalent under the Conservatives is no better exemplified than by Adrian Beecroft, a major investor in the now-defunct payday loans company Wonga, which charged loans at an eye-watering 1,509%. Beecroft was a significant donor to the Conservatives — donating £800,000 to the party over a seven-year period including during the 2017 election campaign. Beecroft also authored a report for former Prime Minister David Cameron, which recommended slashing a swathe of employment rights and regulations, which led the way to the introduction of tribunal fees. The forthcoming election will likely offer parliament a wealth of new faces, but it is unlikely to provide fresh answers to the on-going Brexit dilemma. Sure, the UK will get another fix for its polling addiction — another barrage of information, counterclaims, debates and policy championing. It won’t be pleasant. This will not truly satisfy the country, a now insatiable nation: the shot in the arm that could cure or kill, is a second referendum that gives British democracy the final hit that it craves. It could be fatal."

Medium.com,Society,Kashmir: An Indian Diplomatic win,World,https://medium.com/discourse/kashmir-an-indian-diplomatic-win-90baf97596a2?source=topic_page---------132------------------1," How India Managed To Utilize Global Politics To Its Favor On Monday August 5th, the Indian Parliament passed The Jammu and Kashmir Reorganisation Bill, 2019. This ended the special status that Jammu and Kashmir maintained since it joined India. This move has been both criticized and praised by different sections of the public. The UNSC (United Security Council) held a closed door session, propelling this situation to the world stage. The Prime Minister of Pakistan spoke at the UNGA (United Nations General Assembly) mentioning India twenty-four times and likened the RSS (An organization that top BJP members belong to) to the Nazis. However, little has changed; India still maintains full control over its territory, and the global attention towards Kashmir has reduced over time. Two situations have allowed India to successfully pull off this political move: First, the domestic strength of the ruling party, BJP. Second, the global diplomatic situation which has allowed India to be an ally of the west and yet maintain a relationship with Russia and China. In 2014, campaigning on an anti-corruption policy, the BJP managed to form the government with a majority in parliament. For the first time since 1984, an Indian Government has had no official opposition as no other party won more than 10% of the seats in parliament. In Assembly elections (elections for state/territorial governments) the BJP has continued to gain seats and form governments. As of now the BJP, either by itself or through its allies, has formed governments in 22 of 31 states/territories. This raise in the popularity of the BJP, and more importantly Modi as a leader, has allowed the government to implement policy with the confidence that it will continue to maintain power. This confidence was bolstered by the 2019 election where the BJP won 303 of 543 ( 353 including BJP’s allies) seats in the parliament. They also hold a majority in the Upper House of the Indian Parliament (Rajya Sabha). With there being no official opposition in the lower house for the second time. Compare this with the situation in Pakistan. In the past 72 years (since Pakistan’s independence), Pakistan has been under a bureaucratic or a military rule for 45 years. This has resulted in Pakistan never being able to define its center of power. The current government of Pakistan holds a majority in the lower house of parliament as a result of allying with seven other parties. In the Pakistani senate, the current government holds only 40 of 104 seats. This has caused a lot of uncertainty for the ruling party. With an Economy that is being propped up by loans from the IMF (International Monetary Fund) and China, Pakistan does not have significant weight to leverage in global politics. This along with a number of other issues, has caused the public opinion in Pakistan to shift away from Kashmir. In a poll conducted by Gallup Pakistan, only 8% said ‘Kashmir’ compared with 53% who said ‘inflation’ and 23% who said ‘unemployment’ when asked, “In your opinion what is the biggest problem faced by Pakistan these days?”. This difference in the level of political power wielded by the governing parties of each country, combined with the difference in the issues faced by each country, has allowed India to commit more to the issue of Kashmir by taking on more risks politically, militarily and economically than Pakistan can afford. The Global balance of power also tilts in India’s favor on the Kashmir issue. US Aid to Pakistan has been cut every year Trump has been president. From a peak of around $1 Billion disbursed in 2016 to around $281 Million in 2019. With the ratio of Military Aid to Economic Aid going from 3:7 in 2016 to zero military aid in 2019. China on the other hand has been doubling down on its assistance to Pakistan. China has invested in numerous developmental projects in Pakistan. In exchange Chinese firms have received tax-breaks and generous lease agreements with the Pakistani Government to extract revenue. China continues to loan Pakistan money despite IMF’s warnings to Pakistan to remain cautious in seeking and accepting Chinese loans. In the next three years Pakistan will have to pay China more than the IMF as part of its loan payments. This difference in political, economic and military power causes Pakistan to be dependent on the political moves by bigger nations. It can seldom force an issue or a draw a definitive red line with the assurance that its allies will stand by it. We see this in regards to the Kashmir issue. Despite Pakistan’s efforts to drive global attention towards Kashmir, the global consensus has sided with India. When the United Nations Security Council met shortly after India passed The Jammu and Kashmir Reorganisation Bill, 2019, it failed to even reach a consensus on a statement to be released to the press. When Imran Khan (Pakistan’s Prime Minister) flew to the US to meet Trump, he had to do so on a plane provided by the Saudi government in order to save costs. The entire visit was not favourable to Pakistan. Trump has continued to state that the Kashmir issue is a bilateral matter but is willing to step in when asked. Even China has distanced itself from the issue. When Imran Khan recently visited China, the joint statement by the Ministry Of Foreign Affairs read, “The Chinese side responded that it was paying close attention to the current situation in Jammu and Kashmir and iterated that the Kashmir issue is a dispute left from history, and should be properly and peacefully resolved based on the UN Charter, relevant UN Security Council resolutions and bilateral agreements.” This basically translates to a holding pattern, or a statement of non-committal non-action on the part of China. At the same time, India has risen considerably on the global stage by expanding its relationship with a number of countries. By deepening its economic and cultural ties with the middle east, India has become enough of an integral partner to the middle east in order to ensure that their respective governments remain non-committal on sovereign issues. Saudi Arabia, Iran and Turkey have all released statements calling for the Kashmir issue to be dealt with on a bilateral level. India’s influence has expanded in the ‘west’ as well. In his recent event titled ‘Howdy Modi’ in Texas that Trump attended, around 50000 people were in attendance. In 2016, when Modi visited England, 60000 people attended an event where Modi and then-PM David Cameron spoke. Trump has even used a variant of Modi’s campaign slogan “Abki baar, Trump sarkar” to appeal more to Indian origin Americans. This level of reach and carefully constructed global relationships has allowed India to secure a political and diplomatic ‘win’ over Pakistan. Fully committing to its idea of sovereignty and ensuring that most countries remain non-committal to a ‘solution’, it has reduced the Kashmir conflict to a bilateral one, giving itself the clear advantage."
Medium.com,Society,Trump’s Misguided Iran Policy,World,https://medium.com/@helamansanchez/trumps-misguided-iran-policy-670519ac561?source=topic_page---------133------------------1," During the early hours of September 14, explosions broke out at an Aramco oil field in Saudi Arabia. As the Saudi government rushed to contain the blaze and investigate the attack, a group of Yemeni rebels, known as the Houthis, claimed responsibility for the bombing. Saudi Arabia soon began to suspect, however, that the perpetrator was likely its regional arch-nemesis, Iran, possibly with the assistance of the Houthi rebels. About a day after the attacks, and amidst international oil market chaos, Donald Trump tweeted from his personal Twitter account, “Saudi Arabia oil supply was attacked. There is reason to believe that we know the culprit, are locked and loaded depending on verification, but are waiting to hear from the Kingdom.” This isn’t the first time that Trump has come dangerously close to attacking Iran this year, the “culprit,” nor is it the administration’s most trivial reason for doing so. And while the Saudis got their fire under control within hours, Trump’s Iran foreign policy is a fire that has been blazing for two-and-a-half years with no end in sight. This administration’s foreign policy in Iran has been reckless and irresponsible, while completely failing to accomplish the goals ostensibly held by the President and his advisors. Trump claims that he wants to limit Iran’s nuclear capabilities and avoid armed conflict if possible. If peace and nuclear non-proliferation are truly Trump’s goal, his choice to pull out of the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA), a peaceful, multilateral agreement that put strong limits on Iran’s nuclear development, is perplexing. Since then, Trump’s Iran policy has been guided by a new campaign dubbed “maximum pressure,” characterized by successive rounds of tariffs and saber-rattling on Twitter and in the press room. Since the U.S. withdrawal from the JCPOA, Iran has been making several displays of aggression to indicate the leverage it has in both regional power relations and global oil markets. Just this year, Iran attacked and captured several commercial oil tankers, shot down an American drone, and now, attacked Saudi oil fields. For a president who claims mastery in the “art of the deal,” Trump’s strategy of throwing out the previous deal to get a better one doesn’t seem to be working. In fact, it seems more likely to lead to war than to successful negotiations. To be fair, it’s not just Trump being a blithering idiot; he has some understandable reasons to be dealing with Iran in the way he is. However, none of these reasons justify the risk of throwing the world into another unending war in the Middle East. First, Trump has a political incentive to declare Obama’s JCPOA a failure and to force Iran to give him a victory to place on his scoreboard. The Iran deal was just one of many Obama-era actions that Trump reversed within the first year-and-a-half of his presidency. Interestingly, the deal Trump now claims to want from Iran sounds almost identical to the original JCPOA that he rejected. Politics should never be the reason that our president acts against the best interest of the American people, especially when it involves jeopardizing our national security. Another pressure for Trump indubitably comes from his notoriously hawkish advisors: Secretary of State Mike Pompeo and former National Security Advisor John Bolton. Iran hawks have advocated for regime change ever since the 1979 Iranian revolution and the ensuing hostage crisis in Tehran, justifying their opposition to the Iranian regime on ideological grounds. They fear the influence of Iran’s anti-Western Islamic radicalism with Marxist influences will embolden other Middle Eastern ideologues hostile to the U.S. Whatever one’s belief about our ideological differences with Iran, it is important to keep in mind that previous American intervention to topple hostile regimes has almost always ended in disaster. There is no more poignant example than when the CIA led a coup of Iran’s democratically elected government in 1953, setting the pieces in place for Iran’s deep mistrust of the United States and the eventual revolution in 1979. The third, and most foolish, motivation for Trump’s Iran policy comes from the “special relationships” that we have with Israel and Saudi Arabia. The two most prominent reasons for our long-standing alliances with Saudi Arabia and Israel come down to business and ideology. The danger with these relationships, however, is that we might compromise the values that are so fundamental to our identity on the world stage. In recent months, we have compromised our values for business and ideological relationships too many times. Examples include Trump’s refusal to accept the intelligence community’s assessment that journalist Jamal Khashoggi was killed by the Saudi state and American complicity in both war crimes on Yemeni civilians by Saudi Arabia and in civil rights abuses committed by Israel against Palestinians. The Trump administration urgently needs to change the way it approaches our relationship with Iran before war breaks out; otherwise, we risk losing more credibility on the world stage. A good first step was for President Trump to fire John Bolton, one of the most vocal voices for regime change in Iran. What we need now is to reinitiate diplomatic negotiations with Iran and make sure that our values are driving foreign policy. Many of the faults I have outlined in the United States’ current foreign policy towards Iran did not start with President Trump. But unless Trump does something to change the current trajectory of the relationship, he may well be the one to end it."

In her post, she publicly shamed her father for his violent behaviour towards her, her sister, and their mother. The post was widely noticed: Seljan’s father Fuad Gahramanli happens to be a prominent opposition activist and the deputy chairman of the Azerbaijan Popular Front party. Half of those who left comments under Seljan’s Facebook post believed she did the right thing, while others suggested she was mentally ill for calling out her father’s behaviour. Members of her father’s political party tended to see Gahramanli as the victim. This is because in conservative Azerbaijan, domestic violence is seen as a strictly private concern — by no means should it leave the household, no matter the cost. With her post, Seljan had broken several stereotypes: a daughter had gone against her father, spoke of those who told her mother to keep it quiet and shamed the leader of her father’s party for not publicly addressing the matter. In this case, not only did the victim raise the subject openly but sparked a nationwide conversation. In a rare case of victory, Gahramanli has since resigned as deputy chairman of the party — though he has not yet publicly apologized for his behaviour towards his family. But the post did more than just that: it prompted a larger conversation about violence against women in Azerbaijan and how it is perceived. Over a month after Seljan’s post, multiple reports of cases of domestic violence have started making headlines in Azerbaijan. Over the space of just five days in early October, Azerbaijani media reported on 12 separate cases of domestic abuse against women, each citing a police report. Four women died in these cases. Furthermore, the independent news outlet Mikroskop reported that from January to September 2019 alone, 118 cases of violence and abuse against women have been reported by Azerbaijani media; 33 of the victims died as a result of sustained injuries, while the rest were hospitalised from their injuries. Stabbing is the leading cause of injury. Read more: How one journalist sparked Armenia’s #MeToo moment Azerbaijanis are now speaking out about domestic violence online and in the media. Women are sharing their stories under the hashtags #qadınaşiddətəson‬ (“end violence against women”) ‪and #Leylaüçünsusma (“don’t stay silent for Leyla” a reference to a recent case where a woman in Baku was stabbed more than a dozen times.)‬ And they’re also taking to the streets. On October 20, a group of civil society activists organised a public demonstration in Azerbaijan’s capital Baku under the slogan “ Don’t tolerate it! March! “ (#DözməYürüşEt). In its description, the group wrote: Recently, countless cases of domestic violence and murders of women have been noted in Azerbaijan. We’ve read stories of women who are beaten, killed or forced to commit suicide by their family members, or run over by cars. Therefore, we will be marching from the statue of [the Azerbaijani poet and daughter of the Khan of Karabakh] Khurshudbanu Natavan […] to raise our voices against this atrocity, to say no to violence against women, and to draw the attention of society and the state towards these problems. At the end of the march, we will make a statement on the issue. The march is open to all who are not indifferent. One of the main slogans of the march will be “don’t be silent against violence, don’t tolerate violence! This was not the country’s first progressive protest march this year on women’s rights. The first was held on International Women’s Day on March 8 and raised awareness on violence against women, underage marriages, and sex-selective abortions in Azerbaijan. But when a small group of Azerbaijani women and some men marched and called for an end to violence against women on October 20, they were themselves met with police violence. Some of these scenes can be seen in the following video report by the BBC’s Azerbaijani service: The sad irony was not lost on protesters: Here I am, learning to fly on Torgovaya Street [where the arrests took place] No comment Participants in the protest also demanded that Azerbaijan sign the Istanbul Convention on preventing and combating violence against women and domestic violence. Azerbaijan has not yet signed the convention, which calls on governments to protect women from all forms of violence, combat domestic violence, and proactively promote equality between women and men. It also obliges them to design a comprehensive framework and policies to assist the victims of gender-based violence and engage in international cooperation to that end. But the protest has changed something. One day later, possibly due to the harsh public criticism of the aggressive police response, the Azerbaijani government’s Committee for Family, Women, and Children’s announced that they had submitted a proposal on the Istanbul Convention to parliament. However, the committee did not specify exactly when they had made the proposal, nor what exactly it contained. The committee also claims, despite not having ratified the Istanbul Convention, that they are actively working to promote women’s rights alongside other governmental institutions. But is it enough? It is worth bearing in mind that although Azerbaijan’s law on domestic violence, adopted in 2010, mandates the government to fund and create shelters for victims, that has still not happened. In fact, the women’s shelters that do operate in the country at present are established and run by various NGOs. The spokesman of the government committee told Mikroskop that the main reason for the lack of state-funded shelters is a lack of resources. Ultimately, while signing the Istanbul Convention would be a step in the right direction, it will not be enough to end domestic violence by itself. Entrenched social norms and gender stereotypes will also have to change. As Michelle Milford Morse, Vice President of the UN Foundation’s Girls and Women Strategy, said in a recent interview: “Violence against girls and women occurs because of long-standing, systemic gender inequality in countries all over the world. It’s rooted in discrimination, power differentials, and harmful social norms. And that’s why it continues today.” Azerbaijan is no exception. The disturbing numbers reported by Mikroskop are just the tip of the iceberg. It is very likely that there are many, many more crimes committed against women which we do not yet know about — in Azerbaijan, women are often encouraged to keep silent and never report any instances of domestic abuse. According to the aforementioned committee’s records, there are at least 800 cases of various violent “crimes and administrative offenses” every year, but they fear that even these numbers do not reflect the real situation, nor what proportion of them are incidents of domestic violence. And yet, in a country where violence against women is such an acute issue, a march to raise awareness to the problem is subject to aggressive police crackdown. Perhaps that answers the question as to why victims are afraid of going to the police in the first place."
Medium.com,Society,The Rock and Referendum Election,World,https://medium.com/essays-and-non-fiction/the-rock-and-referendum-election-d2713e0d8737?source=topic_page---------136------------------1," Since 2016 British politics has increasingly resembled the swansong tour of one of those rock bands with randomised umlauts.

The Brexit Party, on that note, are supposed to be a threat to everyone, but I’m not making up a band for them and here’s why: Nigel Farage was last seen coat-tailing Donald Trump in the US.

Just about the only person sticking to the agreed running order is Swingin’ Jo Swinson, whose Celine Dion power ballads are the soggy embrace desperately sought by mellower Conservative voters whose vicarage tea Party has abruptly turned into a gathering of all the awkward relatives they usually forget to invite. Maybe out of this unpromising lineup will come a vibrant new scene, but I can’t shake the feeling that this is less the UK’s political Burning Man than the Milton Keynes branch of Fyre Festival. No one really wants to be here. That’s to say that almost everyone is angry with the present situation — not wrongly, there’s plenty to be angry about — but only the most die-hard political headbangers are really looking forward to the UK’s third election in four years, especially when you factor in the better-than-average chance that it will resolve exactly nothing. For all that Boris Johnson has an apparent lead, it’s well within the margin of go-fuck-yourself in 2019. Similarly, you have to be a pretty optimistic Labour stalwart to see your party riding a wave of poll-inverting leftism to a majority in the House. Johnson’s lead and Corbyn’s 2017 surge notwithstanding, we could well be back here on 13th December with nothing to show for six weeks of angry and largely irrelevant bullshit. The problem isn’t really the House of Commons, after all: it’s Brexit. The House can’t agree because there is no reasonable middle any more. Even Brexiters don’t agree on what Brexit should look like. Like Boris Johnson, who denounced a sea border with Northern Ireland in fiery terms a few months ago and is now advocating one as an almost angelic solution to the impasse, they often don’t even agree with themselves. The Norway option, once touted as the thinking person’s politically liberating (rather than economically damaging) Brexit, is now an unmentionable and craven surrender. An afternoon is now a long time in politics. For all the thunder about how Parliament has failed to untangle the problem and must now be renewed (read “stacked”) to achieve a solution, actually if you think about it this Parliament has done pretty well in the face of exactly no help at all from the executive, the media, or the public. Various members have attempted to find compromises, however unpalatable, and been shot down by their own leaders and reviled in the red tops, and a number of talented people are just tired of the abuse and have handed in their notice. All the same, the House of Commons has fought hard and repeatedly won the right to perform its critical constitutional function: scrutiny and amendment of legislation in the public interest. Even the indicative voting process could have yielded a useful result, but Theresa May shut it down lest it deliver what seems to be the somewhat incoherent middle ground of staying in the Customs Union plus close relationship with (but not membership of) the Single Market, this posture to be confirmed by a second referendum. Both Labour and the Tories have run shy of a second referendum. Labour has belatedly embraced it — Corbyn was wriggling on the hook of whether he’d offer one against Remain on any deal until a fairly long way into this year — but still declined to get behind this most persuasive iteration of it, as advanced by Peter Kyle and Phil Wilson for what now feels like decades. The thing is that, absent a second referendum per se, this election will inevitably partly be one. The other (crucial) arguments about the future and near present of the UK will be lensed through Brexit, which is why the Tory party field is increasingly Buccaneer Brexity and the Liberal Democrats — until quite recently still in the national dog house because of the austerity coalition — are hoovering up votes from right and to some extent left as well. And since the country is demonstrably down to the wire on Brexit, it seems likely that even our clunky, blockish voting system will still manage to deliver a hung parliament. At which point: it’s Groundhog Day. Again. We already know, broadly, what the Tory manifesto will say. It’ll tumpet Johnson’s deal, claim to be the party of the NHS (wait, what?) and lean hard on Law N Order, low taxes and nebulous trade deal futures. But what will Labour’s say? Conference handed out some formidable policies. Will the party really incorporate a commitment to retain and even expand Freedom of Movement? I can’t imagine that it will, but if it did that would go a long way to drawing back strayed Remainer voters — at the cost of tabloid headlines of surpassing rage. Doubtful. Will it really write the Green New Deal with a 2030 target date into this manifesto, despite union misgivings? That would be HUGE. It might even be enough to cut through the Brexit noise, because what’s implied in that is more radical by far than anything else in the UK’s febrile political atmosphere. I’m guessing… not quite. The GND will be in there, but there’ll be some careful framing and the target date may go missing. I care deeply about that — and so should you — but I don’t think a lot of column inches will be burned on it between now and 12th December. No. This will be, like it or not, another Brexit election. It seems that direct democracy really does beget direct democracy. The referendum didn’t get Brexit out of the way; incomplete and undefined, Brexit has infected every subseqent public vote with a quality of referendumness. Sir John Curtice told LBC recently that we might elect more than 100 MPs not from the two main parties. That makes it harder for the Conservatives, because they have few friends in the rest of the House. Labour doesn’t have to win this election outright to unseat the Tories; we, the electorate, just have to deny Johnson his majority and install one which favours fact over the Brexit dreamscape. Vote smart, for the best or least-worst option, and finally, when we’ve done that and resolved this four-year shouting match, we could have something approaching functional politics to tackle the crises of this moment which are not self-inflicted, but external, structural, and real."

oday Britain was, once again, supposed to leave the European Union. Three days ago, once again, the EU extended the deadline. And on Tuesday, once again, the Houses of Parliament voted for a general election.

If it looks like Groundhog Day from a distance, try living as part of it for the last four and a half years. During which time we have had a referendum, three leadership elections in two different parties, two general elections with a third in six weeks’ time. I always hated that film, hated the main character’s character, hated how he ‘got the girl’, hated its facile humour. But at least, in movie terms, it had a happy ending. The British version is unlikely to be so cheerful. What’s worse is that this whole thing was dictated by party politics not economics, as David Cameron tried to quell a wing of his party that were un-quellable. Now the Tory infighting has become the country’s identity and no one is likely to be happy with the outcome. If we leave Europhile Remainers are unhappy and, I’m sure, many Leavers will be when they discover the true cost of losing free trade. If we stay, the Leavers will kvetch about the ‘brown’ people. Because, let’s face it, as A A Gill put it so succinctly before the first vote that got us into this mess, this is all about Johnny Foreigner.

Every economist agrees that leaving will damage the country. Johnson and his mates will asset strip. Hedge-fund managers will make millions, whilst pensioners won’t be able to afford food. Tax evasion will continue to be an accepted practice, since many argue that avoiding new tax-evasion laws is driving this whole agenda, whilst the basic infrastructure that that pays for collapses. I have just come from a country that is somewhat broke: Greece. And whilst there are plenty of shiny 4x4s, the roads they drive on are full of holes, unmarked and precipitous, a bit like their economy."
Medium.com,Society,Statement by Vice President Joe Biden on Donald Trump’s Repeated Diplomatic Failures,World,https://medium.com/@JoeBiden/statement-by-vice-president-joe-biden-on-donald-trumps-repeated-diplomatic-failures-2e8bc4a84e84?source=topic_page---------138------------------1," This morning, North Korea fired two missiles in a deliberate attempt to provoke its neighbors and intimidate the United States — again. It was the 12th such test the regime has conducted since May in violation of UN resolutions, and which President Trump has down-played. After the latest round of denuclearization talks collapsed almost immediately in Stockholm earlier this month, these tests are a stark reminder that Donald Trump — a self-proclaimed deal maker — has achieved nothing but a string of spectacular diplomatic failures that are making the American people less safe. His “love letters” to murderous dictator Kim Jong Un have delivered little more than made-for-TV moments. North Korea today has more fissile material and more capability than when talks began, and Trump has given away our leverage — including suspending military exercises with our allies and granting Kim co-equal status at two summits with the president of the United States of America — for practically nothing in return. Now a more confident Kim is ticking up the pace of his violations because he believes he can pressure Trump to bend to his will. There is no deal, because there is no strategy and no patience for the kind of tough, hard diplomacy that actually produces results. It’s a pattern we see over and over again. Donald Trump talks a big game, promises the greatest deal ever, then gives away America’s best negotiating tools in exchange for a photo op for himself. He only cares about his own self-aggrandizement and self-enrichment. And every single time, it’s the American people who end up paying. He pulled us out of the successful Iran nuclear deal, promising he’d get a better one. He hasn’t. And now, Iran has taken its nuclear program out of the deep-freeze and ramped up its aggressive acts across the region — and Trump has no strategy to deal with these predictable responses. He pulled us out of the Paris climate accord and dismisses climate change as a hoax. In less than a week, we will officially notify our departure from Paris, even as California is on fire and states throughout the Midwest are still recovering from record flooding over the summer. He scuttled negotiations with the Taliban that might have opened the door to a peace settlement, reportedly because he didn’t get the Camp David moment of glory he wanted. Meanwhile he’s significantly weakened our negotiating position by imposing a possibly politically-motivated timeline for removing our troops from Afghanistan, without extracting any concessions from the Taliban in return. His vaunted Middle East peace deal has yet to emerge. He gave away our strongest asset to take on ISIS by precipitously withdrawing our troops from Northeast Syria. He promised to get tough with China, saying trade wars were “good and easy to win.” But at more than a year in, what do we have to show for it? Nothing but pain for American farming and manufacturing, and vague promises that would only restore trade levels with China back to where they were before Trump’s irresponsible trade war. The American people can’t afford four more years of Donald Trump’s art of no deals."

Medium.com,Society,Russia Is About to Disconnect From the Internet: Here’s What That Means,World,https://medium.com/pcmag-access/russia-is-about-to-disconnect-from-the-internet-heres-what-that-means-7e05318753a7?source=topic_page---------140------------------1," Russia plans to activate a version of the internet that’s walled off from the rest of the world, ostensibly so it can protect itself in the event of a cyber attack. But experts argue the move might do the country more harm than good. By Adam Smith Russia intends to disconnect from the internet on November 1—in theory. A long-planned bill will go into effect and lay the foundation for a national network whereby internet service providers are controlled by Roskomnadzor, Russia’s telecom agency. The goal is to give Russia the power to disconnect from the global internet in the event of a cyberwar, and in the interim, to serve up a government-sanctioned, walled-off version of the web. It also gives Russian President Vladimir Putin greater control over Russian citizens. Details of the bill are sketchy. Russian news agency RIA-Novosti says the aim is to provide a “sustainable, secure, and fully functioning” internet. And it will reportedly do so by developing its own version of the internet’s address system. Russians attempting to reach international sites will instead be directed to Russian versions. Citizens hoping to visit Facebook, for example, might be redirected to Russian social network VK. Russian officials have argued that this so-called sovereign internet will protect the country from harm, but experts argue it could make Russia—and the entire open web—more vulnerable to attack. With all the talk of clouds and wireless connectivity, many people think of the internet as ephemeral. But it’s powered by vast server farms, interconnected cables, and networking infrastructure that cross borders and oceans. That makes it difficult to control, which is why Russia’s law targets the internet’s address book, the Domain Name System (DNS). In essence, the DNS converts a web address (such as www.pcmag.com) into an IP address (such as 192.168.1.1) that fetches the site you want. Russia’s system uses a proxy to steer packets of information away from the public DNS resolver by default, check where the data is located, and either let that information through, redirect it, or block it completely. We see examples of this kind of control in Saudi Arabia, Turkey, and China. But Russia might have some difficulty in recreating China’s Great Firewall, in part because Russia’s internet was built to be open, according to Alex Henthorn-Iwane, VP of Product Marketing for network monitoring company ThousandEyes. China restricted its web access from the start: The Communist Party legislated in 1996 (two years after the internet arrived there) that all service providers must be licensed by the government and that all internet traffic must go through state-owned telecommunication companies. Since then, it’s poured vast amounts of money into the effort, and the Chinese internet still is not completely airtight. Russia has reportedly spent about $300 million on its sovereign internet plan. But while the country has restricted access to certain services in recent years—from VPNs to encrypted messaging apps—Henthorn-Iwane says it’s unlikely the Russian government will be able to exert the level of control China has accomplished with its Great Firewall by November 1. “One of the major benefits about the internet is [its] cross-border trade mechanism, and Russia won’t be able to replicate every single service that is provided by non-Russian companies,” Henthorn-Iwane says. “If China allows Western companies to use SAAS (software as a service) tools, that tells you it’s not realistic. Office 365, or Salesforce, I would imagine they’re going to have to keep open, if they want to attract foreign direct investment.” Also, China has also fostered a powerful e-commerce and mobile app ecosystem while Russia hasn’t, which makes it less likely that Russia will ever actually turn its internet off. The plan is also questionable from a cybersecurity standpoint. “If cyber criminals or nation-states want to infiltrate and infect a machine, to command and control, you don’t need a lot of bandwidth. You could have a cross-border cell phone to get on the internal internet of the country. For that matter, you could have people inside the country, which all major states do, to enable cyber warfare.” Yet despite the low likelihood of Russia closing the doors on external internet connections, the proposed policy is indicative of a greater trend among governments: creating a “splinternet.” The term was first used in 2001 to describe “parallel internets,” or multiple privately-run networks that exist to avoid heavy-handed and changing government regulation. “Splinternet” is now more likely to describe secondary networks run by those governments. The concept is not alien to the West. San Francisco–based Twitter, which regularly comes under criticism from users in the United States for not taking enough action against white supremacists and other bad actors, is required by law to block those same harmful users in Germany. Google has also agreed to change names and borders on its mapping products upon request from certain governments. GDPR regulation, meanwhile, means many US news publishers are unable to show their content in European countries because of how they store data on European citizens. The amount of regulatory control governments place on the internet is a sliding scale based on political ideology. For some, that’s shutting the internet off completely (or, at least, attempting to), while others focus on how data can or can’t move across countries. And while the American view of the internet—heavily influenced by its history of free markets and free speech—might be closer in theory to the open internet that was proposed by the web’s pioneers, the hegemony of Silicon Valley has created a situation in which the majority of the internet is under the de facto control of the US government. Google parent company Alphabet, for example, dominates how many people around the world access the web, whether that’s through search, its browser (Chrome), or its operating system (Android or Chrome OS). But should the US government wish to exercise its control in the name of security, as it did with Huawei, that would be entirely possible. In a world of splinternets, it’s easier to say you have an open system when the nexus of power is within your borders. The future will likely bring more legislation like Russia’s, albeit with varying degrees of severity."

Medium.com,Society,Europe — in or out.,World,https://medium.com/@garyneal_19697/europe-in-or-out-146ae3f748ba?source=topic_page---------142------------------1," A citizen’s perspective. Sir Winston Churchill quoted in 1957:- “ We genuinely wish to join the European free trade area, and if our continental friends wish to reach agreement, I am quite sure a way can be found and that reasonable adjustments can be made to meet the essential interests of all.” The UK joined the European Community in 1973 under Edward Heath, later ratified by a referendum in 1975 under Harold Wilson. So what went wrong? For the last 3 1/2 years, the politicians and citizens of the United Kingdom(UK) have been torn between those wanting to remain in the European Union and those wanting to leave. If the majority of the politicians in the UK had wanted to leave, the UK would have been out by now. A BBC survey showed the following results for MPs who had announced their intentions: 73% wanted to stay in the EU, 27% wanted to leave. The results of the 2016 referendum gave 52% of the voters wanting to leave, 48% wanting to stay, and that I suspect is why the current impasse exists. So where does democracy lie, with the people or the politicians? If you look at a voting map of the UK, all of Scotland wanted to remain, most of England wanted to leave with small pockets of remain, notably around London. In Northern Ireland, the majority was to remain. The vote was very close and it has split the country. The argument came down to money and control. The money the UK pays into the European Union and the lack of control they have in running the country. But with the control came benefits, the most important being the freedom of movement of people, goods and services. You could be a citizen of the United Kingdom and work relatively freely in any member state of the European Union. The same with goods which could be moved freely due to the elimination of customs duties and trade quotas. The membership fee is distributed to other member states, depending on their needs, some of which included the United Kingdom. Immigration was probably the most emotionally charged of them all. People coming to the UK and swamping public resources provided by the National Health Service and the benefits system. And, although immigration has generally been good, the infrastructure has not been expanded to cope with it. Currently, most people struggle to get a doctor’s appointment within two weeks. Facebook didn’t help at the time; my newsfeed was constantly showing me the images of immigrant floods, criminal behaviour of immigrants and immigrants being accommodated in five-star hotels. Obviously, since then, the actions of Cambridge Analytica have come to light Another point to consider is that the UK is an island nation and this tends to make them a little insular and did help to define the British identity. The British have always claimed to be British and not European. Neither were they invaded during the Second World War so there’s no shared experience. The leave campaign was fond of using this particular Churchill “quote.” “We have our own dream and our own task. We are with Europe, but not of it. We are linked but not combined. We are interested and associated but not absorbed. If Britain must choose between Europe and the open sea, she must always choose the open sea.” Sadly, this is two quotes 23 years apart. “We have our own dream and our own task. We are with Europe, but not of it. We are linked but not combined. We are interested and associated but not absorbed.” This was written in 1930 for America’s Saturday Evening Post and reflected on the extent and influence of the British Empire. A United Europe was only a pipe dream. The second part, “If Britain must choose between Europe and the open sea, she must always choose the open sea.” was not said by Churchill after the war, but during the war on the eve of D day and came about during a row with De Gaulle over the American involvement in the Second World War. The full quote is:- “We are going to liberate Europe, but it is because the Americans are with us. So get this quite clear. Every time we have to decide between Europe and the open sea, it is always the open sea we shall choose. Every time I have to choose between you [De Gaulle] and Roosevelt, I will always choose Roosevelt.” Now it is 2019 and the UK is not much further than it was 3 1/2 years ago. A deal has sort of been agreed, but the Government does not have the majority to push the Bill through for the 31st October deadline. An extension has been agreed with the EU, so the details of the Bill can be properly scrutinised (although cynics would say ‘create further delay ‘). An election has been proposed for the 12th December. And the citizens are confused, angry and frustrated. A democratic vote was taken 3 1/2years ago to leave the EU. Where does democracy lie?"

Yesterday, Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey announced he would be banning all political advertising from his platform. In his view, political support “should be earned, not bought.” Unsurprisingly, Mark Zuckerberg has come under fire following this announcement, with demands to know whether Facebook would also implement such a ban. Zuckerberg appears to have doubled down on Facebook’s policy and confirmed the platform would continue to run political ads. In a teleconference with journalists he said: “In a democracy, I don’t think it’s right for private companies to censor politicians or the news.” Instead the company has committed to investing in greater transparency about who is paying for ads and how much is being spent. These responses are reflective of two common approaches to dealing with seemingly intractable problems — both of which are gaining ground more broadly. So the question is: who’s right?"

oday is October 31st, 2019, the second time we were meant to leave the E.U. From my tiny Shoreditch flat, I see autumn stirring with majestic ease and am celebrating with Spanish Rioja a few more months being an E.U. citizen. When it comes to no-deal Brexit, despite the politics, xenophobia and general national shame, there is something else equally important to be concerned about: where am I going to get my bresaola? That may sound a bit pretentious, but even the most iconic of British foods like fish and chips or chips with chips may be challenging to make in a post-Brexit world. Frozen potatoes from the Netherlands and fish from Norway is just the start of what is a complicated economic story of where our ingredients come from. So what can I do? I’ve grown accustomed to the spoils of all-year Dutch cherry tomatoes, Irish steak, Spanish lemons, Italian Burrata and French wine. Even yoghurt may be labelled a luxury good without a deal. I have decided to anticipate the worst, and started thinking about what foods may be available should we lose access to the E.U. market. What does a no-deal diet look, and more importantly, taste like? To do this properly, I’m going to need economic data and recipes. My journey takes me from the humble isles of the local Sainsbury’s to the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organisation (FAO) report and finally, the kitchen. Did you know we exported 50 million dollars of wine to France in 2016? It’s true! Without further delay, here are seven Post-Brexit safe recipes served with a side of economic insight. Bon appetite. Note: For additional irony, I have adapted these recipes from every Italian grandmother’s favourite cookbook — The Silver Spoon. Most of us will have a memory, perhaps from childhood, probably involving a plastic bag of stale bread, when we were harangued by one of these quarrelsome birds who had seemingly woken up on the wrong side of the pond. This recipe could be substituted for chicken of which the U.K. produces 81% of its supply, but the chance of getting even with those geese is too good to pass up. It is worth noting Britain imports 99% of its frozen potatoes from the E.U. mostly for things like chips, but we produce 97% of our own fresh supply. Plenty to go round! When you think Britain, how often do you think beetroot? The only time I’ve ever seen a British person eating beetroot is when tentatively sampling borscht. The U.K. beet industry it turns out is one of the most competitive in the world, producing 100 tones per hectare and setting crop yield records in 2018. To be fair, we mostly grow beets for sugar, but surely it’s not too much of a stretch to imagine it being used for all kinds of foods. Britons eat 13 billion shelled eggs every year, and around 96% of those eggs are produced here in the U.K. — hurray! We do import a-lot of liquid eggs from the Netherlands, but most of those end up in cakes and pastries (we don’t need more reasons to eat unhealthily, thank you). As an added bonus you may be delighted to hear British is a massive shellfish producer, but most of our stock gets exported. Some oyster farmers are concerned that this will impact their bottom line — $549 million in 2015 to be exact. This recipe is here to help them out and ensure sure you are getting your daily dose of iodine. Greg Elwell once stated in the Oklahoma Gazette: “Lobster is fancy. If you imagine a lobster talking, it probably has a British accent. Draw an animated lobster, and I bet you’ll include a top hat, a monocle, and an opera cape.” Well, not any more. Thanks to the wonder of excess supply and Brexit trade embargos, this food, once associated with poverty, is about to make a comeback to your proletariat dinner plate. Ah, dumb, directionless, defenceless sheep. I recall a story from 2005 where Turkish shepherds watched in horror as hundreds of their flock followed each other over a cliff. Can you picture it? 1,500 sheep, each walking off a cliff, one after the other. We currently export 98% of our lambs to the E.U. They are in fact so plentiful that in the event of a no-deal Brexit, Boris Johnson is reportedly planning to buy almost the entirety of Wales’s lambs. Quite what the Prime Minister intends to do with £500m of lambs is not clear. “Are we going to give schoolchildren lamb stew, but no fruit and vegetables?” asks an audibly frustrated Tim Lang, a professor of food policy at London’s City University. Please don’t leave lambs to idle and contemplate a lemming induced fate, cook one instead. This dish, despite its continental name, was stolen from the British and improved upon by the thieving French in 1691. Like most things Brexit we are here to reclaim independence of this dessert, bring it home and turn it into the burnt sugar crash inducing dish nobody wanted, but half the population maintain was a good idea. Thanks to a no-deal, Brits could soon be swimming in milk. U.K. cows produce 80% of all milk produced in Britain, providing plenty for breakfast cereal or dessert trifles. Pair that with some beetroot sugar, eggs and a few hours and soon we will show the E.U. how to make a proper custard. As more E.U. nationals are leaving amid concerns about freedom of movement millions of apples were recently left to rot in U.K. orchards — how selfish. Thats fine though because they will all be missing out on this delightful cake. Oh sure they can get apples in Europe, and sure the recipe is Italian. Still, only the British have gone to the trouble of investing in the cultivation of sour, cooking apples: Howgate Wonder, Grenadier, Lord Derby and, of course, the Bramley. Britain imports more than 476,000 tonnes of apples, but only export 14,800 tonnes (3%) of our own. The good news is that we can substitute all those sweet continental apples with our glorious sour ones. Enjoy! (P.S. Seriously, make this cake — its amazing and really easy. I made some for my friends, and one person actually said it tasted like their Italian grandmothers — biggest compliment ever). Wine is the U.K.’s most valuable food import, totalling more than £2bn a year. In principle, this could be replaced by increased imports from other countries, such as Australia and Chile, but that would mean saying goodbye to champagne, prosecco and cava. But it’s not all bad news though — we export around £4.5 billion in Whisky annually, much of it going to the E.U. or to countries which have trade deals with the E.U. About 20 million casks of Whisky are currently maturing in Scotland, and the country could always tap its barley fields to brew beer. Be sure to do your part and treat yourself to a tipple tonight, on the house of course, which is currently on fire, with my dreams slowly burning away. Happy Brexit everyone."
Medium.com,Society,"Brexit, Immigration and Political Divide",World,https://medium.com/@andrewhorton_85407/brexit-immigration-and-political-divide-5165df8e815d?source=topic_page---------146------------------1," “Credulity is a greater evil in the present day than it ever was before, because, owing to the growth of education, it is much easier than it used to be to spread misinformation, and, owing to democracy, the spread of misinformation is more important than in former times to the holders of power.” – Bertrand Russel. This article is not about the merits or failings of the UK’s immigration policies. Rather, it is an examination of some of the ways the topic of immigration was handled before, and during, the Brexit campaign while considering some of the negative impacts the discourse has had on British politics and public relations. The topic of immigration is nuanced and there are few easy answers. However, there are good and bad ways to have discussions, and when it comes to people’s national identities and their sense of belonging, I feel it is fair to be critical of those who have been excessively divisive, or who have not taken seriously their responsibility as leaders. Whether you support Remain or Leave, all of us are responsible for maintaining civil discourse, and it appears evident that many of us in the public, as well as those in the press, have regularly failed to achieve this end. With that said, there will be no intended unfounded accusations or belittling of those mentioned in the article. If I have misrepresented anyone, I apologise in advance. “We will take steps to take net migration back to the levels of the 1990s — tens of thousands a year, not hundreds of thousands.” David Cameron – Conservative Manifesto. There is no doubt that one of the most significant motivators for the majority of Brexit voters was immigration. Net migration peaked at 336,000 in 2015 and as of March 2019, while declining significantly after the referendum, was still recorded as high as 226,000. Many believe this to be unsustainable. During previous UK election cycles, immigration was a much-debated topic. It was clear that vocal sections of the electorate, as well as press outlets like The Daily Mail, were beginning to put pressure on the Conservative Party to address the issue. As a result, David Cameron pledged for net migration levels to be reduced to the tens of thousands in 2010 and, in the years to follow, was critical of the EU’s single market rule on freedom of movement. At the same time, the Syrian civil war displaced millions of people causing the refugee crisis and a desperate need to provide humanitarian aid. In 2015, Angela Merkel agreed to take hundreds of thousands of refugees into Germany and David Cameron committed to taking in 20,000 by the year 2020. To those already concerned with immigration in 2010, by 2015, there appeared to be a demand that, not only their voice be heard, but that action be taken. The call for change on immigration continued to be championed by popular tabloids and they inevitably fuelled further discussions. In 2016, The Migration Observatory at The University of Oxford found: “An apparent change in how immigration is discussed, with a significant decline in discussion of the legal status of migrants and an increase in the focus on the scale of migration from 2009 onwards. This was accompanied by a rise in the relative importance of discussion relating to ‘limiting’ or ‘controlling’ migration since 2010.” Finally, in February 2016, David Cameron announced that the government would be proposing the In/Out referendum on Britain’s status as an EU country. The political backdrop could not be clearer — immigration and refugees had dominated political discourse the year prior and were going to be key to the Brexit campaign also. Reporting on a study conducted at King’s College London involving 15,000 articles written for 20 different outlets, The Guardian shared that: “Media interest in immigration more than tripled during the 10-week campaign, rising faster than any other political issue and appearing on 99 front pages, compared with 82 about the economy. Most of these front pages (79) were published by pro-leave newspapers.” The economy was written about more times than immigration, yet the latter is what captured attention more vividly. With such a strong emphasis on the topic, there is little doubt that it would help shape the opinions of those already sceptical about Britain’s immigration policy. With that said, the focus on immigration should not be considered a problem in itself due to the desire for discourse across many areas of the country. Instead, the problem lies with some of the attempts to persuade voters that primarily sought to provoke fear. Here are three high-profile examples: These examples, as well as the constant general coverage, evidently helped to create an environment where many people felt worried about immigration and the social impacts it was having/ was going to continue to have if the UK remained in the EU. Referring to a survey done by British Social Attitudes (BSA) of nearly 3000 people, The Independent reported: “Nearly three-quarters (73 per cent) of those who are worried about immigration voted Leave, compared with 36 per cent of those who did not identify this as a concern, the research found, showing the discrepancy in views about immigration between Remain and Leave voters.” These types of findings are particularly interesting when compared to the demographic data of areas that voted overwhelmingly to leave. The top 5 highest Leave-voting areas of Boston, South Holland, Castle Point, Thurrock and Great Yarmouth all had relatively modest numbers of net-migration in 2015/16. This indicates that people in these areas, who were most concerned with immigration, might not have had a lived experience of the impacts the media was speaking of. The data here does not invalidate their concerns but it does suggest that they were/are concerned for something they perceive to be a future problem rather than something directly impacting them now to any great extent. Equally, they might feel as if other areas of the country don’t benefit from immigration as much as is claimed. It is for these areas of the country that the media had a particularly important duty to report on the topic of immigration as fairly and objectively as possible. Instead, it is conceivable that the more sensational images and claims made their way through and were discussed more than data showing a more nuanced narrative. The short answer to this hypothetical question is no. As previously stated, discussions about immigration clearly needed to be had since so many people felt that it was a concern. But those discussions should have been conducted in a measured way with politicians and journalists being held to account when failing to be honest. For instance, all three examples highlighted above were conducted by major influencers in the run up to the referendum: Leave.EU, Vote Leave and Nigel Farage. They could have delivered the same or similar points without the divisive rhetoric. If there is/was a threat of people coming illegally into the country, why fake a video and not just report on it legitimately? Why feel the need to have a poster of non-EU refugees crossing a border that has little to do with the UK when your aim is to lower immigration levels from the EU? And why lie about Turkey joining the EU while insinuating that large numbers would come instantaneously through our “open” door when that was simply not the case? There were of course people who were having sensible debates and using factual claims (a topic for a future article), it is just a shame that the political discourse across the UK failed to focus on those people. Instead, the focus was on the most simplistic messages and slogans that failed to provide adequate details to truly inform voters. This doesn’t mean that all Brexit voters were uninformed and lacked relevant details — that would be extremely patronising for anyone to say. I, for one, know that my knowledge of the EU and immigration was poorer than I would have liked at the time of the vote, so I certainly cannot judge. It would also be wrong to say that the media had a direct cause and effect relationship to people’s opinions on immigration, or that the posters and videos “won” the referendum. But they would have helped shape the discourse since millions of people would have seen them. Therefore, it would be naïve to think they had no impact either. In the Reuters Institute Digital News Report (2017) it was described how public trust in the media had declined, presumably because of the “polarising Brexit campaign.” There was also a trend towards news being accessed through social media. Much has been said about the lack of policing by websites like Facebook over the use of targeted ad campaigns. Whether “fake news” had a profound impact on the decisions of many voters is questionable. What is not questionable is that this type of campaigning has done nothing to build trust or to accurately inform voters with the detail needed to make a life changing decision. The lasting result of this lack of trust is unknown but, at the moment, there are pockets of the population who are disillusioned with the press and with UK democracy. “The Home Office (2017) shows there were 80,393 hate crime offences recorded in 2016/17, compared with 62,518 the year before, a 29 per cent increase…While the increase in police recorded crime can be partially attributed to greater reporting, the Home Office report is unequivocal in detailing a genuine rise in hate crime, particularly around the EU Referendum.” Perhaps the most important point of reflection following the referendum, and how it was handled by campaigners and journalists, is the effects it has had on the social fabric of the UK. A rise in hate crimes hints at the possibility that the rhetoric of “taking back control” and “wanting our country back” could be translated by a minority of people as licence to belittle and harm those who they believe don’t belong. “It is clear from your internet and other researches that your inspiration is not love of country or your fellow citizens, it is an admiration for Nazism, and similar anti-democratic white supremacist creeds where democracy and political persuasion are supplanted by violence.” Sentencing Remarks of Mr Justice Wilkie On 16th June, 2016 (the same day as the BREAKING POINT poster), Jo Cox MP was walking to a meeting with some of her constituents when she was brutally murdered by a politically motivated extremist. When asked his name in court the man stated, “My name is death to traitors, freedom for Britain.” The tragedy is stark reminder of what can happen in a heated political climate and when political ideologies influence dangerous people. I want to note that I do not intend to use Jo Cox’s murder for political point-scoring, nor am I suggesting that Brexit was the motivation for the attack. I want to remind myself and others of what is at stake when divisive politics is encouraged. Communities can be split, people can be harassed and loved ones can be lost. As I have suggested throughout the article, there is nothing wrong with wanting to have a meaningful discussion about immigration. The journalist and author Douglas Murray, amongst others, has argued that, for many years, the political class and left wing media have stifled the debate, resulting in public outcry. Creating an environment of fear — allowing no one to voice legitimate concerns, is not the way for a democracy to flourish. Equally, some areas of the media, as previously highlighted, have done just as much damage to the possibility of sensible democratic debate by telling needless lies and by purposely attempting to provoke fear. At the time of writing, confidence in the UK’s democratic systems, and in the truthfulness of the press, is low. It is not clear when exactly that will change but a starting point would be for all of us to begin expecting more of ourselves and others in the marketplace of ideas. Democracy should not be about the freedom to have an opinion and then to convince others of that view no matter the cost. The philosopher Soren Kierkegaard once said: “People demand freedom of speech as a compensation for the freedom of thought which they seldom use.” We can, and should, aim to be better than this."
Medium.com,Society,Sajith’s Manifesto,World,https://medium.com/@indica/sajiths-manifesto-a1e9c13fa06f?source=topic_page---------147------------------1," Welcome to an auction of non-existent resources, as Lee Kuan Yew said. This is Sajith Premadasa’s manifesto, released in Kandy today. Below are the highlights. You can read the whole thing in Sinhala, Tamil or English. What follows below are my highlights. For me the main issues are, 1) not murdering me 2) climate change 3) the poor 4) public transport. So, on those issues it’s either Sajith or Anura Kumar Dissanayake (JVP) for me and, who are we kidding, it’s Sajith. This election is fundamentally a two-party choice between facism and not, and I choose not. I also think Sajith is young and poor-oriented, which is good. You can read the whole thing yourself, I won’t attempt to summarize it. I’ll just highlight the parts that were interesting to me. So that all sounds nice and if you go through every past President’s manifesto the country should have been banging by now. Sajith does have a section on implementation which talks about reforms, KPIs, meetings and consultants, but again, how do you implement that. It’s not even clear how much power the current Executive President has. Sajith has been one of the more active ministers at least in terms of building housing, so perhaps we’ll get that. He is also capable of working within the system, and of connecting to all classes of Sri Lankans. If he gets a mandate it’s possible, and none of the ideas are especially bad. More to the point, the are all ideas within a democratic framework and norms, which matters most. My general sense is that this is a manifesto for governance rather than authoritarianism. Sajith is running as the NDF candidate, which to me stands for No Damn Facists. For me the election is that choice, and Sajith is the democratic candidate. He’s quite socialist, poor-oriented, and he has good people around him. So for me it’s a clear choice, but read the manifesto (Sinhala, Tamil, English) and see for yourself."

Medium.com,Society,What the US Can Learn From Switzerland’s Gun Culture,World,https://medium.com/@alicebesso/what-the-us-can-learn-from-switzerlands-gun-culture-77dec8c8dcc6?source=topic_page---------150------------------1," Oh, Switzerland. High peaks, green pastures, delicious cheese and chocolate, and neutrality. Because of the latter, Switzerland hasn’t taken part in any international armed conflict since 1815, making the country relatively discreet on the world stage. For me, growing up in Switzerland was like growing up in a sanitized, safe, and tidy bubble. Although things are far from perfect, violent crime is low, and turmoil or unrest is rare. Switzerland is a direct democracy, meaning its citizens can challenge any law approved by the parliament, or even propose a modification of the Constitution. Four times a year, they vote on various themes ranging from social issues to infrastructure, economics, public finance, education, military issues, and more. This level of power concentrated in the population’s decisions makes it harder to blame a single politician every time something goes wrong, as is the case in many countries, including the United States. As a result, Swiss politicians are often seen walking around on the street without security, comfortably blending in with the people, which can seem bizarre from abroad. In 2014, former Swiss President Didier Burkhalter became a Twitter sensation after a photo of him waiting for a train, alone and without bodyguards, started circulating. In this way, and many more, I like to think of Switzerland as the polar opposite of the United States. But democratic history and decentralized government aside, there is a surprising aspect that unites both countries: a strong gun culture. On its blog, the NRA even uses Switzerland as an example to show that stricter gun laws are unnecessary-as gun violence in Switzerland is low and mass shootings are rare, despite the high levels of gun ownership. The last one happened 18 years ago, when a man stormed the local parliament in Zug in 2001, killing 14 and injuring 18. Across the pond, amid the divisive gun control debate, one solution appears to reconcile Democrats and Republicans alike: the “red flag” gun laws. If enforced federally, the laws would allow private citizens to request court orders for officials to confiscate the firearms of people who pose a danger to themselves or others. But are they enough to reduce gun violence and prevent future mass shootings? They aren’t. Contrary to popular belief, the Swiss example demonstrates exactly why stricter gun laws beyond the “red flag” laws are needed. Not just anyone can buy a firearm in Switzerland. For pistols, revolvers, and semi-automatic firearms, one must get a firearms acquisition permit, which isn’t given out lightly, and is valid for one purchase only. The main conditions are that you have to be at least 18 years old, have no criminal record or addictions, not be placed under guardianship, and not identified as being a danger to yourself or others. To ensure that the last condition is fulfilled, authorities might consult a prospective gun buyer’s relatives or even demand a certificate from a psychiatrist. Verifying all of these conditions at the local and federal level can take a while, meaning there are wait times on top of these requirements. Moreover, firearms purchases and transfers are recorded, allowing for a registry of weapon holders. And although it is not uncommon to see a person in military service carrying their unloaded rifle, gun-carrying permits are rarely issued, except for people working in domains where it is needed, such as security. Switzerland’s gun culture is closely linked to the country’s national defense service. Able-bodied men between the ages of 18 and 34 are subject to compulsory military service. They can keep their service weapon at home, but they’re required to store all army ammunition in central arsenals. Comparing Swiss and American gun culture is like comparing apples and oranges. One is a small landlocked country in the middle of Europe. The other encompasses millions of square miles of territory. Both states’ relationships to firearms is rooted in their history and their culture, which influences how people view them in society. In the latter, the right to bear arms was created to protect against evil within the borders, but in the former, it was designed to protect the country against foreign invaders. For example, in Switzerland, it is unthinkable to own a gun for the sole purpose of self-defense–this draws a sharp contrast between the two countries. For that reason, the Swiss mentality cannot be transferred to the American reality. The same regulations cannot be adopted while expecting the same results. But that doesn’t mean they cannot learn from us. It’s easy to dismiss each side of the gun control debate as irreconcilable. It’s even easier to point to Switzerland to invalidate the claim that fewer firearms bring fewer gun deaths. There are reasons why Switzerland is the exception to the rule, including its regulations, the extensive training and permits required, and what firearms mean to people. In the US, for the protection of both the Second Amendment and human life, common sense must prevail, and compromises must be made. The majority of Americans support new gun control regulations including “red flag” laws, background checks, and a ban on high-capacity magazines. However, merely adopting the “red flag” laws and expecting the violence to disappear is like putting a band-aid on a gunshot wound and expecting it to heal. It’s a step in the right direction, but not enough to fix the deeply rooted causes of gun violence. For the sake of everyone’s safety, a multi-faceted approach must be considered-one that encompasses regulations, responsibility, safety, mental health, and compassion. There is still a long way to go before we get there."
Medium.com,Society,Yemen Government Officials Survive Two Assassination Attempts,World,https://medium.com/citizen-truth/yemen-government-officials-survive-two-assassination-attempts-5766ef142e6a?source=topic_page---------151------------------1," A large explosion ripped through a convoy for Yemen Defense Minister Mohammad al-Maqdishi on Tuesday, which involved several ministerial buildings in the province of Marib. The complex is said to be an interim headquarters for the ministry of defense. Maqdishi was about to hold a meeting with top military officials when the explosion hit his convoy. According to the Associated Press, anonymous Yemen officials reported the explosion killed two guards and wounded four others. The officials offered no further details since they were not authorized to speak to the press. No group has claimed responsibility for the blast, and it was not clear whether it was caused by a device or a projectile fired from outside the complex. On Monday media reports said that two other Yemeni ministers had also survived a blast in the Yemeni city of Shabwah. The targets were interior minister Ahmad al-Maisari, who is also deputy prime minister, and transport minister Saleh Al-Jabwani. They both survived the blast, caused by an explosive-laden car near their homes in the city of Ataq, which is the capital of the internationally backed government of Yemen President Abd Rabu Mansur Hadi. No group has claimed responsibility for Monday’s blast either. The two blasts targeting high-ranking Yemeni officials came shortly after Hadi’s government reached a deal with the UnitedArab Emirate-backed Southern Transitional Council (STC), a Yemeni separatist group. The Saudi Arabia-brokered deal between the two sides states that the SCT will be incorporated into a new cabinet, led by Hadi. According to the agreement, the separatists would assume half the ministerial posts on condition they stop fighting in the areas of Aden, Abyan and Shabwah. An integration of all STC forces into the defense ministry should be realized in a period of 60 days, the deal stipulated. Over the past several weeks, Saudi Arabia, which mediated the deal, has been beefing up its military presence in southern Yemen after the United Arab Emirates withdrew forces from the oil-rich Aden. In 2015 the UAE-backed STC took control of Aden, which was home to the government after the Iran-backed Houthi rebel group kicked Hadi out of the capital Sana’a in 2014. Fighting in Yemen began in late 2014 when Houthi rebels took control of large parts of the country, including the capital Sana’a. Mass protests and the Houthi rebel group forced the internationally recognized government of President Abd Rabbuh Mansur Hadi from power in 2015. Since then, Hadi has resided in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia. The civil war has its roots in the 2011 Arab Spring, which led to a 2011 Yemen uprising that eventually forced the end of the 32-year-long regime of Yemen’s late president, Ali Abdullah Saleh. The uprising grew into a military conflict in 2014 and has since caused the deaths of thousands of people and the displacement of hundreds of thousands more. Since 2014 the separatist Houthis have engaged in a civil war with the government. In support of the government, Saudi Arabia has led an Arab military coalition which included the United Arab Emirates. The Houthis have constantly attacked Saudi Arabia. Most recently, the Houthis allegedly launched missiles and explosives-laden drones against the Saudi oil refinery, Aramco. Saudi Arabia has yet to respond to a Houthi truce offer, providing that Saudi Arabia stops its military attacks on Yemen.

Medium.com,Society,"Brexit deal or no, U.K. infrastructure is still catching a bid",World,https://medium.com/@investableuniverse/brexit-deal-or-no-u-k-infrastructure-is-still-catching-a-bid-2c9749170784?source=topic_page---------152------------------1," U.K. assets rallied on Tuesday amid hopes that a deal to exit the European Union might soon be forthcoming. But private money, as it has a way of doing, may have beaten the punters to the punch. A recent series of major U.K. infrastructure investments by long-term-oriented, private funds suggest a bullish contingent gathering pace, even without a formal deal in hand before the October 31 Brexit deadline. Speaking at this week’s opening of the U.K. Parliament, Britain’s Queen Elizabeth II announced the unveiling of a National Infrastructure Strategy, which she called “a long-term vision to improve the nation’s digital, transport and energy infrastructure.” Her Majesty’s announcement follows the release last year of the first-ever National Infrastructure Commission’s report, which recommended sweeping structural improvements to the U.K.’s transportation, energy, telecommunications, waste and water works. Big broadband bet Digital infrastructure is central to this high-profile push. On Tuesday, private equity giant KKR announced that its $7.4 billion third global infrastructure fund had acquired a majority stake in Hyperoptic, the U.K.’s largest residential high-speed (gigabit) broadband provider, which covers 400,000 customers across the country. Publicizing the acquisition, KKR European Infrastructure executives Vincent Policard and Cristina Gonzales said of Hyperoptic: “The business is strongly positioned to meet the growing demand for full-fibre services in the U.K. through further investment and national roll-out, supporting housing development and renovation. Our investment in Hyperoptic builds on KKR’s strong track record in telecommunications infrastructure in Europe, investing in and deploying next-generation digital connectivity.” As reported in Data Economy News, an independent survey of senior IT executives by data center operator Equinix found almost half of U.K.-based IT managers it surveyed said uncertainty around a final Brexit deal has not impacted their company’s decision to invest in IT infrastructure. Also this week, Equinix released the results of its annual Global Interconnection Index, which found that with 51% compound annualized growth forecast for this year, interconnectionbandwidth across Europe (including U.K.) could surpass expected growth in North America (46% CAGR), while still lagging growth in Latin America. Posh airport deal Private air travel is also catching a bid. Late last month, Macquarie Infrastructure and Real Assets (MIRA) announced that its sixth European infrastructure fund had acquired the U.K.’s only dedicated business airport, London’s Farnborough Airport, from a private consortium led by Luxembourg-domiciled TAG Group Holdings. Financial terms of the deal were not disclosed. Macquarie has been an active investor in U.K. infrastructure for 30 years, having arranged more than £40 billion (roughly $51 billion) in British infrastructure funding since 2005. The ownership transfer comes amid buoyant earnings growth at an airport venue that caters to the ultra-wealthy. On Tuesday, Farnborough announced a 23% increase in revenue to a record £80 million ($102 million) for its 2018 fiscal year, led by an increase of 4,000 business flights compared to the previous year. The solid earnings picture suggests that, with or without Brexit, U.K. air terminal demand from the corporate jet crowd continues to fly high."

Medium.com,Society,The Brexit Culture War Is Finally Hitting Its Endgame,World,https://gen.medium.com/the-brexit-culture-war-is-finally-hitting-its-endgame-9333da3bb3c?source=topic_page---------154------------------1," our years of carnage. Brexit has been pulverizing British politics for so long that most of the people who live here can barely remember what it was like beforehand. Sometimes we reminisce about a period when politics was about other things, like health care or education policy. But it’s a distant memory which is increasingly hard to recall — like the face of someone you once knew in school. That might finally be about to come to an end. Not the real end, of course. Brexit will never really end. It’s a permanent state of hellishness. Even if Britain leaves the EU, it’ll still face decades of trade deals and international negotiations. Even if it doesn’t, there’ll be years of political upheaval as the emotions triggered by it refuse to die down. We’re not at the end. But we might, if we’re lucky, be approaching the end of the beginning. The prime minister, Boris Johnson, is going to hold a general election. On December 12, either he will win, or the other side will. And that decision will dictate how Britain leaves the EU, or if it even will at all. It won’t be a normal election. It’ll be grounded in an intense sense of tribal warfare conducted on cultural lines. This is the new form of political identity operating in Britain. Back in those olden political days of 2015, we used to think in terms of left and right, Labour and Conservative. Politics was fundamentally socioeconomic. Then the 2016 Brexit referendum came. When the results were in, it was clear it didn’t represent the traditional left-right division. Well-off voters in the shires of southern England voted the same way as left-behind voters in the post-industrial towns of northern England. The only variables which mattered were age, education, and proclivity to authoritarian social opinions. The older you were, the more poorly educated, and the more likely to support capital punishment — the more likely that you’d voted Brexit. Politics stopped being socioeconomic and became sociocultural. But the actual act of delivering Brexit was not about cultural values. It was a fiendish, impossible technical puzzle — renegotiating trade deals, saving manufacturing supply lines from customs checks, leveling up independent regulatory capacity. After over four decades of legal embrace, Britain and the EU were connected in a million complex ways. It’s hard to sever that arrangement without serious pain. The basic conundrum around Brexit in practice was that the closer Britain stays to the EU after leaving, the more it preserves the economy — but the less independence it has. And the further Britain pushed the EU away, the more independence it would get — and the more economic damage it would suffer. The government tried various approaches, but the culture war tribalism of the referendum wouldn’t input into the technical exercise. It was like trying to put a VHS tape into a DVD player. Underneath the party politics, something deeper is shifting. The tectonic plates of politics — people’s sense of identity — are changing. Last week, for a few glistening moments, it looked like the prime minister was on the verge of getting something through. He’d struck a new deal with the EU which pleased the Brexit wing of his party — promising complete separation from the EU — while keeping most moderates on board on the basis of simple exhaustion and terror at the prospect of there being no deal at all. But there was a blood sacrifice: The Northern Irish Democratic Unionist Party. They had been firm allies of the hard Brexiters. And yet the deal split Northern Ireland off into the EU’s customs ecosystem. They were outraged, red-faced with betrayal, absolutely incandescent with anger. In some cases, they seemed to cross that it looked like they might actually physically explode. But for the Brexiteers, their former comrades were a necessary sacrifice to the greater cause. For a moment, the deal looked like it might squeeze through the House of Commons. Johnson tried to force it through over the course of a tight two days, which would have prevented members of parliament from having any real time to read it or properly scrutinize the contents. But at the last moment, the lawmakers held firm, rejected the timetable, and demanded more time to look at the deal. Johnson reacted impulsively. In what seemed to be a fit of pique, he pulled the legislation and demanded that there be a general election. On Tuesday night, parliament agreed to a December 12 trip to the polls — the first December election in Britain since 1923. The dark, cold, wet few weeks to come will define everything. If Johnson wins, Brexit will happen immediately and on the hardest terms. If the opposition wins, they will renegotiate his deal to make it much softer — staying tightly ensconced in the EU trading system — and then hold a second referendum on the deal. Brexit may well not happen at all. The dynamics are complex. Johnson enjoys a healthy double-digit lead over the opposition Labour party. “Leave” voters have only split two ways, between him and the more hardline Brexit party, whereas “Remain” voters have split five ways, between Labour, the Liberal Democrats, the Scottish National Party (SNP), Plaid Cymru, and the Greens. But other structural aspects don’t play quite so well for Johnson. The Remain vote enjoys an advantageous geographical spread. In most places, there is one primary Remain party fighting the Conservatives — they’re only quite rarely pitted against each other. It’s also hard to see where Johnson plans to get his votes from. He is already set to lose moderate Tory voters to the SNP in Scotland and the Liberal Democrats in southern England. He will need to pick up Brexit-supporting Labour voters in northern England to make up for it, but they’re put off by his upper-class manner and right-wing economic policies. Most polling analysts believe it will be hard for either main party to win the election with an outright majority. And that favors Labour, because it can form coalitions with any of the Remain parties, whereas Johnson only has the Brexit party to buddy up with. Underneath the party politics, something deeper is shifting. The tectonic plates of politics — people’s sense of identity — are changing. People increasingly see themselves as Remainers and Leavers, rather than Labour or Conservative supporters. And that makes it incredibly hard to assess how the votes will fall. The change from a socioeconomic to a sociocultural political debate is playing absolute havoc with British political realities. There is everything to play for. Either side could quite easily win. Britain’s future will be defined, for a generation, by what happens in the next few weeks."
Medium.com,Society,Why Americans should care about polio eradication.,World,https://medium.com/@getfaccinated/why-americans-should-care-about-polio-eradication-c359fcfb470a?source=topic_page---------155------------------1," © Photo by Nic Bothma I served in the United States Marine Corps for eight years. During those years of service across the globe, one moment will always stay with me. I will never forget seeing a child stricken by disease, so skinny his bones protruded. Paralyzed, he crawled on the ground. His future dreams stolen. The thief was polio, a disease entirely preventable. Polio is a disease that has eroded from the American social consciousness. The degrading social awareness is reasonable given the last case of polio was brought into the United States by travelers in 1993. Currently, polio is endemic in only three countries and is considered a candidate for total eradication. Disease eradication is an achievement unseen for human infectious diseases since smallpox in 1980. We are close to achieving the same feat with polio. Unfortunately, the march has not been straight forward. Time and time again, we have missed the target deadlines. Polio eradication was planned to occur in 2000, a target we missed. Polio transmission was intended to interrupted in 2014 with a certified eradication date in 2018. Another target date missed. We have learned from our failures, and we are currently shifting tactics. The endgame strategy now centers around the switch from the Salk oral polio vaccine (OPV) to the Sabin inactivated polio vaccine (IPV). On a large scale, the IPV is five times more expensive than OPV. IPV does have the advantage of not inducing vaccine-derived polio when coverage rates are low. Though cases of vaccine-derived polio are sporadic, they do occur, weakening confidence in the vaccine. Transitioning OPV countries to IPV will increase locals’ confidence in the vaccine and thus help increase vaccine uptake. Given the increased cost of IPV, it follows that one of the significant challenges identified by the Global Polio Eradication Initiative is inadequate funding. Inadequate funding will affect the necessary vaccine stock and human resources required to eradicate polio. Currently, the Trump administration is planning to cut the Center for Disease Control (CDC) budget, which includes the budget for world vaccination programs. A cutback during a transition to a more expensive eradication policy. A questionable decision as the CDC was only able to vaccinate a little over half its target goals in 2017. So why should we care? Besides the moral impetus, eradication of polio will affect our wallets. Disease eradication is one of the rare occasions where there is a guaranteed return on investment. The CDC estimated a savings of 50 billion dollars by 2035 if we eradicate polio by 2020. Portions of these cost savings are due to annual vaccination costs. We spend about 5.40 to vaccinate one child for polio. With close to four million births a year, this gives a yearly fee of over twenty million dollars a year to protect every newborn in the country. The direct prices of vaccines are just one portion of the estimated cost savings, not accounting for the physician visits, patient time lost, and cost of treatment for polio. A demonstration of the financial merit of disease eradication is smallpox. The annual cost to eradicate smallpox from 1967 to 1979 was 23 million dollars. Based on the associated expenses, it is estimated the United States saves every 26 days what we spent each year during the eradication of smallpox. Every day we delay polio eradication there is a loss in cost savings. There is also the possibility of a resurgence of polio as we have seen with measles. A disease long considered eliminated from the United States which has resurfaced. Failure to achieve eradication will require further future resources to be devoted to this task and puts future Americans at unnecessary risk. Those at risk in America and around the world are society’s most vulnerable. When outbreaks occur in countries of conflict due to immunization rates falling, the most vulnerable are exposed. It is not the extremist or freedom fighter. It is not the government coalition, corrupt or not. It is the children who become afflicted, children who had no say in who their parents are or which country they were born. We are on the final stretch of eradicating polio — one last sprint from creating an immortalized moment. Like man setting foot on the moon, it could be one of the few moments of greatness shared across the world. To completely eradicate a disease is just as impressive a feat, a legacy we can leave for those after us. A legacy we can gift to our children and our grandchildren. It’s time."
Medium.com,Society,German cities ban old diesel cars. But — is the air any cleaner?,World,https://medium.com/@blazej.kupec/german-cities-ban-old-diesel-cars-but-is-the-air-any-cleaner-f7d185021508?source=topic_page---------156------------------1," Berlin plans to ban old diesel cars from eleven of its most polluted streets in November, following Darmstadt, Hamburg and Stuttgart in their efforts to reduce NOx emissions. The ban has, however, a considerable opposition across Germany; many people believe it’s pointless while businesses fear unnecessary costs. The diesel ban in Berlin will affect cars and trucks up to and including EURO 5 emission category. These cars — there are around 200.000 of them (every sixth car) — are no longer allowed to enter a combined three kilometres of roads in the German capital. The city hopes that the prohibitive measure will help combat the levels of nitrogen dioxide and put them below the admissible level of 40 milligrams per cubic meter of air. In 2018, the average concertation of the pollutant in Berlin has been recorded at 49 milligrams. What is EURO standard If a car wants to drive on European roads it has to meet certain emission standards. The European Union has first introduced them in 1992. Five sets of standards have followed since, each being more stringent as the previous. They are listed below (and when they’ve become mandatory): EURO 1 since 31 December 1992 EURO 2 since 1 January 1997 EURO 3 since 1 January 2001 EURO 4 since 1 January 2006 EURO 5 since 1 January 2011 EURO 6 since 1 January 2015 “Ban won’t change anything. The pollution will just move” One of the dirtiest parts of the city is a 300-meter chunk of Brückenstraße that bridges popular Alexanderplatz and the district of Kreuzberg, south of the river Spree. Andrea works in the local bakery and knows the narrow and often heavily congested street very well. “I haven’t noticed that the air is more polluted here. I am more annoyed by the noise,” she admits. She also drives a diesel car — and has been so for the past 20 years — but hers is a relatively new one and is not being scrutinized for excessively emitting NOx gases. “It might happen that there will be fewer people to the bakery because of the diesel ban. People might also have problems in their everyday lives — leaving kids three blocks from the school instead of at the entrance,” she gives an example. A short walk from her bakery is a typical German beer house. The older men, sitting at the bar, point out that the road outside is “the dirties part of Berlin”. Brückenstraße is in fact among the most polluted; in 2018 it had the ninth highest level of nitrogen dioxide particles. The men are, nevertheless, not particularly excited about the diesel ban. “They won’t solve anything that way. People will simply make a detour, and then you’ll have congestion in other parts, together with pollution,” they predict. Berlin is one of eleven German cities tasked with implementing driving restrictions within city limits as a way to combat high levels of NOx pollution. Until October 2019, however, only three cities have imposed the measures: Hamburg, Darmstadt and Stuttgart. Hamburg: restrictions work but not good enough The second-largest German city barred diesel cars from two of its streets (2,3 kilometres) in May 2018, almost immediately after the decision from the country top court. Similarly to Berlin, the ban applies to all diesel cars except for new EURO 6 models. More than half of 320.000 Hamburg-registered diesel cars are affected. It is worth pointing out, though, that the city allows a plethora of exceptions; for the residents of the affected areas and their visitors, emergency and police vehicles, delivery services and taxi drivers, among others. And even those who are not — under any circumstances — allowed to drive on the two streets might still want to tempt the gods since fines for violators are relatively low — car drivers pay 20 euro if they get caught and truck companies 75 euro. Results so far are mixed. The levels of nitrogen dioxide have indeed fallen (on one street from 47 to 41, and the other from 46 to 44 milligrams per one cubic meter of air) but are still above the admissible volumes. Environmental organizations maintain that the diesel ban is necessary, but “it should have been broadened and coupled with stricter control measures”. Darmstadt: more than 3000 violators in a couple of months A comparable interdiction has been enforced in Darmstadt, a smaller city south of Frankfurt. There too the diesel ban applies on only two streets, together comprising a little more than one kilometre of the city’s roads. The level of air pollutants has fallen, according to Focus.de, quoting Darmstadt authorities. The city has also recorded a considerable number of violators — at least 3000 of them have driven a EURO 5 (or older) diesel vehicle where these cars have been outlawed. Stuttgart: Authorities says ban works but residents are not happy about it Considering the limited extent of the diesel prohibition in Darmstadt and Hamburg, only Stuttgart has enforced a noticeable ban thus far. Around 80 milligrams in one cubic meter of air has been the average level of NOx in Stuttgart in the last year, double the admissible levels for the European Union. The city, home to German automaker giants Daimler and Porsche, barred diesel cars up to and including EURO 4 emission category which makes them mostly older than eight years. The environmentalists at the Deutsche Umwelthilfe have demanded that the state government of Baden Württemberg, of which Stuttgart is a capital, introduces zonal driving restrictions for EURO 5 engines as well. The state officials, on the other hand, contest that a blanket ban is not necessary since the existing restrictions have yielded satisfying results. “We have decreased the values from 80 milligrams to 50–56 milligrams,” said Fritz Kuhn, Stuttgart’s mayor (Bündnis 90/Die Grünen). Stuttgart is, in fact, an above-average polluted city, partly because it lies in the basin. In recent years, the levels of nitrogen dioxide have been twice as high as the European Union’s threshold of 40 milligrams per cubic meter of air. The trend is positive, however. In 2015, the city’s average level of NOx has been at 87 milligrams, in 2017 73 milligrams and last year 71 milligrams. Nothing has changed Stuttgart’s residents doubt the ban is indeed necessary. “Nothing has changed. There are still traffic jams, and the public transport is not any cheaper,” claims Gasper Soban who runs a car business. He, too, owns an old diesel car that he still uses, relying on the fact that diesel ban controls are not heavily enforced. He is an exception, though, since many owners sold their unfitting cars. Official data shows that the share of registered diesel cars, that do not meet EURO 5 standards, has fallen from 7,1 percent to 3,9 percent since the start of 2019. “Old diesels in Germany are well maintained. But there is not a lot of other options besides selling the car below the market price — otherwise, nobody will buy them in and around Stuttgart,” Soban adds. He believes that older citizens might bear the costs the most. “Lots of them bought an expensive diesel Mercedes before retiring but are now unable to drive one. People are not happy.” Steve Staresinic, an American tax consultant in Stuttgart, draws attention to the costs some companies, particularly in the delivery business, might have. “Those who have had old diesel vans in their fleet had to buy new ones. Even more worrisome is a possible EURO 5 ban since some of these vehicles are only two years old. The same is true for the citizens. More than a thousand of them have an almost new diesel car which costs up to 50.000 euro but they won’t be able to use it anymore,” he points out. Staresinic regularly sights older delivery vans on the streets of Stuttgart. “People take risks”. “The authorities have banned diesel cars before they were able to introduce proper measures, such as improvements of public transport and cycling infrastructure or implement park & ride services,” Staresinic continues."
Medium.com,Society,No Silence in Sudan｜The UST-L Vitruvian,World,https://medium.com/ustlthevitruvian/no-silence-in-sudan-the-ust-l-vitruvian-4fe8a700b9b1?source=topic_page---------157------------------1," Written by Anika Asuncion, The Vitruvian’s Associate Editor (SY 2019–2020) In the midst of political unrest that started in December 2018, Sudan paused to hear an angel sing of promise. Alaa Salah, a 22-year-old architecture student, orchestrated a show of power through song and poetry on a car roof while hundreds of protesters chanted with her. While clad in white, a symbol of peace, Salah’s message had transcended barriers of discord. Sudanese President Omar Al-Bashir was eventually forced to step down after numerous rallies and accusations were filed against him, a monumental milestone after 30 years of monotonous control. Women have birthed this moment, and they should be applauded for it especially after all those years of mistreatment of them from the patriarchy. For three decades, Omar al-Bashir implemented lashings of policies aimed at degrading women, apparently with the motive of fulfilling the Sudan’s incredibly conservative Islamic forces, which strengthened his regime. This meant that child marriage was allowed, marital rape was permitted, and women were not allowed to wear trousers in public. Misogyny never stopped Alaa Salah to speak against the injustices brought about by Al-Bashir, and she never limited herself from what she can do for Sudan. She was raised to love it, after all. “Two-third of the protesters in Sudan are women. Women are half the society. You cannot have a revolution without women,” remarked Salah. “You cannot have democracy without women. We believed we could, so we did.” Salah’s work had paid off, because in the minutes where her voice became the sound of revolution, all victims of al-Bashir were unified and determined to get him ousted. For days, Sudanese protesters would rage on the streets to defy his oppressive regime. Economic turmoil was the catalyst of the coup d’état executed against him on April 11, 2019. Famine was prominent in the region, and poverty was the face of the nation. The totalitarianism and injustice exhibited by the former president are testaments to the kind of greedy and corrupted politician he really was. People may have glorified him for being a revolutionary hero in the past for overthrowing a previous dictator, but now that he’s been charged with war crimes and genocide by the international court, majority have ultimately lost faith in him. The unfortunate thing is, Sudan still hasn’t been wholly freed. Tyranny was a rampant theme in al-Bashir’s decades of ruling, even after he was taken away. The Transitional Military Council (TMC) displayed aggressiveness against the protesters after the coup, insisting that the army needed to rule. They vowed that order would be restored in a short while, but the rest of the people called for a civilian-led government instead. Violence broke out after that, and Sudan was then cut off from the rest of the world due to a media blackout. Until now, the internet is barely accessible to Sudanese citizens and a proper government has yet to be established. A devastating fact is that women who stood in the front lines of revolution were sexually harassed, raped, and killed. Sudan remains shrouded, but activists refuse for it to be a coffin being lowered further into the ground. On the bright side, the TMC and the representative group of civilian protesters, Forces of Freedom and Change (FCC), have recently reached a consensus. The agreement was made in July, and both groups are willing to share power until the elections in 2022. They even spurred the United Nations Security Council lift its suspension of troop withdrawals and make sure all peacekeepers leave Darfur by June 2020, but the African Union says overall security in the vast western region “remains volatile.” Although there isn’t a stable government in Sudan yet, the world is listening closely. Salah’s voice is still being heard, and her image is a vivid painting in the minds of those who care enough to see it. Multiple countries have pledged financial aid to help Sudan, such as Saudi Arabia and United Arab Emirates. Both countries pledged $3B, but the amount of money needed to rebuild Sudan’s economy is around $10B. Celebrities and the like have spread awareness about the dire situation in the African country, but not everyone knows the extent of it. A line from a poem that Alaa Salah recited spoke volumes about Sudan’s revolution: “The bullet doesn’t kill. What kills is the silence of people.”"
Medium.com,Society,The Hong Kong protests are becoming more violent because justice is not being served,World,https://medium.com/adinkra/the-hong-kong-protests-are-becoming-more-violent-because-justice-is-not-being-served-528a6e8a98bb?source=topic_page---------158------------------1," By Hong Kong Free Press Johnson Yeung Ching-yin, author of this post, is a human rights advocate in Hong Kong, an exco member of Amnesty International, and former convenor of the Civil Human Rights Front. The post was published by Hong Kong Free Press on 26 October 2019 and is republished on Global Voices under a content partnership agreement, as well as with the consent of the author. I want to tell a story about me and violence. On July 21, I was dragging my body back home at midnight after a long day of protests. I lay in my bed. My partner was asleep, and I scrolled up and down the screen of my phone in the dark. My newsfeed was awash with footage of mobs wielding metal rods and hitting train passengers indiscriminately in Yuen Long. These thugs, later confirmed to have triad backgrounds and links to a pro-Beijing lawmaker, were beating people while the police stood by and watched. Some were escorted personally by riot police to safe havens. I barely slept that night; the adrenaline in my body kept me awake. My mind kept rehearsing how I would defend the passengers if I had been on the train. The next day, an atmosphere of terror overcame Hong Kong. Shops and malls were closed early, in fearful anticipation of another attack. During lunch, a colleague invited me to a protest at the area where the thugs were based. I agreed immediately, finished my lunch in five minutes, and grabbed a PVC pipe and put it in my backpack. I was ready to get into a scuffle. Not only was I prepared to fight-I was also looking forward to encountering the thugs so I could mete out justice to them. In the end, I didn’t encounter any thugs that day, but I still remember the impulse to use violence. Are the Hong Kong protests becoming more violent? Certainly. And although the demonstrations are largely non-violent, the use of force against the police, vandalism and vigilantism are becoming more frequent. And I have a clear sense of why this is happening: it is because justice has not been served over the past four months. The police have been systematically violating rights and hurting people. More than 1,000 people have been injured; a journalist will more than likely lose her sight in one eye; one man’s arm was broken during an arrest; others say they were sexually abused by law enforcement. A reporter has been hospitalised after a thug stabbed her in one lung; a teenager could spend his whole life in a wheelchair because hired gangs cut his tendons. And a few days ago, a young girl was injured by a taxi driver who appeared to deliberately run over some protesters. Will these thugs be brought to justice? I doubt it, as I have seen the police work side by side with them multiple times. Now, 80 per cent of the population are demanding an independent inquiry into police brutality, according to a Ming Pao poll, and the government has responded by invoking emergency powers and banning people from wearing masks. And keep in mind, we didn’t choose the government. The emergency powers have destroyed the very last of the checks and balances that prevent Hong Kong from turning into a truly authoritarian city. It has shut down every single potential peaceful channel to resolve the political crisis. The people are not just going to sit there and be butchered. They will resist. Remember how Hobbes describes the state of nature? No government, no laws, no common power to restrain. Sound familiar? That’s Hong Kong nowadays: people concede to the state a monopoly on violence because they trust the state will use violence according to the law-but this social contract has been burnt to ashes by the government. On many occasions, I feel the impulse to throw a petrol bomb. I have pictured in my head how to wrest a pistol from an officer’s holster. And do you know what is stopping me from doing so? It’s because I am representing my organisation, which is committed to non-violence, and because I believe a largely non-violent movement has a better chance of success. Most importantly, I have convinced myself that justice would be served in the long run. That doesn’t mean everyone can and should think as I do. I feel impatient. And there are people who believe seeking justice within the system is a joke. For them, vandalising a store owned by a crony of the government, or hitting a pro-government supporter who attempts to attack others, is a way to find some justice. The violence should not be condoned-it should be stopped, starting with state violence. Hong Kong is in a state of emergency, and the law that was once respected by its citizens is melting away. I am not asking you to tolerate violence, I am asking you to understand it. Martin Luther King once said, “Riot is the language of the unheard.” Without understanding where it comes from, you are not hearing what the people are saying. Justice is what we are entitled to, and it should be returned right now."
Medium.com,Society,The World Is Exploding in Mass Protest. Will the U.S. Join In?,World,https://zora.medium.com/the-world-is-exploding-in-mass-protest-will-the-u-s-join-in-1d4560b51c5d?source=topic_page---------159------------------1," recent months, mass protests involving tens and hundreds of thousands of demonstrators have ignited across much of the globe — Chile, Lebanon, Iraq, Hong Kong, Spain, Indonesia, Haiti, Ecuador, Egypt, and elsewhere. Corruption, inflation, joblessness, contamination, violence, a scarcity of goods and public services, and a quest for sovereignty, coupled with a ruling class bathing in exponential wealth, are some of the factors that have galvanized protestors to take to the streets. The ground for lasting transnational protests against Trump has never been more fertile. Evidence of Trump’s obstruction of justice, stonewalling, and collusion with foreign governments is accumulating rapidly. Trump has given Turkey’s President Erdogan the green light to crush the Kurds in northern Syria, stalwart U.S. allies. Some 1,500 more asylum-seeking children were separated from their parents and guardians at the border than previously thought. The Trump administration has eliminated climate and immigrant protections while openly instigating terror and disregarding the law. Which begs the question — why haven’t they happened here? One possibility is landmass. “People here are very dispersed,” says Lisa Mueller, political scientist and author of the book, Political Protest in Contemporary Africa. In Sudan, for example, the urban population is very concentrated. “This allows people to coordinate better,” says Mueller. The ground for lasting transnational protests against Trump has never been more fertile. Another possibility? “Protest work may have been redirected into more traditional work and political channels,” says Alex Hanna, a sociologist who studies social movements. Zakiya Luna, professor of sociology at the University of California Santa Barbara, would agree. “For some people [protests are] a jumping-off point to get involved in different organizations and collective spaces out of the streets and into more institutional structures.” he mere fact that the U.S. still has democratic elections (however shaky) may also stave off mass, long-term protests here. “Our elections are pretty consistent and predictable,” says Luna. “There are institutional ways to be heard in a representative government. And enough people whose interests aren’t being taken care of can communicate them through social media and other forums.” It’s possible, too, that the diverse composition of U.S. residents makes mass nationwide protests less conducive. “In some of these high-profile and large-scale social movements, like the Women’s March, there is a lot of diversity or fractionalization,” says Mueller. (The Women’s March has been criticized in the past for, among other things, excluding disabled people.) “Diverse grievances can serve as a hurdle in a movement, especially if the leadership team can’t address them,” says Mueller. Leadership must be adept at bridging differences among protestors to find common ground. One way to do this is to signal unity. “This is strategic for a protest movement,” says Mueller. “It attracts recruits.” “Since July, Never Again Action and other immigrant organizations have held nearly continuous protests at various ICE facilities across the country. Their numbers, though impressive, are smaller than protests happening internationally.” Perhaps this is why the protests in Hong Kong are still going strong after almost five months. The leadership has gone out of its way to make unity a priority in a very diverse group of over a million protestors. Nightly at 10:30 p.m., protesters have walked out onto their balconies to join in anti-government chants. They have also developed protestor slang and their own sign language to secretly communicate their safety needs or police activity with one another. ertainly, the U.S. has had its share of sustained, mass demonstrations over the past several decades, including the civil rights movement, anti-Vietnam War protests, the Dakota Access pipeline protests at Standing Rock, Occupy Wall Street, and Black Lives Matter protests. “Much of the protests in the 1960s, initiated by Black activists protesting Jim Crow laws and segregation forms the backbone of social movement theory and thinking,” says Hanna. Since the 2016 presidential election, U.S. residents have routinely taken to the streets. An estimated 100,000 turned out in Washington, D.C., for the Women’s March, the day after President Trump’s inauguration, along with an additional 4 million protestors across the U.S. It holds the distinction of being the largest single-day march in U.S. history. The March for Our Lives in early 2018, which protested gun violence, was followed by the march against family separation at the border that summer, and more recently, the Climate Strike in September. These events, though they only lasted a single or a few days, turned out tens of thousands of participants. Since July, Never Again Action and other immigrant organizations have held nearly continuous protests at various ICE facilities across the country. Their numbers, though impressive, are smaller than protests happening internationally. Above all else, the prospect of success, however remote it may be, is imperative to maintaining mass, ongoing protests. “Whatever protest someone is engaged in generally has some sort of hope,” says Luna. “Even if it’s only a small bit of hope. You have to believe that you can create something different than what you see now.” Whether U.S. residents engage in long-term mass protests in the future or continue to invest in other kinds of grassroots organizing, one thing is for certain. In this time of turbulence, there’s much to learn and admire about resistance and social change from others around the world."
Medium.com,Society,The UK’s general election is the most unpredictable in a generation,World,https://medium.com/@Rashmee/the-uks-general-election-is-the-most-unpredictable-in-a-generation-a76e39b9fc79?source=topic_page---------160------------------1," Britain will vote on December 12, the first election in that month since 1923, the third in four years, and a contest that is likely to be the most unpredictable in a generation. There are two main reasons for this: an increasingly fickle electorate, and someone election strategists are calling “Workington Man.” The term appears in a report out today (pdf, p. 18) from Onward, the right-leaning think tank. Workington Man is white, over 45 years of age, without a college degree, and mostly to be found in northern English towns that traditionally vote Labour, according to James O’Shaughnessy and Will Tanner in “The Politics of Belonging.” Those towns include Workington, Wigan, Wakefield, Castleford, St. Helens, Halifax, and Dewsbury. These parts of England are roughly equivalent to America’s Rust Belt in terms of former industrial strength, current economic decline, and a cultural suspicion of the forces of globalization. Workington Man replaces Worcester Woman, the British equivalent of America’s soccer mom, or the swing voter that pollsters and demographers once identified as a key target in terms of campaign and policy. Worcester Woman was in focus in Britain’s 1997 election, which ended 18 years of Conservative rule and saw Tony Blair in Downing Street with a landslide Labour win. But now, the key member of the British political tribe is supposed to be Workington Man, at least according to the narrative being pushed by right-of-center figures. Labour would probably still count him as its own, and voting patterns until now in Workington constituency bear this out. Meanwhile, the Liberal Democrats, who are opposed to Brexit, are focusing on voters that might be described as “Richmond Remainers.” It is a reference to the green and pleasant London suburb of Richmond, which voted to remain in the EU. Six months after the Brexit referendum, a Liberal Democrat political novice defeated the incumbent Conservative MP in a by-election. (In 2017, the Conservatives won Richmond back.) According to Tanner, Workington Man is key because Boris Johnson’s governing Conservative Party, which badly needs a parliamentary majority, risks losing roughly half the 13 seats it holds in Scotland, and several more in London and the south of England. Those constituencies voted to remain in the EU in the 2016 referendum. Enter Workington Man, whose supposed hometown has only once sent a Conservative politician to parliament (and that was more than 40 years ago), but voted to leave the EU in 2016. That’s where Johnson’s Tories could find support, according to Onward’s report, which insists that Workington Man is “the median voter of the group essential for either party to win a majority (Middle England).” There may be something in this analysis. Writing in The Times, London (paywall), polling expert John Curtice pointed to “nearly 50 Labour seats that could fall into the Tory [Conservative] column… disproportionately located in the north of England and the Midlands, where many a voter backed Leave.” Workington Man seems to offer confirmation that the British electorate has become more promiscuous about party loyalty, swinging both ways between the Tories and Labour in the last election two years ago. Research from the British Election Study (BES), the longest running social science survey in the UK, found that the 2017 election “saw the highest levels of switching between the Conservatives and Labour since the BES started in 1964.” This was because of “electoral shocks” such as Brexit, with nearly one-third (31%) of Conservative supporters switching to Labour in 2017 because they were not in favor of Britain leaving the European Union. The survey also showed that nearly half the electorate voted for different parties in the past three elections-2010, 2015, and 2017. Six weeks to the election, and four parties-the Conseravtives, Labour, Liberal Democrats, and the Brexit Party-are running in double figures in the opinion polls, underlining the point made by BES co-director, Professor Jane Green: “Almost half the electorate are now floating voters.” Johnson’s Conservatives are at 40% in the latest poll by Opinium Research, the highest figure in a single poll since mid-August. The same poll shows Labour at 24%, the Lib Dems at 15%, and the Brexit Party at 10%. But even a 10-point poll lead right now cannot be seen as a reliable pointer to the future. Workington Man, assuming he exists, is not so easy to pin down."

Medium.com,Society,Blueprint for Revolution: Laugh Your Way to Victory,World,https://medium.com/better-humans/blueprint-for-revolution-laugh-your-way-to-victory-6e9565b09d5?source=topic_page---------162------------------1," I want you to take a moment and play one of my favorite games. It’s called “Pretend Police.” It’s fun. Here goes. Pretend you’re the police in Ankara, Turkey. A few days ago, security guards in one of the busiest subway stations in town spotted a couple making out on the platform. Strict Muslims, the guards were bugged by such immodest behavior in public, so they did the only thing they could really do, which was get on the subway’s PA system and ask all passengers to behave themselves and stop kissing each other. Because everyone in Ankara has smartphones, this little incident was leaked to the press within minutes; by the afternoon, politicians opposed to the ruling Islamist-based party realized that they had gold on their hands and started encouraging their supporters to stage huge demonstrations to protest this silly anti-smooching bias. This is where you come in. On Saturday, the day of the demonstration, you show up in uniform, baton at hand, ready to keep the peace. Walking into the subway station, you see more than a hundred young men and women chanting anti-government slogans and provoking your colleagues. Someone shoves someone. Someone loses their cool. Soon it’s a full-blown riot. If you’re seriously playing along, it’s probably not hard to figure out what to do. You’re a police officer, and you’ve probably spent a whole week at the academy training for situations just like this. It’s what police all over the world do. You move in, you get in formation, you put on your riot gear, and you start to thump your baton on your shield to intimidate the crowd. You probably don’t feel too bad about it, either; you’re only doing your job. Besides, you’re just protecting yourself and your fellow cops from flying stones or whatever else the people decide to throw your way. You move in. It takes you an hour, maybe two, before thirty or forty of the protestors are in jail, ten or twenty are in the hospital, and the rest have run away. You return to the precinct house, drink a coffee with your buddies, and go to bed feeling content with a day’s work. That was easy. Now, let’s play again. It’s Saturday morning. You arrive at the subway station. There are more than a hundred people there, protesting against the censorious announcement from the day before. But they’re not saying anything against the government. They’re not shouting or chanting. They’re kissing each other loudly, making these gross slurpy sounds nobody likes, drooling and giggling. There are almost no signs to be seen, but the ones you do notice have little pink hearts on them and read “Kiss me” or “Free hugs.” The women are in short-sleeved, low-cut blouses. The men have their button-downs on. No one seems to notice you — they’re too busy holding each other’s heads as they suck face. What do you do now? Go ahead and game it out if you’d like, but let me save you the trouble. The answer is that there’s nothing you can do. It’s not only that the amorous demonstrators aren’t breaking any laws; it’s also their attitude that makes a world of difference. If you’re a cop, you spend a lot of time thinking about how to deal with people who are violent. But nothing in your training prepares you for dealing with people who are funny. This is the genius of laughtivism. I know, the name is stupid; my friends who are native English-speakers tell me so all the time. But the principle is solid, and like many things, I stumbled upon it completely by mistake. It was early on in our efforts to take down Milošević, and like all novice activists, we had a moment of reckoning. Looking around the room at one of our meetings, we realized that we were kids, and rather than focus on what we had going for us, we began obsessing about everything we didn’t have. We didn’t have an army. We didn’t have a lot of money. We had no access to media, which was virtually all state-run. The dictator, we realized, had both a vision and the means to make it come true; his means involved instilling fear. We had a much better vision, but, we thought on that grim evening, no way of turning it into a reality. It was then that we came up with the smiling barrel. The idea was really very simple. As we chatted, someone kept talking about how Milošević only won because he made people afraid, and someone else said that the only thing that could trump fear was laughter. It was one of the wisest things I’ve ever heard. As Monty Python skits have always been up there right with Tolkien for me, I knew very well that humor doesn’t just make you chuckle — it makes you think. We started telling jokes. Within the hour, it seemed to us entirely possible that all we really needed to bring down the regime were a few healthy laughs. And we were eager to start laughing. We retrieved an old and battered barrel from a nearby construction site and delivered it to our movement’s “official” designer — my best friend, Duda, designer of the Otpor! clenched-fist symbol — and asked him to draw a realistic portrait of the fearsome leader’s face. Duda was delighted to comply. When we came back a day or two later, we had ourselves Milošević-on-a-barrel, grinning an evil grin, his forehead marked by the barrel’s numerous rust spots. It was a face so comical that even a two-year-old would have found it amusing. But we weren’t done. We asked Duda to paint a big, pretty sign that read “Smash his face for just a dinar.” That was about two cents at the time, so it was a pretty good deal. Then we took the sign, the barrel, and a baseball bat to Knez Mihailova Street, the main pedestrian boulevard in Belgrade. Right off Republic Square, Knez Mihailova Street is always filled with shoppers and strollers, as this is where everyone comes to check out the latest fashions and meet their friends for drinks in the afternoons. We placed the inanimate objects smack in the middle of the street — right at the center of all the action — and hastily retreated to a nearby coffee shop, the Russian Emperor. The first few passersby who noticed the barrel and the sign seemed confused, unsure what to make of the brazen display of dissidence right there in the open. The following ten people who checked it out were more relaxed; some even smiled, and one went as far as picking up the bat and holding it for a few moments before putting it down and quickly walking away. Then, the moment we’d been waiting for: a young man, just a few years younger than us, laughed out loud, searched his pockets, took out a dinar, plopped it into a hole on top of the barrel, picked up the bat, and with a gigantic swing smashed Milošević’s face. You could hear the solid thud reverberate five blocks in each direction. He must have realized that with the few remaining independent radio and newspapers of Belgrade criticizing the government all the time, one dent in a barrel wasn’t going to land him a prison sentence. To him, the risk of action was acceptably low. And once he took his first crack at Milošević’s face, others started to realize that they too could get away with it. It was something between peer pressure and a mob mentality. Soon curious bystanders lined up for a turn at bat and took their own swings. People started to stare, then to point, then to laugh. Before long some parents were encouraging their children who were too small for the bat to kick the barrel instead with their tiny legs. Everybody was having fun, and the sound of this barrel being smashed was echoing all the way down to Kalemegdan Park. It didn’t take long for dinars to pour into the barrel and for poor Duda’s artistic masterpiece — the stern and serious mug of Mr.√ — to get beaten into unrecognizability by an enthusiastic and cheerful crowd. As this was happening, my friends and I were sitting outside at the café, sipping double espressos, smoking Marlboros, and cracking up. It was fun to see all these people blowing off steam with our barrel. But the best part, we knew, still lay ahead. It came when the police arrived. It took ten or fifteen minutes. A patrol car stopped nearby and two pudgy policemen stepped out and surveyed the scene. This is when I came up with my beloved “Pretend Police” game. I played it for the first time at the café that day. The police’s first instinct, I knew, would be to arrest people. Ordinarily, of course, they’d arrest the demonstration’s organizers, but we were nowhere to be found. That left the officers with only two choices. They could arrest the people lining up to smack the barrel — including waiters from nearby cafés, really good-looking girls holding shopping bags, and a bunch of parents with children — or they could just arrest the barrel itself. If they went for the people, they would cause an outrage, as there’s hardly a law on the books prohibiting violence against rusty metal cylinders, and mass arrests of innocent bystanders is the surest way for a regime to radicalize even its previously pacified citizens. Which left only one viable choice: arrest the barrel. Within minutes of their arrival, the two rotund officers shooed away the onlookers, positioned themselves on either side of the filthy thing, and hauled it off in their squad car. Another friend of ours, a photographer from a small students’ newspaper, was on hand to shoot this spectacle. The next day, we made sure to disseminate his photographs far and wide. Our stunt ended up on the cover of two opposition newspapers, the type of publicity that you literally couldn’t buy. That picture was truly worth a thousand words: it told anyone who so much as glimpsed at it that Milošević’s feared police really only consisted of a bunch of comically inept dweebs. I like this barrel story. It’s usually one of the first that our CANVAS trainers Sandra, Sinisa, or Rasko share with aspiring activists. And without fail, every time people hear about it they say more or less what my Egyptian friends did when we walked with them through Republic Square: “It’ll never work back where I’m from.” I have two things to say in response. The first is to quote Mark Twain (you can’t argue with Mark Twain!), who said, “The human race has unquestionably one really effective weapon—laughter… Against the assault of laughter nothing can stand.” The second is to remind my new friends that while humor varies from country to country, the need to laugh is universal. I’ve noticed this as I’ve traveled to meet with activists around the world. People from Western Sahara or Papua New Guinea might not agree with me on what exactly makes something funny—for more on this, see the French obsession with Jerry Lewis or check out any German “comedy”—but everyone agrees that funny trumps fearsome anytime. Good activists, like good stand-up comedians, just need to practice a few acquired skills. The first is to know your audience. I heard a funny story once about a comedian—I forget his name, so my apologies to whoever it was—who was paying his dues by working the club circuit. He was a funny but clueless guy who could put together a punch line but couldn’t read social cues too well. One night the hapless jokester took the stage and started riffing about his girlfriend’s cat. The animal, he said, was a bastard; he knew just when things were getting hot and heavy in the bedroom, and then jumped on the bed and refused to move, meowing and ruining the moment. Then the comic launched into a tirade about how he’d love to kill that cat, describing all the ways—most of which were outlandish and cartoonish—in which he dreamed of robbing the feline of all nine of its lives. It was a great bit, fast-moving and punchy, but no one was laughing. The comic said goodnight and walked off the stage. A few people booed. Only later in the evening did he learn that the evening’s performance was a benefit for a local animal shelter. Had he done his homework, he could have tailored his jokes to the audience’s sensibilities and walked home a winner. That’s just what the Poles did, and often, in the days of Solidarity. In the 1980s, Solidarity was the labor movement that led the fight against Polish Communism. And its activists knew that their audience, the Communist officials who ruled the country, didn’t tolerate outright dissent. It wasn’t like Belgrade, where the culture of an independent media and a grudging acceptance of opposition voices allowed shoppers to feel comfortable smashing a barrel with Milošević’s face on it. In Communist Poland, the activists’ gambits needed to be not only funny but also subtle. And so it was that on a very cold February evening in 1982, the people of Świdnik, a small town in eastern Poland, took their television sets for a walk. This legendary bit of protest began when a few activists in town grew tired of turning on their TVs every evening at seven-thirty and watching smiley announcers with fancy haircuts reading government-approved scripts that were ridiculously rosy and full of lies. They decided to protest by not watching the news. Soon enough, it occurred to them that simply not watching the news wouldn’t do: if all you did was turn off the set and sit around in the dark, nobody would ever know. For the boycott to work, it had to be public, but also subtle enough to avoid a police crackdown. Like comics trying out new material, they improvised. At first, they made a point of unplugging their sets and placing them on their windowsills every evening at 7:30. It was a good first step, public and visible and sending a clear message. But it wasn’t funny at all, and therefore it was uninspiring. This is where the wheelbarrows came into the picture. Someone procured a bunch of them and encouraged a group of friends to take their sets down to the street, load them onto the wheelbarrow, and stroll around leisurely. Before too long, anyone walking the streets of Świdnik at dusk could see friends and neighbors ambling and laughing, pushing along their TVs as if they were baby carriages, using the half-hour previously spent listening to the official newscast to greet one another, gossip, and share in the thrill of standing up to the regime together. It was a great gag, and the practice soon spread to other Polish towns. Flabbergasted, the government weighed its options. It couldn’t arrest anyone; there was no law specifying that Polish citizens were prohibited from placing their television sets in wheelbarrows and walking them around. All it could do was move up its curfew from 10:00 p.m. to 7:00 p.m., forcing everyone indoors. This, they were certain, would stop the shenanigans. It didn’t. Like any budding comedian who gets a taste of the audience’s applause and is hooked for life, the Polish resistance wanted to move on to bigger and flashier displays. It was getting more and more difficult, though, with the Communists now on the lookout for any sign of civil disobedience. By 1987, with the showdown with the dictatorship growing more and more inevitable, they decided to stage their biggest joke yet. They would take to the streets, en masse, to display their absolute and manic love of Communism. In October, as the government celebrated the seventieth anniversary of the Russian Revolution, Solidarity announced that it would stage its own commemorative rally. Adopting the bombastic language of Communism, it printed brochures calling on the people to “break the passivity of the popular masses.” Come to the square, it ordered the faithful, and wear red. Soon the streets were filled with red shoes and red scarves, red ties and red lipsticks, red shirts and red coats. Seeing so many people they knew dressed up like extras in a bad Soviet propaganda film made Poles laugh. The authorities, on the other hand, weren’t amused. It was obvious that the red-clad marchers were mocking the regime’s ideology, but how could the Communists break up a rally in support of Communism? The police positioned themselves on the sidelines, waiting for any excuse to act. Finally, when a few people who didn’t have anything red to wear asked a nearby food stall for a breadstick smeared with ketchup to wave around, the police pounced, shutting down the stall and arresting one of its customers. It was the best they could do. By 1989, the opposition succeeded in instituting semi-free elections. And by 1990, it was in power. It wasn’t only knowing their audience that helped the Poles use humor effectively. It was also that other tenet of good comedy: timing is everything. Using the occasion of International Women’s Day one year, for example, groups of activists positioned themselves in central spots all over Poland distributing free sanitary napkins to passersby. It was a clever way to use the calendar to stage a piece of theater that reminded people that basic supplies, sanitary napkins among them, were nearly impossible to get in the shortage-stricken and disastrously run Polish marketplace. Iranian nonviolent activists, too, have a great knack for timing. Soccer in Iran is second only to Islam in sanctity. It is beloved by everyone and stands just a notch above nuclear armament on the national priority scale. So when Iran played South Korea for a spot at the 2014 World Cup, you could count on everyone’s full and undivided attention. Fatma Iktasari and Shabnam Kazimi knew this when they dressed up for the decisive match one afternoon in 2012. Even though it was hot outside, they put on blue jeans, long black jackets, and wool caps. It was the only way into the stadium: by long-standing custom, women aren’t allowed to attend soccer games in Iran. There, in one of the most religiously conservative societies in the world, it’s just another restriction placed on women. The mullahs, of course, say that this “protective” measure exists to prevent the country’s ladies from hearing the sort of foul language that’s thrown around during sporting events, the type of chant that might corrupt the purity of the delicate feminine soul. But Iktasari and Kazimi weren’t afraid of learning new dirty words. With generic costumes concealing their gender, the two women walked right past the guards and hoped to see their beloved national team beat its opponent and secure a berth in soccer’s most prestigious global tournament. But once the game was underway they quickly ditched their disguises. It was clear to all who were watching that there were real live women inside the stadium, watching the match. In between cheering and chanting, Iktasari and Kazimi also took a few photos of themselves in the stands, which they knew would be big hits on all the social media networks. Had the same feat been attempted on any other day, it’s likely that it would have gotten a bit of attention and then been forgotten. But with soccer and the victory and the World Cup on everybody’s minds, the two women’s dress-up stunt quickly became something much larger than it actually was. First, it presented the Iranian authorities with what we at CANVAS call a dilemma situation. It’s lose-lose for the police all around. They could arrest the women, which would make them look foolish to a worldwide sporting audience of millions — and, what’s worse, perhaps risk some sanction or disqualification from the World Cup tournament — or they could just grin and play nice, let the women sit there to enjoy the game, and give similar ideas to the other thirty-five million women in Iran who are stifling under oppressive laws. The soccer sit-in became a symbol and, like all symbols, a vessel for anyone to read anything into it. In the popular imagination, Iktasari and Kazimi weren’t just activists protesting an oppressive and discriminatory law many Iranians despised; they symbolized hope itself, the promise of one day living in a country where all citizens, regardless of their gender, could go to a soccer match freely and happily. One Iranian blogger even expressed this desire in the form of really bad poetry: “Heroes,” he wrote, dedicating his words to the two daring women, “warriors, dream one day of a workshop with the kids in the ‘freedom’ gym.” The word choice was poor, but the meaning was clear: the comical costumed stunt had gone over very well. By exploiting this dilemma situation, the Iranian activists pushed one of the most feared security apparatuses in the world into a lose-lose scenario. You may doubt that this approach is applicable to political comedy. After all, if they are to succeed, activists must convey meanings and deliver messages, not just pull off a pratfall or a sight gag. But there is a reason humor is such a popular tool in the modern activist’s arsenal: it works. For one thing, it breaks fear and builds confidence. It also adds the necessary cool factor, which helps movements attract new members. Finally, humor can incite clumsy reactions from your opponent. The best humorous actions — or laughtivism — force autocrats and their security pillars into lose-lose scenarios, undermining the credibility of their regimes or institutions no matter how they manage to respond. Politicians, whether they are democratically elected or harsh dictators, usually share an inflated sense of self-importance. After too long in power, and after seeing their own Photoshopped face too many times in newspapers and on the covers of magazines, they start taking themselves too seriously. It’s as if they start believing their own propaganda. This is why they make stupid mistakes when challenged with laughtivism. The high and mighty can’t take a joke."
Medium.com,Society,What Just Happened In Mexico? The Disaster of Culiacan,World,https://medium.com/navigating-life/what-the-fuck-just-happened-in-mexico-b98eff2b340c?source=topic_page---------163------------------1," On Thursday afternoon, October 17, one of the biggest stories in the ongoing saga of the Mexican Drug War occurred. That day in the city of Culiacan in Sinaloa, police and soldiers from the Mexican government arrested Chapo “El Chapo” Guzman’s son, Ovidio Guzman. And what happened next might as well have come right out of a movie. Ovidio Guzman is not only El Chapo’s son, but a high-level trafficker in the Sinaloa Cartel who was indicted by the US Justice Department in February on drug trafficking charges. When the cartel found out El Chapo’s son had been arrested and taken, they decided to act. The cartel started fighting and causing mayhem all over the city to recapture Chapo’s son from the government. It looked like something you’d expect to see happening in Syria, not a Mexican city. On Thursday in the Sinaloan city of Culiacan, the cartel gunmen were everywhere. They openly drove in trucks with mounted machine guns, blockaded streets flashing their Kalashnikovs and burned trucks unleashing plumes of smoke like it was a scene in Syria. They took control of the strategic points in the metro area, shut down the airport, roads, and government buildings and exchanged fire with security forces for hours, leaving at least eight people dead. — Ioan Grillo, Time Magazine At one point in the chaos and confusion, cartel members even went into a prison, freed around 50 inmates, armed some of them, and recruited them to help them fight the government. Civilians in the area were forced to stay inside and hide or find some sort of refuge. Some weren’t even able to get home and had to hunker down in stores and restaurants as the city escalated into a total warzone. There were videos and transcripts of cartel members radioing the government forces and demanding them to give up El Chapo’s son or their families would be murdered. And there were reports that members of the military had their family members taken hostage. Eventually, the government forces decided to release Ovidio in order to avoid more bloodshed. When it was officially announced my jaw dropped. I was in utter disbelief. The next morning, President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador of Mexico gave a statement justifying the decision of Mexican security forces to release El Chapo’s son under pressure from the cartel. “ You can’t fight fire with fire. That’s the difference with this strategy compared with what previous governments have done. We don’t want deaths, we don’t want war.” — President Lopez Obrador There you have it straight from the mouth of the highest-ranking official in Mexico. The cartel just waged all-out war against the government. And they won. These narcos literally shut down an entire city of 800,000 people and forced the government to surrender to them. This is history unfolding in Mexico. It’s completely unprecedented and it feels like here in America, no one’s even talking about it! That just underneath our border, an entire city was at the mercy of drug traffickers and even the President of the country had to admit the best option was to capitulate to them. I can only speculate on some reasons that the American mainstream media isn’t giving this story the attention it deserves but I do have a few guesses: Whatever the reason, I have to wonder. Why isn’t the 24/7 news cycle that loves to have stories of conflict, war, and struggle, jumping on this story? This is one of the worst security crises Mexico has seen in years. This situation in #Culiacan is one of the biggest stories from the Mexican drug war to ever develop. The cartel has power and influence at every level of the Mexican government, military, and police. It seems they just don’t flaunt it unless necessary. What this disaster in Culiacan just did was expose to the outside world who truly runs Mexico. Even from the perception of Mexican citizens this level of brazenness and boldness by the cartels is unprecedented. This is going to cause a lot of people to start talking and asking questions. President Lopez Obrador is going to have to address this new reality in Mexico. While some people may agree with backing down to the cartel in order to avoid violence, many people also consider the move to be cowardly and shameful. “His idea of peace and love doesn’t work. He is making the cartel stronger, I don’t even know what his strategy is.” — Raul Benitez (Security Expert) For the cartel to be able to act with such impunity and demonstrate such an impressive projection of force is truly unsettling. But I’m not sure what the alternative is. It’s crazy to think that these criminal organizations have become so vastly influential that trying to take them on directly would potentially mean civil war. This entire situation in Mexico has become a whole other animal. Removing the drug traffickers forcibly would mean all-out warfare against the cartels, unimaginable levels of counter-intelligence operations, extensive surveillance & undercover work, and a comprehensive purging of large portions of the Mexican government, from the politicians to the military, to all levels of law enforcement. In other words, it would take a miracle. The cartels are so powerful, so dominant, and so embedded in the infrastructure of Mexican society that I’m not sure if forcibly removing them is even an option at this point. There’s no denying that what we’ve just witnessed in Mexico is historic. It’s an unprecedented development and evolution in this ongoing Mexican drug war. It’s completely blurring the lines between organized crime and outright insurgency. I think this is something new that we haven’t seen before where you have a criminal organization that has grown this powerful. Narcos in Mexico have completely shattered the pretense of a government monopoly on violence. This could have huge repercussions and implications on Mexican domestic and foreign policy. International relations might very well be affected because one can make the argument that the official government of Mexico isn’t truly in power. This also calls into question so many things about the War on Drugs and Mexico’s relationship with the United States. With so much money and guns moving south into Mexico and so many drugs moving north into America, this has got to spark a serious conversation. I‘m not sure what this really means for Mexico and its government moving forward. The government itself showed a complete failure in maintaining law and order. It showed that they’ll negotiate with terrorists. It showed that the government can be defeated with violence and it might set a precedent for how Mexican drug traffickers respond to future arrests of high-level targets. This is a dark and challenging time for the people of Mexico and this is a complex and nuanced situation. I don’t have any answers or solutions but I‘ll be continuing to watch how things develop and I hope the people of Mexico can find peace and prosperity. I’ve also covered one of the most recent attacks that occurred in northern Mexico on November 5, 2019."

Medium.com,Society,"This election is not about Brexit, it’s about common human decency",World,https://medium.com/@JohnWight1/this-election-is-not-about-brexit-its-about-common-human-decency-5a302ee95b65?source=topic_page---------165------------------1," One million people, many of them in work, forced to rely on foodbanks; 1 in 4 children living in poverty; homelessness, including rough sleeping, at a 30-year high; real wages down; the worst housing crisis of any advanced industrialised economy; the NHS in crisis; the most ramshackle, anarchic, and expensive rail system in Europe; the highest prison population in western Europe; crime up; suicides up — all this as as the combined wealth of the richest 1000 people in Britain increased by 183 per cent over the same decade in which 120,000 people have died as a direct result of austerity. This grim toll ensures that the general election on 12 December is the most important and seminal in a generation. Brexit of course will figure front and centre for many people when casting their vote. The issue has polarised British society over these past three years, corroding social cohesion as the country grapples with what is inarguably the most severe political and constitutional crisis it has faced in generations. What is crucial to grasp is the fact that Brexit is not in a Tony Benn exit from the EU. Instead it is a disaster capitalist project of the right, dripping in nativism, English nationalism and xenophobia, exposing the dire consequences of a country that has yet to honestly or properly address its colonial and imperial past. But, no matter, Labour and Corbyn’s fortunes in this election will be bound up not with Brexit or even Corbyn’s personal qualities as a putative prime minister. Instead, as in 2017, Labour’s fortunes will be bound up with their manifesto for transformational change. If this manifesto is anything like the one Labour fought the election on two years, it will be one that plants its colours squarely on the side of working people, the low waged and the vulnerable, pledging to reverse decades in which successive governments have worshipped at the altar of the free market, allowing blind economic forces to dictate every aspect of government policy, embracing thereby the economy as a tyrant over the lives of ordinary working people rather than as a servant of their needs. In this regard austerity, rolled out as the answer to the global financial crash of 2007–08, had absolutely nothing to do with economics and everything to do with ideology — specifically the unleashing of a class war with the objective of transferring wealth from poor and working people to the rich and affluent, using the crash as a pretext. The Tory political and media establishment accuses Corbyn of wishing to drag the country back to the 1970s, a supposed decade of doom and gloom in Britain. This is nonsense. I grew up in the 1970s and for working people it was a veritable paradise compared to today. Free dental care, eye care, school meals for all children, decent wages and conditions, trade union rights, a sense of community that is sorely lacking now. And thinking about it, to label these things as “free” is a misnomer. They weren’t free. They were paid for out of general taxation — and taxation, as every smart person knows, is the price we pay for civilisation. Yes, there was a rising tide of industrial action by the unions, but in contradistinction to the right’s historical narrative of the period, this labour unrest came about in response to the spike in inflation that had arrived on the back of the liberalisation of the global financial system, beginning in the early 1970s and exacerbated by the Nixon administration’s decision to abandon the gold standard in 1971. This measure was taken in response to the economic drain on the US economy and the value of the dollar internationally as a result of the war in Vietnam. The result for British workers was downward pressure on wages. As revealed by Cambridge academics Ken Coutts and Graham Gudgin in a report on this causation: “The freeing up of finance led to a huge, and eventually unsustainable, expansion of household borrowing. This temporarily accelerated the growth of consumer spending and hence GDP and of house prices, but in 2008 contributed to a banking crisis and the longest recession for over a century.” Later in the same report, on the issue of industrial relations, the authors have this to say: “Common sense indicates that less [industrial] disruption should be a good thing in itself but not necessarily if the result has been a weakening of wage bargaining power that has allowed a resurgence of extreme income inequality. We note that the UK economy grew consistently and well through the 1950s and 1960s even with poor industrial relations, as it did in the USA with extra-ordinarily high strike levels by British standards.” Jeremy Corbyn, with a manifesto that will do less to drag Britain back to the 1970s and more to move it out of the 1870s, has reignited the kind of class and political consciousness we haven’t seen in decades, challenging three decades of permanent government of the rich, by the rich, and for the rich. And it is for this reason that he’s been so fiercely attacked and demonised by those whose power and privileges are predicated on mass political somnolence. Meanwhile, when it comes to foreign policy, just consider the difference between a government that slavishly attaches itself to the coattails of Trump in Washington and a leader of the opposition who, if elected prime minister, will not. And this is without taking into account the prospect of bringing a long awaited curtain down on the disgraceful cosying up to a bloodsoaked Saudi kleptocracy, blind support for the apartheid State of Israel, and the propensity for military instead of diplomatic intervention as a means by which to sustain influence on the world stage. In 2010 the Tories came to power and unleashed war on society, turning the lives of millions of British people and their families upside down in service to a callously and consciously cruel belief that poverty marked out its victims as perpetrators of their own condition. Thus the demonisation that accompanied austerity shaped public apathy if not consensus when it came to its implementation as being necessary in order to trim the fact of a bloated public sector and purify the poor and disadvantaged with pain. We may not be materially affected by austerity, by foodbanks, benefit sanctions, zero hours contracts, and by attacks on the disabled. However our humanity obliges us to be offended by it. You don’t have to be a migrant to resent their depiction as the enemy within. And you do not need to be among the ranks of growing number of rough sleepers on our streets to understand that no one should be allowed to fall that far. The savage consequences of austerity impacts all of us; the normalisation of so much injustice and cruelty chips away at our own humanity, and that more than anything is unforgivable. It is why, if nothing else, the success of the Tories in turning us into passive spectators of the mass experiment in human despair they have inflicted on the most vulnerable in society should be foremost in our minds when we cast our vote on 12 December. End."
Medium.com,Society,Australia Proposes Face Scans for Watching Online Pornography,World,https://medium.com/@jamietarabay/australia-proposes-face-scans-for-watching-online-pornography-88a29101ebb0?source=topic_page---------166------------------1," The Australian government has proposed using a facial recognition system it is developing to verify that people who seek to watch pornography online are of legal age. Current law in Australia does not prohibit minors from viewing pornography. But the federal government is considering proposals that would require people to prove their age before watching the material. Under the proposal from the Department of Home Affairs, a computer user’s face would be matched to images from official identity documents. It does not say how the user would submit a facial image at the beginning of each online session. The proposal drew immediate objections as a potential infringement of Australians’ privacy. “I think people should be very concerned about any government department that’s seeking to store this kind of information,” said Senator Rex Patrick, a centrist lawmaker from the state of South Australia. The Department of Home Affairs did not respond to questions about the proposal, and the attorney general’s office, when asked to comment on the legal ramifications of the system, directed all questions to Home Affairs. The proposal comes as a growing number of American cities are debating the use of facial recognition systems in surveillance by police departments, with San Francisco becoming the first major American city this year to ban the technology. Proponents of the systems say they are an effective public safety tool that should be regulated but not prohibited. Last month, a British court ruled that police use of the systems does not violate privacy and human rights. At this point, the Australian proposal is merely notional. Parliament has yet to approve a central identity database that the Department of Home Affairs wants to use in a national face-matching system. The system could be used to identify criminal suspects whose images are captured on surveillance cameras. But it is an indication of the ambitions that the department — which oversees all of Australia’s intelligence and national security agencies — harbors for facial recognition technology as it has moved to expand its surveillance powers in the two years since the agency was created. The department made its proposal in a submission to a parliamentary inquiry into proposals for online age verification for pornography and gambling. The effort echoes a move by Britain — which was ultimately dropped — to begin requiring commercial providers of online pornography to verify that their users are 18 or over. The initiative spurred widespread privacy complaints, though the government cited technical gaps that allowed users to bypass verification methods and concerns over cyberattacks in shelving the plan. Under the British initiative, users would have been required to prove their age to third-party verification services using traditional IDs or verified cards purchased from retailers. In Australia, the Department of Home Affairs has offered a different solution, saying it can provide a “suite of identity matching services.” Its face verification service, the department wrote, could help “by preventing a minor from using their parent’s driver’s license to circumvent age verification controls.” Last week, a joint parliamentary committee on intelligence and security rejected a bill proposing the central identity database, which would allow the department to collect, verify and share identity information across federal and state governments. The committee asked for the bill to be redrafted because it “does not adequately incorporate enough detail,” its chairman, Andrew Hastie, said. A committee member, Mark Dreyfus, said there were “almost no limitations or safeguards at all” in the proposed law. The facial verification system will become operational if the bill is passed. The Department of Home Affairs has said that it intends the system to be available not only to government agencies, but also to the private sector. Organizations in the private sector, though, would be able to use the technology only with a person’s consent. This is not the first time the department has proposed a use for facial recognition systems. Last year, it pushed facial verification as a way to crack down on online identity fraud. It also rejected suggestions that warrants would be necessary for access to the country’s facial recognition database. In recent years, Australian governments on both sides of the aisle have passed dozens of national security laws that have increased law enforcement powers and, critics say, encroached on the rights of citizens. Two years ago, the government passed a metadata retention law that allows it to collect and store for two years information on phone calls and text messages, including the identity of participants and the duration of the communication. And late last year it passed a bill that would require technology companies to provide law enforcement and security agencies with access to encrypted communications."
Medium.com,Society,Lebanese Prime Minister Resigns after Reaching “Dead End” Amid Protests,World,https://medium.com/@subverse/lebanese-prime-minister-resigns-after-reaching-dead-end-amid-protests-7e1b081e2368?source=topic_page---------167------------------1," By Tarik Johnson Lebanese Prime Minister Saad Hariri has officially submitted his resignation on Tuesday to President Michel Aoun and is awaiting the final decision. This was one of the demands from protesters who took to the streets two weeks ago, after the government tried to impose a tax on Whatsapp calls, along with other austerity measures. However this is only seen as a single win in what many news outlets are calling the “Lebanese Whatsapp revolution” or the “tax intifada,” with protesters calling for further resignations and a complete overhaul of the sectarian political system. “I can’t hide this from you. I have reached a dead-end,” Hariri said in his resignation speech. “To all my political peers, our responsibility today is how to protect Lebanon and to uplift the economy,” he added. “Today, there is a serious opportunity and we should not waste it.” Lebanon is in an economic and financial crisis which has led to a deep recession. It has the third highest public debt in the world, 150% of its GDP, and its poverty and unemployment rates are high, with one third of people under the age of 35 unemployed. Speaking about how the resignation is a good sign for protesters Lina Khatib, director at Chatham House’s MENA program and research associate at SOAS, said “(It will give) the protest movement momentum after a tough few days during which some demonstrators were beginning to question whether public action was going to achieve much in the face of an obstinate political class that until Hariri’s resignation announcement was refusing to give in to people’s demands.” So far the government proposed a 50 percent cut in the salaries of civil servants and politicians and removal of some of their privileges. A few other ministers have already resigned, and before his resignation Hariri proposed to build new electrical power plants and put new taxes on banking profits. Many believe that even if these measures are taken, it’s unlikely to fix the public opinion on the politicians or end the protests because it will show the government could find billions of dollars in a short amount of time without imposing more taxes on the average citizen. The combination of the protests and Lebanon’s already struggling economy has put enormous pressure on the countries banks. Lebanon’s banking association said banks would remain closed on Tuesday for a 10th working day, but said the central bank had provided the liquidity necessary to pay out salaries for public sector workers, including security forces. Banks previously said they will ensure people receive their end-of-month salaries through ATMs. The banks also said they would stay closed out of concern for the safety of customers and employees. While Lebanon’s pound currency is officially pegged at 1507.5 to the dollar, parallel market rates have risen in recent months. The International Monetary Fund (IMF) said it was evaluating an emergency reform package the Lebanese government announced last week, but which has failed to defuse the popular anger or reassure foreign donors. Riad Salameh, Lebanon’s central bank governor told Reuters, “I am not saying that we are going to have a collapse in a matter of days, I am saying we need to have a solution in a matter of days to regain confidence and avoid collapse in the future.” Hezbollah, a militant Shia group, that has a large impact on the coalition government led by Mr Hariri, a Sunni, has recently reaffirmed its position against the protests. On Tuesday, black-clad men loyal to Hezbollah and another Shia group, Amal, invaded a protest camp in central Beirut, yelling slogans, setting tents on fire and attacking anti-government demonstrators. A roadblock set up by protesters was also attacked. Shia opposition groups are accusing Hariri of siding with protesters and not allowing security forces to remove them from the streets. Tuesday was the first attempt to unblock roads in the capital by force and police have been instructed to not use force with protesters. President Aoun will now have to consult parliament to form another government, but parliament is made up of the same factions that are in the outgoing coalition. Whatever they do, they will do it under intense pressure from the protest movement and from a deepening economic and social crisis.

Amid a flood of memoranda of understanding and cooperation agreements, Russia sealed a series of deals with many of the 54 African countries represented at the conference in Sochi. Russia sees Africa as a vital part of its effort to diversify its global diplomatic, economic, and security relations as Western pressure grows. During the Soviet Era, there was a strong Russian influence in Africa. Countries like Egypt, Algeria, Angola, and others received strong diplomatic or military support from the Soviet Union. However, following the downfall of the Soviet Union in 1991, Soviet-Africa relations cooled off. After a quarter of a century later, Russia now has new ambitions in Africa. To boost its global geopolitical influence, Russia has inserted itself into both Africa and the Middle East. Russia signed a deal to supply 12 Mi-35 Hind E attack helicopters to Nigeria to battle Boko Haram terrorists in the North East. Overall, Russia plans to send $4 billion worth of weapons to African countries in 2019. Russia hopes to build a naval base in Sudan and logistics base in Eritrea, along the coast at the Red Sea. Furthermore, on the horizon, Russia’s interest in establishing a military base in Libya. Russia and Egypt, in 2017, reached a deal to allow Russian military aircraft to use Egyptian airspace and army bases. Military bases in Eritrea and Sudan would enable Moscow monitor Western warships sailing through the Red Sea to either the Mediterranean or the Arabian Sea. In Libya and Egypt, the military bases will position Russia on NATO’s southern flank. Many Russian companies; like Rosneft, Gazprom, and Rosatom; are active in Zimbabwe, Angola, Egypt, Algeria, and Nigeria. In Zimbabwe, Russia is developing one of the largest platinum deposits. Zimbabwe is the third largest platinum producer at 445,000 ounces in 2018, behind South Africa and Russia. In Angola, Russia’s Alrosa is active in diamond mining. Angola mines and sells rough diamonds worth about 6.8 million carats. Estimated reserves are 60 million carats. Russia’s state nuclear company, Rosatom, is in talks with Ethiopia to build a nuclear power station. Also, Rosatom signed an agreement with Rwanda to construct the country’s first nuclear science and technology center. In Egypt, negotiations have been finalized with Russia’s Rosatom for the construction of a five-gigawatt nuclear plant. Construction of the plant is expected to commence in 2020, with commissioning expected in 2026, and completion by 2029. Russia and Egypt, in 2018, signed a 50-year agreement to create a Russian Industrial Zone (RIZ) within the Suez Canal Economic Zone. Russia plans to utilize the zone to produce electronics, and machinery for exports to Africa, Asia, and the Middle East. In 2017, Rosneft bought a 30% stake in Egypt’s Zohr gas field for $1.125 billion. Competing with both the West (Europe & the United States) and the East (China and India) in Africa will present a significant challenge for Russia. Because of its financial limitations, due to sanctions, Moscow is less likely to lure African states with significant investments like China Belt and Road Initiative. Russia’s trade turnover with Africa doubled in the past five years to $20 billion. It is minimal compared to trade volume between Africa and the European Union and China valued at $334 billion and $204 billion respectively."
Medium.com,Society,Slum life: Women and Sanitation,World,https://medium.com/@kristenrive/slum-life-women-and-sanitation-a80594eb419d?source=topic_page---------169------------------1," In India, despite their sociocultural differences, women are unified in their struggle with inadequate sanitary conditions. Females naturally have a greater need for privacy, safety, and cleanliness than males, but often have no better option than to use dirty community toilet complexes or open defecation sites. Inadequate sanitation facilities place females at risk of gendered, caste, and class based violence and harassment. Sanitation in slums is a complex issue, but it must be redesigned to address both biological and sociocultural requirements. The population of Delhi is 22 million and 1.8 million live in 695 slums. The Indian Census reported that there are 811,061 females per 974,329 males. Not only are they outnumbered, but their status as women appears as a justifiable reason for their significant disadvantage. For example, Muslim women living in slums suffer not only because they are a minority, but because they are female. Caste also plays an important part in how women get treated. It is within these circumstances that women must attempt to meet their sanitation needs. Slums are described as residential dwellings unfit for human habitation because of several factors such as poor ventilation, cramped spaces, dilapidated and unsanitary conditions. Many people in slums survive without basic amenities like electricity, gas, plumbing and clean water facilities. In fact, an economic survey of Delhi in 2017 found that 22% of slums do not have latrine facilities. Toilets in Delhi slums are household constructed private toilets or community toilet complexes. But these toilets do not adequately serve the slum population. Politicians will come to slums offering change, often before an election. They might implement new infrastructure, but often the process fails because they do not follow through with the requirements. Experts on the subject describe this purposeful lack of government intervention as ‘sanitation infrastructural violence’. Meaning that government sanitation policies do not look at the entire process, such as ensuring toilet blocks have an adequate water supply, maintaining regular cleaning, and proper connections to the sewage system. But, considering that many slums do not connect to sewage systems, new toilet blocks quickly become dirty, in need of repair, becoming so overcrowded that women often see open defecation sites as the better option. There has been a reported link between sanitation and gender based violence. This includes teasing, whistling, groping, rape or assault, attempted rape, flashing, sticks thrown and photos taken of them. Some women have even reported stories about men dressing as women so they can sneak up and attack while they are defecating. Approach roads can also be dangerous as men will be drunk, lying on the road, screaming obscenities. Globally, gender based violence has been increasing, particularly in rapidly urbanising countries like India. Reportedly, four out of five women in India have experienced harassment in a public space. Offenders are often unknown to the women and are believed to come from the next colony which helps them evade punishment. This highlights the gender inequalities women face just trying to use toilets. Women often feel they cannot tell anyone about harassment incidents. For instance, even if their partners are told, they often refrain from complaining to the police for fear of harassment and attacks on their dignity. This reflects the influence of cultural attitudes on sanitation. Sanitation also encompasses intra-community variations such as gender relations at home. Some women cannot talk to males in their family, such as those who are in purdah, the religious and social practice of female seclusion. Therefore, depending on the relationship, the husband or male head of the household may reject the request for a toilet. This illustrates the difficulty some women face in voicing their concerns about an issue that they are most affected by. Religious beliefs coupled with intolerance from men often mean that women must face a silent struggle with sanitation issues. Across Hindu and Muslim cultures bodily secretions such as faeces, blood, semen and urine are polluting. These beliefs call for the necessity of ritualistic cleansing after such activities as sexual intercourse, menstruation or after defecation. However during menstruation women often have to reuse dirty cloths due to a lack of privacy and space. The lack of privacy, inconvenience and uncleanliness reduces the dignity of women. Because, not only do they need to meet their personal needs but also that of their families, on top of trying to hide their body in public settings. This makes for an enormous burden. The problem is the lack of integration of needs into investment and implementation of sanitation. At the very least, local governments need to check that there is an adequate water supply before building toilet blocks. Decision making about design and planning should involve local women, as they are the ones who suffer the most from inadequate sanitation facilities. However, empowering women with this task would require addressing the gendered inequalities that tie sanitation to responsibilities. For women living in the slums, religious and cultural requirements shape privacy and comfort. This makes improving sanitation a complex, multifaceted issue. Therefore, to be effective sanitation must consider biological needs as well as the impact of gender inequality."
Medium.com,Society,Untitled story,World,https://medium.com/goods-services/modest-price-hikes-lead-to-major-protests-e01aa340b69?source=topic_page---------170------------------1," Newspapers from The Guardian to The South China Morning Post are talking about more and more protests around the world. The playbook for each event is very similar. First, there’s an event that seems small, but upsets a lot of people. In Hong Kong, it was an extradition bill. In Chile, it was a $0.04 fare increase on metro tickets. In Lebanon, it was a tax on Voice over IP calls. And in India, onion inflation is skyrocketing. Then, young people begin protesting. They are organizing through encrypted messaging apps and filling the streets to protest the proposed measures or government corruption. In most cases, the government reverses its course. Hong Kong pulled the extradition bill. Chile and Lebanon canceled the taxes and India has put severe measures in place to manage the price of onions. However, in each of these situations, it is too little, too late. The protesters have not backed down. Most of the unrest starts around economic concerns. Young people are taking action because of higher income inequality around the globe and concerns about the future job market. The problem is that according to most global metrics the international economy is doing relatively well. According to the International Monetary Fund, the gross world product, the combined gross national product of all the countries in the world, has increased by 3% or more every year since 2009. This number suggests that workers, even young workers, should be in a better position than they were a decade ago. However, the cost of living in most cities is increasing faster than the economic prospects of most of the protesters. In this story, all roads lead to income inequality. From the increased global dissent, it is clear that the healthy global economy is not helping everyone. The real concern is what happens when the global economy starts showing signs that it is slowing down. If modest price increases are already causing protests and riots what happens when the global economy stops growing by more than 3% annually? If the last few months are any measure, the future will have even more protests. Why? The global economy cannot keep expanding indefinitely. Plus, trade disputes are putting pressure on the economy, weakening it in most cases. Slower growth or worse, contraction, will cause more people to face economic hardship. Another reason that protests will spread is that technology is connecting communities around the globe. In the last 30 years, technological advances have increased the influence of civil societies and NGOs by allowing groups that were domestically focused to expand their influence internationally. Youth around the world are able to create a shared identity through online groups and social networks. These groups can share information, ideas, tactics, and expert opinions instantly with other parts of the world. In the past, people would travel to other parts of the world to train with resistance or change leaders. Then they would return home and push for change. Today, technology has cut the time and cost of gaining political know-now dramatically. Groups can join forces transnationally to achieve the same goal. On the surface, these isolated protests might appear to be unrelated. However, if an unhappy young adult in one country sees successful protestors in another part of the world, he or she may be inspired. The two individuals or movements can easily communicate and share tips and strategies. Since youth are leading these movements and youth are the best at transforming the uses of technology, it’s easy to make the leap that social media and the internet is making it easier for more protests to pop up."
Medium.com,Society,The Long Coup,World,https://medium.com/@indica/the-long-coup-c8b53c7ccb07?source=topic_page---------171------------------1," S
ri Lanka has an election in less than three weeks, but it’s unclear who’s in opposition. After a coup attempt last October, Humpty Dumpty was never put back together. The government remains divided and both sides are essentially running against it. This is a classic playbook really. Hitler first tried a coup and then took power legitimately, through elections. It’s a particular sort of cancer that democracies are vulnerable to and you can see facism vs. doe-eyed democracy all over the world. In case you hadn’t noticed, it’s happening here. In October, the President switched sides. He appointed an opposition leader Mahinda Rajapaksa as Prime Minister, and publicly spoke about how MPs were hard to bribe these days. When they couldn’t buy a majority, they physically attacked MPs and Police in Parliament and tried to prevent it from functioning. After street protests and a court ruling this was finally rolled back, but not completely. The President, who was a criminal at this point, was not impeached, and he and the Rajapaksas went on to sabotage the country over the next year. Despite having to give Parliament back, the President retained military control and took over the police. Which still sounds like a coup… With that he proceeded to shut down an investigation into extreme Islamic terrorism, jailing the lead investigator. He then centralized and buried all the incoming intelligence and, somewhat predictably, a terrible attack happened in April. If this sounds like a conspiracy, please read the Parliament committee investigation, which is actually worse. In response, the Rajapaksas and his own party unleashed a set of anti-Muslim mob attacks — where perpetrators were bailed out by Dayasiri, the President’s party secretary. The President also pardoned the main instigator of racist riots, who went on to more incitement and contempt of court. At the same time, rumors of attacks on schools circulated — backed by no intelligence in particular. However, troops were deployed at schools across the country, with the tragic result of one parent actually being killed. This was in effect part of a campaign to aggravate rather than settle fears. The coup itself caused the rupee to tumble and resulted in a wave of tourist cancellations. This was a hit to our democracy, but also the economy. The criminal neglect leading to the Easter Attacks then delivered a knockout punch, reducing tourism to almost zero and cutting economic activity nearly in half. Leading up to elections, the SLPP also organized protests by doctors, railways workers and retired soldiers — crippling hospitals, transportation and blocking the streets. This is all leading up to the November election. The SLPP has successfully attacked national security and the economy and is now campaigning on a promise to fix both. Perhaps by attacking them less when they’re in power. It is a bit like someone breaking your window and showing up with a pane of glass, and a bill. This ongoing sabotage of a nation for political power is wrong, but somewhat predictable when there were zero consequences for the illegal acts of the coup. The President wasn’t impeached and the politicians who assaulted police in Parliament were never punished. So in effect they tried again. They are running a candidate for President and assaulting the country. Not punished for the coup, they are instead looking for a reward. In the face of this, the fellowship of the thing is broken. The UNP is running a rebel candidate from within its ranks and the conscience of the nation, the JVP, is running independently. Civil society / good governance types are running a former general and dozens of other candidates have emerged — almost all on the democratic side (as opposed to Rajapaksatarian). Sajith Premadasa is the most viable candidate and also somehow opposition because the Prime Minister hates him, but he is still tied to a party that is tied to the ongoing wreckage of the coup. And yet it is hard to give another mandate for ‘good governance’ when the last attempt went to so badly. And yet you have to ask why that was. The fact is that the government was going mediocrely, until the SLPP staged the coup. Then it was going badly, until they made it tragic with ongoing sabotage of national security and the economy. I don’t know who’s in government, but I do know that I oppose the attacks on our democracy, security and economy by the SLPP. I’ll never vote for the SLPP, because they are a fundamentally anti-democratic party trying to break a democracy. So that leaves the JVP and the UNP. Honestly, I wish it was just those two running. Then it would be a choice between two very different ideas of governance, rather than just between people. So of those two, I dunno, choose whatever you want. You have three preference votes (vote as 1,2 or 1,2,3 — but not Xs) so you can actually vote for both. But please don’t vote to legitimize the coup. These criminals who should be in jail are now visiting jails saying that even more criminals will be released. The people that crippled are national security are running on national security, those who attacked the economy are running on reviving it. It’s hard to see when the sabotage has been so thorough, but it shouldn’t be rewarded. It’s been a long coup. Please help end it in November."
Medium.com,Society,Confronting the new climate reality in Asia and the Pacific,World,https://medium.com/@UNESCAP/confronting-the-new-climate-reality-in-asia-and-the-pacific-49e42e413849?source=topic_page---------172------------------1," By Kaveh Zahedi, Deputy Executive Secretary for Sustainable Development In
less than ten days world leaders, including representative from Myanmar will be gathering at the United Nations in New York for the Climate Action Summit. Their goal is simple; to increase ambition and accelerate action in the face of a mounting climate emergency. For many this means ambition and action that enables countries to decarbonize their economies by the middle of the century. But that is only half the equation. Equally ambitious plans are also needed to build the resilience of vulnerable sectors and communities being battered by climate related disasters of increasing frequency, intensity and unpredictability. Nowhere is this reality starker than in the Asia Pacific region which has suffered another punishing year of devastation due to extreme events linked to climate change. Last year Kerala state in India had its worst floods in a century. The floods in Iran in April this year were unprecedented. Floods and heatwaves in quick succession in Japan caused widespread destruction and loss of life. In several South Asian countries, immediately following a period of drought, weeks of heavy monsoon rains this month unleashed floods and landslides. Across North-east and South Asia, record high temperatures have been set. The latest research from the United Nations Economic and Social Commission for Asia and the Pacific has shown that intense heatwaves and drought are becoming more frequent; unusual tropical cyclones originate from beyond the traditional risk zones and follow tracks that have not been seen before; and unprecedented floods and occurring throughout the region including Myanmar. The science tells us that the impacts are only going to increase in severity and frequency as greenhouse gas emissions concentrations in the atmosphere continue to rise. The poor and vulnerable are taking the biggest hit. Disasters cost lives and damage livelihood and assets. Increases in disaster exposure are increasing child malnutrition and mortality and forcing poor families to take children out of school — entrenching inter-generational poverty. And they perpetuate inequalities within and between countries. A person in the Pacific small island developing states is 3 to 5 times more at risk of disasters than a person elsewhere in our disaster-prone region. Vanuatu has faced annual losses of over 20% of its GDP. In Southeast Asia, Lao, Cambodia and Viet Nam have all faced losses of more than 5% of their GDP. In short, disasters are slowing down and often reversing poverty reduction and widening inequality. But amidst this cycle of disaster and vulnerability lies a golden opportunity for careful and forward-looking investment. The Global Commission on Adaptation recently found that there would be over $7 trillion in total net benefits between now and 2030 from investing in early warning systems, climate-resilient infrastructure, improved dryland agriculture, mangrove protection, and in making water resources more resilient could generate. So where could countries in the Asia Pacific region make a start? First, by providing people with the means to overcome shocks. Increasing social protection is a good start. Currently developing countries in Asia and the Pacific only spend about 3.7 per cent of GDP on social protection, compared to the world average of 11.2 per cent, leaving people vulnerable in case they get sick, lose their jobs, become old or are hit by a disaster. In the aftermath of Typhoon Hyan in the Philippines we saw effectiveness of social protection, especially cash transfers, but these were only possible because the government could use the conditional cash transfer system and mechanism already in place for poor and vulnerable people. Second by lifting the financial burden off the poor. Disaster risk finance and insurance can cover poor and vulnerable people from climate shocks and help them recover from disaster, such as Mongolia’s index-based insurance scheme to deal with the increased frequency of “dzuds” where combination of droughts and shortage of pasture lead to massive livestock deaths. Disaster risk finance can also help countries pool the risks as is happening through the emerging ASEAN Disaster Risk Financing and Insurance programme. Third by increasing investment in new technologies and big data. Artificial Intelligence driven risk analytics as well as fast combination of sensor and geospatial data, can strengthen early warning systems. Big data, including from mobile phones, can help identify and locate vulnerable populations in risk hotspots who have been the hardest to reach so far, ensuring faster more targeted help after disasters. Experience around the region has already shown the potential. In India, a combination of automated risk analytics, geospatial data and the digital identity system (the so called AADHARR system) have helped to identify and deliver assistance to millions of drought-affected subsistence farmers. But much more investment in needed to make technology an integral part of disaster risk response and resilience building. Climate related disasters are likely to increase in Asia Pacific. This is our new climate reality. The Summit provides the perfect platform to make the commitments needed for helping communities and people to adapt to this reality before decades of hard-won development gains are washed away."

Medium.com,Society,Why Was ISIS Leader Killed In US Raid Just Miles From Turkey?,World,https://medium.com/citizen-truth/why-was-isis-leader-killed-in-us-raid-just-miles-from-turkey-c5ede3b5c3cb?source=topic_page---------174------------------1," The leader of ISIS, Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, was killed in a US operation in northern Syria on Saturday night only a few miles from the Turkish border raising questions about his ties to Turkey. President Trump gave a graphic description of al-Baghdadi’s death in a Sunday morning news conference: “He died after running into a dead-end tunnel, whimpering and crying and screaming. The compound had been cleared by this time, with people either surrendering or being shot and killed. Eleven young children were moved out of the house un-injured. The only ones remaining were Baghdadi in the tunnel, who had dragged three children with him to certain death. He reached the end of the tunnel, as our dogs chased him down. He ignited his vest, killing himself and the three children. His body was mutilated by the blast, but test results gave certain and positive identification.” Al-Baghdadi’s death is a major symbolic blow to ISIS, which remains active, but scattered, after holding nearly a third of Syria and Iraq as a self-proclaimed caliphate at its peak. Al-Baghdadi declared himself the caliph of the ruthless terrorist organization, which was denounced by even al-Qaida for its sadistic practices. No US soldiers were hurt in the operation, which Trump described as “impeccable.” US national security adviser Robert O’Brien said the raid will be named after Kayla Mueller, a humanitarian who was captured by the terrorist group, tortured, and sexually abused by Baghdadi before dying in ISIS confinement at the age of 26. “I am grateful to our president and brave troops for finding ISIS leader Al-Bagdadi,” said Diane Foley, whose son James was among the American hostages murdered by ISIS. “I hope this will hinder the resurgence of terror groups and pray that captured Isis fighters will be brought to trial and held accountable.” Trump mentioned the Americans who were killed by ISIS at the press conference, and thanked the Kurds, Russia, Iraq, Turkey, and even Syria’s Assad dictatorship for providing unspecified aid in the mission. “For five months there has been joint intel cooperation on the ground and accurate monitoring, until we achieved a joint operation to kill Abu Bakir al-Bagdadi,” Kurdish commander Mazloum Abdi tweeted. “Thanks to everybody who participate in this great mission.” The location of the raid was Idlib, a city curiously close to the Turkish border. “A big question is what was Baghdadi doing apparently in a hideout less than five kilometers from Turkey’s border? In a province Turkey ostensibly controls and maintains with military outposts,” asked diplomat Brett McGurk, as per the New Yorker’s Robin Wright. During ISIS’s peak, oil smuggling was the terrorist group’s main source of revenue. “Widespread reports” have shown that the contraband oil was sold in Turkey, with government officials such as President Erdogan’s son-in-law allegedly involved in the illegal trade, as reported by Foreign Policy’s Ahmet Yayla and Colin Clarke. “There are many more examples of Turkey’s passive support to Islamic State fighters, including wounded Islamic State militants treated for free at hospitals across southeastern Turkey,” wrote Clarke and Yayla. “Among those receiving care was one of the top deputies of Islamic State chieftain Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, Ahmet el-H, who was treated in a private hospital in Sanliurfa in August 2014.” Turkey has also recruited jihadist fighters for its massacre of the US-allied Kurds in recent weeks. The Kurds, who were the frontline fighters against ISIS and continue to help fight against the terrorist group, were abandoned by President Trump after a call with Erdogan earlier this month. Hundreds of ISIS prisoners guarded by the Kurds have escaped in the wake of Turkey’s assault on northern Syria. Turkey is not alone among governments that hold questionable relations with the terrorist organization. As a leaked WikiLeaks email from 2014 shows, Hillary Clinton told campaign manager John Podesta of the need to pressure “the governments of Qatar and Saudi Arabia, which are providing clandestine financial and logistic support to ISIL and other radical Sunni groups in the region.” While the death of one of the most ruthless terrorists in modern history has been widely celebrated, critics like Intercept columnist Mehdi Hasan are concerned that without addressing the underlying political issues and power vacuums in the Middle East, jihadist groups like ISIS will continue to operate. Hasan cast doubt on Sen. Graham’s claim that al-Bagdadi’s death would be a “game changer” in the region, noting how the death of ISIS architect al-Zarqawi in 2010 failed to stop the growth of the terrorist group, which held territory the size of Portugal and contained 8 million people in its peak. “We don’t know how its going to play out. The experts say that when a terrorist leader is killed, it could set back the group in the longterm, but in the short term it actually could make the group more deadly as they try to plan revenge attacks,” said Hasan told MSNBC on Sunday. Hasan criticized the president for his rhetoric and Muslim ban, noting that ISIS recruiters use Trump’s speeches to bolster their “clash of civilizations” narrative of the West’s hatred towards Islam. But despite his concern that ISIS will survive, Hasan agreed that al-Baghdadi’s death is a huge symbolic blow to the terrorist organization. “On behalf of every Muslim I know…every Muslim watching…good riddance to Abu Bakr Al Baghdadi,” Hasan told MSNBC. “Here is a man whose primary victims were Muslims, who was loathed by Muslims…The world is a a better place…Good riddance to this piece of human scum.” Read the original article and sign up for our newsletter at https://citizentruth.org"

For 12 days (as of writing), protestors, in a show of national solidarity that transcends entrenched and traditional geographic and sectarian divides, have been able to sustain a defacto general strike by blocking major roads and highways throughout the country. Although the strength of this stranglehold has waned at times, the people’s resilience has been proven as every speech given by a government official or traditional party leader has been countered with a larger influx of people to the streets. Even with this incredible show of strength in the face of sporadic violence and suppression, some are already writing the revolutions obituary. Although I cannot condone or participate in such fatalistic analyses, it would be wrong to withhold any form of constructive criticism that can help us identify the strengths and weaknesses of this movement as well as what threats may lay ahead. To be able to make such criticisms we would need a better understanding of the forces at play in the uprising. This as opposed to leaning on tired platitudes of regional comparisons or lack of clear goals. There are five main characteristics of the Lebanese uprising that can help us shape our understanding of it. The first and most important one is that it is a Spontaneous and reactive uprising. People took to the streets after an announcement of additional taxes from the government and have not left since then. This is important because the uprising is not being maintained by any political initiative but is self-regenerative. This is impressive considering the lack of political participation or opposition in previous political crises. The ability for the uprising to sustain itself then can only be taken as a sign of accelerated development of discipline and revolutionary ethic usually thought to be impossible to find in spontaneous uprisings. This is further supported by the fact that the uprising has not subsided in the face of promised concessions from the government and multiple attempts to co-opt or suppress the uprising. The second characteristic is that the uprising is decentralized. Previous oppositional movements to the government usually found their confrontations confined to Beirut and met with entrenched scepticism by those outside the capital city. This time, protests have erupted in all major cities and several smaller ones. Most striking is the fact that the uprising is also taking place in areas that are thought to be the most entrenched in the traditional political system which has sustained itself through clientelism. Protestors have correctly identified this decentralization as a strength of the uprising. The movement cannot be dismissed as an expression of outrage from a privileged class of city dwellers. Mass participation has also meant that the government has been unable to play different sections of the Lebanese population against each other making them politically impotent. Inline with decentralization and spontaneity, the third characteristic of the uprising is that it is Leaderless. This is a bit of a tricky one, there is no doubt that a diffused ‘leadership’ of sorts has, by now, naturally emerged to coordinate the various protest sites. However, leadership here is not used in the directional sense of the term but rather the functional and organizational sense. The fact that the movement has remained leaderless is being touted as a firm positive. This is because the government has repetitively called for a meeting with the movement’s leadership to negotiate demands. A leaderless movement means that there is no one to negotiate with and a minimization of the threat of opportunism. This rejection of opportunism was made clear when protesters made it clear that anyone claiming to negotiation on behalf of the protesters is to be labelled a traitor to the revolution and to be excommunicated — further proof of the revolutionary discipline developed. The ‘leaderlessness’ of the uprising is also being presented as a way to preserve its decentralization and minimize fragmentation. Finally, a leaderless revolution means the government doesn’t have targets to imprison. But here, two contradictions present themselves. The first is that if the revolutionary spirit is this formidable, then why the fear of leadership? If a movement can disown a self-proclaimed leader claiming to negotiate on its behalf, it can just as well chose leaders that are given no mandate to negotiation and disown them just as well as they would the self-proclaimed leadership. Second, the juxtaposition of leadership and decentralisation is simply false. Leadership can easily be constituted in a way that reflects and emboldens the decentralization of the movement and respects the pluralism within it. The situation gets more complicated when we confront the fact that the uprising has a leadership constituted from the various political oppositional forces that have been manifesting since the garbage crisis of 2015. This leadership made itself known on the first Sunday of the uprising to reject the concessions provided by the Prime Minister and is referenced frequently in the news. It has even put forth four concrete demands including 1) the immediate resignation of the government 2) the freezing of politicians financial accounts 3) the creation of a small technocratic administrative government meant to formulate plans to save Lebanon from its financial woes 4) early parliamentary elections. With this, any talk of the movement being leaderless can be dismissed, what can be said however is that this ‘leadership’ is choosing to take a passive role instead of a directional one that tries to mould the uprising or take it in one direction or the other. In this way, the uprising’s leadership is maintaining the reactive nature of the revolution. Finally, there is something to be said about the social phenomena of imprisoned leaders as sources of galvanisation and the intensification of confrontation. The demands made by this leadership brings us to the fourth characteristic of the uprising — A-politics. The protestors and its leadership consistently repeat that they do not belong to any political school of thought or movement, they are simply calling for a removal of the entire ruling class and its system of confessional representation. The proof of this ‘non-alignment’ is that they are not seeking power for themselves, but want to replace the current government with technocrats who have the technical skills to save Lebanon from doom (as per demand #3). This presentation is a bid to present Lebanon’s problems as simple, technical, or administrative problems with scientific solutions. But this point is met with immediate contradictions. What political method will be used to select the ‘technocrats’? what decision-making system will tell us the correct technical solution? and since we’re asking this question, who said a team of technocratic administrators should be the next step? why not opt for direct democratic control of the economy by the people? it’s their revolution, not the leaderships. Obviously then these proposed solutions are themselves political and subscribe to a set political-economic ideology. Two further contradiction can be found here. The first is that there needs to be leadership for it to be able to disqualify itself from leadership. As we have seen it is not that this movement doesn’t have a leadership. It is that this leadership refuses to play a leadership role — an outright political decision meant to preserve the decentrality and autonomy of the movement. this brings us to our second contradiction in that for all the talk of decentralization, an immediate demand of the leadership is to centralize control to a group of technocrats as soon as the current government resigns. How is it then that the leadership is promoting decentralization as a way to blunt fragmentation, but is looking to turn its back on it as soon as its primary goal is met in favour of a ‘dictatorship of the technocratia’. If fragmentation due to centralization is expected under uprising conditions, why would it not be expected during the consolidation of the revolution? The fifth and final characteristic of this uprising is that it embraces and seeks to maintain current institutions. Shortly after the beginning of the uprising, the Lebanese Army announced a state of neutrality. This was quickly hailed by protestors who quickly aligned themselves with the army. A declaration of neutrality meant that the army will not tolerate attacks on protestors by government party supporters who are better organized, armed, and are not afraid to use direct violence. However, by declaring neutrality the army removed itself from the playing field. Where previously the army was seen as an institution that the protestors can pressure and manipulate — an area of contestation, its declaration of neutrality solidified it as an agent of the state apparatus and the ruling class in its entirety. The army, even though it has promised to protect the protestors from rogue actors, has also regularly participated in the clearing of roads from protestors — that is to say that it has actively suppressed the movement as well. The army is not the only institution that the uprising refuses to contest. The leadership of the uprising has refused to contend with the network of banks, construction companies, export/import businesses, universities, and hospitals that are aligned to the current ruling class. Even with a change in the political system in Lebanon, these institutions will remain as will their loyalties to the ruling class. One can argue that once the seizure of power by the uprising is complete, then these institutions will automatically redirect themselves as the old ruling class stops being useful, but these institutions are inseparable from the ruling class meaning that they will not turn on them before the seizure of power and will probably disappear with the ruling class if they are successfully ousted leaving technocratic administrators with nothing to administer! This refusal to contest these institutions and the uprisings alignment with the army has also meant that the uprising’s arsenal of direct action is automatically limited for one cannot escalate tactics to occupations and the building of dual power if they want to be seen as an ally to the institutions that have propagated their oppression. These too are political decisions that place unnecessary shackles on the uprising and relegate it to a position second to the government it wishes to overthrow. Without the ability to escalate tactics and intensify the revolutionary process the uprising maintains the governments best weapon, time. None of these observations is meant to poke holes or discredit the uprising, nor is it meant to be seen as opposition or prognosis of failure. However, all of these are issues worth considering and will impact the revolutionary process well past the resignation of the government and the seizure of power. Here major questions around what opposition to the ascending government will look like, and how a new government will deal with such opposition is unclear — especially if some of these oppositional forces already have a system of dual power. Will the institutions that the uprising is fighting hard to maintain be able to uphold their role as well as they currently are? Will elections according to a new non-confessional electoral law really present new leaders? One may project that in the event of a successful revolution, institutions hollowed out by the ruling class will be reinforced by the large Lebanese diaspora. We can equally project that the discipline forged through this uprising will repel any violent counterrevolution after the seizure of power as it has during the uprising. Although we can equally say that this discipline and unity might disintegrate once the flood gates of ‘politics’ reopen in a post-uprising Lebanon; in which case a counterrevolution may not need to be violent but can simply reassert itself through electoral politics. The future is unknown, this does not mean that we shouldn’t push forward, but that at the least, we should be aware of the words of warning by Antonio Gramsci. The crisis consists precisely in the fact that the old is dying and the new cannot be born; in this interregnum a great variety of morbid symptoms appear."
Medium.com,Society,A Brief and Glorious History of America’s Canine Warriors,World,https://gen.medium.com/her-name-is-conan-military-dogs-like-the-one-in-the-syria-isis-raid-have-a-long-pedigree-de86a9c2b866?source=topic_page---------177------------------1," ISIS leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi likely died with the sound of one of America’s most fearsome warriors still ringing in his ears. In the aftermath of the Saturday night raid on al-Baghdadi’s compound in Syria’s northeastern Idlib province, U.S. officials revealed that it was a military working dog that pursued the elusive terror kingpin into the dead-end subterranean tunnel where he ignited his suicide vest, killing himself and three children he used as human shields. Of the U.S.’s elite forces who conducted the raid, only the dog was injured. That a military working dog was involved in the raid is unsurprising: since 9/11, Man’s Best Friend has become an increasingly critical element of the Global War on Terror. And as of Monday, the Unites States’ new favorite Good Boy — reportedly a female Belgian Malinois, the same breed as Cairo, the dog that accompanied Navy SEALs on the mission that killed Osama bin Laden in 2011 — had already returned to duty downrange. (Surprisingly, the dog’s name remains classified, though reports suggest her name is Conan.) That Trump, the first president in a century without a dog in the Oval Office, reportedly wants to meet with Conan at the White House isn’t just astounding, but wholly unprecedented given that, for decades, the valor of military working dogs has gone wholly unrecognized. Dogs have been an integral part of U.S. military strategy since they started entering the service in World War II. Below, a brief history of U.S. military working dogs — and their rising stardom at home. While dogs have been employed in military conflicts from detecting intruders to hauling artillery, the only military working dogs employed by the U.S. Army prior to the U.S. entry into World War II were the roughly 50 sled dogs assigned to remote military outposts in Alaska. According to an internal history from the Army’s Quartermaster General, the rapid proliferation of new installations and industrial facilities also came with increasing concern over saboteurs and seditionists, especially as German submarines began operating off the eastern seaboard of the United States in 1942. Dogs offered a simple solution, their keen sense a valuable asset to Coast Guard beach patrols and, eventually, base security forces across the country. The Army formally established the K-9 Corps in the aftermath of the December 1941 attack on Pearl Harbor to help solicit volunteer working dogs from across the United States. Indeed, the K-9 Corps produced one of the earliest heroes of the Army’s foray into military working dogs: Chips, a mixed-breed canine who alerted his handler to a machine-gun attack while assigned to the 7th Army during the Allied invasion of Sicily. Chips was awarded the Silver Star and the Purple Heart for his efforts, an honor that apparently irked the Military Order of the Purple Heart, a congressionally chartered veterans’ organization. The group reportedly complained that “giving the medals to a dog was an insult to the men who received them,” according to the American Kennel Club. As a result, the Army ordered that any recognition of military animals “be published in unit general orders” rather than with a specific military award like the Silver Star or Purple heart. The order was essentially a warning to commanders to not dole out medals to military working dogs again; their achievements, the message said, were not on par with their human counterparts. The achievements of war dogs went relatively unnoticed in the intervening years. According to journalist Rebecca Frankel’s book War Dogs: Tales of Canine Heroism, History, and Love, the military canines of World War II were credited with saving some 15,000 men; in Vietnam, war dogs conducted an estimated 87,000 missions in which dogs enabled more than 4,000 enemy kills. ”How the dogs came in, and how they came out again, is as important, in some ways, as what they did while they were there,” Frankel writes. “This discernable pattern of U.S. war dog history is one of building to a great success that is later shelved and forgotten, only to be rebuilt again when the need arises.” The idea of retiring a military working dog back to the U.S. wasn’t even considered until the Vietnam War. In December 1966, an Air Force sentry dog named Nemo alerted his handler, Airman 1st Class Robert A. Throneburg, to an incoming Viet Cong commando raid on the American Tan Son Nhut air base before engaging the attacking force, “lung[ing] savagely forward into the enemy’s nest” with Throneburg close behind, according to contemporary reports. After killing two VC fighters, Throneburg was wounded and Nemo lost his right eye, but the dog refused to leave his handler, protecting him from approaching soldiers until other Air Force security forces could arrive. Nemo would become the first sentry dog retired back to the United States; the 37th Security Forces Squadron kennel compound was named in his honor in 2005. But he was one of a startling few: As Frankel notes, when the U.S. started dismantling its canine programs after Vietnam, the Pentagon left behind nearly 4,900 in the country. Veterans believe roughly 1,600 of the dogs were euthanized. Until President Bill Clinton signed “Robby’s Law” into law in 2000, it was common practice to simply euthanize military working dogs at the end of their service rather than overseeing their exit into the welcoming arms of civilian law enforcement or their former handlers. The importance of working dogs in counter-IED and counter-insurgency operations post-9/11 has only grown, and not just because of uber-famous, Osama Bin Laden-hunting war dogs like Cairo. The proliferation of IEDs produced what Frankel calls the “Dog Surge,” an urgent need for Marine Corps Improvised Explosive Detector Dogs and the Army Tactical Explosive Detection Dogs. And since then, their primacy has only grown: look no further than Maiko, the multi-purpose canine (MPC) who helped alert Army Rangers to an ambush in Afghanistan this past December. The military working dogs of the Iraq and Afghanistan campaigns are among the hardest-working in the history of U.S. warfare. Dogs allegedly saved 15,000 men during World War II, according to Frankel; during a single deployment from 2010 to 2011, Air Force Staff Sgt. Justin Kitts and his dog Dyngo received the Bronze Star for, among other things, “providing safety to more than 30,000 U.S., host nations, and coalition forces.” But it wasn’t until the last five years that military working dogs received the most important reward of all: the ability to return to the arms of their handlers. After two deployments to Iraq and a 2006 IED injury, Marine Cpl. Megan Leavey waged a high-profile campaign to adopt her military working dog Rex, reuniting with him 10 months before his death only through the help of Sen. Chuck Schumer. In 2015, the Military Working Dog Retirement Act established a preference for military working dog adoptions by their former handlers “unless the Secretary [of a military department] determines that adoption of the dog by the former handler would not be in the best interests of the dog.” The U.S. military’s modern process of retiring working dogs is far from perfect: a 2018 report from the Pentagon’s Office of the Inspector General found that the Army’s current program for dispositioning military canines still lacks sufficient management, accountability, and oversight. But Leavey’s story, released as a controversial major motion picture in 2017, helped to afford military working dogs an ultimate honor: returning home to the open arms of their beloved humans. “A dog doesn’t value a medal on the mantle,” as Staff Sgt. Seth Kenny, a trainer with the 55th Security Forces Squadron, said in a recent statement. “A dog values being pain-free when they try to walk up the stairs after spending 90% of their life truly giving their all without a second thought.” Conan won’t receive any medals or citations, but she’ll almost certainly receive something else: a loving home to return to in recognition for her service to the country."

And that seems unfair, especially when you look at the choices of wording different people have used. It’s all talk of what this means for America’s role in the Middle East, or the future of the Kurds, or how Assad and Erdoğan will benefit from this move. Take these headlines at face value and, sure, it seems people are asking a lot of different things, but you can boil it all down to complete confusion about what’s going to follow from Trump’s latest decision. We know it’s going to be dramatic, whatever it is. The next big happening will be the result of not just the American retreat, but the alliance between Assad’s government and Kurdish forces, the assassination of ISIS leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, the invasion of northern Syria by the Turkish military, not to mention to development of nuclear weapons in Iran, political turmoil in Lebanon, Iraq, and Israel, an ongoing civil war in Yemen, and more American troops being sent into Saudi Arabia. The whole Middle East is in the latest phase of its never-ending turmoil, and it all looks set to blow. There are several paths we might take. When American troops were still on the ground, there was a kind of stalemate. Turkey was held back, ISIS was going nowhere, and Assad was unlikely to attempt an invasion into Kurdish territory. Now that those troops are leaving, it’s worth considering the ways the Middle East could change going forward. Things might work out just fine. Not the likeliest outcome, but we shouldn’t write it off. There might not be any new wars, and the conflicts already brewing could simmer down. Before the Turkish invasion, Syria was settling into a new norm, with the Assad government re-establishing control over a huge part of the country, including Damascus, Homs, and Hama — three key centres of financial, political, and cultural activity. Of course, ‘just fine’ means something different, depending on which group you ask. Any Kurds supporting the cause of an independent state for their people have little to no chance of achieving their goal. As for the Kurds favouring the more moderate cause of an autonomous zone in Syria, similar to that in northern Iraq, their deal with Assad puts them in a better position, but they’re still fighting as tough a battle as ever. Assad’s dream of controlling all Syria once again can really only satisfy himself, his family, and a relatively small core of genuine supporters, but it would be preferable to minority groups as the Druze, that feel threatened by a Saddam Hussain-esque rule by a different group that persecutes their own (the Sunni Hussain’s brutal rule was fierce against, for example, the Shi’a in his country). Assad, coming from the Alawite minority group, is favoured by many minorities, for fear of the alternative. One such alternative is living under Kurdish rule, which has been troubled. In the area some Kurds wish of carving out as part of their independent state, there lives a part of the population of Assyrians, a Christian ethnoreligious group that has been living in the lands of modern Syria since before the Kurds and Arabs. The Kurds have made a show of working with Assyrian groups, such as the leftist ‘Dawronoye’ organisation, but in reality those Assyrian groups have often proved to be fraudulent, and have not represented the popular will of the Assyrians. Kurdish forces have, for instance, cracked down of schools refusing to teach curriculums designed by the authorities of Rojava, the name given to the autonomous and self-proclaimed libertarian socialist Kurdish proto-state in north-eastern Syria that has been self-governing since 2012. In another instance, a Kurdish militia associated with Rojava abandoned a town of Assyrians whilst ISIS forces were approaching. Victory for Assad, and victory for the Kurds (which remain mutually exclusive), will both have troubling consequences for somebody. Even worse would be victory for Turkey. Turks and Arabs don’t tend to like each other. More than the legacy of Ottoman ineffective-and-periodically-brutal-rule-from-Istanbul, there’s the modern problem of geopolitics. Turkey is in NATO, Arab states are most certainly not. Turkey is friendly with the US, while Arab states are either friendly, or very much not. Turkey would like to invade Arab states, and Arab states would prefer it stays right the hell away. Which is why you should care when I say Turks hate the Kurds about a thousand times more. If the fighting turns in favour of Turkey, and the militias they are backing within Syria, it’ll be rough on everybody. The consequences for Assad and the Kurds are obvious — the first faces a tactical defeat, the second faces a potential genocide — but for Turkey there will also be troubles. America probably won’t act, but the EU is likely to place sanctions on the already struggling Turkish economy. Along with that, Kurdish militias within Turkey, such as the communist PKK, will surely increase violent activity, the brunt of which will be faced by Turkish civilians, particularly rural voters that form a huge chunk of President Erdoğan’s base. The last possibility is a return to the chaos of five or six years ago, before Russia became so heavily involved and shored up the Assad government. It’s hard so say whether that would be any worse than Turkish success. The question is whether, when every outcome that sees any one part being successful creates such incredible misery for all the others, is anarchy the way to produce the most happiness. Nobody wins, thus everybody wins, in a little way. Assad, Turkey, and the Kurds, could all have their own little piece of the country. If you delve too far into that mindset you end up like the colonisers of old, carving up the Middle East into thoughtless parcels of land. Perhaps, then, it’s not the best solution. None of us know what’s going to happen next. That’s why everybody’s asking the same question, over and over. Syria will resolve itself, eventually, but trying to guess how it does it will only make you look an idiot (just consult the long list of people who have predicted the fall of Assad). The best any of us can do, is to watch, and hope, and fight, and wait."

Medium.com,Society,An Internet Clampdown Is Coming to Russia,World,https://onezero.medium.com/an-internet-clampdown-is-coming-to-russia-d77ff8d72f5d?source=topic_page---------181------------------1," ast May, Russian President Vladimir Putin signed what was called the “Stable RuNet law.” The bill sought to reroute Russian web traffic and data through state-controlled points with an aim toward constructing a national domain name system (DNS) that would allow the Russian internet to function even if the country is cut off from foreign cyberinfrastructure. The law required the country’s internet service providers (ISPs) to exclusively go through exchange points located inside the Russian Federation and be approved by Roskomnadzor, the state-controlled telecommunications regulator. Two of Russia’s leading tech brands — Yandex, the country’s answer to Google, and Mail.Ru, which owns two of the most widely used Russian social media sites — supported the law following the Russian authorities’ promise to purchase new equipment required by the legislation. Even though there has been significant debate on whether this promise and the pursued scenario in general could work in practice, Alexander Zharov, the director of Roskomnadzor, recently confirmed that the equipment installation on the networks of major telecom operators is now underway. According to Zharov, the communications watchdog has begun the “combat testing” process, and the revamped segment of the Russian internet, or RuNet, is scheduled to officially launch at the beginning of November. By further tightening state control and censorship of the RuNet, Russian authorities are visibly channeling inspiration from their colleagues in China, where the government maintains a tight grip on the internet. But can the Kremlin fully embrace the Chinese model? The answer is yes — but only to a point and only in the immediate future. First, the methods used by both countries vary, and China, at least up until now, has been much more effective than Russia in controlling its digital space. Second, economically and financially, particularly in terms of technological innovations, Russia is currently lagging behind China. Ever since the collapse of the USSR, the main mission of the Russian media has been to influence rather than merely inform the general public. The Russian internet is now no longer an exception. For both Moscow and Beijing, the question is not whether they wish to control the flow of information online, but rather how they choose to exercise this control on a practical basis. China’s model of cybersovereignty is sought through real-time censorship by a so-called army of censors (aka “50 Cent Army”) both in the governing body and the state-operated technological firms that are engaged in day-to-day monitoring of the internet. This includes rounds of surveilling online content and even the outright banning of websites and online platforms (such as Western social networks like Facebook) from being accessible within the borders of the country. Russia’s model, at least up until the adoption of the Stable RuNet law, had been less concerned with outright censorship of material. Instead, Russia has devoted considerable state efforts and funds to influencing “netizen” behavior online. While the entire isolation of the Russian internet over the coming years remains improbable, severe clampdown on the free flow of information is still likely to impact the Russian citizenry, albeit in a different way reflective of the remnants of the Soviet sociopolitical past rooted in state censorship and restrictions on freedom of societal expression. Ever since the collapse of the USSR, the main mission of the Russian media has been to influence rather than merely inform the general public. The Russian internet is now no longer an exception in this landscape. By closely monitoring internet user habits, the Russian federal services have been both implicitly and explicitly influencing user behavior, which in turn spreads a heightened level of self-awareness among citizens in terms of what they post and where they post it. Such self-censorship is also constantly being encouraged by selective and widely covered arrests and fines of individuals — both political figures and also ordinary civilians — who publicly voice their criticism of the ruling regime, and particularly of Putin. To this end, the Russian internet, unlike China’s online space, is likely to remain mostly state-controlled rather than explicitly censored. But this reality could well begin to shift as the Kremlin devotes more effort and resources to research and development for advancing machine learning, all while continually increasing state funding for domestic companies developing A.I. One of the specific ways I predict the Russian state authorities will try to emulate their Chinese colleagues is through an increased clampdown on the virtual private networks (VPNs) that are used by citizens to circumvent government-managed filtering and online censorship. Although disconnecting from the global internet space will eliminate the possibility of accessing “undesirable” or outright banned websites through VPNs, even substantially limiting their use, which is a policy that Roskomnadzor began to implement earlier this year, will accelerate the clampdown on internet freedom and broader freedom of political expression in Russia. But there is clearly more to the Stable RuNet law than mere suppression of net freedom, and both the current processes and their implications reach beyond the physical and virtual borders of the Russian Federation. This June, the Chinese tech giant Huawei signed an agreement with Russian telecommunications company MTS to develop a 5G network in Russia. The bilateral agreement, listed on the Kremlin’s website as a “memorandum of understanding,” was signed on the sidelines of a meeting in Moscow between President Putin and Chinese President Xi Jinping. Following a pilot project during last year’s Russia-hosted World Cup, Huawei launched its first 5G test zone in Moscow and went live on Russian territory this September. Even though Russia had also been collaborating with Sweden (specifically Ericsson and Tele2) on its original 5G zone, Huawei continues to be the most prominent investor in mobile technology development in Russia, running the largest mobile research and development lab in Moscow. For now, it is not entirely clear whether Russia’s aim is to also create its very own national 5G network using Chinese (or even Swedish) equipment. At least for the time being, the Russian military is declining to free up the radio frequencies that are necessary for local 5G development. Putin, for his part, remains in agreement with his Security Council on reserving the 3.4 to 3.8 GHz frequency range for military, intelligence, and security use by the Russian state. Yet while the United States continues to boycott the use of Huawei equipment, the Chinese company’s cooperation with the leading Russian mobile operator serves as yet another sign that the cooperation between the two sides, as noted by Putin back in June, is “at an unprecedentedly high level.” Despite Putin’s slight dip in popularity in recent years, his ultimate goal remains centered on managing the aspirations of the Kremlin elites and strengthening the legitimacy of his leadership. Focusing media attention on the “protection” of the Russian internet segment from “Western hegemons” as a justification for strengthening government control of Russian cyberspace allows the ruling state to promote its influence in this domain domestically. Partnering with China on cyber also enables the Kremlin to exert its power abroad as a geopolitical force on par with global players like the United States. This is why the possibility of Russia cutting itself off entirely from the rest of the digital world, as predicted by a number of Russian analysts earlier this year, might be the least likely development for the RuNet. The creation of a localized Russian “intranet” would not only be too expensive, but would entirely disrupt vital online services. Following the example of North Korea would risk collateral damage on Russia’s already relatively weak economy. These online services are a vital component of Russia’s present business ties with the West, particularly with Western Europe, and an important part of its overall connection to the global economy. Aside from the obvious concerns arising from the growing Balkanization of the global internet, restrictions on access to content and transmission of information are also challenging for foreign businesses, particularly cross-border internet companies that will very likely be affected by the introduction of a centralized RuNet regulator. At the very least, a reluctance to abide by the Kremlin-approved and Roskomnadzor-operated legislation that will regulate the Russian segment of the internet according to Russian rules of the game will very likely alienate international companies, particularly Western ones. We already saw a glimpse of this in early October when Yandex shares fell by over 18% and wiped $1.5 billion off the value of the Russian tech giant, which is officially registered in Holland, after the introduction of a Kremlin-backed draft law limiting foreign stakes in “significant” Russian IT firms. In the short term, this will probably play straight into Putin’s hands and allow Russian companies to grow and become competitive on a global scale. In the longer run, whether Russia can afford to lose these partnerships in the name of pursuing internet sovereignty and cyberindependence from the West is questionable. And an isolated Russian cyberspace even partially disconnected from a large segment of the digital world is also not an ideal scenario for American and Western European companies looking to do business with what is, after all, the largest country in the world."

One of the first dishes she ever made me was sinigang, an indigenous soup unique for its sour and savory flavor profile — as if a tamarind tree dipped its branches in the ocean and shook its fruit across your tongue. It’s the first dish my mother ever learned to cook herself, the first she ever cooked for me, and, not coincidentally, the one we both love most. While my understanding of Tagalog was limited, my memories of Filipino flavors — and the ways I encountered and reencountered them out in the world — felt inexhaustible, even though there was no Filipino restaurant in the northern Virginia suburbs where I grew up. In high school, I sought out salt and vinegar chips in the snack aisle — their taste recalling that salt-sour one-two punch I experienced while eating green mango and rock salt as a midafternoon merienda after school. (Though, of course, it lacked the bright, tart smack of that underripe fruit.) When I went to college down in North Carolina, I learned that what I had known as chicharrón could also be called pork rinds. But while delightful, these were just approximations. After many years of never encountering actual Filipino food outside of potlucks and family gatherings, I finally see these foods — the ones I’ve loved and the ones that have evaded me — parading out of professional kitchens across the country. No longer did I need to chase Filipino flavors by proxy. At Rice Bar in Los Angeles, juicy links of longganisa over garlic rice and a fried egg kept me grounded during grad school and served as a much-appreciated thank-you to the Filipinx classmate who helped me with coding. In New York, I treat friends who’ve never tried the cuisine to Maharlika, where sizzling plates of sisig never fail to impress. But what is emerging from these heralded kitchens is not the Filipino food of my mother’s table, nor that of her nanay’s. Melding American sensibilities and ingredients with Filipino memories and stories, a new crop of Filipino and Filipino American chefs are using their menus to explore their identities, building upon a complex and dynamic cuisine that has long merged disparate ingredients, influences, and sensibilities with striking results. It’s remarkable for a cuisine that is still relatively new to American palates — particularly compared to its Southeast Asian neighbors, Thailand and Vietnam, whose dishes and condiments have been fixtures in U.S. strip malls, pantries, and grocery stores for years."
Medium.com,Society,From camps to prisons: Xinjiang’s next great human rights catastrophe,World,https://medium.com/adinkra/from-camps-to-prisons-xinjiangs-next-great-human-rights-catastrophe-1eaf9a655c49?source=topic_page---------183------------------1," By Gene Bunin Just a little over a decade ago, the facility on 1327 Dongzhan Road, a few kilometers north of the forlorn freight station in the northern outskirts of Xinjiang’s Urumqi, was mostly trees and grass. On September 16, 2009, it officially became the new location of the Xinjiang Women’s Prison, a move that came on the heels of the infamous July 5 riots, and it wouldn’t be long before the facility received what would become its first high-profile inmate — the writer, website moderator, and government employee Gulmire Imin, sentenced to life in a closed trial. Despite continued international attention, Imin saw no concessions in the years that followed, but has instead been joined by other women whose modest biographies are in stark contrast with the gravity of their sentences. One of them, Buzeynep Abdureshit, a 27-year-old whose only possible “crimes” were having studied in Egypt and having a husband abroad, was sentenced to seven years in 2017 for “assembling a crowd to disturb social order”. Then, in the June of this year, the prison became home to Nurzada Zhumaqan and Erlan Qabden — both ethnic Kazakh women in their fifties, both with health issues, and both having committed no identifiable crime. Their prison terms? 20 and 19 years, respectively. Their barbarian nature aside, these more recent sentences are particularly worrying as they indicate the likely direction in which the repressions in Xinjiang are now heading. While most of the world’s attention has been focused on the region’s “re-education” camps, the government’s own statistics, some limited reporting, and new evidence presented by victims’ relatives and former detainees in neighboring Kazakhstan all suggest that an incredible number of those detained in 2017 and 2018 are now being given lengthy sentences and transferred to major prisons, such as the one in Urumqi. For Aibota Zhanibek, the older of Nurzada Zhumaqan’s daughters and now Kazakhstan citizen, the news was especially heartbreaking as it came around the New Year — a time when many in Kazakhstan were learning that their relatives had been let out of camps in the wave of mass releases in late December 2018. While many shared the good news, Zhanibek would learn that her mother had been sentenced to prison on charges later revealed as “using superstition to undermine law enforcement” and “assembling a crowd to disturb social order”. Erlan Qabden, a nurse from another county of the same prefecture as Zhumaqan, was sentenced for “using extremism to undermine law enforcement” and “picking quarrels and provoking trouble”, charges that — according to her relatives in Kazakhstan — stem from her attending a flagraising ceremony with a headscarf on. At the office of the Atajurt Kazakh Human Rights organization in Almaty, where Zhanibek appears weekly to appeal for her mother on camera, the majority of those who come to testify and appeal no longer talk of camps — as was the case a year ago — but of prisons. Though fragmentary and corrupted by hearsay, the information obtained from talking to just a dozen or so of the appealing parties is sufficient to start noticing the trends: the long sentences, the months or even years of pre-trial detention, and the particular targeting of religious men. A statistical profiling of the victims — sourced from thousands of public video testimonies gathered by Atajurt and parsed by the Xinjiang Victims Database — makes it possible to corroborate some of the qualitative observations in a more quantitative manner. A comparison of victims reported to have received prison sentences with those reported released from camp shows that over 90% of the sentenced are men (cf., 69% of the released), with almost 75% believed to be detained for religious reasons (cf., 27%). An analysis of 311 victims with reported prison terms shows an average sentence of 11.2 years, with 89% of the sentenced given a term of 5 years or longer, while a study of 65 victims detained for 2 months or longer shows that, for these victims, the average pre-sentence detention was approximately 9 months, with over 30% held for a year or longer. Many of the sentenced are believed to be transferred to prisons following a stay in a pre-trial detention center ( kanshousuo) — a notoriously abused institution where former detainees have reported extreme mistreatment and horrible living conditions. However, a number of eyewitness accounts give strong reason to believe that those interned extralegally in the region’s “re-education” camps are also being sentenced, while still in the camps. Four Kazakh ex-detainees, having spent the majority of 2018 in camps, all talked of either witnessing or hearing about “open court sessions” inside the “schools”. Two of them, Ergali Ermek and a detainee who — choosing anonymity — will be called “Ruslan”, both said that it was those who were sentenced to 10 years or more that were later bussed off to real prisons. One known case is that of Zhiger Toqai, a student at the Satbayev University in Almaty, whose detention was initially reported by relatives in Kazakhstan and whose sentence was confirmed by Ruslan, his former cellmate at the camp. In a recently published interview, Rahima Senbai recalls an open court where seven women were sentenced for observing iftar. For the ill and elderly, the long prison terms appear tantamount to death sentences, shattering not only the morale of relatives abroad but also all pretenses of a legitimate penal system in Xinjiang. However, inherent in such illegitimacy is also hope, as without a solid foundation and convincing arguments the absurd sentences may be more easily repealed and the inmates released — a phenomenon already noted with the extralegal camps. The stories of Ergali Ermek and Ruslan — both of whom were sentenced but later released anyway — seem to hint at this already, as does the case of Gulbahar Haitiwaji, who was allegedly sentenced to 7 years in December 2018 but allowed to return to France just recently. With sufficient international pressure and condemnation, it is not impossible that even the Xinjiang Women’s Prison see its gates pried open, allowing those like Buzeynep Abdureshit, Nurzada Zhumaqan, and Erlan Qabden to once more enjoy a certain degree of freedom. And perhaps even those like Gulmire Imin."

Medium.com,Society,"Fiscal Credit, Social Trust",World,https://medium.com/swlh/fiscal-credit-social-trust-a3b929d827e3?source=topic_page---------185------------------1," China’s “Social Credit System” has been a topic of conversation in the West since 2015, when an ACLU article warned agains its potential dangers. However, the concept of a credit system clearly predates that — in the West and worldwide. What is the difference between different credit rewards systems and this one? As China approaches their desired implementation date of 2020, there’s good reason to believe that it will be coming up more and more in conversation. China’s Social Credit System (SCS, 社会信用体系 or shehui xinyong tixi) can also be translated as “community faith system”. This translation is noteworthy because credence being placed on the credit aspect rather than the trust or faith interpretation. That the middle phrase is popularly translated as “credit” (信用 or xinyong), but can be also understood as “using truth” (xin means truth and yong “to use”). This perspective adds complexity to to a concept that currently has a solely financial interpretation. This translation bifurcation is just the beginning of difficulties that can be encountered translating China’s policies into English. The original plan for social credit was released in 2014. It wasn’t entirely clear what the project might ultimately consist of for the whole country, so each region took on their own planning and implementation. “They expected the different parts of the government, both centrally and locally, to try out their own approach in terms of implementation,” says Xin Dai, a professor and associate dean at China’s Ocean University Law School, who has researched social credit. As a result of this local emphasis, each implementation looks very different. In terms of data collection, some regions rely more heavily on pre-existing records, while others employ watch-guards to maintain surveillance on individual’s actions and reactions. Repercussions range from an imposed audio clip of one’s poor social status on their ringback tone, to banning access to plane trips and fast-paced trains. Rewards for good social conduct range from honorary recognition to no-interest loans. SCS is due to go nationwide by 2020, and the country is already banning millions of “blacklisted” individuals from purchasing plane or train tickets. The country has been working closely with organizations that already have information on their citizen’s history, from pulling criminal records to “Sesame Credit”, whose data comes from Alibaba. The paper “Clear Sanctions, Vague Rewards”, written by a group of researchers at the Technical University of Munich in 2019, outlines 3 possible motivations for implementing the SCS. With a rapidly accelerating economy (peaking at a 14.5% growth rate in 2014 according to the World Bank), some of China’s growing pains have been in the domain of reported trust issues. Predominantly this revolves around corporate and institutional trust in the last 2 decades — food poisonings, chemical spills, academic dishonesty etc¹. According to a survey conducted by Ipsos Public Affairs², “moral decline” was regarded as the most serious issue in China in 2017. 47% of Chinese respondents ranked it as one of the top 3 greatest concerns, while the same issue was only mentioned by 15% of total respondents worldwide. A big hope of the Chinese government is that SCS will give millions of Chinese citizens without a financial history access to credit and investment opportunities in the domestic market. This is huge! With such a massive population, China has the world’s largest number of unbanked citizens³. All individuals would use their personal trustworthiness score to obtain access to loan applications without any previous participation in the system, thus boosting the Chinese economy with domestic spending. As the aforementioned paper describes, “the concept of personal identity is largely determined by Confucian principles, [wherein] personhood is supposed to extend from the private to the public sphere, thereby somewhat losing its private and public boundaries.” A basic, cultural underpinning of Chinese culture is communal (hence, Communism), which means that privacy can be seen as sneaky. Contrast this with a western focus on the individual, personal liberties and personal property, and the result is drastically different starting points. This understanding may help Westerners begin to understand why one study found that amongst Chinese citizens, 50% fully support and another 1/3 somewhat support an implementation of SCS. The SCS is not seen as a primacy-violating system in Chinese society, but rather something that can keep the community safer. At present, the government is already connecting to private systems to produce their rankings. “You’ll have sort of memorandum of understanding-like arrangements between the city and, say, Alibaba and Tencent about data exchanges and including that in assessments of citizens,” writes Mareike Ohlberg, research associate at the Mercator Institute for China Studies. The government is also connecting their rankings right back to private systems to ensure compliance. Remember those bans on plane and train purchases? That is a result of an interlinked information flow between transportation systems and governmental actors. Additionally, as it has been for many years, the internet in China is highly censored. This means that each person’s cell phone number and online activity is assigned a unique ID number tied to their real name, making tracking much more swift and precise. And though it’s not mandatory, the China Credit website already encourages users to log in by scanning their faces. So what is the difference in SCS to various types of social rankings that take place in the US? After all, you can rank your Uber driver, they can rank you, and private data is being upturned at seemingly every corner. In the U.S., corporations have even been shown to use what’s called “e-credit” scores to market different products to their customers: “You go to Capital One’s website, they infer based on your browsing information what kind of value as a customer you represent, and they’ll show you a different ad based on what I call your e-credit score. Not your actual credit score, because they don’t have access to that based on your profile information. But they kinda make up an ad-hoc credit score at the moment you arrive, and show you high-interest or low-interest advertisements.” This might seem like an innocuous form of marketing, but these scores get traded or sold between entities and become a proxy for a person’s status and identity. This proxy is unknown to the user, whose information is being collected — without option for dispute. Despite this, it is then being used to justify actions that impact the individual, such as differing interest rate offers on loans. In the world at large, there is a lot of data being collected with little protection, and no algorithmic transparency about how variables are being used, and then implemented at a large scale, threatening large populations. These are what Cathy O’Neil calls “Weapons of Math Destruction” (or WMDs), and we are seeing an increasing rate of them in the modern age. Which, yes, is deeply troubling when considering what privacy has meant for decades, and what it may mean in the near future. But what makes SCS so different for China from these instances happening in the rest of the world? Mostly it is the systems in which they are occurring. The People’s Republic of China is an authoritarian country, the Chinese Communist Party has been responsible for human rights violations for decades. Obviously the current uprisings in Hong Kong point to some troubling undercurrents with regards to human rights, and reporting on Xinjiang in particular raises many questions about state-sanctioned ethnic cleansing. There seems to be partial reporting on many of these issues, perhaps in part due to cultural/language differences, but due in large part to governmental censorship. This censorship is at the crux of the difference — in the West, however threatened or challenged, we maintain freedom of speech and a rich pool of perspectives to illuminate what is happening around us. Jay Stanley of the ACLU wrote a controversial piece on the burgeoning of SCS in 2015 that got a lot of pushback for reporting accuracy. However, the piece is still up and contributing to a deeper complexity around this topic for anyone with internet access. Freedom of speech and freedom of press are rights that, if exercised along with thorough research, have the potential to raise up consensus perspective and shape reality. If not exercised well, we all fall prey to losing the identity of national ideals (in this case, privacy and institutional transparency), and eventually allowing governmental structures the same liberties as proprietary entities — and vice versa. For now, the world awaits the implementation of China’s Social Credit System in 2020, including the ripples it may add technological reform, governmental sanctions and privacy conversations worldwide.

hile politicians argue over Brexit, regular people living in Britain wonder what foods they’ll have access to after the dust settles. Depending upon how long it takes to implement a plan for feeding Britain post-Brexit, the ingredients that become available will reflect a new food system, perhaps one in which Britons will consume more ingredients grown entirely in Britain. According to the U.K.’s Department for Environment, Food, and Regulatory Affairs, 52 percent of the food that is consumed in the U.K. is produced in the U.K. About 30 percent comes from the EU, and the rest arrives in the U.K. from everywhere else. The U.K. exports high-value meats and alcoholic beverages, while it imports mostly fruit and vegetables. Many policymakers are worried about the U.K.’s ability to feed itself in the immediate aftermath of Brexit; consumers, as well as the food industry, have begun to stockpile favorite wine and cheeses as uncertainty about the outcome of trade talks continues. A good bottle of Laphroaig will only last through the weekend; what remains for weekday meals could be sparse until the food system leverages technologies such as indoor farming. Professor Tim Lang of Sussex, an expert on the U.K.’s food policy at City University London’s Centre for Food Policy, is anxious about the prospects of feeding the U.K. in a Brexit world. In a report commissioned by The Food Research Collaboration, Lang warns of threats to U.K. food security if food safety standards are not upheld. He is also concerned about the effect of Brexit on food service workers. These workers deliver the greatest gross value to the U.K. economy, and a new post-Brexit immigrant policy could threaten the labor supply for the food-service industry. In all, Lang and his fellow collaborators in the study argue for a fresh look at U.K.’s overall food strategy for the future. Consumers in the U.K. worry that the accessible food from the EU that arrives in limited amounts will become more scarce and more expensive, especially oranges from Seville, wine from Provence, and ham from Parma. But is there another way to view Brexit in terms of its impact on the U.K. food system. While the road will be bumpy in a transition to a post-Brexit world, Britons may eventually find a new route that will deliver a diverse and resilient food system for the U.K. Why this optimism? Because individuals around the world who work within the food supply chain are resourceful and live to optimize. And they are discovering entirely new ways to produce and distribute the food we eat. This all comes during a flurry of disruptions in transportation, health care, travel, and politics. Could it be that the real cause for concern is the many unknowns and uncertainties that have persisted because of the length of time the U.K. has taken to decide about how to exit the EU? Trump supporters, Brexit supporters, and Yellow Jackets over in France continue to support some version of nationalism that includes a desire to produce their own food and support their own economies. All three groups want more local control over what they eat, lower taxes and prices, and a little respect for their prosaic needs. U.K. Brexit supporters worry about plain and simple fare. Half the British population, the half that works in supply-chain jobs, is fed up with the price of sausage and the shaming they feel from Brussels for eating greasy pork pies. Anti-Brexiters worry about the availability of Parmigiano-Reggiano. Although the U.K. produces most of the cheese (and that’s mostly cheddar) consumed at home, its citizens also enjoy French and Italian cheeses. While the U.K. continues to dither its way toward a resolution regarding Brexit, Britons may have something to learn from how Russia is coping with a long-term food embargo. This isn’t the first time a country has had to rethink how to feed its people. Trade sanctions and embargoes are at least as old as Napoleon’s Continental System. Back then, smugglers found ways to circumvent the embargo, and they most likely will do it again this time. More recently, other countries have had to adapt to food trade sanctions. Russia, Cuba, Venezuela, and Brazil contend with embargoes, blockades, and voters who need food. In each case, politics shape trade policies, but in Cuba and Venezuela, transport and banking infrastructures lead to even more complications. In 2014, Russia placed an embargo on food from the EU, the U.S., and other countries as a response to sanctions by the West for Russia’s annexation of Crimea and conflict in Ukraine. Now, four years later, Russia has somewhat recovered from the loss of Italian sardines and now produces more of its own food, shifting its supply chain away from Western food suppliers. There is even a small cadre of cheese entrepreneurs who have seized the opportunity to fill in the holes for luxury French cheeses. Of course, most cheese aficionados would admit the Russian cheesemakers have not yet mastered the technique or matched the terroir that comes with hundreds of years of cheese-making in Europe. Before the embargo, Russia depended upon imports for fruit and vegetables, meat, seafood, and dairy, as does the U.K. Food prices, entangled in a Russian currency crisis, rose 36 percent for fruits and vegetables. That, combined with the lower quality of food, resulted in Russians eating less meat and fruit, both included in the embargo, causing a decrease in supply and thus a rise in prices. Most Russians changed their diets, cutting back on costly items. According to Rosstat, between 2013 and 2015, Russians’ consumption of fruit declined by almost 5 percent. Some domestically produced food came from counterfeiters and carried labels that falsely represented food ingredients. This happens everywhere, but without human inspectors from the EU, the black and gray food markets thrive. And as a result, Russians are eating more food produced in their own country. Russian President Vladimir Putin announced Russia’s new Food Security Doctrine, a plan to enable Russia to feed itself without reliance on outside producers. While this idea may resonate with some, the idea of being able to supply all one’s food internally is unlikely if people fancy bananas on their porridge. Britons want to hang on to those oranges from Seville. After further negotiations and an eventual resolution, food prices will increase as the food supply chain shifts gears from the old way to the new way of feeding Britain (whatever that looks like, exactly). But eventually, a new system will emerge, and more food will flow to and from Britain legally, transparently, safely, and, eventually, at a lower cost. In all likelihood, Britain will find ways to produce more of its own food, but it will still rely on Europe for many of its (fancier) delicacies. Food supply chain optimizers, many of them Leavers, are accustomed to finding ways to adapt. Tech is now entering all phases of the food system, making food healthier and able to be grown just about anywhere. The expected border delays and warehouse shortages will likely occur as the changeover happens, but those who run the world of food logistics are the ordinary people who have lost patience with the bureaucracy in Brussels. The post-Brexit food system will still include food from the EU in addition to an increase in food production in Britain. Customs inspections and paperwork will surely find a digital solution that will expedite the movement of food from a favorite cheesemonger in Alsace and an orange grove in Spain. Blockchain, the Holy Redeemer of digital ledgers, will find a role to play in this supply chain predicted to be a new flow of food into the U.K. The number of lorries that move back and forth between the U.K. and the EU today will fall, and those that still travel on British roads will either be autonomous or join platoons that will expedite loads. Why not expand the Chunnel freight service to carry more food? Maybe Amazon’s new blimp proposal will include a blimp-supported distribution center over the channel that sent off airborne carriers in both directions. While trucking will be with us for a long time, they aren’t indispensable. Just ask a horse. Vertical and enclosed growing systems, wired and informed by artificial intelligence, in addition to artificial light, will churn up to eight turns of crops, instead of the traditional two or four from farmers who grow food in the ground. Some foods will be made in a lab, some printed, and even other types of food will be grown in our own homes. Both Remainers and Leavers may be surprised at their own imagination and creativity when it comes to finding new ways to produce and transport food. The post-Brexit food system will get a remake in terms of the origin of its ingredients. Still, be prepared for higher prices in the short term and a race to find ways to produce soil-based imports, such as grain, on an island with limited arable soil. A few less Sunday roast beef dinners would also help. This whole kerfuffle about Brexit will not eliminate truffles, but it will put pressure on the need to design a new and more resilient food system, maybe even British-grown Seville oranges."
Medium.com,Society,"In Syria, history is repeating itself",World,https://medium.com/@Rashmee/in-syria-history-is-repeating-itself-e59c8c4c743e?source=topic_page---------188------------------1," In Syria, other people’s history from lands near and far is repeating itself — not as farce but as a parody. Developments in Syria in 2019 are an ironic imitation of Iraq in 2003 and Ukraine in 2014. Consider US President Donald Trump’s comments that a small number of US troops would remain in Syria to secure “the Oil.” The 1,000-person US contingent in north-eastern Syria had been suddenly pulled back by Trump, effectively green-lighting the October 9 Turkish invasion of Kurdish-controlled territory. Trump, who had paid no heed to the threatened massacre of the Kurdish fighters, was brazen enough to nominate Syrian oil as worthy of the United States’ tender care. Accordingly, US Defence Secretary Mark Esper assured that US troops would be stationed around unspecified oil areas in Syria “to deny access, specifically revenue to [the Islamic State] ISIS and any other groups that may want to seek that revenue to enable their own malign activities.” Then the US president suggested “some of our big oil companies” could move in “and do it properly,” by which he probably meant extracting the black gold and selling it for a handsome profit. Minus the audacious public acknowledgement that Middle Eastern oil matters more to US politicians than human lives, it might have been Iraq 2003 all over again. When US forces rolled into central Baghdad in April 2003, they quickly took charge of Iraq’s massive Oil Ministry. Unlike other public buildings, including the National Museum, that were left unguarded and ransacked, the Oil Ministry was guarded by approximately 50 tanks and strategically positioned sharpshooters. It was clearly meant to secure the oil. The only difference is that US President George W. Bush wasn’t indiscreet enough to say as much. Then there is Turkey’s invasion of Syrian territory. It is reminiscent of Russia’s seizure of the Ukrainian peninsula of Crimea in 2014 but with one crucial difference. When Russia intervened militarily in Crimea, it provoked international outrage. Crippling sanctions were imposed by the United States and the European Union and Russia’s relations with the West were ruptured. Not so with Turkey. All signs suggest Ankara may just get away with it. On October 23, Trump lifted sanctions against Turkey, commending its promise of a “permanent ceasefire” in north-eastern Syria. Meanwhile, the Europeans have been crying foul but not with one voice and not as furiously as over Russia’s Crimean adventure. German Defence Minister Annegret Kramp-Karrenbauer called out Turkey — “our NATO partner” — for having “annexed territory in violation of international law.” She wants NATO defence ministers to consider a controversial proposal to deploy international troops to establish a security zone in north-eastern Syria but the chances of any of this coming to pass are slim. Under terms of the deal negotiated in Sochi on October 22 by Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan and Russian President Vladimir Putin, Turkey has de facto control of the area it has taken in Syria. The focus of the 6-hour Erdogan-Putin talks, the Kremlin said, was about “normalising the situation” in north-eastern Syria. It’s something Putin strived mightily to do in Crimea through a combination of megaprojects and maximum pressure on the Crimean Tatars, a Turkic Muslim community, among others. What will be deemed normal in the Turkish-annexed part of Syria is likely to be just as arbitrary as in Russified Crimea. However, for all the echoes of the past, events in Syria are playing out in a very different context to what went before. Putin’s Russia, swaggering and newly enshrined as the main non-regional powerbroker, continues in its usual way — unashamedly transactional with short-term friends who serve its long-term interests. Now it is also served by Trump’s America, a risible figure on the world stage, compared to the once sober, if heavy-handed protector of the international order.

Medium.com,Society,Is Canada New Legal Framework Regulating Cannabis Use Too Restrictive? Some Expert Think So.,World,https://medium.com/@strategicoutlook/is-canada-new-legal-framework-regulating-cannabis-use-too-restrictive-some-expert-think-so-bb2062a1e6a0?source=topic_page---------190------------------1," The legalization of cannabis in Canada is seen as one of the most progressive public policies in Canadian history. The move has been celebrated as a means of promoting public health, reducing crime, and “bringing a multi-billion-dollar industry from the black market into the legal one”. Canada became the second country to legalize the recreational use of cannabis behind Uruguay. Since legalization, the federal government has promised to adopt a ‘strict’ public health-focused model of production, and sale that emphasizes minimizing harm. Such as the risks of contamination or unknown potency associated with drugs sold in the illicit markets. The government also wants to ensure criminals groups are not profiting from cannabis legalization and reduce the burden on the criminal justice system. The Cannabis Act, also known as Bill- C46, is the federal legislation regulating the cannabis industry. Some experts such as civil liberties groups, scholars, criminal and constitutional lawyers have express concerns about how restrictive the new legislation is. Abby Deshman of the Canadian Civil Liberties Association (CCLA) says, “we’re legalizing the industry, but criminalizing a lot of the aspects around the use of cannabis,”. In Ontario for example, only cannabis purchased from the official recognize cannabis store is considered legal. Anyone caught in possession of cannabis not purchased from the Ontario Cannabis Store (OCS) is considered legal and could potentially face a fine or a criminal charge. Some legal experts believe too much attention and discussions are around legalization, but the focus should be on the impact the policies are going to have on certain communities. Speaking to some of Toronto’s top criminal lawyers for this article, they point to the fact that the government rushed to put the legislation together. The fact is you have a patchwork of provincial, territorial, and municipal laws and by-laws that interact with the federal criminal laws, which make it difficult for the average Canadian to understand what everything means. Under the Cannabis Act, each province and territory is responsible for setting its own rules for how cannabis can be sold, where stores can be located, and how stores must be operated. Provinces and territories may also set additional restrictions they feel are necessary. For instance, the federal legislation sets the age limit for purchasing cannabis at 18, however in Ontario, the age limit is 19, In Quebec and Alberta, it is 18. As I noted above, one of the key reasons the government chose to legalize cannabis was that the old legal framework was not serving its intended policy objective. At the time of legalization, the government said, “the old approach to cannabis did not work. It let criminals and organized crime profit while failing to keep cannabis out of the hands of Canadian youth. In many cases, it has been easier for our kids to buy cannabis than cigarettes”. However, Michael Smith a constitutional lawyer and sociologist professor, from the University of Toronto, believes the new legal framework might be counterproductive to the government objectives. Legalization has also raised questions about what to do with Canadians with criminal records for minor possession. It is estimated, more than 250,000 Canadian have a criminal record related to minor cannabis infractions. Several experts have expressed their concerns with the lack of action taking by the federal government to expunge individuals’ records. Akwasi Owusu-Bempah, a professor at the University of Toronto says “Canadian celebrating cannabis legalization should be cautioned, “unless both the federal regulations and various provincial legislation provide avenues for inclusion and a means of repairing the harms caused by Canada’s war on drugs. We need to make sure that everyone has the opportunity to participate in this growing economy, while also working to improve the lives of people criminalized for activities that will no longer be illegal”. Canadians convicted for simple possession, face difficulties finding work, traveling, and difficulties during vulnerable sector searches if they want to work with children or vulnerable adults. While former cops who advocated for harsh sentences for minor possession of cannabis are cashing in on legalization, such as former Toronto police chief Julian Fantino. Fantino was fiercely opposed to cannabis legalization and once said “legalizing cannabis is like legalizing murder”. He is now the Chief Executive for Aleafia, a Concord Ontario-based company that produces cannabis. The government has proposed Bill-C-93, which will amend the Criminal Records Act, and allow anyone convicted of less than 30 grams of cannabis to file a formal application to get a pardon. However, this is a long and tedious process explained by Annamaria Enenajor, a Toronto-based lawyer directing the national Cannabis Amnesty campaign. She says “automatically expunging the records for those convicted of low-level cannabis crimes is a far better policy than putting the onus on the person to apply for such relief. Legal experts say the government has taking the right steps forward but there’s still a long way to go. Jack Lloyd, a Toronto-based lawyer specializing in these cases, offered his analysis, “Out of the 250,000 Canadian convicted for minor cannabis infraction, 80,000 are eligible for this pardon program. That is great. Any day the government says we are going to remove the stigma from 80,000 victims of the drug war, that is a great day. But they could be doing a lot more to help communities that have been impacted negatively, especially if they have now admitted that simple possession was a wrong-headed law, to begin with”. So Far only 44 pardons have been granted out of a total of 71 people who have applied. The process is very cumbersome and bureaucratic, says Toronto lawyer Caryma Sa’d. Another area of concern is the type of power the Cannabis Act gives to police officers. As it stands, the Act gives any police officer with reasonable probable grounds who believes there is cannabis illegally in a vehicle to — without a search warrant and at any time — search the entire vehicle and any person found in the vehicle. The overhaul of the Criminal Code also saw the government introduced new impaired driving laws related to cannabis use. Under Canada’s new drug-impaired driving laws, drivers are prohibited from having blood THC levels of two and five nanograms per milliliter. If drivers are found, they are liable for a fine of up to $1,000, while drivers with over five nanograms face a minimum $1,000 fine and up to 10 years in prison for a first offence. However, a new study from the University of British Columbia (UBC) says the new law on cannabis-impaired driving penalties may be too strict. Researchers found no link between low levels of THC, the psychoactive chemical in pot, and car crashes”. Lead investigator for the research Dr. Jeffrey Brubacher says, “THC does not appear to be associated with an increased risk of crashing”. Criminal defense and constitutional lawyers are also concern about the new legislation. A group of prominent criminal defence lawyers have brought the matter to the attention of the federal government, by signing a letter asking the government to remove parts of the proposed regulation in bill C-46 that would make it a criminal offence for people found to have more than two nanograms of THC in a milliliter of their blood within two hours of driving. Lawyers say the proposal would disproportionately affect people who consume the drug for medical purposes and is contrary to s. 7 of the Charter. Caryma Sa’d, one of the letter’s signatory’s say’s there are a lot of flaws in the legislation,” I wouldn’t be surprised to see constitutional challenges.” The legalization of cannabis has brought excitement to many Canadians around the country, however, questions remain"
Medium.com,Society,When Will Civilization End? Sneak a Peek at the Doomsday Clock,World,https://medium.com/pcmag-access/when-will-civilization-end-sneak-a-peek-at-the-doomsday-clock-ddf012ac33e3?source=topic_page---------191------------------1," The Doomsday Clock, conceived in the 1940s after the US dropped the atomic bomb on Japan, serves as a check on how we’re doing as a civilization. If the clock strikes midnight, we’re toast, but the Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists wants to make sure that never happens. By S.C. Stuart On August 6, 1945, the US dropped the first atomic bomb on the Japanese city of Hiroshima, wiping out the city and killing over 80,000 people. Many more died of radiation exposure soon after. Three days later, a second bomb destroyed Nagasaki. World War II ended with the Japanese surrender less than a month later. Scientists from the highly secretive Manhattan Project, who built these nuclear weapons, knew they had to avoid a full-scale arms race, so barely three months after the bombs dropped, they released a six-page black-and-white leaflet called the Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists. The goal was to involve the public in discourse around these life-threatening technologies and the circumstances that might lead to further deployment. Two years later, when the Bulletin became a full-color magazine, graphic artist Martyl Langsdorf was commissioned to design the cover. She wanted to convey “a sense of urgency” and came up with the Doomsday Clock concept. The Bulletin still exists today, and is now a rich digital resource. Since 1945, it’s been “set” by an esteemed council including scientists, economists, political advisers, and military strategists. In 2019, it was set to Two Minutes to Midnight (midnight being the end of civilization); 2020’s time will be determined at the organization’s annual meeting next month and announced in January. Ahead of that gathering, we spoke with Dr. Rachel Bronson, president and CEO of the Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists, a Middle East expert and author. Below are edited and condensed excerpts from our conversation. PCMag: According to the Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists in 2019, the Doomsday Clock was set at ‘two minutes to midnight.’ How did you come to this conclusion?
Dr. Rachel Bronson: Our esteemed Science and Security Board had deep discussions about the threat level, and drew on expertise from many sources, including our Board of Sponsors, which contains 14 Nobel Laureates. Many negative developments had taken place, which made it appear that the world was headed into an unregulated nuclear environment. These included the United States abandoning the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action [which imposed unprecedented constraints on Iran’s nuclear program] and being poised to withdraw from the INF Treaty [which bans missiles of intermediate range]. Relations between the US, Russia, and China have grown more fraught. Russia, India, and Pakistan are all continuing to expand and modernize their nuclear programs, and the North Korean nuclear issue remains unresolved. Essentially, we’re in a new arms race. But there are also new threats, as you laid out in your recent statement on information warfare. Can you expand on that?
Much has changed since the Bulletin was first published in 1945. In 2009, we added climate change into the existential risks we focus on every day and use to set the Doomsday Clock. Today we are particularly concerned about the incorporation of AI into autonomous weaponry that makes “kill” decisions without human supervision. We’re also keeping abreast of world security threats, including biological hazards, such as bio-terrorism attacks, the emergence of rapidly spreading and fatal diseases, and synthetic biology programs. The 2019 setting was the closest to midnight since the Soviets and Americans tested their hydrogen bombs in the 1950s. On a more positive note, when was the Doomsday Clock set at its furthest from midnight, and why?
In 1991, we set the clock back: “17 Minutes to Midnight.” The Cold War was over. The Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty greatly scaled back the number of strategic nuclear weapons deployed by both sides, and a series of unilateral initiatives were underway to remove most of the intercontinental ballistic missiles and bombers in both countries from hair-trigger alert. How have we not blown ourselves up before now?
Because-so far-national leaders have heeded warnings, set up communication channels with adversaries, negotiated treaties to control the weapons, taken steps to radically reduce arsenals, and engaged erstwhile enemies in cooperative projects. We’ve also gotten lucky. Preventing nuclear war requires continued diplomacy, more exchanges of information, and open communications that engender trust. Let’s talk about your own background: you joined the Bulletin in 2015, after executive roles at the Chicago Council on Global Affairs and the Council on Foreign Relations. What made you decide this would be your next challenge?
I’d been familiar with the Bulletin throughout my career, since graduate school, and right through my roles in Washington. I was particularly drawn to this job because it addressed today’s biggest challenges-the geopolitics of energy, the fast-paced advancement of science and technology, climate change, and the place of the US in the world. I wanted to provide leadership to make the Bulletin stronger, more visible, and have an even greater policy impact in advocating for arms control, debating what kind of energy future we need, and how to make nuclear power safer. I was already in Chicago and expected to move back to Washington, but this was too good an opportunity to pass up. Your doctorate from Columbia University is in political science. How did you first become interested in global affairs, and why?
My first wake-up call was as a child hearing Israeli jets break the sound barrier during the invasion of Lebanon. My father, a math professor, had taken a six-month posting to the Technion [Institute of Technology] in Israel, and I got the first-hand experience of living amongst people on all sides of fierce political divides while a military conflict raged around us. I wanted to understand how the situation had occurred. That’s how it all started for me. I went on to study US history and decided to focus on Middle East politics during senior year just prior to Desert Storm, continuing on into graduate and postgraduate study. After your PhD at Columbia, you worked for a DC-based think tank and consulted for the military during a time when US strategists were creating a new way of examining global politics.
Yes, the 90s was an exciting time. A lot of political science theories on war and peace had, until then, been viewed through the European model, with European use cases. It all changed around that time. I went to DC, did advisory work on the military presence in the Middle East, as well as consulting for the US Navy, before joining the Council on Foreign Relations in New York. One of my academic papers during this period addressed the problem with our presence in the Persian Gulf. We had strong military-to-military relations, but we knew we hadn’t built similarly strong civil-military relations. You need institutions to support military engagement in order to have a feasible post-conflict plan. We didn’t have very good ones. Is there a physical Doomsday Clock? Can the public visit it?
Yes and no. It’s largely symbolic. We do create one each year for the announcement of the “reset” time, when someone significant is invited to move the hands. We’ve also created one which is on display at the Public School of Policy here at the University of Chicago. A confession: I first heard about the Doomsday Clock via the recent BBC Cold War drama series Summer of Rockets. I had no idea it was a real thing until I looked you up.
But that’s great! Hollywood and television are central to our mission of connecting experts to the broader public interested in these topics. We’re extremely proud of our connection to popular culture. We often get called on to advise on scripts and we’re happy the message is getting out there. Finally, while many people feel utterly powerless in the face of world events, the Bulletin exists to say there are ways to get involved, right?
Yes! #RewindTheDoomsdayClock is our campaign to encourage citizens in every country to use the power of the internet to fight against social media disinformation and move the Doomsday Clock away from catastrophe by insisting on facts. They can demand action to reduce the existential threat of nuclear war and unchecked climate change by telling their government representatives that they don’t want their taxes spent on nuclear weapons, and asking what they are doing to mitigate climate change. Write, email, and organize. Let governments know that our security depends on getting rid of nuclear weapons and on finding ways to keep our planet habitable for humanity. The Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists holds its annual event on Nov. 7 with keynote speaker Eric Horvitz, director of Microsoft Research Labs."
Medium.com,Society,Betrayal Times Two: Arabs and Kurds,World,https://medium.com/@steverussell_9575/betrayal-times-two-arabs-and-kurds-62f8bd283c2b?source=topic_page---------192------------------1," The Kurds field some all-woman combat units in a region not known for it (Israeli Defense Force excepted) and the women as well as the Kurdish men are fierce. They’ve had to be; they live in a rough neighborhood. Kurdistan, in the “home of the Kurds” sense, includes parts of Turkey, Iraq, Syria and Iran. In the sense of an internationally recognized nation-state, Kurdistan does not exist. It almost did exist at the end of World War I. The Kurds have a distinct language and a distinct culture. They have a national flag, national colors, and a national anthem that they will sing at the appearance of a mic — unlike us, we who passed over many great patriotic songs to adopt an anthem that only professionals (and not all of them) can sing. Most Kurds were residing in the Ottoman Empire, which threw in with the Central Powers in WWI. The Ottoman Turks gave a good account of themselves, but the main event was in Western Europe, and the Central Powers lost. If you saw “Lawrence of Arabia,” it was a reasonable approximation (with the usual Hollywood discount) of the British attempt to foment rebellion among Ottoman Arabs. T.E. Lawrence was an anthropologist who had “gone native” well before WWI. Lawrence spoke Arabic and knew the clan relationships and the customs among the Arabs. His primary assignment was to keep a tactic rolling that occurred to him in his early attacks on the Hejaz Railway, an unfinished engineering wonder that was intended to connect Constantinople to Medina. Lawrence’s idea was to blow bridges on the rail line, but not blow them so badly as to make repair impossible. The theory was much like the theory behind the modern assault rifle, that a grave wound is better than a clean kill because another soldier has to tend the wounded. The objective was to make Turkey pour resources into keeping the rail line open to supply Turkish garrisons rather than attempting alternative arrangements. The successful crippling of the Hejaz Railway took place in a larger political context that was, from the Arab point of view that came to be Lawrence’s point of view, the Arabs fighting for freedom, for one huge Arab kingdom on a scale that would not be imagined again until Gamal Abdel Nasser dreamed the United Arab Republic. The UAR began with Egypt and Syria in 1958 but — instead of attracting more Arab governments — the UAR fell apart in 1961. The kingdom the Arabs were fighting for had been doomed from the start by a written but secret agreement hammered out by Sir Mark Sykes and François Georges-Picot in 1916, two years after the Ottoman Empire entered the war but well before there were any spoils to split up. The Ottoman Empire was to be dismembered, but an Arab Kingdom was not part of the deal. Oil was already a consideration in those days. From the time Lawrence learned of the Sykes-Picot Agreement, he was playing a game that was borderline treasonous. The Arabs, you see, were fighting and dying alongside Lawrence based on what he knew to be a lie. He took on attempting to sabotage that lie. Some historians claim it was Lawrence who tipped off Emir Faisal about the British double-dealing, which set off the Emir attempting some double-dealing of his own — an offer to change sides that came to nothing when the Turks would not put up a lie to match the British lie. Whether or not it was Lawrence who let Faisal in on the impending betrayal, it was certainly Lawrence who made a mad dash for Damascus at the head of an Arab army for the purpose of rendering Sykes-Picot untenable by changing the facts on the ground. Damascus was to become French, and the plan was to install Faisal as ruler backed by British arms to make good on the British promise. Scott Anderson summed up the outcome in a 2014 issue of Smithsonian Magazine: Part of the enduring fascination (with Lawrence) has to do with the sheer improbability of Lawrence’s tale, of an unassuming young Briton who found himself the champion of a downtrodden people, thrust into events that changed the course of history. Added to this is the poignancy of his journey, so masterfully rendered in David Lean’s 1962 film, “Lawrence of Arabia,” of a man trapped by divided loyalties, torn between serving the empire whose uniform he wore and being true to those fighting and dying alongside him. It is this struggle that raises the Lawrence saga to the level of Shakespearean tragedy, as it ultimately ended badly for all concerned: for Lawrence, for the Arabs, for Britain, in the slow uncoiling of history, for the Western world at large. Loosely cloaked about the figure of T.E. Lawrence there lingers the wistful specter of what might have been if only he had been listened to. The British and the French had not reckoned with Mustafa Kemal Atatürk, who rallied the Turks and fought his way out of the imperialist plans, becoming the founder of the modern Republic of Turkey. In 1924, Atatürk abolished the Ottoman Caliphate. A few pretenders tried to declare themselves to be the new Caliph, but the umma (Muslim community) accepted none of them. When the dust settled, the Caliphate was vacant and defunct. The holy sites and therefore the supervision of the Hajj (annual pilgrimage) were the responsibility of the House of Saud, still the rulers today of Saudi Arabia. The Kurds had never been able to agree on the borders or the government of Kurdistan, but when the Treaty of Sèvres died, they got folded back into the various nations from which they have repeatedly grasped for independence. When the United States invaded Iraq, the Kurds supported the U.S. and used the resulting chaos to set themselves up in a semi-autonomous region around Mosul. The Syrian Kurds pulled off a similar gambit under the cover of the Syrian civil war. When public opinion in the United States turned firmly against opening another front in the forever wars, the Obama administration undertook to train and arm an indigenous force to destroy the “new Caliphate” that had been declared by Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, the terrorist chieftain of the Islamic State, formerly ISIS, formerly al-Qaeda in Iraq. ISIS broke with al-Qaeda over brutality, with al-Qaeda trying to tamp it down and ISIS claiming Osama bin Laden’s organization had lost its jihadi fervor. The Syrian Kurds allied with the U.S.-friendly Syrian rebels to take back the real estate administered by the Islamic State. With U.S. air support, they pulled it off, taking over 10,000 killed in action and over twice that many wounded. The small U.S. contingent sprinkled among the Kurds to advise and call in air support came to respect their comrades-in-arms and were appalled when the Trump administration ordered them to withdraw, taking with them the ability to call in the U.S. Air Force. The Turks, who consider most Kurds to be terrorists, attacked immediately, displacing tens of thousands of Kurdish civilians. Unbeknownst to the public, Kurdish intelligence had been working with the CIA to locate the hidey-hole where Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi had been running dispatch central for terror attacks since the Kurdish militia took away his real estate. The withdrawal of U.S. troops mucked up the timetable for the raid to capture or kill al-Baghdadi, but the Kurdish intelligence troops stayed on post even as their families were fleeing for their lives. President Trump made a statement in which he thanked Russia first and the Syrian Kurds last. Russia released a statement disclaiming any military action and expressing skepticism that al-Baghdadi was dead. Trump also thanked Turkey, which did accept credit. But the mission did not depart from the easiest place, Incirlik Air Base in Turkey, because our “ally” was not trusted to maintain secrecy. The U.S. helicopters flew all the way from Northern Iraq, low and fast, to avoid the military aircraft in control of the space — our Russian “partners” and our Turkish “partners.” Running al-Baghdadi to ground was accomplished in much the same manner as the raid that killed Osama bin Laden. The CIA used intelligence gathered from Syrian Kurds along with information from interrogating ISIS prisoners. This achievement was by the same U.S. intelligence community that Mr. Trump is trying to discredit over the finding that Russia interfered in the 2016 elections. However the credit is misdirected, the most wanted terrorist in the world, Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, is still dead. And the nation that used to be the most trusted in the world to stand up for freedom and self-determination has still betrayed the Kurds, who bled in our cause. The U.S. soldiers who had to watch the betrayal on the ground might want to pick up T.E. Lawrence’s memoir, The Seven Pillars of Wisdom. They will find they have a lot in common with the British hero of WWI."
Medium.com,Society,On the women who fought the Islamic State’s territory — and won.,World,https://medium.com/@gaylelemmon/on-the-women-who-fought-the-islamic-states-territory-and-won-732263abfc05?source=topic_page---------193------------------1," The story of America’s partners in the ISIS fight cannot be told without talking about the role of the women who led in battle against men who bought, sold and enslaved women. Talk to them and they will tell you they are not just battling ISIS, but the entire mindset that says women are worth nothing and matter none. These women signed up and refused to back down against the men of the Islamic State, and they have pressed forward to write what they call a new chapter for women, not just in Kurdish communities, but across the region. In the process, as I have seen for myself, they have built an experiment in women’s equality that goes well beyond what we have seen until now, anywhere in the world. For the past two years I have chronicled for my next book the stories of the women who led the battle against ISIS as the partner force for the United States. The respect the American forces felt for these battlefield fighters and commanders is shown in the words they used to describe these women: warriors, leaders, fighters. This all-women military force sits at the center of a politcal experiment based upon the notion that true equality is possible for women and good for everyone. And brought to you by women who spent four years battling — at close range — men who bought, sold and enslaved women while leading men in that fight. These young women — from Kurdish, Arab, Christian communities and beyond — have given all to beat ISIS. And on the heels of that fight, these young women created a real-life utopian push for equality in the last place most would expect to find it. On the ashes of the battle against the physical territory of the Islamic State, they launched an unlikely political experiment in which women play a leading role in all political bodies. And all this while almost no one outside its borders was taking note. Spend time with these women — Kurds, Christian, Arabs — -and it is clear they fight not just to defeat the Islamic State, but to gain against extremism and to advance the idea of women’s equality. After all, who are the first people to pay the price when extremists win? Women and girls. Across communities. The Islamic State enslaved women. On the streets of Raqqa, ISIS fighters traded women and girls. And the young women who come from Raqqa are part of this all-women’s force created not just to protect land but to protect women. One of the young women I met in this photo had a brother who joined the Islamic State. He forced her to marry one of his fellow fighters. She had no choice, and her mother could not stop it. Her husband brutalized her. She survived, and decided that the one way she could avenge her suffering was to be part of defending her city. That is where I met her in 2018. In the coming months, I look forward to introducing you to the women who are part of this story. Their futures now hang in the balance as negotiations about the fate of their region presses forward. What is not in question is their role serving and protecting their communities and the important part they played in keeping ISIS at bay. The world began paying attention during the Islamic State’s siege of the border town of Kobani in 2014. In that fight, Kurdish women played a central role in leading and holding the near-collapsed front lines as a mix of Syrians and Iraqis worked to defend the city from a well-armed ISIS which had yet to experience one single battlefield defeat. The Americans launched strikes from the air, and it was up to the women and men inside Kobani to do the fighting and dying on the ground to keep the town out of ISIS hands. Following the end of the battle for Kobani, the forces who held the city emerged to hand the Islamic State its maiden defeat and begin their partnership with the United States. The town later erected a statue in its center to commemorate the role women played in the city’s defense. Young people come and take pictures in front of it today. As of today, this statue stands proud. In the coming days the town’s fate will be decided, along with so much else in northern Syria. What these young women achieved against the Islamc State will stand no matter what comes."
Medium.com,Society,Czech Commission Findings Slated to Incriminate Politicians and Bureaucrats,World,https://medium.com/@PeteSvoboda89/czech-commission-findings-slated-to-incriminate-politicians-and-bureaucrats-ea8efa4d6c2f?source=topic_page---------194------------------1," A parliamentary commission in the Czech Republic aimed at anti-corruption and transparency initiatives will likely implicate high-ranking government officials in their role at illegally nationalizing the OKD mining company. T
he Olza river runs through the quiet city of Karvina on the Czech-Polish border. While the beauty of the city is picturesque — greenery and mountains adorn on all sides — there is the unmistakable bustle of modern life, taking the form of a coal mining district where coal-bearing layers of the carboniferous age can be found. The Ostrava-Karvina coal basin is home to its fair share of controversy, although this drama originates more than 300 kilometers west in the capital city of Prague. Here, the country’s government makes decisions and rulings with implications for not only Czech citizens, but for many across the continent — and arguably the world. On Tuesday, a final report by a parliamentary commission to investigate the process of the privatization and nationalization of the mining company OKD was published. The implications of the findings stretch far beyond the fate of coal mines, dipping into the country’s complex and nuanced history, economy, and future forms of governance. Reportedly, the findings will incriminate several politicians and ministers of the Babiš government. Today’s report comes from an initiative spearheaded by the newest anti-corruption party in the Czech government as part of their transparency and accountability agenda. One of the Pirate Party’s first moves was to explore political responsibility, property transfers and economic interests behind the current status of the nationalized coal mining company OKD amid a rocky and sometimes shady few decades of power transfers, international investment, government mismanagement, and purported corruption. During the Soviet years, Czechoslovakia was a Soviet satellite state — one that was formally independent but under extreme political, military and economic influence. Post-communist mannerisms of the Czech elite are deeply seated into the working psyche of decision-makers and politicians; their past is inextricably linked with their present whether they care to admit so or otherwise. Though the country has had both peaceful and violent uprisings, it’s been a slow (and arguably unsuccessful) crawl out of the shadows for the Czech Republic in its attempts to escape the dredges of Soviet communism. Large and powerful Czech organizations including those dealing with international currency and exchanges have connections with former Soviet officials, even today. The country’s president, Milos Zeman, has connections with the Russians, even lobbying on behalf of Russia’s state atomic energy company. The case of OKD is emblematic of problems the country has been facing since the dissolution of the Soviet Union, marked by shadowy transactions, conflicts of interest, hidden agendas and public manipulation. By 1993, Czechoslovakia split into today’s sovereign nations of the Czech Republic and Slovakia. The Czech Prime Minister is roped into what seems to be a never-ending knot of scandals, corruption and coverups. Babiš’s chokehold on the media has, for the most part, gone unchallenged. As the fourth wealthiest man in the entire country today, Babiš bought the Czech media giant Mafra in 2012, which owns several newspapers and other media outlets. Recent protests across the nation identify three major grievances related to corruption at the highest levels of Czech government: a major conflict of interest in the allocation of EU subsidies; the criminal investigation into the use of the aforementioned EU-sponsored funds; and, a shady communist past including a collaboration with the former Czechoslovak state police. Grievances one and two are linked to the infamous Stork’s Nest scandal, which involved PM Babiš’s business dealings in the Agrofert company. In 2007, Babiš considered investing in a farm called “Stork’s Nest” (Čapí farma) about an hour outside of Prague. Under his direction, Agrofert swiftly set up a subsidiary to develop the property, tapping into approximately $2 million of EU funds. When the Prime Minister’s ANO party competed for parliamentary seats in 2017, the Czech police brought fraud charges against him directly relating to the investment in Stork’s Nest. Interestingly, Agrofert was then placed into a trust the same year the police investigation began. Around the same time, the Prime Minister’s son, Andrej Babiš Jr., sent an email to Czech police claiming that he was being held against his will in Crimea. Investigative journalists tracked down Babiš Jr., who was told that he was to go on an extended vacation or risk returning to the Czech Republic to be committed to a mental institution. The Prime Minister fired back, stating that his son was mentally ill and suffered from schizophrenia. The diagnosing doctor later worked for the Prime Minister at the Finance Ministry and became a member of the ANO party. The Czech police investigation into Prime Minister Babiš’s involvement in the Agrofert case was dropped two weeks ago, when the general attorney stated that there was no legal reason to continue prosecution (a suspicious move, as the case had been under investigation and legal proceedings for some time now). The third and perhaps most serious grievance has serious implications related to the transparency of the country and a full dissolution of ties with the Czech communist past. While he has not admitted it (and has even gone before courts to try his innocence), it is suspected — with good evidence — that Babiš acted as an informant for the Czechoslovak Secret Police during the Soviet years. The protests included slogans such as “We don’t want an StB agent”, the StB being the secret communist police in former Czechoslovakia. The parliamentary commission investigation into the OKD privatization spans between 1990–2017, from the fall of the former USSR to the bankruptcy of the company. Initial reports suggest that the findings will incriminate two former ministers of economy and various high-ranking bureaucratic officials from the early 2000’s — totaling approximately 20 high-profile individuals. Today, the government controls OKD’s management. The state-imposed quasi-nationalization of the mining company has had its share of mismanagement, from logistical to ethical. After falling hard-coal prices and struggles with top-down management, the private company OKD declared bankruptcy in 2017. Subsequently, a group of private investors offered to buy out the valuated company, restructure and pay existing debts. The group was denied the bid, under the decision-making powers of the then-finance minister Andrej Babiš. Soon after, the government swooped in and nationalized the company, placing it (and its profits) under state control. While the bankruptcy process was underway, Babiš appointed a purported business associate — Lee Louda — as OKD’s insolvency administrator. For seemingly no reason, Louda refused to pay the company’s debts under national supervision. Strategically, this made sense for Babiš, presenting the nationalization of the company as a proverbial goldmine for the country as a pawn in the upcoming elections for Prime Minister. Before its nationalization, OKD was a subsidiary of the Dutch-based energy group New World Resources (NWR) where it grew and prospered. After bankruptcy however, the company was valued far below its worth, held in a hostage-like situation by the finance ministry, and ultimately taken under control of the state. NWR, unappreciative of these hostile — and very costly — measures, threatened to lodge a formal complaint against Prague under the Energy Charter Treaty, an international pact that governs cross-border investments. The move was seen by many as Babiš pilfering the company from its parent company for political gain. They were not wrong. Today, the largest coal mine in the country is owned by the state. This stands in stark contrast to the country’s public face on environmental concerns. As scientists, environmentalists and the general public have known for quite some time, coal isn’t exactly an ecologically friendly resource. Aside from general health concerns for individuals, the mining of coal negatively impacts environmental concerns surrounding land use, waste management, and water and air pollution which are detrimental to the atmosphere. So how can a country, party to the Paris Agreement and bound by international law, stand so firm in securing profits from a major polluter being run by the state? Even more peculiar — reportedly, the company filed for a 7-year extension to continue mining until 2030, despite originally only being approved to operate until 2023. The profit value of this additional 7-year period is estimated to be around a few billion Czech crowns per year. If the extension is accepted, the answer will be clear. The objectivity of the state, in matters such as business and the environment, is forever compromised. Aside from intentional undervaluation and environmental distress, there remains the puzzling query of management choice after obvious previous financial failure. While the ownership of OKD has changed hands quite a few times over the past few decades (and today remains under government control), the actual management of the company mostly remains. If a change in management was needed, it was grossly mishandled by the government. Unfortunately, the human cost of mismanagement is of greater consequence than political games. A methane explosion on the Czech-Polish border in December 2018 killed 13 workers in OKD mines; speculations that important safety regulations were skirted for cost purposes, forcing miners to ignore safety warnings and measures in place, has not yet been put to rest. This was the worst mining disaster in the Czech Republic since 1990, when 30 died in a fire in the same region. The parliamentary commission’s report certainly sheds light on the shadowy ins and outs of the Czech mining company OKD over the past several decades. While preliminary indications prove a complex string of political deals and backstage handshakes, there is no doubt that it is ultimately the Czech people who are suffering as a result of the political self-interests and the government’s (intentional) lack of action."

It was a miserable day; it had been raining all morning and I was starting to feel cold. A group of fifty of us had gathered for a meeting on Paris’ Pont au Change which had been blockaded by a rather surreal big blue boat. We were in the middle of the road but as there were no cars it didn’t matter. I was annoyed. This was the anti-climax that I hadn’t expected and I sensed the impatience of my daughter who was with me and her growing disappointment. We needed to get into a warm café, have a hot drink and get our thoughts together. Extinction Rebellion (aka XR) in France is a recent phenomenon and has grown rapidly to 8000 activists since it was launched less than 12 months ago, an impressive growth that mirrors the growing climate crisis. I had joined in June and had participated in a number of its workshops covering the organisation structure, the extent of the climate crisis and a full day training on civil disobedience. Along with other capital cities, the International Rebellion in Paris started on the 7th of October. I had been called to a briefing the night before in a disused warehouse on the outskirts of Paris. There, I met up with an international group who had arrived from all over the world to participate in the Paris actions. We chatted and exchanged stories before breaking off to be then assigned to a small team of twenty French activists who would meet up the following day to execute the action. We were not told what exactly it would be nor where it would take place, merely that we would receive a message during the following morning with a rendezvous somewhere in Paris. Both my children had decided to take time off school to participate. My daughter came down first in the morning and we waited for a few hours before we finally received our meet-up location — in a café near the Louvre. After an hour our group leader got a call and got us walking three-quarters of a mile to Place de Chatelet where we converged with other groups as they rapidly assembled tents and stands. All roads had been blocked by the activists with the impressive sky-blue boat stopping traffic at the far end of the bridge which led from the main Place. Within the space of thirty minutes, it was clear that the operation had worked and the area had been turned into a huge impromptu festival. The scale of the logistics even included providing food to the ‘bloqueurs’ (those who had chained themselves to block incoming roads) and the provision of eco-friendly portable toilets. Journalists and television crew eventually came down to ensure full media coverage. The police forces, clearly taken off-guard, were left on the periphery of the site — their riot gear on show despite their impotency given the situation My son arrived by 6 pm that evening and after eating with us, joined a musical group brandishing his ukulele and drumsticks. My daughter joined a group of people dancing on the bridge which included one person dressed as a chicken moving his feathered head to the sound of a DJ who had set-up his mixing deck on the boat. Other activities taking place ranged from performances, crafts, singing, debates and even gardening. At 10pm, I slipped into a bar with a few other activists and we compared notes. The day had been a clear success. Whether the momentum would hold up and the police would move in remained unanswered questions. My daughter and I decided to return to our hotel with my son staying a few hours longer and help with the distribution of food. Returning the following day, the scene was different. Gone was the festive atmosphere and in its place was a miserable grey day complete with rain, wind and cold. It was here that my daughter and I found ourselves with one group of activists who had decided to hold a meeting on the bridge — exposed to the elements, they organised themselves in a circle with two moderators determining when people could talk. As they discussed their proposed actions, I became suddenly struck by a couple of things — firstly, the presence of a number of ‘yellow-jackets’ in the group and one who was wearing an Unbowed tee-shirt underneath (Unbowed or ‘Les Insoumis’ being a radical French left-wing political party run by the veteran firebrand politician Jean-Luc Melenchon) the other was the language which seemed more concerned with anti-capitalism than saving the planet. I was getting a distinct impression that the group was being hijacked. To be clear, the objectives of XR are as follows: For XR France, there is one additional demand · Protection of global biodiversity. Internationally, XR advocates non-violent civil disobedience to attain these objectives and looks to engage a broad section of the population to do that. In that respect, I found much of the discourse on the bridge problematic. My daughter was also telling me at this point that she was unhappy with what was being said. We waited, with my hand raised until a moderator indicated that I could speak. I knew that the people around me would not like what I was about to say. “I feel very disappointed listening to what you have been saying” — nobody spoke, just the sound of the rain. “I’ve joined this group as I want to help stop an ecological catastrophe and I want to work with other people who feel the same sense of urgency. I’m not here to be a tribute act to the Yellow Jackets or The Unbowed” Hands shot up to allow the moderator to let them speak, a sign that I had probably upset some people. I went on to say that seemingly aligning XR with other political movements undermined its objectivity. “As XR we were not there to offer a particular prescription to solve the climate crisis — but to offer an objective and a way of deciding together how we achieve it”. “If we are going to solve the climate crisis then we need to look to people who might have views on all sides of the political spectrum, to help them see the urgency and bring them into this discussion.” Finally, one person spoke up “But what do you suggest?” I mentioned different cultures. That in other countries, like the UK, XR even had faith groups to organise disruptive events. “How do we reach these people in France if they think that we are just another left-wing group? If we are going to get the support that we need then we have to also be talking with people that we don’t agree with or are different from ourselves” At this point, almost to prove my point, my daughter motioned to me that she wanted to say something, so I fell quiet as she interjected. “I’m here as I’m worried about my future and I want to do something about it. I’m not here to debate politics with you. I just want there to be a planet that I can live on.” I was a little bit shocked but quite proud. My daughter, usually reserved, had reduced concisely into a few sentences what I had been trying to say for the previous five minutes. Again, silence from the group. I continued. “And beyond that, let’s be honest, we have not sought this diversity. Look around you, I don’t see any black, Asian or Arab people. You’re all so white!” I felt that I might have overstepped the mark but I saw the hand signals of a few people around me to indicate some agreement. Later that evening on the phone, my girlfriend (herself Asian), listened to what I had said earlier that day: “Great sweetheart, another white saviour, that’s what we really need!” That put me in my place and made me aware of the absurdity of my comments. I was a middle-class white man trying to call out other white people for non-inclusion. It wasn’t a great look. Back on the bridge, the people had listened politely to what we said and I felt that our views had been respected. However, a young man ended with a terse remark: “Well, what you’re talking about might work in other countries but perhaps that won’t work here.” I didn’t respond as he perhaps had a point. I didn’t know for sure that building a movement with a broad base of support was going to be possible in a country like France that, in many ways, is so divided. As my daughter and I headed back to the café, several people who had heard us stopped to talk and ask questions. They were interested and friendly. One woman told me that she had understood already the problem and there had been discussion in another group about trying to tackle it. Perhaps I should check with them. Another man told me that they needed to go and visit mosques and churches to explain what they were doing and why it was important. It was something that would happen but clearly hadn’t yet — these were early days. Finally, in the warmth, we ordered tea and dried off. During the rest of the day, we talked with people in our international group. Some had organised their own events and had created links with French activists to hold artistic demonstrations. Some others had initiated an event in Paris to highlight the plight of environmental campaigners in Latin America. XR might not have the diversity it aspires to yet, but it is already international. Back on the street, I found my son, playing improvised drums with a choral group next to the iconic XR boat which had been seen on the streets of so many other global cities where XR has protested. The atmosphere was joyful again. Today XR in France doesn’t have the diversity it really needs. However, the group has shown itself to be more than open to constructive criticism as well as a willingness to do something about it. Let’s hope that more diversity will come in time and with that more change can come."
Medium.com,Society,Jordan: In the Eye of the Storm,World,https://medium.com/@kentkroeger3/jordan-in-the-eye-of-the-storm-130e2608bec3?source=topic_page---------198------------------1," By Kent R. Kroeger (October 26, 2019) Note: The names in this essay have been changed to protect identities. If the world seems on the verge of exploding, you are probably watching too much news on cable TV. On the other hand, there may be something real going on. Something so fundamental that even the U.S. can’t alter its trajectory. In the past few months, we have had protests in Hong Kong, Ecuador, Chile, Lebanon, Iraq, UK and Jordan. Whether it is teachers, pro or anti-Brexiteers, students, or disgruntled commuters, anger appears to be rising among the world’s citizens. The dark forces exploiting this growing discontent are gaining power so fast, Washington Post columnist David Ignatius is convinced the time is now for the U.S. to extend its regime-change magic to Lebanon. [What could possibly go wrong?] But is this apparent increase in worldwide protest significantly different from the recent past? The answer is a tentative ‘yes.’ Let us look at the data. According to the GDELT project, the term ‘protest’ in the world’s TV news has been on the rise since January 2018, particularly on Al Jazeera and the BBC World Service. Figure 1: Frequency the term ‘protest’ used in major news broadcasts We are repeatedly told by the news media that, since the election of Donald Trump, the world has become more agitated (and Figure 1 suggests this is true). And this tumult has had profound consequences on countries otherwise free of conflict and violence. Nowhere more so than Jordan and its capital city of Amman. Human settlements in Amman, Jordan date back over 9,000 years, but the city today doesn’t look a day over 200-years-old. Amman is like a pair of old leather shoes that are comfortable. Clearly having seen more prosperous days, the city is ragged but relaxed. It’s worn down but durable. My son and I had just arrived in Amman from Muscat, Oman, the day before when a hired driver picked us up at our hotel near the old city center. Our driver, Farouk, a middle-aged Palestinian and father of four, said he was eager to show us his city as he took one last drag on his half-smoked cigarette before snuffing it out. [Everyone in Jordan smokes, or so it seemed. Hookah lounges were everywhere.] As our hotel was in old Amman, near the former parliament building, we were walking distance to most everything we needed during our four-day stay. Still, an informal driving tour is a useful introduction to any new city. Farouk’s English was far better than my Arabic so after a few minutes of exploratory small-talk, we settled into a conversational rhythm that seemed to facilitate mutual understanding. When traveling abroad, it is advisable to avoid conversations about politics, particularly in a country like Jordan which, despite the generally laid back demeanor of its citizens, is still a constitutional monarchy where political speech and press freedoms are significantly constrained. The democracy watchdog group, Freedom House, classifies Jordan as only ‘partly free,’ scoring the country a 37 out of 100 on their Freedom Index. In its 2019 report on worldwide press freedom, Reporters without Borders (RWB) ranked Jordan 130th out 180 countries (Afghanistan ranks higher than Jordan on the RWB’s Press Freedom Index). Nevertheless, in a region where one’s very existence can be a potent political statement, politics hangs in the bone-dry Jordanian air like a low-frequency hum. You see politics everywhere, if you look for it. Using an unscientific sampling method (i.e., any taxi cab that passed Farouk’s car), I estimated that about 1-in-20 Amman taxi cabs had Saddam Hussein’s image pasted on the back bumper or window. Not a surprise, considering the former Iraqi strongman was one of the first Arab leaders to embrace the Palestinian cause, at least superficially; but the ubiquity of his image still begged the question: “Why Saddam Hussein?” “He is admired by many Palestinians,” Farouk said. He didn’t elaborate. He didn’t need to. During his rule, Saddam Hussein granted equal-rights status to roughly 35,000 Palestinian refugees living in Iraq — most of whom came to Iraq in one of three waves: (1) the 1948 war surrounding Israel’s creation, (2) after the Six-Day War in 1967, and (3) and in the 1990s after many Palestinians were expelled by Gulf states opposed to Iraq’s occupation of Kuwait. “Portraying himself as a defender of the Palestinian cause for statehood, Saddam gave them subsidized housing and the right to work — rare privileges for foreign refugees that bred resentment among many Iraqis,” according to journalist Ahmed Rasheed. In 2017, reacting to that popular resentment, the current Iraqi regime rescinded those special citizenship rights for Palestinians leaving the roughly 10,000 Palestinians still in Iraq feeling particularly vulnerable. Not every Jordanian Palestinian keeps warm feelings about Saddam, however. One such person on my Reddit feed (“Samir”) explained the Jordanian fondness for the former Iraqi leader as rooted in his selling oil to Jordan in the 1990s at preferential prices in exchange for the Jordanians helping Saddam escape U.N-imposed sanctions by utilizing Jordan’s Aqaba port. “Let us not forget that Iraq under his reign tried to blow up some Amman hotels in the 1990s hosting Americans,” Samir noted. ___________________________________________________________________ Farouk abruptly merged onto Khaled Ben Al-Walid Street, a major road artery in Amman’s central district, cutting off a taxi cab in the process. As he darted back and forth between lanes of fast-moving traffic, I felt like I was on Mr. Toad’s Wild Ride at Disney World. As our speed settled into a crawl as we came upon a minor traffic jam, Farouk pointed to some nondescript buildings to our left. “Jabal el-Hussein refugee camp,” he said. “A Palestinian camp?” I asked. “Yes,” he responded. “Created after 1948 (Arab-Israeli war). But now also Syrians and Egyptians.” Built in 1952, the camp originally housed 8,000 Palestinian refugees in a area covering 0.4 square kilometers in northwest Amman, not far from the The Citadel, a Roman-era complex of ruins in the heart of Amman. Today, the United Nations Relief and Works Agency (UNRWA) says the camp’s population exceeds 29,000 registered refugees, but unofficial population estimates report the number of people living in Jabal el-Hussein camp is between 40,000 and 60,000 people, including many Syrian refugees who escaped that country’s recent civil war. My first surprise was that the Jabal el-Hussein camp looked like just another Amman neighborhood. The buildings were closer together, perhaps. But, otherwise, it would be hard to know where the camp begins and where it ends. After over 60 years in existence, many Palestinian refugee camps in Jordan have morphed from transitory tent cities to complex, permanent communities that, by all appearances, seem integrated into the host country’s economy. “Is it safe for us to walk around the camp?” I asked timidly, not wanting to offend our host. “Safe?” he said with a smile. “This is Jordan. Of course, it is safe.” A refrain we would hear more than once while in Jordan. ___________________________________________________________________ Before starting our driving tour of Amman, I had asked Farouk if we could visit one of the Amman’s Palestinian refugee camps. He didn’t respond at the time, which I assumed was either a function of the language barrier or that I was asking something politically sensitive. So when in the middle of our car tour he pointed out the Jabal el-Hussein camp, I was surprised. Pleasantly so. And even more so as he continued talking about refugees more broadly — specifically, their impact on everyday life in Jordanian society. “We have many refugees because we are safe,” Farouk started. “But our government doesn’t have the money to take care of everyone.” Behind only Lebanon, Jordan has 71 refugees for every 1,000 Jordanian citizens. In third place is Turkey, with 43 refugees for every 1,000 Turkish citizens. Figure 2: Countries with highest refugee density (2017) But, factoring in undocumented refugees, one World Bank official estimated that one-out-of-three people living in Jordan in 2015 was a refugee. In a country of 9.7 million, that is around 3 million refugees. Whatever the true figure, refugees are a major cost factor within the country’s public and private economies. “Jordan is now hosting just over 650,000 registered Syrian refugees, with some estimating the total number, including unregistered persons, closer to double that,” according to Mark Plant, Chief Operating Officer of the Center for Global Development (Europe), an independent research organization. “At the same time, international partners, notably the International Monetary Fund (IMF), have been insisting that Jordan take actions to bring down government debt to more sustainable levels through increasing fiscal discipline to tame government deficits. These dual imperatives by the international community — host more refugees and tame the budget — seem to put Jordan in an untenable situation as long as the refugee crisis continues.” In terms of Jordan’s financial ability to handle such a large refugee population, the evidence is mixed. On the positive side, at 30 percent of GDP, Jordan has a relatively small amount of external debt (i.e., total public and private debt owed to nonresidents repayable in internationally accepted currencies). In terms of gross government debt, however, Jordan possesses one of the highest debt levels relative to GDP at 96 percent (for comparison, the gross government debt relative to GDP for the U.S. is 107 percent). For all countries, the average gross government debt relative to GDP is 60 percent, according to the IMF. Jordan receives substantial support from the international community. But, even with that assistance, Jordan’s government budget is strained…and the people feel it. __________________________________________________________________ More than once Farouk reminded me that the Palestinians in Jordan “are Jordanians.” And he wanted to make it clear that Jordanian support for the Syrian and Iraqi refugees is evidence of Jordan’s strong humanitarian history, but that Jordanian citizens — most of whom are Palestinian — cannot be of secondary importance. Farouk’s sentiment should sound vaguely familiar to Americans. Replace “Syrian refugees” with “Mexicans” and “Jordanians” with “Americans” and you have Donald Trump’s core immigration platform. And it is not just working-class Jordanians extending this opinion. Ahmed, a Jordanian academic and former senior government official for Jordan’s King Abdullah told me during dinner, “Few countries have more refugees for its population size than Jordan — and we have expertise on refugees issues that we need to share — but we also have limits.” Concerned that Jordan’s government budget deficit was too high to maintain long-term, he cited Jordan’s recent teachers strike that resulted in Jordanian teachers getting a 35 percent pay raise. “The government didn’t even get the teachers to accept performance pay standards,” he lamented. The Jordanian teachers strike underscores the risk in underestimating the potential for Jordan’s domestic stressors to impact regime stability. Nevertheless, casual conversations with Jordanians leave a strong impression that popular support for the King Abdullah is high and not immediately threatened. ___________________________________________________________________ As Farouk dropped my son and I off at our hotel following our tour, I again asked if there were any areas near our hotel we should avoid walking around at night. He clearly thought I was just another overly cautious, misinformed American — but, in my defense, Amman is a big city and like any city it has ‘bad areas.’ “You are safe,” he assured me. “This is Jordan.” Farouk’s national pride notwithstanding, a variety of crime statistics do confirm that Jordan is relatively safe, at least compared to its neighbors. According to Numbeo.com’s survey-based Crime index, Jordan is relatively crime-free compared to its Arab neighbors, ranking 62nd out of 123 countries. In comparison, the Palestinian Territories rank 46th, Lebanon 63rd, Iraq 73rd, Egypt 81st, and Syria 114th. Using a more concrete metric — annual homicide rate — Jordan ranks 67th out of 195 countries with an annual murder rate of 1.4 murders per 100,000 inhabitants, compared to 9.9 for Iraq, 4.0 for Lebanon, and 2.5 for Egypt. But it is not on individual-level crime statistics that Jordan stands out. Saudi Arabia is much safer than Jordan, but at a tremendous cost to Saudi personal freedoms. It is at a more macro-level that Jordan truly looks like a regional outlier. In Amman, we were only 55 miles from the Syrian border at the Jaber Border Crossing (similar to the distance between Philadelphia and Dover, Delaware) and 130 miles from Damascus, Syria (similar to the distance between Philadelphia and Washington, D.C.). Yet, the problems of Jordan’s northern neighbor could not have felt more distant. Even as news coverage of Turkey’s incursion into northern Syria dominated the regional news channels, there was no evidence that people in Amman were overly concerned. Our hosts occasionally would make glancing references about the Turkey-Syrian-Kurdish conflict, and only as a contrast to Jordan’s general state of peace and generosity in taking in Syrian refugees. “You can’t blame the Syrians here in Jordan for not wanting to go back to Syria,” commented Ahmed. “They fear reprisals from (Bashar al) Assad’s police state.” ___________________________________________________________________ My most vivid contrast to Jordan was the country of Oman, where my son and I had spent the previous week prior to arriving in Amman. Other than Islam’s omnipresence, Jordan is an antipode to Oman. Modernity has settled into Oman with the subtlety of a Donald Trump applause line. The newness found everywhere in Oman’s capital, Muscat, has a calculated presence amidst a still conservative Islamic society, suggesting Muscat as a ‘future Dubai’ at one moment and, at another, emitting the aura of a stubbornly ancient culture. It’s a tension that may work in Oman’s favor in the long run. Or it may not. What Oman and Jordan have in common is their status as enclaves of peace and stability surrounded by neighbors that are either being bombed or bombing someone else. Here’s a quick rundown of Jordan and Oman’s neighborhood: Egypt’s Sisi regime is facing its biggest domestic protests of its relatively brief reign. The Israeli-Palestinian conflict has regressed into an active, never-ending crime scene disproportionately favoring the perpetrator over the victim and showing no signs of changing that dynamic. Syria is the mess du jour for now. But Iraq always waits in the anteroom ready to take over that role in a moment’s notice. Lebanon is facing its largest mass protests in decades. And, on Lebanon’s southern border, Hezbollah remains locked in a continuous standoff with Israel while it also support’s Assad’s efforts to regain a tight grip on his people. Saudi Arabia and UAE continue their cruel proxy war with Iran in Yemen, leaving the most vulnerable in Yemen on the constant brink of death by famine and disease. And, yet, there is Jordan in the middle of all that chaos, appreciating their relative quiescence, but always aware that it could end. I asked a prominent Jordanian political scientist what Jordan’s secret is to maintaining stability. It's not like Jordan controls vast reserves of oil and natural gas to buy social tranquility. They are not a worldwide IT hub like Israel. How does Jordan do it? The professor leaned back in his chair, stroking his chin. “If I knew, I’d bottle it and sell it to the world.” Please send comments to: kroeger98@yahoo.com"

Medium.com,Society,Why the United States should not be arming Ukraine,World,https://medium.com/@thehuntercawood/why-the-united-states-should-not-be-arming-ukraine-3dd29800edad?source=topic_page---------202------------------1," A
week and a half ago, the American news cycle exploded into a state of pandemonium as the White House made public a transcript-like memorandum of President Trump’s phone call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy. The call itself had already been the subject of intrigue thanks to a whistleblower complaint originating from within the intelligence community; however, House Democrats quickly weaponized both the call and complaint with allegations that President Trump had inappropriately extended a quid-pro-quo to President Zelenskiy involving American military aid in exchange for Ukraine’s help in investigating possible wrongdoing by Former Vice President Joe Biden and his son, Hunter Biden. Debates on cable news have raged on like the Great Fire of Rome since the release of that now-infamous transcript, with most of the parley focusing in on the ethicality of Trump’s conversation with the Ukrainian president and the plausibility of impeachment. The one thing that hasn’t been up for debate is the question at the center of this controversy, “Should the United States be arming Ukraine in the first place?” Back in August, news outlets started reporting that the Trump administration was slow-walking $250 million dollars in military aid to Ukraine. This solicited outrage from figures across the political spectrum who rushed to denounce the move as undermining “American national security interests.” What was shocking about this series of events was the sheer uniformity on display. Pundits and politicians alike lined up behind arming Ukraine without question or even discussion, eventually mounting enough pressure on the Trump administration to fold its cards. According to reporting by the Washington Post, the White House decided to release the aid intended for Ukraine after Sen. Richard J. Durbin (D-Ill.) threatened to freeze $5 billion in Pentagon funding for next year unless the Trump administration went forward with the military assistance promised to Ukraine. It should be noted, Senator Durbin is the Co-Chair of the Senate Ukraine Caucus, which is a sub-group of lawmakers in the Senate who advocate, lobby, and vote collectively for pro-Ukrainian policies. That fact alone might explain the lack of thought diversity on display. Absent of any pro-Russian lobby in the United States, the pro-Ukraine lobby has been able to monopolize Congress and coalesce support around its interests. That, however, should not stop us from having an honest debate about whether or not the United States should be sending millions of taxpayer dollars to Ukraine each year to fund a war that has nothing to do with the United States. The fact is the United States should not be arming Ukraine and there are at least three fundamental reasons why. First of all, the United States does not have any “national security interest” at play in Ukraine. Despite what many leading pundits and politicians say in these vague, buzzword-filled speeches that advocate for military aid, America’s security is not being threatened. The civil war in Ukraine is not similar to the Syrian Civil War, where the government was once on the threat of collapse and groups like ISIS had the stated goal of overthrowing the government as well as launching attacks on the Western world. The separatist movement in Donetsk and Luhansk is nothing like that. The War in Donbas is motivated by the separatist movement’s goal to gain independence from Ukraine. If the Donbas region breaks away and becomes an autonomous republic or reunites with Russia, then how is America national security threatened by that? Simply put, it’s not. Second of all, American military aid is counterproductive to resolving the conflict in Eastern Ukraine. The conflict itself has already claimed more than 13,000 lives, but instead of fostering a peace settlement, America’s military aid encourages Ukraine to prolong the war and the suffering that coincides with it. Tendentious cable news experts might say that Ukraine needs America’s military aid to “defend itself,” but the truth is that Ukraine has fought almost entirely on the offensive side of this war. American military assistance gives Ukraine the impetus to continue its offensive on the Donbas region, even while the conflict sits in a stalemate, ripe for resolution. It promotes a military solution for what should and could be a diplomatic or democratic solution. Last but not least, the United States is wasting billions of dollars that could be spent elsewhere on more important things — things like healthcare and education, which are far more important to average Americans than aiding and abetting a proxy war with Russia. More accurately, the US has reportedly provided $1.5 billion dollars worth of military aid to Ukraine since 2014, while at the same time a large number of Americans have been drowning in exorbitant debt incurred by ever-rising education and healthcare costs. From simply the point of view of a return on investment, sending millions of dollars to Ukraine each year yields virtually nothing for the United States. American economic interests do not profit from prolonged instability in Ukraine, which military aid arguably perpetuates. That said, if the United States wants to be a force for good and advocate for democracy then it has several avenues to do so. For example, the United States could organize an internationally-recognizable status referendum for Donbas to resolve the conflict, act as a mediator between the two sides, and send humanitarian aid to the areas most affected by the conflict. Either one or all of these approaches would have a verifiably positive impact on the conflict. More importantly, such approaches would do more good for more people."
Medium.com,Society,We must say this aloud: Alaa Soufi did nothing wrong,World,https://medium.com/@hussansk/we-must-say-this-aloud-alaa-soufi-did-nothing-wrong-3b81c174ab1b?source=topic_page---------203------------------1," Soufi’s — a Syrian run restaurant — received national and international media coverage when they were forced to close after receiving numerous death threats. The increased media coverage resulted in support from many quarters and they are now open again. The family was targeted by an organized right wing internet campaign after their son Alaa Soufi was part of a protest against People’s Party of Canada’s Leader Maxime Bernier. Alaa, along with three other people, were charged Tuesday, they are now out on bail. Clearly Hamilton Police waited till after the Oct 21st federal election to make the arrests. While a lot of analysis has been shared about the targeting of the Soufi’s one thing must be repeated, loudly and clearly: Alaa, and the protest, did the right thing. Alaa, a Syrian refugee, was protesting the public platform given to the People’s Party of Canada. To understand who the party and Maxime Bernier are, consider the first question he was asked in the Federal Leaders Debate earlier this week. “Mr. Bernier, you like to tweet, so let me read some of your tweets back to you. You called diversity in Canada a cult and extreme multiculturalism. You’ve used the words ghetto and tribes to describe newcomers whom you say bring distrust and potential violence. On Greta Thunberg, the 16-year-old climate change activist, you called her, quote, clearly mentally unstable.” The People’s Party of Canada is so racist that they will not exclude candidates who are blatantly Islamophobic, but kicked a candidate out who asked for a condemnation of racism. Public platforms where such vitriol and hatred against racialized people and migrants is drummed up must be loudly and urgently condemned. The fact that Mr Bernier, and his ultra right wing party, was given space to share their viewpoints in meetings, candidate debates, and on television resulted in their party gaining a quarter of a million votes this election. To be clear, shutting down these racist spaces is not censorship. For a racialized refugee from a Muslim country to protest against an organization that wishes to do him, and the rest of us harm, is the definition of responsible citizenship and free speech. An outrage machine has gone into high gear attacking Alaa seemingly for standing in front of an elderly grandmother trying to enter a building. We must be clear: this woman was entering a public arena to listen to anti-immigrant, racist vitriol. Stopping her from entering is an acceptable response. But the fact is, he nor others, actually stopped her. She entered the building, and her primary complaint is that she did not get a good seat. In case there are doubts about this woman’s political position, here is what she said, “I look at the Middle East and it frightens me, because there’s no democracy … and the fighting in Syria and the values are different than ours.” and “maybe we shouldn’t open the floodgates [on immigration]”. Remember that she made these statements after learning that Alaa is Syrian. Not a single news story about her or the protest bothered to include a viewpoint explaining how intensely racist these words are. The phrase “values” or “western values” has been mobilized by the People’s Party of Canada along with populists the world over, incite hatred and bigotry against migrants and racialized people. It is a dog-whistle, a coded term, that aims to cast non-White people as backward aggressors, and outside of society, despite the presence of migrants, and their values, here for centuries. This is not a story of an innocent grandmother being blocked, this is story of people proclaiming racist views going to listen to a racist, and them largely being given carte blanche to do so. And while Canadian and American commentators are casting Bernier’s defeat at the polls as a rejection by voters of their ideals, the fact is this campaign has given racists a much larger megaphone to draw more people to their hatred cause. The fake outrage engineered around the protest in Hamilton, framed as a limiting of free speech, remained intact, even as Soufi’s was attacked. A false analogy was created where death threats on a family, was framed as equal to a protest against an event by a politician to engender violence and hatred. There must be no equivocation in our public position against deplatforming of racists and hate mongers, irrespective of our internal analysis of tactics. While even the leader of the third-placed New Democratic Party, Jagmeet Singh called on the Elections Commission to disinvite Maxime Bernier from the Leaders Debate, with some very important exceptions, there was no cross-country organized effort to shut down People’s Party candidates getting a platform, or other party candidates refusing to debate them. If there is one thing we must learn from the rise of Donald Trump is that racist ideas if allowed to be propagated create enormous suffering for so many of us. Yesterday’s joke can soon become today’s authoritarian. Alaa, like many others that are stepping up against anti-people ideology, did the right thing. More of us need to join him."

Medium.com,Society,Watching the House Foreign Affairs Committee’s Hearing on Human Rights in South Asia was like…,World,https://medium.com/@induv/colonizerboardmeeting-633584032dee?source=topic_page---------205------------------1," I knew going into the hearing that the master, Western narrative about Kashmir would dominate. I just had no idea how openly bigoted our progressive elected officials could be, running a curated story about human rights violations that relied so blatantly on circular logic, colonizing tropes, and selective concern. It also reaffirmed, for me, the deadly combination (no exaggeration) of American (United States) entitlement, exceptionalism, and willful ignorance that plagues this nation and has hurt so much of the rest of the world. I am compelled to begin with the following observation: The United States House Foreign Affairs Committee brazenly ignored and officially erased the genocide and (seven iterations of) ethnic cleansing of Kashmiri Pandits — the indigenous people of the land — from the Kashmir Valley during its hearing on human rights violations in South Asia. This is because the entire hearing was predicated on Hinduphobia and the specter of rampant Hindu Islamophobia. The fact that indigenous Hindus were driven from their ancestral land by militant Kashmiri Muslims is inconvenient to that narrative. As I watched the spectacle unfold, the normalcy of censoring of Hindus in the media and popular discourse — and now, within the formal chambers of democracy — became painfully apparent. I have come to recognize that what makes Hinduphobia so insidious is that it promotes anti-Hinduism and anti-Hindu fear as socially and morally good. It is the modern version of old-school colonizing, missionary rhetoric. Which means it is completely camouflaged and very difficult for people to understand. In his opening, Congressman Levin states to Chatterji and Kaul, “I want to thank you for your scholarship, for your work on the ground, the different roles you play […] I’ve spoken out about what happened in Kashmir, and caught a lot of heck for it but I don’t really care…um…it’s really important that we speak the truth about these matters [audience claps]” (Part II: 1:17:29). He is not talking about the ethnic cleansing of Kashmiri Pandits, and neither did they. Hindus cannot speak counternarratives to the anti-Hindu master narrative without being deemed fascist (which is not only ironic, but precisely and painfully how colonization works) and accused of legitimizing the “Hindu nationalist regime.” What I came to learn during the hearing was that Hindus are not even allowed to take a “neutral” stance, where we defensively forefront the plight of other communities and don’t speak about Hindus. Hindus are only taken seriously by the West if we reinforce — with vigor and “insider authority” — the dominant anti-Hindu narrative: that Hinduism is fundamentally corrupt. This is framed by determinations of the Indian subaltern that are sourced in the Western Academy and also by the convenient framework of “Hindu” that is deployed by these same people, which allows only them to define what is Hindu. It is telling that, as an emergent scholar, whenever I have mentioned “Hindu identity” in an academic setting, the first — and often only — question I have been asked is about examining caste privilege. Not once have I been asked what it’s like to be a descendant from an ancient indigenous civilization that survived a thousand years of colonization, living in a world that is dominated by the two religions that colonized us. Apparently a U.S. Congressman of color can enter into evidence during a House Committee hearing Catholic and Evangelical Christian journals that report on Christian persecution. But a Hindu’s perspective is not legitimized unless it is laced with self-hate and a “critical” analytical lens that is informed and authorized by a lineage of academic theorizing that emerged from the voracious and distorted colonial gaze. Indian agency and the right to act upon legitimate Indian security concerns do not appear to register to the U.S. government; two U.S. Congresswoman of color warned Secretary Wells and Aarti Tikoo Singh about bringing Pakistan into the conversation. As a lifelong New Yorker, this immediately recalls 9/11. The U.S. can strip us of our shoes at the airport for twenty years because of one attack in 2001, but India is not permitted any allowance to protect herself? In fact, Secretary Wells had to repeatedly remind the committee that India is a functioning democracy; this was met with words and looks of barely disguised disdain. Members of the government openly scoffed at this. Remember, the infantilization of and disdain for brown people’s intelligence and our ability to self-govern is a hallmark of the colonizer. At one point, U.S. Congressman Yoho (the Ranking Republican member of the Committee) bemoaned the fact that other countries could not seem to live up to the high standards of the United States (details in my analysis below). He said this without a trace of irony. Sir, it is not India’s highest objective to become more like the United States, in 2019 or in any other year. Contrary to what most of the committee seemed to believe, the United States did not invent cultural and religious plurality. The assumption that it did and India ought to become like the U.S. — through force if needed — is the kind of civilizing, “modernizing” logic that is at the foundation of colonization and, unfortunately, also that of the hearing. Liberation does not mean “Made like the U.S.A.”. U.S. understandings of religious bigotry are not grounded and informed by the same scope of history as India’s. In the United States, Islamophobia and anti-Semitism are recognized (in progressive circles) on personal, systemic, and discursive levels, as they should be. People understand well that asking a Muslim to answer to Islamic fundamentalism when they are sharing a story about Islamophobia is the very definition of Islamophobia. Hindus are not afforded this same logic. Hinduphobia is (maybe) recognized if the news reports a violent attack on a Hindu person. Broader, systemic Hinduphobic narratives are not only unrecognized, they are elevated as socially just. So when it came time to contacting representatives, it is entirely plausible that Kashmiri Muslims, Indian Muslims, and Muslims, in general, felt they would be met with sympathy in speaking to their representatives and that Kashmiri Hindus, Indian Hindus, and Hindus in general did not share that confidence. It is entirely plausible that Hindu Americans are afraid of being read as Islamophobic when they are actually expressing legitimate concern about Hinduphobia and Hinduphobic narratives. As a result, only certain anecdotes and perspectives got amplified by members of Congress during the hearing, and these neatly reinforced the dominant Hinduphobic narrative. As a Hindu American, it was shocking to finally realize about how undemocratic and biased a seemingly simple democratic mechanism can be. The Hindu American community must wake up. But does this even matter to Hindus living in India? On one hand, I get the criticism coming from Hindus in India. Who cares about what a group of ignorant, imperialist, narcissistic U.S. government officials think? India is a sovereign nation with agency, democratic mechanisms, and a high level of self-awareness. India doesn’t need U.S. approval. Coming from a post-colonial nation, that sentiment makes a lot of sense. At the same time, this sentiment ignores the reality. This isn’t about approval, nor is it appropriate to assume that every country exists in a vacuum, which we know isn’t true. The U.S. and India exist within global circuits of power and money and the military industrial complex and international alliances (e.g. the U.S. with Pakistan) that very much have an impact on the lives of Indian Hindus. The American Academy has been the production house of Hinduphobia since it took over from the German and British Academies in the middle of the 20th century, when “colonization ended.” Academic, media, and pop-activist Hinduphobic constructions from the West(ern perspective) impact how governments think about Hinduism and India, and ignoring it isn’t going to make it go away. It’s not going anywhere. If anything, it’s spreading. Just take a look at the multibillion dollar Yoga Industrial Complex, and the Western Academics — “South Asian” and otherwise — who invent scholarship about Hinduism to substantiate the narrative that yoga is not actually Hindu, or that yoga ought to be cleaved from the oppressive grip of Hinduism. The West makes a killing off the back of Hindu erasure, so why wouldn’t they attack the source? Which is why I don’t think using terms like colonizer board meeting is an exaggeration at all. (Links to the hearings: Panel I Panel II) I will preface this by saying that I don’t necessarily agree with how the Indian government has handled the process since August 5th, but I also don’t pretend to know or comprehend all the details and refuse to pivot off of fear-based narratives that have spiraled out of control. I do know that even if the anecdotes we’re hearing have been exaggerated, the optics are horrible. At best, it’s a public relations disaster. At worst, it’s a human rights one. And there’s a whole range of possibility in between. However, this is about the hearing. Congressman Brad Sherman, you’re heading a subcommittee on South Asia; you know the panelists’ names in advance. Learn how to pronounce them. Even a good high school principal would have the decency to learn her students’ names for graduation. You are an elected official of the United States Government with apparent care for a region of the world where the names are not what you’re used to. You butchered it, with that too-familiar expression of monocultural American sorry-not-sorry-your-name-is-just-too-exotic. (Nice job publicly exotifying your brown witnesses.) This includes Kashmir (kaśmīr), which they consistently mispronounced throughout the day as Cashmere. (This is not a small thing. Kashmir is named after Rishi Kashyapa, a revered Vedic sage. The complete erasure of Kashmir’s Hindu indigenous roots and people was a dominant feature of the hearing as the goal was clearly to promote fear about Hinduism. Recognizing the persecution of Hindus would pop that bubble.) Congressman Sherman also referred to India as Israel at one point, and South Asia as Southeast Asia. He also didn’t know where Srinagar was, asking if it was “a city in Jammu.” (Part II: 1:54:54) This was (partly) emblematic of the entire hearing: we will keep comparing India (a post-colonial nation) to the United States (a settler colonial nation), because the U.S. is the gold standard and the norm and every piece of information that nuances the master narrative or provides a counternarrative and centers Indian context and history will be dismissed or drowned out. It was mesmerizing. It was as if these members of Congress had a BuzzFeed level of information about the region and were not interested in hearing anything other than reinforcement of their ideas, in the name of “bold” truth-seeking and information-gathering. (The colonial history of boldness from the West is contingent upon proving the barbaric otherness of the East.) The baseline circular logic was: because of the communications “blackout” (which Secretary Wells repeatedly corrected as diminishing) and because American journalists have not been allowed in the region, we have very little information about what is happening in Kashmir. But we do know for a fact that there are massive human rights violations happening and that the anecdotes we hear from our constituents proves this. And the dangerous and untrustworthy Hindu nationalist government is behind this. Five hours is too much to deconstruct (and I don’t get paid to do this) so I’m going to try and summarize the broad themes, as I saw them unfold. Disproportionate time on Kashmir. Although the hearing was meant to be about South Asia, the majority of the time was spent reaffirming select human rights violation narratives about Kashmir. “Kashmir is hardly the only human rights issue in South Asia, but it’s the one that’s in the news and attracting attention around the country,” declared Congressman Sherman (Part II: 17:50). Notice how he doesn’t comment on or even wonder about why that might be the case. Meanwhile, there are blasphemy laws in Pakistan, where Hindus and other religious minorities are persecuted regularly (and for years) with impunity; children are raped, murdered, and forced into conversion. In fact, Fatima Gul gave an opening statement with great and grave concerns about ongoing human rights violations — including rape and kidnapping — in Balochistan. Here are 2019 country/region ranking from Freedom House, an independent watchdog organization. Freedom House’s metrics are publicly available and transparent. (Note, for the subcategory scales, the lower the score, the better. For the aggregate score, the higher the better.) Why are we not talking about these other countries that are measurably worse? Sensationalism. Individual anecdotes are amplified into sensational sound bites. For instance, reports of pellet gun use that blinded a child (which is horrible, of course) led to the Indian government ceasing that method two years ago, as Secretary Wells reported. Nevertheless, even after hearing that the tactic had been abandoned, the committee member stated “So, the Indian government is blinding children.” Perpetuating Narrative-Driven Conjecture as Fact. There are plenty of examples. Here are just two. Erasing Jihadism/Erasing Human Rights Violations Against Hindus. “As the night fell, the microscopic community became panic-stricken when the Valley began reverberating with the war-cries of Islamists, who had stage-managed the whole event with great care; choosing its timing and the slogans to be used. A host of highly provocative, communal and threatening slogans, interspersed with martial songs, incited the Muslims to come out on the streets and break the chains of ‘slavery’. These exhortations urged the faithful to give a final push to the Kafir in order to ring in the true Islamic order. These slogans were mixed with precise and unambiguous threats to Pandits.They were presented with three choices — Ralive, Tsaliv ya Galive (convert to Islam, leave the place or perish). Tens of thousands of Kashmiri Muslims poured into the streets of the Valley, shouting ‘death to India’ and death to Kafirs…” Selective Concern for Human Rights. Conflating “Muslim” with “Kashmiri”. Conflating the lockdown with (the abrogation of) Articles 370 and 35a. This happened relentlessly and across both sessions. Congressman Levin reflects to Bencosme that “as someone who traveled to Kashmir and Ladakh over thirty years ago[…]it’s hard for me to take seriously that this is being done for the economic development of Kashmir and to unleash [raises hands up and the audience claps]. Can you or others speak to this argument? Is tourism blossoming and so forth?” (Part II: 1:21:05) Obviously the Indian government is not referencing the lockdown when it talks about economic development, so Mr. Levin’s commentary is unnecessary, specious, and patronizing. The Indian government is talking about the restrictions imposed by Article 35A, which restricted the ability for non-residents to invest in the state in terms of permanent capital (i.e., property). Also, this is based on ground knowledge as a tourist from over thirty years ago? Also Bencosme is neither an economist nor a development expert. No one on the panel is. Ignoring Counternarratives. A lot of panelists have been saying there is no healthcare…I visited all the three hospitals in Srinagar, the major hospitals in the Kashmir Valley. I spoke not only to the health care practitioners but also to the patients, their attendees, as well. And the common refrain was, of course, that there is a communication blockade, but they were able to access healthcare because this was not the first time Kashmir has been under a lockdown. In 2016, Kashmir was put under a lockdown by the militants and by separatists backed by Pakistan for almost six months. The hospitals and other basic essential services in Kashmir are used to such contingencies and they have worked …functioned smoothly in previous lockdowns as well. So, therefore, to say that this particular lockdown was different is, again, wrong. The healthcare is fundamentally run by Kashmiri Muslims themselves. It is Kashmiri Muslim civilians who are doctors, who are pharmacists and health care practitioners in Kashmir and they had stocked health care equipment and medicines for at least three months. So, again, I would say the record needs to be set straight on this.” (Beginning Part II: 1:54:45) However, the anecdata and fear-based narrative, once again, won the day. American Exceptionalism/Imperialism. (There are so many examples.) “Should the United States pull out because other countries do not hold themselves to the high standards of the United States? Um, and that’s something we’ve talked about before, and that’s something I want to hear from you. Are our standards too high (motions with arms raised above shoulders) that other nations look up and say we can’t do this? I look at the Human Rights Council, and President Trump pulled out in the summer of 2018. … I look at the list of people that are probably the top 10. Afghanistan, Bahrain, Bangladesh, China, Fiji, India, Iraq, Japan, Nepal, Pakistan, Philippines, and the council is Senegal. And certainly, I think, I can remove Japan but the rest of ’em have some form of — and I know this is going to irritate people and we’re gonna get calls — there’s human rights abuses that aren’t at the level that we would accept. I think that’s fair to say. And my question to you. And I want to talk to both of you. … In India, which religions are being treated fairly? And which ones unfairly? Because what I see are countries drifting away from American leadership.” Misrepresentation. Demographic minority is conflated with systemically minoritization. Hindu institutions and people are disenfranchised by Indian laws, while Islam and Christianity are supported by them. Hindu temples are (mis)managed and taxed by the government, and those moneys go toward subsidizing pilgrimages for Muslims, for instance. Bear in mind, these are colonial era holdovers, and the logic and historically-informed definitions of minority governing affirmative action in the United States do not pertain to religion in India. Throughout the entire five hour hearing, the subcommittee, visiting representatives, and witnesses bemoaned the lack of eyes on the ground in Kashmir. The one person who has spent considerable time on the ground before and after the abrogation, is a religious refugee from the region, and has a stellar record for unbiased reporting was barely asked any questions, set aside her own Kashmiri Pandit identity and narrative (and has come under fire from her community for sacrificing the rare opportunity for the Kashmiri Pandit narrative to go on the record), and was, nevertheless, unfoundedly smeared as being biased in front of everyone else. If she was a Muslim or a Christian religious refugee, would this have happened? Every single thing that Secretary Wells, Fatima Gul, and Aarti Tikoo Singh shared. The missing perspectives of Kashmiri Pandit refugees. Their voices matter, their counternarratives matter, their connection to their ancestral land matters, their truth matters."
Medium.com,Society,Catalunya Independence Revolt Rocks Spain as Separatists Rally,World,https://medium.com/@CTStaff/catalunya-independence-revolt-rocks-spain-as-separatists-rally-2e0c7bfede64?source=topic_page---------206------------------1," On October 14, nine imprisoned members of the Catalunya independence movement were found guilty of sedition and lesser crimes, and though they dodged the more serious charge of “rebellion,” the verdict has sparked mass protests and upheaval in Barcelona and other major Catalan cities in Spain. Over the last few years, the Spanish government has struggled to get a handle on the Catalunya independence movement and in its attempt to rein in the uprising has been condemned for human rights violations. The recent protests suggest the movement is not disappearing anytime soon despite the Spanish government’s best efforts. Many of the autonomous communities that are part of modern-day Spain are not really Spanish. Areas such as Catalunya (also known as Catalonia), Galicia and Basque Country have their own languages, cultures and political leanings that are completely different from what comes to mind when the average American thinks of Spain. The communities are mostly in northern Spain, far from the sunny, flamenco-filled streets of Seville and the country’s capital city of Madrid. For centuries, even after Spain annexed these kingdoms, they enjoyed relative political and social autonomy. They were free to make their own laws, speak their own language and educate their children as they saw fit. Gradually, the power of the autonomous communities began to decrease, but when Franco’s dictatorship began after the end of the Spanish Civil War in 1939, he stripped the communities of all rights related to self-governance and preservation of local culture to establish a homogenous Spain routed in Castilian identity. He made it illegal for children to be taught Basque, Catalan and Gallego in schools, and people were often imprisoned and tortured for no crime other than speaking their native tongue. Many people in these regions still long for independence, and those that are active in the various Catalunya independence movements still face severe consequences from the Spanish federal state, even though Franco’s dictatorship ended in 1977 with his death and Spain is now run by a “democratic” government. In the past, groups such as the Basque separatists Euskadi Ta Askatasuna, commonly known as the ETA, held more political clout and garnered more media attention than the Catalan separatist movement. But today, in modern Spain, the struggle between the national government and the various autonomous communities is most visible in Catalunya, home to one of Spain’s most popular tourist destinations, Barcelona. Catalunya is one of Spain’s wealthiest regions due to its strong industrial and tourism sectors. Its residents make up 16% of Spain’s total population and its economy contributes to nearly 19% of Spain’s GDP. Tax dollars from Catalunya help support Spain’s poorer regions, such as Andalucía and Extremadura, which is part of the reason why people from these regions are normally strongly opposed to the idea of Catalunya independence. Regions such as Galicia and Catalunya are technically considered “autonomous communities,” but for the most part, they are autonomous in name only. In 2006 laws were passed granting Catalunya greater independence than it had enjoyed since the pre-Franco years, with some even referring to Catalunya as a “nation,” but following the 2008 financial crash and the subsequent political fallout, these were all repealed by 2010. Catalunya has significantly more job opportunities than parts of Spain such as Andalucía, many people who live in the community are not Catalan but come from other parts of Spain or other countries. As a result, pro-independence political parties hold the majority of seats in the Catalan parliament, but only by a slim margin. The popular consensus is also mixed, with most data indicating that about 44% of Catalans support Catalunya’s independence from Spain. The Catalan separatists don’t have the best reputation outside of Catalunya either. Many people in other regions view them as troublemakers attempting to create political and social divisions that do not need to exist. José Rianxo, a high school teacher in Galicia, told Citizen Truth, “They’ve managed to divide the people of Catalunya into two opposing sides, something that they should not be proud of. You should only start the process of secession if you have a clear majority of the population in favor of it, which isn’t the case in Catalunya.” Catalunya has held a number of referendums to provide its citizens the opportunity to vote for Catalunya’s independence, most recently and notably on Oct. 1, 2017. On this early October morning, individuals at the polls were met with nightsticks and rubber bullets from the Guardia Civil and Spanish national police, with some disturbing images showing national law enforcement officers beating innocent people as they attempted to cast their votes. For many individuals in Catalunya and in other parts of Spain, this conjured up disturbing recollections of the terror and repression that existed during Franco’s regime. Despite these obstacles, the Catalan parliament declared independence Oct. 27, 2017, which led to the Spanish national government using legal powers akin to executive orders in the United States to dissolve the Catalan parliament and arrest a number of Catalan politicians. Those arrested included many big names in Catalan politics, including a deputy premier, government ministers, cabinet members and the former speaker of the Catalan parliament. Most of the leaders behind the October 2017 referendum, commonly referred to as “1–0,” were imprisoned in Madrid shortly after the referendum. One of the national government’s favorite tactics in their assault on separatist movements is to incarcerate political prisoners far away from their homelands. The imprisoned Catalan separatist leaders have been held in Catalonian prisons since July 2018, but many political prisoners linked to the Galician and Basque independence movements are still incarcerated far away from their family and friends, which has led to conflict between the Spanish national government and these regions. On Oct. 14, 2019, nine of the imprisoned Catalonians were found guilty of sedition and other less serious crimes, and though they dodged the more serious charge of “rebellion,” which can merit a sentence of up to 25 years, some of them face up to 13 years of incarceration. The majority also face political sanctions such as bans against holding public office after their release. The head of the Catalan Republican Left party and former deputy premier of Catalunya, Oriol Junqueras, received the stiffest sentence: 13 years in prison for the crimes of sedition and misuse of public funds. Other government ministers including Raül Romeva and Dolors Bassa face 12-year prison sentences. Spain’s manner of handling separatist movements has drawn ire and concern from the international community, and the Spanish national government has been accused of human rights violations by a number of groups. Lawyers for the imprisoned politicians have reported that they intend to appeal the decisions with the Spanish Constitutional Court and are also considering bringing the case before the European Court of Human Rights. The Spanish government intends to try six other Catalan political leaders who fled the country following the fallout after the referendum attempt, including the former Catalan premier Carles Puigdemont. Puigdemont currently resides in Waterloo, Belgium, and leads a quasi-government in exile called the “Council of the Republic,” which includes other self-exiled Catalan political figures such as education minister Clara Ponsatí, health minister Toni Comín and culture minister Lluis Puig. Most nationally syndicated Spanish newspapers have been supporting the sentence, claiming that it is not a spiteful, revenge-driven attack on the Catalan people, but rather simply upholding the law. Many members of the general population agree and see the separatist’s Catalunya independence movement as subversive and disrespectful of Spanish federal law. Rianxo stated that “Although there is a certain lack of sensitivity in some sectors of the national government with regard to historic nationalities, these can only be remedied within the legal system.” He added, “I think that the solution to the problem is to change the Constitution to define Spain as a federal state. The decision made by the Catalan separatists rests on the margin of legality and distances us from a possible consensus around this idea.” However, in many parts of Spain, including Galicia, there have been many actions of solidarity undertaken to support the imprisoned Catalan separatists, with mass protests mirroring the Catalan “Tsunami Democratíc” taking place in cities such as Santiago de Compostela and Vigo. The “Tsunami Democratíc” has been behind the majority of the demonstrations against the unusually harsh sentences given to the Catalan leaders and is similar to the social media-driven movements behind the demonstrations in Hong Kong and other areas. As of now, its leaders are unknown to the Spanish national government and the general public, but acting Interior Minister Fernando Grande-Marlaska has said that the government is working on all fronts to figure out who is behind the movement. “Of course there are investigations, we have efficient intelligence services, and we will end up knowing who is behind these actions by Tsunami Democràtic,” Grande-Marlaska told reporters. Since the sentencing, the Catalan leaders, Barcelona and other major Catalan cities such as Tarragona and Girona have been rocked with large protests led by angry Catalan citizens. The demonstrations at Barcelona’s Josep Taradellas-El Prat Airport have been so severe that more than 110 flights have been canceled so far. The Mossos d’Esquadra, Catalunya’s autonomous police force, responded with violence against the protesters, releasing a barrage of foam bullets that injured many so severely they had to be hospitalized. Members of the Spanish National Police were also present, indiscriminately firing rubber bullets into the crowd and wounding one man so severely he lost an eye. Many passengers who were supposed to be on those flights are now stranded at the airport, dealing with their situations the best they can. Josephine and Filippo Musarella, who were supposed to catch a flight to Nice from the airport, ended up having to spend the night in the terminal after their flight was canceled. According to Josephine, “We did our best to get through the night. We slept here, on these cardboard boxes. They just told us that we have seats on a flight this afternoon, but we’ll see if that’s true.” Protesters also obstructed traffic at the major intersection of Passeig de Grácia and Gran Vía in Barcelona, while more than 25,000 people filled the city’s Plaça de Catalunya. Many of these individuals would later end up at the airport protests. Thousands of other protesters flooded downtown Barcelona’s streets on Monday night to demand that the imprisoned leaders be acquitted. The Catalan politicians aren’t the only separatists facing lengthy prison sentences. Seven individuals charged with crimes related to terrorism and planning acts of violence are currently being held in pre-trial custody. The individuals are members of the Comités de Defensa de la República (CDR), an activist group working toward Catalan independence. According to Judge Manuel García-Castellón of the Audencia Nacionál, Spain’s high court, the individuals belong to a violent faction of the CDR “that aims to instate a Catalan republic via any means, even violent ones.” The seven individuals are currently being detained under the charges of possession of explosives, conspiracy to cause harm and belonging to a terrorist group. They were arrested during “Operation Judas,” a Guardia Civil operation that consisted of police raids on private property in the Catalan cities of Sabadell, Barcelona and Santa Perpètua de Mogoda. The prisoners have also been implicated in attempting to establish a secret channel to convey sensitive political information between Catalunya and the exiled Catalan leaders in Belgium. Both hardline Catalan separatists and the Spanish national government appear unwilling to compromise on the issue of Catalan independence, and it appears as if both sides have decided that making any concessions in an attempt to reach an agreement would be akin to sacrificing all their values and political ideas. Rianxo explains, “We live in an era where political parties are incapable of reaching an agreement with each other and act only in their own self-interest. This makes it very difficult to resolve extremely complex issues. I think that in this day and age it doesn’t make sense to create new countries out of territories in Spain; however, within the Constitution there exists the possibility to allow for different sensibilities that different areas might have. The problem is that nobody is interested in compromising.” One of the great things about a democratic government is that systems and policies can change, but only with the support of the people. However, the will of the people is never as clear as one would like it to be, and as a result, change through democratic processes is often a long and difficult journey. The future of Catalunya is unclear, and it will remain so until extremists on both sides continue to put their political ideologies before the will of the people."

And while some countries have pledged to reach carbon neutrality by 2015, getting there still remains a big question mark. ‘I haven’t met any leaders who know… how to get there’ Laurence Tubiana, one of the key architects of the Paris agreement, said to Climate Home News just after the Summit.

We all knew he couldn’t and that it was merely political bombast. But with his hugely misplaced hubris, perhaps he thought he could. After all, he would have been happy to see us crash out with no deal, just for bragging rights to be able to say he did what Theresa May couldn’t. After agreeing a Withdrawal Agreement with the EU, that is generally opined as worse than May’s deal, Johnson returned to Westminster puffed up that he was close to becoming the man of the hour. To expedite this, his plan was to avoid any meaningful scrutiny in Parliament over the Withdrawal Bill with an accelerated timetable. Thankfully, Parliament rebuffed his efforts and he had no choice but to request an extension from the EU with his tail between his legs. Like a petulant schoolboy being forced to apologise for a misdemeanor, but doing so in muttering it under his breath so as not to be seen as fully complying, Johnson decided he would refuse to sign the letter making his request to the EU. It allowed his right wing media paymasters to say he didn’t actually make the request in a pointless attempt to retain some credibility for their man. What a buffoon. So now, it’s highly unlikely Brexit will be achieved by Johnson’s do or die date of 31 October 2019 and he has consequently paused the Bill. It’s the latest in a series of failures that have characterised his short tenure as Prime Minister. The Number 10 and Conservative Party press offices, now evidently one in the same, have seemingly been taken over by a team with zero comms experience and obtuseness aplenty. Even in their aggressive bias, they couldn’t spin the back to back Ls Johnson has taken since he became Prime Minister. You know things must be bad when Conservative Party tweets (which now resemble those straight out of the Trump playbook) are being refuted with zingers from George Osborne. I didn’t know Gideon had it in him. Somewhat overestimating how much control he has in the situation, Johnson has now said he’ll give MPs more time to debate the Withdrawal Bill; in exchange, he wants MPs to agree to a general election on 12 December. I want Johnson out of office, and the end of this Conservative government, like yesterday. The Prime Minister is racist, Islamophobic, homophobic, misogynistic, sexist, colonialist and classist. He has conspired to have a journalist physically attacked. His election is a stain on British political history and he needs to go. A general election might just facilitate booting him out of office. That’s right, might. See, while Johnson’s premiership should be a political open goal for the opposition parties. Yet unfortunately, the prejudice, the poisoned rhetoric, the demonising of opponents and minorities and the hate, all of which are central to Brand Johnson, Brand Tory and the right, have become normalised. That means a departure of Johnson from Number 10, however likely, can’t be guaranteed. Just as experienced in Trump’s America, the right wing media have given a voice to the attitudes, charged language and utterances that were always present in British society, but suppressed. The Tories have reciprocated that same energy and message, projecting it throughout society. Surely, it’s ok to be racist or an Islamophobe when your Prime Minister is too, right? Now, those sections of British society feel so emboldened that they needn’t hide their views, even in the voting booth. It’s akin to the Death Eaters in Harry Potter. They were still a bunch of badmind individuals once He Who Must Not Be Named had been defeated by baby Harry. It just wasn’t acceptable for them to show that as their leader was presumed dead. Once it was clear he was back, they all came out of the woodwork, brandishing their dark marks with pride. It’s no different for the prejudiced sections of society who no longer feel they need to disguise their attitudes and they shan’t do so in an election or any election campaign. In fact, I dread to think just how toxic the right will make a forthcoming election campaign. Preeti Patel is probably dusting off May’s ‘go home’ billboard vans as we speak. This means an election, likely to have high turnout, will still attract support for the right amongst prejudiced sections of the electorate, and, admittedly, those who just want Brexit done (albeit a hugely short-sighted approach for such a momentous issue in British politics and society). The message from the Tories will be that they are the party to get Brexit done and that will gain them votes. Although overall, I expect them to face huge losses for their failures to do so when given the chance. As for the opposition parties, Labour under Jeremy Corybn are playing a balancing act of neither being anti or pro Brexit in their official party stance. It’s the right approach to take as despite my personal views on Brexit, we cannot dismiss the views and votes of 17.4 million people who sought to leave the EU. Nevertheless, that too potentially splits the Labour vote, at least while Brexit remains unresolved and without a clear path for how it might be. The Liberal Democrats positioning themselves as the anti-Brexit party might be all well and good but they’re ignoring a huge section of the electorate in doing so. Conversely, being unashamedly anti-Brexit will erode the vote share of the Tories and Labour for remainers that once aligned themselves with the two main parties. If a remain elector doesn’t trust Labour’s stance is guaranteed to see us stay in the EU, the Liberal Democrats are a likely destination for their vote. And if you’re a Tory remain voter, and disillusioned with the hateful brand of politics from your party, you may still not be able to bring yourself to vote for Labour. The Yellow Tories could instead become your new political home. Some reading this, especially Labour supporters, might argue that a general election won’t be another Brexit referendum by another name. Rather, it’ll be an election where the electorate will need to consider the merit of policies from each party. But let’s take a reality check here. Any election will be dominated by and fought on Brexit party lines. Labour have some great policies that can help shape British society into a fairer place that isn’t just for the 1% as the Conservatives have made it. And they’re all vote winners for me. Although above the white noise of Brexit, I don’t feel confident that they’ll be heard. Which brings us to the fact that an election won’t solve the Brexit problem. We could end up with a hung parliament or a government of any party that is faced with the same impasse we are currently faced with. The balancing act of pleasing the electorate, getting consensus from Parliament and an agreement where the EU understandably shows us they’re still Billy Big Balls, is unworkable with politicians. That’s why we need a second referendum, or People’s Vote, on the deal. I’ve always maintained that we can’t ignore the initial referendum result. Nevertheless, on a matter as technical and detailed as leaving the EU, we cannot view that referendum as anything more than a vote in principle. Now that a Withdrawal Agreement has been produced, and given the difficulty and time it has taken to get to an extremely poor deal, there isn’t sufficient consensus amongst MPs. A second referendum on the actual deal, with the option to remain in the EU as the only viable option should one not want said deal, is the only sensible course. As much as I would lament a vote for any deal to leave the EU (I don’t believe a ‘good deal’ exists), who could argue against a referendum result where the electorate was now informed on what Brexit would look like? Providing the respective campaigns were transparent (the Leave campaign in the 2016 referendum was riddled with lies, scaremongering and propaganda), it would be a fair and democractic outcome of a problem that MPs cannot solve themselves. This is Labour’s Brexit stance and one that I support. I just don’t think they need to be in power for it to be effected. Let Brexit be sorted beforehand so a new Labour government, should there be one, can focus on policies that will shape Britain for the better and begin the healing of the divisions that Brexit has brought about throughout the country. An election, that Johnson is gambling can be portrayed as Parliament vs the People, doesn’t solve Brexit and likely presents further cracks in British politics and society. Johnson will not be the Prime Minister for much longer as he too has drunk from the poisoned chalice that is Brexit, and has done so with an almighty swig in his supreme arrogance. An election removing him therefore doesn’t solve Brexit. However, a referendum, that returns the final and irrefutable decision on Brexit to the electorate, can."
Medium.com,Society,Green is the New Normal in German Politics,World,https://medium.com/breakthrough1/green-is-the-new-normal-in-german-politics-eff2059cea8?source=topic_page---------209------------------1," “G
reen is the new black.” That was the headline that Foreign Policy Magazine ran to cover the success of the German Greens in 2011. Back then, the party was experiencing a historic surge. Polls were putting it at 28 per cent. The German press christened it the new people’s party (“die neue Volkspartei”), and pundits argued for the need for a Green chancellor candidate in the 2013 election. But the hype proved short-lived. Six months later, the Greens’ polling success had halved to 14 per cent. By the time of the 2013 federal elections, the Greens were back in single digits, gaining a disappointing 8.4 per cent. The following years saw support remain at similar levels with the Greens receiving 8.9 per cent in the 2017 federal election. Now the tide has turned again. The Green wave that hit this year’s European elections shook German politics. With 20.5 per cent, the Greens surpassed the Social Democrats (SPD), becoming the second strongest party behind the Christian Democrats (CDU). In the European Parliament, Germany’s 21 Green MEPs now make up one of the largest national party delegations. Since this electoral triumph, support for the Greens has continued to rise. Green membership in Germany has reached 90 000, a historic high, and the Greens scored their best-ever results in the latest regional elections in the eastern German Länder of Brandenburg and Saxony. The Greens and the Conservatives are neck and neck. In June 2019, the Greens were the leading party in the polls with 27 per cent, followed by the CDU at 25 per cent. While the numbers have recently inversed, the Greens remain strong and have displaced the Social Democrats as leaders of the progressive camp. This new state of play begs many questions. How sustainable is this trajectory? Is this simply a case of 2011 redux, or are we seeing a fundamental realignment of the political landscape? What are the drivers behind this shake-up? And is this shift down to the strength of the Greens or rather the weakness of the other parties? The surge in support for the German Greens took off shortly after the 2017 federal election. As the far-right AfD party (which scored a worryingly high 12.6 per cent) was excluded from coalition talks, only two governing constellations were arithmetically possible: yet another grand coalition between the Conservatives and a much-diminished Social Democrats, or a so-called Jamaica coalition, named after the colours of the Jamaican flag, which would bring together the Conservatives, the Liberals, and the Greens. Having suffered a historically poor result, the Social Democrats (scoring 20.5 per cent in the election compared to a high of over 40 per cent in their heyday) immediately announced their intention to lead the opposition in the German Bundestag, leaving no option on the table other than Jamaica coalition talks. These talks were a watershed moment for the Greens. First, it brought the party together. A negotiating team of 14 Green politicians was created which successfully represented the party’s membership and its broad spectrum of political constituencies. Second, the Greens adopted a pragmatic, reasonable approach to the negotiations, boosting their appeal. They fought hard for their programme but were also willing to compromise when necessary.[1] This was in stark contrast to the Liberals who earnt much criticism for abruptly walking out of the coalition negotiations. This chain of events sparked a new dynamic. Ordinary people began to realise that the Greens have come a long way from their anti-establishment beginnings to become a responsible political actor. The German Greens have also shown that they can govern. At the time of writing, they are in government in nine Länder regions in coalitions ranging from green-black in Baden-Württemberg, where the Greens are the leading governing party with the CDU as a junior partner, to black-green, red-green, red-red-green, black-red-green, red-yellow-green, and black-yellow-green. “Ordinary people began to realise that the Greens have come a long way from their anti-establishment beginnings to become a responsible political actor.” This new dynamic continued with a change in the party’s internal structures. New leaders were elected with Robert Habeck and Annalena Baerbock. Both are experienced, charismatic politicians, but they are new to the federal scene and embody a younger, more modern generation. Both chairs have made efforts to transcend the traditional cleavage within the party between the Fundi (left-wing/eco-socialist) and Realo (‘pragmatic realist’) wings. They have ended the duplication of office structures — with each party co-chair representing either the Fundis or the Realos and running their own offices — and instead used the resources to strengthen the think-tank capacity of the party, hiring a range of policy advisors. This has strengthened the intellectual and policy capabilities of the leadership. And they have used this to good effect, publishing new policy papers which have influenced German public discourse on issues such as social security. The change in public discourse and media coverage has also was worked in favour of the Greens. Sustainability issues have become big news. Over the past months, climate change — from discussions on a carbon tax to forest fires in Brazil — has been a headline issue, largely thanks to the Fridays for Future climate protesters. In a number of polls and surveys, more than 40 per cent of respondents replied that climate change is the most pressing issue of our time, displacing immigration. The German Green Party has made the best of a fortuitous situation. But the new political developments in Germany go much deeper than this. The political landscape is in the grips of a fundamental restructuring. For other EU countries, this is nothing new. The old, established parties have been gradually losing support, with new parties emerging and challenging the status quo. In France, for example, the traditional balance has been smashed away with the more than 100-year old Parti socialiste sliding into irrelevance, while in Italy the Five Star Movement, founded in 2009, became the largest party in the Italian Parliament in the 2018 election. Germany has seen a similar trend; it has just developed more gradually. Back in the 1970s, the Volksparteien — the CDU and the SPD — would together take 90 per cent of the vote. Only three parties were represented in the Bundestag. Fast forward to 2019 and their share has shrunk to around 40 per cent, with the number of political parties in the Bundestag having doubled to six. The binding power that the Volksparteien held over large swathes of the electorate has dwindled.[2] The Volksparteien can no longer represent the Volk because the Volk is no longer the same as it was back in the 1970s and 1980s. The 20th century was the mass age, defined by mass production and consumption, mass parties and politics. But the 21st century is the individual age. Society has become individualised and more diverse. As Dr Reckwitz highlights in The Society of Singularities (Die Gesellschaft der Singularitäten), “late modernity celebrates the singular.” The future belongs to a politics that bridges divides and solves contradictions. As German sociologist Armin Nassehi notes, the classical Volksparteien used to stand for one of two camps: “Capital and labour, Christian Democrats and Social Democrats. That was a stable distinction. Today you can’t build a Volkspartei on that anymore.” As interests, positions, and opinions within society diverge, the Volksparteien struggle to cover a broadening spectrum. The CDU and the SPD have failed to understand the transformation that has gripped society. As a result, they have not been able to articulate a narrative that brings together society’s disparate currents, a narrative that speaks to the individual and brings them into a collective. Robert Habeck spoke of that challenge in a Green European Journal interview back in 2017. “Politics is lagging behind…we have to find a language, a form of politics, that doesn’t try to reverse the degree of individualisation people have already long had in their lives, but accepts it while bringing it into a new form of collectivity.” The CDU and SPD lack this vision for the future and are mired in internal conflict. The SPD is still grappling with the Hartz IV social reforms it passed in 2003, which made it more difficult for people to claim unemployment benefits, and the CDU remains split over immigration. The former big two have also lost their way because of their tendency to define themselves in opposition to each other. It is hard to keep up a binary system, notionally capital against labour, when governing together is the norm rather than the exception (2005–2009, 2013–2017, and 2017 onwards). A terrible thing has befallen these parties — they have been deprived of their classical enemy.[3] It is certainly questionable whether there is a place at all in the 21st century for parties that define themselves according to a binary logic. If the 21st century is the ‘individual age’, then the right approach is not a binary logic, that defines itself in opposition to something, but a complementary logic that connects differences. Such a logic builds bridges between individuals and interest groups — between the young and the old, between urban and rural interests, between immigrants and non-immigrants, between those who welcome societal changes and those that are wary, between the interests of economy and ecology. The future belongs to a politics that bridges divides and solves contradictions. The German Greens have understood this and have started to pursue such an approach. They have established an economic advisory council that includes Germany’s top CEOs to discuss how to bridge economic and environmental interests. When it comes to migration and refugee policy the party’s keywords are ‘humanity’ and ‘order’ — ‘humanity’ for taking in refugees from war-plagued regions, and ‘order’ for sending back those who don’t fulfil the necessary criteria and are rather economic migrants. In the field of economic policy, they have tried to bridge the divide between saving and investing, publishing a position paper in which they support limiting public debt but also want to reform the German debt brake to allow for more investment. Annalena Baerbock and Robert Habeck have labelled this new Green approach ‘radical realism’. Futurologist Daniel Dettling has similarly described the German Greens as a new type of Volkspartei, a future party (Zukunftspartei) that brings opposites together: diversity and Heimat, security and freedom, economy and ecology. In this context, the Greens are becoming a kind of quantum party. Whereas traditional computers store and calculate via binary digits, which can only be either 0 or 1, quantum computers run on quantum bits, qubits, which can be in a superposition of both. Peter Unfried, a renowned journalist for the left-leaning newspaper die tageszeitung, has similarly discussed how the German Greens have evolved from being a party for “minorities… to being a party for the big picture.”[4] The German Greens have also enjoyed success at appealing to different political groups. Robert Habeck speaks to many left-leaning voters, while Winfried Kretschmann, the Green Minister-President of Baden-Württemberg who argues for a new kind of conservatism, appeals to more conservative voters. The fact that different political camps are attracted to the Green message highlights how far environmentalism has become its own system of ideas. In this context, as highlighted by Reinhard Olschanski, Greens now embody modernity’s fourth political idea — environmentalism — next to liberalism, conservatism, and socialism. But it is not only the Greens that have changed, society has too. As awareness of sustainability issues has risen, both sides have come closer to each other. While the Greens have often been portrayed as being in opposition to mainstream society, they have come to increasingly resemble each other. The German Greens have become more mainstream, and the mainstream has become more Green. Peter Unfried notes how the Greens have become a party “that ordinary people can vote for” while Robert Habeck claims that “Green is the new normal”. In this context, the Greens are tapping much more into the zeitgeist than other parties. Unsurprisingly, their largest group of voters hails from the younger generations. In the 2019 European elections, 34 per cent of the age group under 25 voted for the German Greens. In fact, among the under 60s, the Greens received the highest share of the vote compared to other parties. It seems unlikely that the current upheaval in German politics and the accompanying ‘Green hype’ is just a temporary phenomenon. Instead, it seems that the Greens are giving a much needed direction in a time of uncertainty. They have taken on the leadership of the progressive camp and are now considered as responsible agents of change — with that comes responsibility and new challenges. The German Greens are taking a unique position by pursuing a complementary political logic that tries to bridge divides and solve contradictions. The question is — can they keep up that approach and will it succeed, or will the Greens end up being caught up in and crushed by the multiple contradictions? Is society ready for such a balancing approach or will the Greens make everybody unhappy? Which policies suit this complementary political logic? It is easier to advance a general political approach than it is to make policy recommendations affecting people’s interests. This last point is particularly relevant to the upcoming 2021 federal election. Should the Greens make it into government, expectations will be incredibly high. Meeting them might be difficult in a coalition where the partners might block progressive change. That could lead to a situation where some Green voters might eventually ask whether the party has lost too much of its colour. Political change also affects how political parties cooperate. There used to be a clear left-right divide: the CDU/CSU would try to form a majority with the Liberals, and the SPD with the Greens. But that binary system no longer works. Germany may well be entering a phase in which a range of similarly polling, mid-sized parties will require new forms of coalition such as Jamaica (CDU/CSU, Greens and Liberals) or Kenya (CDU/CSU, Greens and SPD). We could be witnessing the ‘dutchification’ of the German political system, whereby diverse governing coalitions become the norm. In such a setting, parties will have to be open for new thinking, approaches, and partners. That will require building bridges, compromise, and responsibility — the very approach currently embodied by the German Greens. — This article was first published at the Green European Journal.

ife is journey, not a destination”, a widely misattributed quote goes. The same might be said about the interminable Brexit process. And just like life can be more interesting if it is treated as a journey, so Brexit delivers some interesting observations, in particular regarding some the decisions that were made along the way. Can we draw some lessons from this? Of course we can. Let us start at the beginning: prime minister David Cameron’s decision to hold the referendum. Was that a good decision? Leavers and Remainers might well give different answers to this question. But the quality of a decision should not really depend on whether one likes the outcome. We must dig a bit deeper, and try to keep an impartial viewpoint.* Strictly speaking, Cameron had no choice: the EU membership referendum was a Conservative Party manifesto commitment in the 2015 election. But while the government had a moral obligation to hold it, it was free to choose how to execute it. When you decide to pursue a course of action that has two very different outcomes, it is advisable to have a plan for either of them. The plan, in case the electorate decided the UK should remain a member of the EU was simple: business as usual. The plan, in the opposite case, was… well, what was it? History shows that David Cameron’s government had none. It had chosen not to develop even an outline plan of what to do if Leave won the referendum. Few people would challenge the idea that, with a considered route from EU membership to non-membership, taking into account the considerable complexity and the wide range of issues that needed resolving, the UK would now not be in the present mess. How could it be that there was no plan? There are several cognitive and behavioural tendencies which, unchecked, can collectively lead to neglect of one of the possible outcomes. One is unrealistic optimism (also known as optimism bias). If you believe that things will go your way, you are less likely to make plans for the opposite case. David Cameron (who campaigned for Remain) appeared pretty confident Remain would win, bolstered by the negative economic forecasts for the various Brexit scenarios considered at the time. This also hints at a second kind of blind spot: the belief that others, by and large, think like we do, and that what matters to us matters to them too (sometimes called the false consensus effect). If you focus only on what is material to you, you risk becoming oblivious to anything else — until it is too late to do anything about it. The fundamental case for Remain was based on economics, but the Leave side played to the electorate’s emotions with messages around regaining sovereignty and “taking back control” of the UK’s trade, laws and borders, and that ended up gaining the upper hand. Finally, Mr Cameron had no skin in the game. He manifestly deflected any responsibility for delivering Brexit by promptly announcing, within hours of the result being declared on 24 thJune 2016 that he was going to quit before the autumn: “I do not think it would be right for me to try to be the captain that steers our country to its next destination”. On 11 thJuly, when his successor was known, he (while humming a jolly tune) declared he would resign two days later, leaving Theresa May to come up with a plan. If it doesn’t matter whether you have a plan, why make the effort? Theresa May was a lukewarm Remainer, who would now have to bring Brexit to a good end. Perhaps to assert that she could be trusted with the job, she dialled the political rhetoric to 11, making ‘Brexit means Brexit’ her motto. She talked tough during her first conference as Conservative party leader and prime minister, opting for the most extreme interpretation of the referendum outcome: out of the Customs Union (“not going to be a ‘Norway’ model”), out of the Single Market (“not going to be a ‘Switzerland’ model”), and out of the jurisdiction of the European Court of Justice. She repeated these red lines at the famous Lancaster House speech. Some momentous decisions may involve principles and convictions, as well as material costs and gains. When you choose to let the former (here in the shape of political ideology) dominate your approach, you run two key risks, especially if you do so without fully grasping the reality within which your principled demands are supposed to be met. The first one is that through such an uncompromising stance, you are overlooking the cost, i.e. what you will need to sacrifice to deliver your principled promises. The second one is that you clash with reality, and there is no possible outcome that meets all your demands. And that did indeed happen to Mrs May. She discovered that the Good Friday agreement was incompatible with the exit of the Customs Union (CU), and so she was forced to propose the compromise of ‘temporarily’ remaining in the CU as a backstop. She made three consecutive unsuccessful attempts to get sufficient support in parliament for her withdrawal deal. The determination (some might say stubbornness) with which she acted is also not necessarily a strength in decision-making. If your resolve for a certain approach is unconditional, then you risk overcommitting and ultimately — as in Mrs May’s case — heading for failure. Theresa May’s government initially intended to start the exit process (by invoking Article 50 of the EU Treaty) without involving parliament. However, a famous case before the Supreme Court led to a ruling that an explicit Act of Parliament was necessary to authorize this invocation. Unfortunately, parliament did not use this opportunity to reflect on what would happen if no deal could be agreed between the EU and the UK, or if such a deal were rejected by the European or the UK parliament individually. Instead, it promptly approved the invocation with a large majority (498 votes to 114 — at the time the Conservatives had 330 seats, so 168 members of the opposition voted in favour as well). But by doing so, they (unwittingly?) transformed “no deal is better than a bad deal” from rhetoric into reality. If there was no approved deal two years after the invocation, the UK would leave the EU without a deal, by legal default. The proverb ‘sin in haste, repent at leisure’ comes to mind (although the parliamentary shenanigans over the last year can hardly be described as leisurely). Had MPs considered this inevitable outcome before approving the invocation, and ensured back then that “no deal” should never be on the table, they would not be in the predicament they find themselves in now. Why didn’t they? There are a few possible explanations. MPs wanted to just get on with things (a case of action bias), and may have judged that the two years afforded by the Article 50 process were ample to achieve a good exit deal (a case of planning fallacy). Both of these might have reinforced motivated reasoning, when we actually engage in conscious reasoning, but with our motives and desires unduly influencing the process. Then, like now, most parliamentarians rejected a no-deal exit, and therefore reasoned that the government’s negotiations would — of course — ensure a good deal in the end. Motivated reasoning is a particularly pernicious cognitive problem: when the undesired becomes the unthinkable, beware. Boris Johnson has only been serving as prime minister for a few months, but he has already clocked up several decisions that can be considered questionable. He has a tendency to bullshit, in the philosophical sense: not caring about the truth and only seeking to impress (I can thoroughly recommend Harry Frankfurt’s On Bullshit). For example, during the Tory leadership race in June he claimed the chances of “no deal” were “a million-to-one against”, but in early September he admitted that “there was a high chance of a no-deal Brexit”. Bullshitting, and having to backtrack on earlier bragging is not exactly reputation-enhancing. More serious were his choices to prorogue parliament and to kick out 21 Conservative MPs who had voted against the government in order to block a no-deal Brexit. The first decision made him an untrustworthy person in the eyes of many MPs, and undoubtedly fuelled their determination to prevent a no-deal Brexit. The second led to his losing his already precarious majority in parliament, making it very hard for him to gain the approvals he needed to make good on his pledge to “leave the EU by 31 October, do or die”. Impulsive actions can feel rewarding in the moment, but you risk overlooking the detrimental longer-term consequences. But perhaps the most instructive insight comes from the preoccupation with the 31 October deadline. Of course, sometimes deadlines are imposed upon us, and in such cases indecision and dithering are best avoided. In this case, however, the deadline is self-imposed. There is a genuine trade-off to be made between a no-deal exit on this date, and a deal at a later date. Sure, many people are fed up with the Brexit process, but are they willing to tolerate a no-deal Brexit, especially as an exit on 31 October is by no means the end of Brexit? Once the UK is out of the EU, the negotiations about the future trade arrangements start, and they are likely to take years. Avoiding a delay by making a quick decision can feel very salient in the moment, to the point of being prepared to do so ‘at all costs’. These costs, as well as the consequences of making a hurried decision look vague and distant. But these consequences will often still be felt when the delay is long forgotten. Time pressure distorts our judgement, and gives more weight to emotions, beliefs and ideology, to the detriment of deliberate, calculated reasoning. Let us, above all, remember that the decisions listed here were made by humans, just like us. We may find it easy to see how, and perhaps why, they were flawed, from the comfortable position of a bystander with hindsight. Rather than blame them, we ought to recognize how we, too, are liable to make the same mistakes, if we are not very careful indeed. (*): Does it matter whether the conjectures in this article are entirely accurate? Not all that much: as long as they are plausible explanations for the flaws in these decisions, they can help us spot problems and make better decisions."
Medium.com,Society,Who Wants to Destroy the World?,World,https://onezero.medium.com/who-wants-to-destroy-the-world-e7571c66397?source=topic_page---------211------------------1," or most of human history, the question of who would want to destroy the world didn’t much matter. The reason, of course, was that that no individual or group of humans could demolish civilization or cause our extinction. Our ancestors just didn’t have the tools: no amount of spears, arrows, swords, or catapults would have enabled them — even the most bloodthirsty and misanthropic — to have inflicted harm in every corner of the world. This changed with the invention of the atomic bomb. While scholars often identify 1945 as the year that human self-annihilation became possible, a more accurate date is 1948 or 1949, since this is when the United States stockpiled enough nuclear weapons (about 100) to have initiated a hemisphere-spanning “nuclear winter.” (See this work in progress for why I’m focusing on 100 nuclear weapons as a threshold.) A nuclear winter occurs when soot from burning cities significantly reduces the amount of sunlight reaching Earth’s surface for a period of months or years, thereby causing temperatures to plummet and famines to ensue. Quite unsettlingly, it wasn’t until the 1980s — decades after we had enough nukes to blot out the sun — that the nuclear winter phenomenon was first identified, although lingering questions remain even today. Thanks to new technologies, nonstate actors such as terrorist groups and lone wolves are getting in on the action, too, and might be more willing than national governments to push the proverbial doomsday button. The U.S. monopoly on world-ending power didn’t last long: by 1953, the Soviet Union had likewise expanded to 100 weapons. Now there were two nations on Earth that could obliterate civilization. But again, this didn’t last very long. The United Kingdom joined the club of potential world-enders around 1962, China around 1971, and France around 1973, with Israel, Pakistan, and India becoming members of this club in the 2010s. Hence, in less than a century, the world went from containing zero actors capable of unilaterally destroying the world to eight. This is a scary situation. Unfortunately, it’s getting worse — much worse. The reason is that states are no longer the only players in the game. Thanks to new technologies, nonstate actors such as terrorist groups and lone wolves are getting in on the action, too, and they might be a lot more willing than national governments to push the proverbial doomsday button. My own research suggests that the percentage of people who would push a doomsday button, if it were placed within finger’s reach, is fairly small, but the absolute number is unacceptably high. Even a quick Google search seems to affirm this. Consider the following answers, taken from different online sources, to the question of whether one would destroy the world if one could (quoting typos and all): “Yes. It is obvious that we gain nothing from living and there is a huge amount of human suffering that I find quite unjustifiable. The complete annihilation of the human race would be the greatest act of compassion ever.” Reddit.com “Yes, we suck as a human race.” Reddit.com “Yes. Because you all are assholes. And this is not a joke I would love to push something that ends humanity. I always thought about it and now there is the question about that topic and I am happy to say I want you all dead everyone single one of you fuckers. Please give me the chance to wipe out humanity.” Reddit.com “My view is that Mankind is a plague… I vote to destroy mankind and let nature start over.” Debate.org “The human animal is the only evil animal in the animal kingdom. We destroy everything… I email the president weekly and beg him to push the button and stop the madness already.” Debate.org “In the short time we’ve been on this planet, humans have already destroyed so much. We destroy ecosystems, and kill off entire species of animals… The world would be better off without humans as a whole.” Debate.org Of course, saying something definitely isn’t the same as doing it. Even so, can we be fully certain that not a single person in the world would attempt to follow through on his or her annihilatory fantasies? One way to approach this question is to look for historical examples of groups or people who both expressed a desire to kill everyone and committed some terrible act or acts of violence. The combination of these two phenomena implies that such people would be willing to act on their omnicidal (meaning killing everyone) impulses and willingly, perhaps even eagerly, push a doomsday button. So are there such examples? Unfortunately, yes. Lots of them. And they seem to fall into a handful of basic categories. Eric Harris mused, “I think I would want us to go extinct,” to which he added, “I have a goal to destroy as much as possible… I want to burn the world” and “I just wish I could actually DO this instead of just DREAM about it all.” Consider the disturbing case of Eric Harris, the psychopathic mastermind behind the 1999 Columbine High School massacre. His journal is full of all sorts of genuinely horrifying, ghoulish fantasies. On several occasions, he explicitly mentions his burning desire to extinguish humanity. At one point. he writes: “If you recall your history the Nazis came up with a ‘final solution’ to the Jewish problem. Kill them all. Well, in case you haven’t figured it out yet, I say ‘KILL MANKIND’ no one should survive.” Elsewhere, Harris mused, “I think I would want us to go extinct,” to which he added, “I have a goal to destroy as much as possible… I want to burn the world” and “I just wish I could actually DO this instead of just DREAM about it all.” When Harris and Dylan Klebold, his partner in crime, perpetrated their massacre in Columbine, they were equipped with garden-variety weapons. Dangerous to be sure, but hardly capable of “burning the world.” Can there be any doubt, though, that if Harris — who was relatively intelligent and liked math and science — had had access to some of the advanced technologies of tomorrow, he would have, when committing suicide, tried to go out with a much bigger bang? The Columbine massacre had a huge influence on later rampage shooters, some of whom also dreamt of omnicide. For example, in 2007, an 18-year-old Finnish student named Pekka-Eric Auvinen shot several people at his school, which he also tried to burn down. Like Harris, he wrote about “a final solution” as “the death of the entire human race,” and described his massacre as “an operation against humanity with the purpose of killing as many people as possible.” Yet another rampage shooter from Finland, Matti Saari, wrote in his suicide note, “I hate the human race, I hate mankind, I hate the whole world, and I want to kill as many people as possible.” Then, of course, there was Elliot Rodger, the incel psychopath who killed seven people and injured 14 in the 2014 Isla Vista killings. In a video shot one day before the rampage, he said in no uncertain terms: “I hate all of you. Humanity is a disgusting, wretched, depraved species. If I had it in my power, I would stop at nothing to reduce every single one of you to mountains of skulls and rivers of blood. And rightfully so. You deserve to be annihilated. And I’ll give that to you.” School shooters and other lone wolves have idiosyncratic motives, such as a misanthropic hatred of humanity, or a desire to retaliate against women for perceived romantic and sexual slights. Together, though, they comprise a relatively cohesive category of omnicidal actors, and a relatively unpredictable one at that. Another type of omnicidal actor comes in the form of apocalyptic terrorists who believe that to save the world, it must first be destroyed. ISIS, arguably the largest and richest terrorist group in history, is a paradigm case. While some members of ISIS probably didn’t hold apocalyptic beliefs, the leadership most certainly did — and they made strategic decisions based on these beliefs. The man who essentially founded ISIS, Abu Musab al-Zarqawi, believed that Islam’s version of Armageddon was about to unfold around the small Syrian town of Dabiq. Hence, the name of the group’s propaganda magazine, Dabiq. After the U.S. military killed al-Zarqawi in 2006, leadership of ISIS transferred to Abu Ayyub al-Masri, a fevered apocalypticist who insisted that the Islamic end-of-days messianic figure, the “Mahdi,” was about to appear in Iraq. Like al-Zarqawi, he based his strategy on his apocalyptic belief — and it backfired. He soon met his end at the hands of Western forces. Both of these individuals really believed that the end was nigh, and that it was their duty to use violence — catastrophic violence, to be more specific — to bring about the apocalypse. ISIS members talked about acquiring nuclear weapons, releasing deadly pathogens, and building dirty bombs. I personally haven’t spoken to a single terrorism scholar who doesn’t think that ISIS would have gleefully pushed a “destroy-the-world” button, especially if Western forces were marching toward Dabiq. But ISIS is far from the only apocalyptic group. Famously, the doomsday cult Aum Shinrikyo attempted to trigger Armageddon by releasing sarin in the Tokyo subway in 1995. Here in the U.S., more than a dozen hate groups subscribe to Christian Identity, an apocalyptic worldview that endorses the use of catastrophic violence as a means of triggering a “race war” that will initiate the end of the world. And one of the bloodiest conflicts in human history, the Taiping Rebellion, involved an apocalyptic movement called the “Taiping Heavenly Kingdom.” This was led by a man named Hong Xiuquan, who believed that he was the brother of Jesus Christ, “commissioned by the Lord of Heaven to slay the devil-demons (Manchus) whose rule had brought ruin to China.” A final type of omnicidal actor lingers within the outermost fringe of radical environmentalist, anarcho-primitivist, and Neo-Luddite ideologies. Ted Kaczynski, better known as the Unabomber, provides an example par excellence. Beginning in 1978, Kaczynski perpetrated numerous domestic terrorist attacks, killing three people and injuring 23 others. A former UC Berkeley mathematics professor and Harvard alumnus, Kaczynski didn’t wish for humanity to go extinct. Rather, he wanted to trigger a global revolution against industrial society, with the ultimate goal of causing its collapse. Kaczynski ultimately didn’t care whether his revolution would cause people to die, since in his utilitarian calculus the ends would justify the means. As Kaczynski wrote in 1995: “This revolution may or may not make use of violence; it may be sudden or it may be a relatively gradual process spanning a few decades. Its object will be to overthrow not governments but the economic and technological basis of the present society.” In contrast, other actors in this category have explicitly embraced pro-extinction convictions. For example, the Gaia Liberation Front (GLF), an ecoterrorist group, holds as their mission “the total liberation of the Earth, which can be accomplished only through the extinction of the Humans as a species.” In advocating this, they argue that “if any Humans survive, they may start the whole thing over again. Our policy is to take no chances.” How might they accomplish their omnicidal aims? GLF contends that bioengineering is “the specific technology for doing the job right of annihilating humanity — and it’s something that could be done by just one person with the necessary expertise and access to the necessary equipment.” They continue: “…genetically engineered viruses… have the advantage of attacking only the target species. To complicate the search for a cure or a vaccine, and as insurance against the possibility that some Humans might be immune to a particular virus, several different viruses could be released (with provision being made for the release of a second round after the generals and the politicians had come out of their shelters).” Technologies such as gene drives, digital-to-biological converters, and CRISPR-Cas9 are making it increasingly feasible to synthesize designer pathogens that could be far more devastating than anything found in nature. This parallels an anonymous article in the Earth First! Journal, published in 1989, meaning that this idea has been around for a while: “Contributions are urgently solicited for scientific research on a species specific virus that will eliminate Homo shiticus from the planet. Only an absolutely species specific virus should be set loose. Otherwise it will be just another technological fix. Remember, Equal Rights for All Other Species.” While the most radical fringe of the environmentalist movement has avoided the limelight in recent years, some experts, such as the terrorism scholar Frances Flannery, expect a resurgence as climate and biodiversity crises worsen. This poses an obvious danger in a world replete with bullets and bombs; but it poses an existential threat in a world of cheap and easy gene editing. Technologies such as gene drives, digital-to-biological converters, and CRISPR-Cas9 are making it increasingly feasible to synthesize designer pathogens that could be far more devastating than anything found in nature. Are there any solutions to the problems posed by virus-toting omnicidal maniacs? One hard-to-avoid — and completely terrifying — answer is mass surveillance. This could take the form of what the philosopher Jeremy Bentham called a “panopticon,” whereby the state (perhaps run by computer programs designed specifically to govern — a form of government called “algocracy”) monitors every action of its citizens. The obvious danger is that this could collapse into tyrannical totalitarianism, which itself constitutes an existential risk. Another possibility involves what the science fiction writer, David Brin, dubs the “transparent society.” This would make surveillance egalitarian, so to speak: everyone would be able to see what everyone else is doing all the time, thereby enabling those watched to watch the watchers. Brin doesn’t argue that this is an ideal situation, only that it’s a better situation than one in which the state has all the power. Perhaps a total loss of privacy is the cost of existential security. Alternatively, I have previously claimed that, in order to reduce the risks posed by malicious agents like those mentioned above, society should prioritize mitigating climate change and ecological destruction. Both phenomena are threat multipliers and threat intensifiers, which means that they’ll introduce new problems while making old problems even worse. Better environmental policies would lower the threat posed by ecoterrorists, whose fundamental complaint — “Humans are stupidly destroying the biosphere” — is scientifically accurate. Such policies would also decrease the number and severity of natural disasters, which could fertilize apocalyptic fervor among religious extremists. As the terrorism scholar Mark Juergensmeyer has remarked, “radical times will breed radical religion,” a hypothesis apparently supported by the rise of ISIS during the Syrian civil war. Moving forward, people who care about human survival need to think hard not just about the various technologies that will become available, but about the types of actors who might try to use these technologies for catastrophic ill. The future of the human race could quite literally depend on it."
Medium.com,Society,My Complicated Feelings Toward Traditional Ethiopian Wear,World,https://zora.medium.com/my-complicated-feelings-toward-traditional-ethiopian-wear-f7686eb943e1?source=topic_page---------212------------------1," henever I have any special event, I normally consult my personal fashion police, the Ethiopian diaspora women in my life, about what to wear. But this time, anticipating the formal and informal events that I will attend to promote my debut novel, Daughters of Silence, I don’t consult with them just yet. My dilemma is a lot more specific. As an immigrant Ethiopian author who’s written a novel set primarily in Ethiopia and featuring an Ethiopian family, I’m actually trying to shake off the feeling that I should wear one specific dress to an author event: habesha kemis. It’s a loose, white cotton dress with colorful embroidery and cross motifs around the neckline, hem, wrists, and down the front. Over the years, I’ve seen enough diaspora Ethiopian and Eritrean women authors wearing this dress to major events — even Tiffany Haddish wore one to the Oscars most recently and visibly — that I feel I should also represent. Should — the bane of many a hyphenated person’s existence when it comes to negotiating their relationship to their origin culture. Although I have become better at resisting the “should” over 27 years living in Europe and North America at key life moments — baptisms, weddings, holidays, and now my literary events — I feel pressured to represent, which always means wearing habesha kemis."
Medium.com,Society,Freedom and Fried Chicken,World,https://medium.com/@aesilk/freedom-and-fried-chicken-ae520ff13eef?source=topic_page---------213------------------1," Inside the hermit kingdom of North Korea people risk their lives for a chance at ‘normal’ I had just graduated from college when I was introduced to the most unusual opportunity to teach North Korean defectors at an alternative school in Seoul. Bansuk School takes its name from Kim Il Sung’s mother and means ‘solid rock’ in Korean. It is located in the heart of Gangnam, the epitome of Seoul’s extravagant and consumerist culture. I looked around the classroom, wedged between students stealthily checking their Samsung Galaxy smart phones and a bookcase filled with college entrance exam textbooks. During recess I asked one of my students what he liked most about being in South Korea. I expected an answer like ‘freedom’ but after a serious pause, he sheepishly said “fried chicken.” I laughed and told him that we should go get BBQ chicken after class some time. In college I had spent several semesters doing extensive research on the interplay of international humanitarian law and the human rights crisis in North Korea. As I progressed through my final semester, my research led me to believe that the case for North Korean refugees, although only a tip of the iceberg, is a strong case founded in international law that could act as a gateway to the fundamental human rights issues of North Korea and ultimately help the North Korean people achieve their liberty in our lifetime. The estimated number of 50,000 North Korean refugees hiding in China bears no connection to the regime. They are the people, the real face of North Korea, and the driving force of change. Yet the reality is that North Korean refugees in China live under constant fear of deportation which puts them at risk of extreme punishments including torture, detainment in political prison camps, and even execution. At least one out of every two North Korean defectors in South Korea testified to having re-escaped after repatriation. So as I stepped into the classroom with a dozen North Korean students sitting in folding chairs, some with deep wrinkles revealing the trace of time, I couldn’t help but divide the room and think that statistically at least half the students had almost lost their lives to have the chance to be where they were that day. I would learn later that one of my students only escaped the brutal beatings from North Korean prison guards because he was too small to be stomped on. A lot of my perspective has changed after meeting the North Korean people outside of papers and charts. I no longer seek to merely classify North Korean defectors in China as refugees according to the 1951 Refugee Convention based on their well-founded fear of persecution; nor do I advocate the need to politically concede to China’s categorization of North Korean defectors as economic migrants, undeserving of refugee status. Instead, I realize that the North Korean people are both refugees and economic migrants — victims of enforced poverty — and wonder whether economic harm should also be a basis for refugee status. I still remember an expression that a North Korean refugee used to describe himself. The term roughly translates to “people who lost phases of life” in English. Life has many different phases: a time to learn how to walk, a time when one begins to read and write, a rebellious phase for teenagers, mid-life crisis…etc. People develop the capacity to become members of the society by going through the different phases of life. But what happens if you miss out? What happens if you cannot learn to read, write, and speak when you are supposed to be actively communicating with the rest of the society? What happens if you have no food to eat when your body needs to grow? How would it affect you if you miss out on human affection, security, and stability during the most important phases of your life? Most of the things in life that I took for granted were privileges that my North Korean counterparts could never dream of having in real life. As opposed to the valiant pursuers of freedom that the public remembers from literature, the North Koreans I meet every day are concerned with what they eat and their starving families back home. I recognize that our society has put a higher price tag on ideals such as freedom when words such as “famine” and “future” are equally significant. South Korea’s homogenous culture silently pressures North Korean defectors to lose their unique identity, but I found myself inspiring them to be proud of their life stories and untainted way of thinking. I wanted to convey to the North Korean people that I understood and empathized with their innate human desire to strive and fight for a better life. Aside from having a long deceased grandfather who was born and raised in Pyongyang, I have no personal connections to North Korea. I have only identified myself as a North Korean once in my life in first grade in French school when I thought that ‘Nord’ meant ‘South’ and kept insisting that I came from ‘Coree du Nord’ to my teacher’s confusion and surprise. But having spent my childhood in multiple developing countries while constantly traveling with my parents for their work, I understand the difficulty of starting a home away from home. On the road in Vietnam, Thailand, and South Africa not only have I soaked in the details of my new surroundings but I have also committed myself to succeed in life to help solve real-world problems that I have witnessed. The world needs bright thinkers and active doers, who have the ability to remain intellectually curious and compassionate, autonomous yet collegial. After having shared countless plates of fried chicken with North Koreans, I can no longer just shrug my shoulders over the fact that some people remain in rubble because they were never given the chance to succeed in life. Though I can only listen to a defector’s memory of spending indefinite months at an International Detention Center in Thailand, I know that I cannot remain distant or unaffected. At the end of the day we are all the same human beings who find joy in the simplest things in life such as sharing a hearty meal with loved ones. The freedom that all human beings fundamentally pursue is the freedom to life — not just to live, but to live to the fullest. No one should be denied their means of sustaining a living by circumstances they have no control over."
Medium.com,Society,Killing the Kurds,World,https://medium.com/@joshuashawnmichaelhehe/killing-the-kurds-f9676ef48ffa?source=topic_page---------214------------------1," The Kurds are a very ancient people with an incredible heritage and culture. They are from the Persian side of the Middle Eastern ethnic tree, not the Arabian side, but the Kurds became a distinct group in their own right. Millennia ago, they were native to a mountainous region of Western Asia known as Kurdistan, which spanned what is now southeastern Turkey, northwestern Iran, northern Iraq, and northern Syria. Unfortunately, over time, they were forced out of their homeland by various different invaders, and they have been trying to reestablish themselves ever since. As a result of this, the religion of the Kurds has changed a great deal throughout history, going from animism all the way to monotheism. This has resulted in what is now a primarily Muslim population. Nowadays, a majority of Kurds practice Sunni Islam, although significant numbers do practice Shia Islam or Alevism. Along with this, there are many Christian Kurds. After all, there were Kurds at the Pentecost. Plus, there are Kurdish adherents of Yarsanism and Yazidism. There are even still a few hundred Zoroastrian Kurds left in the world. Again though, there are currently millions of Muslim Kurds. This was all the result of a widespread conversion that began centuries ago. In line with this, the emergence of Islamic scholars, or Sheikhs, as national leaders among the Kurds was the result of the elimination of hereditary semi-autonomous Kurdish principalities in the Ottoman Empire, especially following the centralization policies of the early 19th century. In particular, Sheikh Ubeydullah was one of several religious leaders who were there to fill the void and re-establish a sense of order. Despite previous revolts by Kurdish leaders to reassert control over their former principalities, Sheikh Ubeydullah is regarded as the first nationalist Kurdish leader whose cause was to establish an ethnic Kurdish state. Thus, the first modern Kurdish nationalist movement emerged in 1880 with an uprising led by Sheikh Ubeydullah, who demanded political autonomy for the Kurds as well as the recognition of a Kurdistan state without interference from Turkish or Persian authorities. However, the uprising against the Ottoman Empire and Qajar Persia was suppressed. Then, Ubeydullah, along with other notable figures, were exiled to Istanbul. Thereby, establishing a strong Kurdish presence in Turkey as time went on. Later, Gertrude Bell became the mother of modern Iraq. As such, she had a phenomenal impact on the reconfiguration of the Middle East after World War I. This was primarily because she was friends with Winston Churchill and Lawrence of Arabia. So, after the Ottoman Empire had been removed, the three of them decided to found a new country. As such, they became the first people to use the Kurds in the northern part of Iraq as a buffer against Turkey. Thus, beginning the Kurdish genocide that still rages on today. After the defeat of the Ottoman Empire, the victorious Western allies made a provision for a Kurdish state in the 1920 Treaty of Sevres. President Wilson promised the Kurds a homeland, but they never got one. The promise was nullified three years later when the Treaty of Lausanne set the boundaries of modern Turkey and made no such provision. Instead, Gertrude Bell mentored King Faisal, who became the European-backed ruler of Iraq. This set the stage for decades of turmoil in the Middle East, particularly regarding the Kurds. Finally, in 1979, Saddam Hussein became the President of Iraq, bringing everything to full fruition. In 1988, he decided to use chemical weapons in Halabja. Saddam Hussein ordered his airforce to drop mustard gas, sarin gas, tabun gas, and other forms of gas on the Iraqi Kurds. Innocent people died horribly. Their organs liquefied, their bodies began to contort in unthinkable ways, breaking bones in the process. Within a couple of hours time, 5,000 Kurds had died tragically and 10,000 more were horribly disfigured and damaged, many of them also dying in the weeks that followed. As if that wasn’t terrible enough on its own, the Anfal genocide killed between 50,000 and 182,000 Kurds in total. It was committed during the Al-Anfal campaign led by Ali Hassan al-Majid against Kurdistan in northern Iraq during the final stages of the Iran–Iraq War, from 1986 to 1989. Time and time again the Kurds have had to form resistance, and this was one of those times. This is where the Peshmerga, or “those who face death”, come into the picture. In fact, the Peshmerga actually predates Iraq, having begun as a tribal border guard under Ottoman rule. Since then they have become an elite fighting force in their own right. The Peshmerga are now the official military of the Kurdistan Region of Iraq. Since the Iraqi Army is forbidden to enter that territory, the Peshmerga, along with its security subsidiaries, are responsible for protecting the Kurdistan Region. They are also quite essential to gaining peace in the Middle East. As part of this, the women in the Peshmerga are the most feared by ISIS. This is because the radicalized terrorists believe that if they are killed by a woman, they will not go to Paradise. Thus, many of these famous female fighters have Twitter accounts, with a huge following in the West. Regardless, together with their male comrades, the Peshmerga fight for freedom, and not just their own. In 2003, the Peshmerga played a key role in the mission to capture the ruthless dictator Saddam Hussein. Then, in 2004, they captured a key al Qaeda member named Hassan Ghul. He revealed the identity of Bin Laden’s messenger, which eventually led to Operation Neptune Spear, resulting in Osama’s death. Along with this, there are a number of women and men becoming Kurdish politicians now. The most prominent example of this is Madam Bayan Sami Abdul Rahman. She is the current representative of the Kurdish Regional Government. Rahman was made the KRG’s representative in the UK, before moving to Washington, DC in 2015 to act as the KRG representative to the US. Basically, she spends her time telling the US government how we need to stand up with the Kurds against ISIS, and how we need to prepare for an independent Kurdistan. Unfortunately, the words of Madam Bayan Sami Abdul Rahman often fall on deaf ears. Currently, the Trump administration is fully in favor of a Kurdish genocide and is willing to do what it can to aid in the atrocity. So, after Trump withdrew the US troops who were protecting Kurdish areas in northern Syria, Turkey invaded the region on October 9th. Since then, the Kurds have had to align themselves with the Syrian government, and as a consequence of this, a number of former ISIS fighters who were being held by the Kurds have now escaped. This is very alarming and quite troubling to say the least. Sadly, this kind of destabilization will continue unless the Kurds get a sovereign state. At the moment there are about 35 million Kurds living in the world, yet they have no country of their own. Instead, significant Kurdish diaspora communities have developed in the cities of western Turkey, particularly in Istanbul. Similarly, a Kurdish diaspora has developed in western Europe, particularly in Germany. There are also exclaves of Kurds in central Anatolia and Khorasan. This is why they need their own country, and Kurdish nationalists are seeking to create an independent nation-state consisting of some or all of the areas with a Kurdish majority. At the very least, they request and require more autonomy within the existing boundaries. Ultimately, the nation of Kurdistan should encompass the northwestern Zagros and the eastern Taurus mountain ranges. This is the territory corresponding to Kurdish irredentist assertions. That is to say, Greater Kurdistan is a roughly defined geo-cultural region in which the Kurds form a prominent majority population. That is the area where Kurdish traditional ethnicity has been historically based. In contrast, Northern Kurdistan is now Turkish, Southern Kurdistan is Iraqi, Eastern Kurdistan is Iranian, and Western Kurdistan is Syrian. It’s just not right. The world is a really big place and we can make room for a few more countries. The bottom line is that the indigenous people of the world desperately need at least part of their land back, to do with as they see fit. After all, without sovereignty, they will never have dignity."

Travel is one of Fatima’s passions, and one of her favourite places to visit is Kashmir, which she describes as “a paradise on earth”-she’s visited the region seven times. This year, after she had made travel arrangements for Kashmir, the political situation there changed dramatically when, on August 5, the government of India revoked Article 370, the section of the Indian constitution that has provided special autonomy to the state of Jammu and Kashmir since 1950. The Indian authorities placed hundreds of political leaders and their aides under house arrest, and suspended access to mobile, landline, and internet networks. Read more: Inside Kashmir’s crisis Fatima’s flight was scheduled for the third week of August. By that time, the authorities had begun to ease some the restrictions and slowly lift the curfews, though there were still some controls in place. Fatima decided, nevertheless, to undertake the journey to the region, where staying for a few days before returning to Bangalore. She shared some of her experiences in a series of posts on Facebook that we have excerpted below. Here are some selected parts of her first two days of experience. This is my seventh visit to Kashmir. . . . I get off the plane and notice an ominous silence outside. None of the airport stores is open. I do not look the officers in the eye, for fear they might take it as an offence and send me back! As soon as I retrieve my luggage from the conveyor belt I leave the airport. Turns out that I was the only tourist on the entire flight. Exiting Srinagar airport, I take a taxi from the prepaid taxi stand. As we drive slowly into the city I witness the same ominous silence. It is 7:30am and the outside temperature is 13° C. The authorities lifted the curfew day before yesterday, but no shops are open. Some locals have come out to shop. They are walking; few people have come in their cars. There are even two or three women going to the market. The taxi driver, Ejaz Bhai, tells me he will go straight home after dropping me. One passenger is enough for the day in this situation. […] According to Ejaj Bhai, no one leaves the house unless it is absolutely necessary, fearing the army might arrest them on any pretext. Most shops are still closed, so people are using up their stocks of food. Who knows what will happen tomorrow?! Ejaz Bhai also told me that police have closed all the hotels here. On the 5th of August, they marked in hotel guest registers that no further guests will be allowed in. There are a lot of armed security personnel on the roads. Approximately every three meters an army officer is standing guard. I am going to Hussain Uncle’s houseboat. (I have known him for a few years). Ejaz Bhai drops me at Dal Lake Gate №7 and I take a shikara to the houseboat, which is also Hussain Uncle’s home. […] The Armed Forces Special Powers Act (AFSPA) has been in effect since 1990. The army has all the power. The law allows the army to pick up anyone, civilian or militant, and they don’t have to be accountable if people turn up dead or disappear. . . . There are mass graves of thousands in the districts of Uri and Baramulla. It’s alleged that suspected militants were picked up and they ended up in those graves. This is the story in a lot of villages in the Kashmir Valley. After the 5th of August many youths have reportedly been arrested, and no one knows where they are. Even though [the government] have lifted the curfew, the people here imposed their own, civil curfew. No one is opening their shops; no one anywhere is working. This is all in protest at the decision taken to revoke Article 370. […] The PSA [Public Safety Act] has been in force since 1978. This banned any kind of gathering or procession in Kashmir. However, people do come out for protests, and mass arrests take place. This time, it’s worse. Telephone, internet lines are down and there is no contact with the outside world. Before the curfew, the army had seized power from the police and took away their weapons. I did not see any police on my way into the city from the airport. […] [The authorities] have arrested many political leaders and sent them to jail in Delhi and Agra. Rumour has it that the jails in Kashmir and Jammu are already full. Even without the curfew in effect, no one is taking their car out. Because gasoline is not available. The buses are not running either. In the afternoon, I ask Hussain Uncle to take me to the lakeside to see the situation in the city. He suggests that I go tomorrow instead: “Today there is trouble in the city.” My second day in Kashmir. I, personally, am in no hurry. Because of the situation, I have no plans to go anywhere. Hussain Uncle lives in one of his two houseboats and keeps the other for tourists, so I am now alone on a huge houseboat. All tours are now closed in Kashmir. . . I talk with his son, Shehzad, during breakfast. Yesterday, a protest rally took place at Shalimar Gardens. Nobody knows what happened after that. There is no way to know how many were arrested, injured, or killed. There is still no telephone, internet. […] Once, in 2008, the government allowed people to protest. People from all over the city came out into the streets of Kashmir, which was very hard to control. The government became smarter, and protests rallies are no longer allowed. The common people of Kashmir want azadi (freedom). They have wanted it since the reign of King Hari Singh, before India became independent. I am not going to debate what the mass of Indian citizens want. . . . What Kashmiris want should be the main concern, because they are from this place. They have started to ration food distribution again. Uncle’s youngest son, Junaid, went to the centre of the town and learnt that from tomorrow they will start the distribution of rations. They are providing only rice now. Earlier they used to distribute flour and sugar as well. I spend the rest of the day sitting on the porch of the houseboat. Life on the Dal lake seems to be normal. People are going to their usual work or other places on small boats. During the curfew, the women here have nothing to do, especially as mobile phone and internet service have also been shut down. Except for TV, there is no option for entertainment. […] In the afternoon I go out, and Uncle sends his son Junaid with me. From the boat, I step on to land and walk along the lakeside. I see some army men patrolling the Boulevard Road. After that, every 10 meters there is an army officer standing. Barbed-wire fences have been placed in front of almost all public buildings. Today I saw several cars and motorbikes on the street. I saw some local people strolling on Boulevard Road. Usually, many people from Srinagar flock here in the afternoon. . . . Public transport is still shut down. A few shared taxis are waiting at the bus stand to take people to Jammu. All roads except those towards Jammu are closed. Photography is prohibited on the street Photography is prohibited on the street and there is an even stricter ban against photographing army personnel. Only a few journalists have permission to take pictures. I am a visitor and if they find out that I came here despite knowing about the curfew, I suspect they will send me back immediately. They could even book me on suspicion of extremism-and we know that after an arrest, there is usually no further news of the detainee. After spending a substantial time in the city, I return to the houseboat. Hussain Uncle tells me that there was trouble in downtown. He heard the sound of teargas shells. After the Maghreb prayers came the loud sound of prayers from the mosque. There is nothing else to do besides pray. On hearing that any words, positive or negative, are uttered in the mosque besides prayers, the army comes to arrest people. Ther are army spies inside the mosque listening to hear what’s going on. All the big mosques were closed after the announcement of curfew. Editor’s note: The Indian government continues to maintain that the situation in Kashmir is normal. Restrictions have been re-imposed in parts of Kashmir."
Medium.com,Society,Mapped: Where polio lives in 2019,World,https://medium.com/@newhumanitarian/mapped-where-polio-lives-in-2019-257131a81194?source=topic_page---------217------------------1," by Irwin Loy There’s reason for both optimism and deep concern on World Polio Day, 24 October: global polio numbers have fallen over decades, but new outbreaks continue to fester, raising questions about eradication efforts in countries where humanitarian access is a problem. First, the good news: a global commission announced today that one of three strains of the wild poliovirus has been eradicated. The type-3 strain was last spotted in Nigeria in 2012. It’s part of a decades-long drop in polio worldwide, from some 350,000 cases of wild poliovirus in 1988 to double-digit figures of the remaining type-1 wild poliovirus today. The bad news: there has been a recent surge in polio, fuelled by dozens of cases of wild poliovirus in Pakistan and Afghanistan. There are also unexpected new outbreaks of vaccine-derived strains — rare mutations that affect under-immunised populations — in at least 14 other countries this year. Some of these hadn’t seen polio for years, including Ghana and the Philippines, which both announced outbreaks in September. And, in some cases, vaccine-derived polio strains have leapt across borders — from Nigeria to its neighbours and from Somalia to Ethiopia. “The risk of new outbreaks in new countries is considered extremely high, even probable,” a World Health Organisation committee on polio said this month. While public health messaging has often brimmed with optimism that polio is on the brink of defeat, there are worries among health experts behind the scenes. In its biannual meetings in October, the WHO’s expert advisory group on vaccines and immunisation said it had “serious concerns about the overall state of eradication efforts”, citing an inability to control outbreaks in Africa and Asia. Here’s a map of where polio lingers in 2019. Zoom in for a snapshot of how things stand in each country: As the map shows, there are three “endemic” countries — Afghanistan, Pakistan, and Nigeria — where polio transmission has never officially stopped. There are also at least 15 “outbreak” countries that have seen polio re-emerge through vaccine-derived viruses, sometimes across borders. In recent days, health officials have also found new cases in Zambia, Chad, and Togo. And at least 13 other countries are “at risk” of polio returning because of low levels of immunisation and routine surveillance, according to the Global Polio Eradication Initiative, or GPEI — the anti-polio consortium made up of governments, donors, and UN agencies. There’s no known cure for polio, but the childhood disease, which can cause paralysis, is entirely preventable through vaccines. Building polio immunity, however, requires repeated rounds of vaccination, and this can be thwarted by shrinking humanitarian access in conflict areas, parents refusing vaccines, and weak or inadequate responses on the part of health authorities. These issues have all factored into why polio remains a global health threat. Here are three key hotspots: Pakistan has recorded at least 72 polio cases in 2019 after seeing only eight last year — an “alarming” rise and a sign of an eradication “programme in crisis”, an advisory group tracking country-level progress warned in August. Anti-polio efforts have taken a hit this year: Pakistan aborted an April immunisation drive after crowds attacked a Peshawar health clinic and vaccinators were killed (some Islamist militants have spoken out against vaccination campaigns, calling them a Western plot to sterilise Muslim children). The government has blamed parents who refuse vaccines — often fuelled by misinformation spread on social media — for the surge in cases. But Pakistan’s own efforts have come under scrutiny. The country’s head of polio eradication acknowledged in July that health workers were misreporting vaccination refusals, calling into question the accuracy of its data. Last year, a report by the Independent Monitoring Board of the GPEI said “the Pakistan Polio Programme is fooling itself into thinking that it has made any progress at all”. Strains of polio in Pakistan have been linked to a 2014 outbreak in Syria and an environmental sample found this year in Iran. Polio has paralysed at least 16 children this year in Afghanistan. Like its neighbour, Pakistan, health authorities face vaccine scepticism in some communities. Frequent immunisation campaigns are also complicated by the country’s decades-long conflict: attacks shuttered at least 100 health facilities this year. Large parts of Afghanistan are controlled by the Taliban or other insurgent groups, and health teams must negotiate access with militants. Children often go without: 1.2 million children missed a vaccination drive last August, for example. This year, the advisory group reviewing country-level progress said that access was deteriorating and too many children had missed multiple vaccination rounds. “A major outbreak is imminent,” the body warned. The advisory group also said Afghanistan must do more to reach mothers and female caretakers, yet no Afghan women hold leadership positions in the country’s polio programme. The GPEI, it noted, is also “disproportionately led by men”. Nigeria is both a tentative success story and a cautionary tale. There have been no cases of wild poliovirus in Nigeria since 2016, spurring speculation that the country might soon be formally declared polio-free. Health experts are cautious: “Undetected and continued circulation of this strain cannot be ruled out” due to surveillance gaps in high-risk and inaccessible areas, the WHO said in April. Outbreaks of vaccine-derived polio (there have been at least 16 cases this year) continue to spread, both within the country and across borders to Niger, Cameroon, Benin, and Ghana. At least 70,000 children miss out on vaccines in Nigeria’s conflict-affected northeast. Nigeria has reached a similar crossroad before: the country went two years without polio before new cases emerged in 2016. The virus had been circulating, undetected, for five years in the northeast’s Borno State — a “humiliating” reversal, the GPEI’s monitoring board said in a report last year: “Nigeria, and therefore Africa, cannot be certified free from the wild poliovirus unless there is better surveillance and better access.” il/ag"

Released on October 4, the tweet led to Chinese state-run television broadcaster CCTV refusing to broadcast two National Basketball Association (NBA) pre-season games in Shanghai and Shenzhen. The tweet also caused several Chinese sponsors to distance themselves from the NBA. As a result, the NBA has reportedly lost all its major Chinese sponsors. This includes a local joint venture of Nissan Motor Co., China’s largest sportswear manufacturer, the nation’s second-largest dairy company, and a smartphone brand. Aside from the sponsorships, China remains the largest market for the NBA outside of the US. A multi-billion-dollar marriage tied up in merchandise sales, media rights, and streaming profits. On October 17, NBA commissioner Adam Silver issued a public statement supporting his employees’ right to freedom of speech. Silver stated that “values of equality, respect, and freedom of expression have long defined the NBA — and will continue to do so. As an American-based basketball league operating globally, among our greatest contributions are these values of the game.” Silver also claims that China requested the NBA fire Morey over the contentious tweet. “We made clear that we were being asked to fire him, by the Chinese government, by the parties we dealt with, government, and business,” Silver said. “We said there’s no chance that’s happening. There’s no chance we’ll even discipline him.” However, China has denied these allegations. Chinese foreign ministry spokesman Geng Shuang said the Chinese government “has never made this kind of request” and that “[they] especially went to the relevant departments to check on this claim.” A day after denying the termination request, CCTV stated that Silver had “defamed” China and had “problems in his character.” “To please some American politicians, Silver has fabricated lies out of nothing and has sought to paint China as unforgiving.” Just as the international incident began to recede, Lebron James reignited public fury. After returning from two high profile games in Shanghai and Shenzhen, James, who is an outspoken critic of President Trump, police violence and other prominent issues, said that Morey’s tweet “wasn’t educated on the situation.” He elaborated further, explaining that Morey’s statement endangered people — “not only financially, but physically. Emotionally. Spiritually.” While James’ tweet was welcomed with enthusiasm on the mainland, others remain outraged. Republican senator Ben Sasse accused James of “parroting communist propaganda.” His comments were mocked in a South Park episode and became the target of a Hong Kong rally last week. Popular Australian muralist also released this photo of James next to a Winnie the Pooh version of President Xi. James has defended himself in response to the intense backlash, stating that his comments were not related to the substance of Morey’s tweet, but rather the ramifications of it. James has also stated that he will not speak further about the issue going forward. As one of the most popular players in the association, James has a lifetime endorsement deal with Nike that may reportedly pay him more than $1 billion. During the 2019 fiscal year ending May, Nike earned $6.2 billion of revenue from sales from Greater China. Jason Whitlock, sports journalist and controversial media figure, has asserted that James supports China’s interests rather than his own country’s. David West, NBA player of 15 years and current Chief Operating Officer (COO) of the Historical Basketball League, slammed Whitlock’s comments and defended James, asserting that he was creating a “false narrative” leading people to “war under false pretenses.” “There’s a lot of intellectual laziness that’s going into this… We’ve dumbed down the conversation to ‘LeBron is pro-China and he won’t speak out on issues in Hong Kong,’” West added."

Medium.com,Society,The Breast Milk Substitute Code — Time for Implementation and Enforcement in Nigeria,World,https://medium.com/@nigeriahealthwatch/the-breast-milk-substitute-code-time-for-implementation-and-enforcement-in-nigeria-7b2015902d0f?source=topic_page---------220------------------1," Breast will always be best
The importance of breastfeeding to improve the health and nutrition of infants and young children cannot be overemphasised. Breastfeeding gives children the healthiest start in life. It is sufficient and beneficial for nutrition in a baby’s first 6 months. Breast milk stimulates brain development and functions as an infant’s first vaccine. Experts discourage the practice of giving babies any other foods and water in the first six months, even in addition to breast milk, as it may expose the baby to disease and hamper their development. Global breastfeeding rates remain lower than what is required to protect the health of women and children, according to the 2019 global breastfeeding scorecard. From 2013 –2018, only 43% of newborns initiate breastfeeding within one hour of birth, and only 41% of infants under six months are exclusively breastfed. In Nigeria, only a mere 28.7% of infants age 0–5 months are exclusively breastfed, leaving a whopping 71.3% of children who do not enjoy the benefits of breast milk in their formative years. Breast Milk Substitutes (BMS) include all milk products — infant formula, follow-up formula and growing up milks — marketed or represented as a partial or total breast milk replacement to feed infants and children up to 36 months old. BMS have been aggressively marketed by infant food manufacturers, making enforcement a challenge in the promotion of breastfeeding. The increased advertising and promotion of breast milk substitutes decreases breastfeeding rates as it discourages mothers from breastfeeding putting both children’s and mothers’ health at risk. The adoption of the Breast Milk Substitute Code
The World Health Assembly (WHA) in 1981 adopted the International Code of Marketing of Breast Milk Substitutes (BMS). The Code was meant to help curtail the adverse effects that aggressive marketing and advertising, free samples and other promotional practices by infant food manufacturers have on breastfeeding rates and duration. The Code aimed to protect the most vulnerable, banning advertising and other forms of promotion of BMS. Since its approval, the BMS Code has been regularly revised by the WHA, taking into cognisance new scientific data on breastfeeding and the BMS industry’s new products and promotional tactics. In Nigeria, the “Marketing Of Infant and Young Children Food and Other Designated Products Regulations 2019” subsidiary legislation of the National Agency for Food and Drug Administration and Control (NAFDAC), came into effect on June 1, 2019. It seeks to control and regulate the marketing of BMS and complementary foods when marketed or otherwise represented to be suitable as a partial or total replacement of breast milk. It states that the advertisement or promotion to the public of breast milk substitutes and related products are prohibited and manufacturers and distributors are prohibited from providing, directly or indirectly, samples of BMS and related products to pregnant women, mothers or members of their families. Poor enforcement of the BMS code — at what cost?
The Federal Ministry of Health, through NAFDAC, has stated that it is the duty of the manufacturers and distributors of breast milk substitutes and complementary foods, non-governmental organisations, professional groups and consumer organisations to collaborate with the agency in the implementation of these regulations. This is a tall order, manufacturers of breast milk substitutes have so far primarily guarded their commercial interests, and have been aggressively marketing their products. Self-monitoring has not worked, and the sanctions for non-compliance have not been enough of a deterrent for breast milk substitute manufacturers to adhere to the Code, especially when they consider that the market value of the baby food market (which includes breast milk substitutes) was valued at an estimated NGN 114.9 billion in 2017 and has continued to grow. Added to this, population dynamics make Nigeria a very profitable market, with the high birth and fertility rates, as well as the increased participation of women in the workforce. All these factors would bode well for the prospects of breast milk substitute manufacturers, and so adherence to the Code has not been in their commercial interest. The expenditure on breast milk substitutes by far exceeds the health budget used to deal with the consequences of not breastfeeding e.g. diarrhea and pneumonia. In 2017, Alive & Thrive analysed the costs associated with breastfeeding. Their analysis showed that there was a saving of $22 million (N6.93 billion) in healthcare costs if an infant was breastfed, however, there was a loss of $9 billion (N2.84 trillion) due to cognitive loss in children, following inadequate breastfeeding. Healthcare workers — part of the problem?
Healthcare workers also have a role to play, ensuring and encouraging exclusive breastfeeding and eradicating practices that directly or indirectly challenge the initiation and continuation of breastfeeding. According to the NAFDAC regulations, feeding with substitutes, where necessary, should be demonstrated only by health workers to mothers or family members who are medically in need of any of the substitutes. Healthcare workers have the power to ban BMS from their health facilities and seize and confiscate any BMS brought to their healthcare facility without a medical prescription. These powers cannot be overemphasised, and healthcare workers should be urged to control the introduction, use and movement of BMS in health facilities. Recently, we shared the story of Agnes, a first-time mother who was advised by a health worker in the health facility where she gave birth to her baby, to get infant formula because she was not producing “enough” milk. This is unacceptable as health workers are supposed to explain and emphasise the benefits of exclusive breastfeeding when a child is born. This exposes gaps in the knowledge and understanding of health workers about the benefits of breastfeeding, many also are largely unaware of the BMS code and so would more easily give into the inducements offered to them by breast milk substitute manufacturers. A comparative analysis in June 2016 of efforts made in BMS Code monitoring found promotional materials for BMS in 48% of facilities in Nigeria and 25% of healthcare workers received BMS samples from manufacturers or their distributors and sales representatives. BMS marketing inhibits optimum breastfeeding practices by influencing health systems and providers. Targeted marketing tactics like this influence mothers to view BMS use as appropriate or a recommended feeding practice if they receive biased advice and promotional materials from trusted sources like the health system. Time to take action This is a rallying cry to the Honourable Minister of Health to take action to show the world that Nigeria is serious about the health and wellbeing of its most vulnerable population — its children. The International Code of Marketing of Breast Milk substitutes is non-binding, but sets out recommendations. However, with the new regulations that came into effect from June 2019, the Nigerian government needs to show its firm commitment by implementing structures that would ensure enforcement of the regulations. Otherwise, Nigeria will continue to face an uphill battle as it tries to push up exclusive breastfeeding rates, contending with the commercial interests of breast milk substitute manufacturers. Counteracting BMS marketing practices and promoting the benefits of breastfeeding should be the leading concern in advocacy for Infant and Young Child Feeding (IYCF). The Federal Ministry of Health, regulatory agencies like NAFDAC, health facilities, healthcare workers and most notably, BMS manufacturers themselves, should work together to ensure compliance with the BMS International Code of Marketing. There will also be a need to implement independent monitoring mechanisms that are unburdened by commercial interests and have a legal mandate to enforce compliance. All infants and young children deserve the healthiest start to life, and breast milk, not substitutes, is key to jumpstarting a healthy life-long development.

Medium.com,Society,Former OPCW chief denounces official investigation of alleged chemical attack in Douma,World,https://medium.com/@Brian_Whit/former-opcw-chief-denounces-official-investigation-of-alleged-chemical-attack-in-douma-df84ad62d2ee?source=topic_page---------221------------------1," A former head of the chemical weapons watchdog OPCW has accused the organisation of “irregular behaviour” during its investigation of an alleged chemical attack in Syria last year, according to reports circulating on the internet. The remarks by José Bustani, director-general of the OPCW between 1997 and 2002, were reported simultaneously on Wednesday by WikiLeaks and the Courage Foundation, an organisation which supports Wikileaks founder Julian Assange and other whistleblowers. Bustani was quoted as saying he had long held doubts about the alleged attack in Douma, on the outskirts of Damascus. “I could make no sense of what I was reading in the international press. Even official reports of investigations seemed incoherent at best.” In comments apparently based on information provided by a whistle-blowing member of the Douma investigation team, the former OPCW chief reportedly said there is now “convincing evidence” of irregularities. An official report of the investigation, published by the OPCW last March, found “reasonable grounds” for believing a toxic chemical had been used as a weapon in Douma and that the chemical was likely to have been chlorine. It was “possible” that two gas cylinders found at the scene were the source of the chemical, the report said. In line with its mandate, the OPCW did not attribute blame but its report hinted that the cylinders had been dropped from the air. If so, this would indicate that the Assad regime was responsible because rebel fighters did not have aircraft. Almost immediately after the alleged attack, the US, Britain and France blamed the regime and without waiting for the OPCW’s investigation responded with airstrikes targeting the regime’s chemical facilities. Since then, Assad’s defenders on social media, together with Russian propaganda channels, have repeatedly claimed that rebels “staged” a chemical attack in Douma in order to falsely incriminate the regime. The latest development in this campaign came on 15 October when the Courage Foundation convened a seven-member panel of “concerned individuals” to meet the unnamed whistleblower. The whistleblower is said to have given an “extensive presentation” which included internal OPCW emails, text messages and “suppressed draft reports”. Based on that, they unanimously expressed “alarm over unacceptable practices in the investigation of the alleged chemical attack in Douma”, adding: “We became convinced by the testimony that key information about chemical analyses, toxicology consultations, ballistics studies, and witness testimonies was suppressed, ostensibly to favour a preordained conclusion.” Following the meeting, the Courage Foundation and Wikileaks circulated a three-page critique of the OPCW’s Douma report ( here and here) though it doesn’t appear to include new information directly attributable to the whistleblower. Bustani is listed as one of the “concerned individuals” on the Courage Foundation’s panel, though he reportedly did not attend the meeting with the whistleblower on 15 October for health reasons. Other members of the panel were: ● Richard Falk, an emeritus professor of international law at Princeton University. Falk has previously claimed there are “well-evidenced doubts” that the 9/11 attacks were carried out by al-Qaeda “with no foreknowledge by government officials”. He also wrote the foreword to a book by a prominent 9/11 truther which suggested the Bush administration was complicit in the attacks. ● Kristinn Hrafnsson, editor-in-chief of Wikileaks. In a posting on its website on Wednesday, WikiLeaks called on OPCW staff to submit leaked documents about Douma via a secure internet connection. ● John Holmes, a retired British army officer. Holmes is currently a board member of the British Syrian Society along with President Assad’s father-in-law, Fawaz Akhras. ● Helmut Lohrer, a board member of International Physicians for the Prevention of Nuclear War. Lohrer’s previous involvement with Syria included a call, in 2015, for sanctions to be lifted. ● Günter Meyer, director of the Centre for Research on the Arab World at the University of Mainz … and a long-standing Assad supporter. ● Elizabeth Murray, a member of Veteran Intelligence Professionals for Sanity (VIPS) and Sam Adams Associates for Integrity in Intelligence. VIPS has previously disputed the regime’s responsibility for chemical attacks in Syria. In 2017 the Sam Adams organisation presented an award for “truth-telling” to journalist Seymour Hersh, the author of several discredited articles about chemical weapons in Syria. Bustani, a 74-year-old Brazilian diplomat, became the first director-general of the OPCW after its formation in 1997. He was ousted five years later after falling out with the Americans during the run-up to war in Iraq. The US State Department accused him of confrontational and abrasive conduct and poor administrative and financial management but according to Bustani the real reason was that he had been having discussions with Iraq about joining the Chemical Weapons Convention. This was something the US didn’t want to happen because it would have weakened American claims about the supposed threat from Saddam Hussein’s weapons of mass destruction. The US brought matters to a head by threatening to cut off its financial support for the OPCW — which at the time accounted for 22% of the total budget — until Bustani stepped down. Intimidated by that, a special session of the states parties voted 48–7 to dismiss him. Bustani later took his case to a tribunal, alleging wrongful dismissal, and was awarded substantial compensation."
Medium.com,Society,Five Reasons Why Lebanon’s Protests Are Exceptional,World,https://medium.com/@fadihaliso/five-reasons-why-lebanons-protests-are-exceptional-988b80f5d829?source=topic_page---------222------------------1," A new whiff of hope 30 years after the end of the civil war A week ago, last Thursday, people in Lebanon woke up on the news of a new tax package the government was planning to introduce. Among those taxes scheduled for the new year, was a monthly 6 USD fee on the use of the free WhatsApp phone calls. These taxes would have accumulated further financial burdens to the ordinary Lebanese who is suffering from a deteriorated economy. During the day, the shy calls to demonstrate were not that promising. But with the end of the working day, thousands of Lebanese went down to the streets all over the country, burning tires and cutting off roads. This spontaneous act was eventually the spark that ignited widespread anger against the ruling’ national unity government’. The result was shocking; It turned out to be the most significant protest movement in the history of Lebanon. On Sunday afternoon, more than 2.5 million out of a population of 5 million were protesting around the country. Protests erupted in every big city, calling for the resignation of the cabinet, the parliament and the president. These demonstrations are, by all means, exceptional in Lebanon’s history. Not only because of their size but for many other reasons. So why is that? For years, the Lebanese society was divided along sectarian and partisan lines. In 2015, the “You Stink” movement came up during the garbage crisis, with the slogan “All means all,” indicating that all political leaders without exceptions must go. People accused, the motto and the activists behind it, of being unrealistic and divisive. Many Lebanese were thrilled to participate in the protests but were not ready to accuse their sectarian leaders of corruption.
However, today, all of this is changing. The seed that was planted four years ago is bearing fruits. The slogan resurfaced and has been used since day one by demonstrators from different religious groups all over the country. Even partisan Lebanese seem to be fed up with the corruption of their parties. No one is excluded! It is, indeed, an exceptional development in Lebanese politics.
Besides, in a rare display of national unity, the demonstrators are not raising any flag but the national flag. The different colors of the Lebanese parties are absent, mainly because these demonstrations are against them all. The slogan “all means all” seems genuine. I have been living in Lebanon for ten years now. Yet, this is the first time I see demonstrations going on all over the country, in Christian, Muslim, and Druze areas at the same time. This decentralized character is by far the most crucial aspect of the current demonstrations for two reasons. First, since all regions are participating, there is no way any religious or political leader can claim that his community is not participating because it feels targeted by the movement. On the contrary, it seems that every religious community is revolting against its leaders simultaneously. Second, the decentralized nature of these protests has made it very difficult for the authorities to repress it. Back in 2015, the “You Stink” movement lost its momentum once the authorities were able to suppress their central gatherings in Down Town Beirut. Over the last week, We have seen many unsuccessful attempts to open the roads and disperse protesters in many areas. And even if one or more of these attempts succeed, there are plenty of other points for demonstrations and sit-ins. This observation could be silly for the western audience. Yet in the middle east, it is significant. Unlike other Arab countries such as Syria, Egypt, and Sudan, the army here is not a tool of repression. Believe it or not, the military here is not using live amunition to disperse demonstrations! Although the military was asked by the government to open roads blocked by demonstrators, the levels of violence we witnessed were minimal. Officers and soldiers seemed instead sympathizing with the demonstrators. The live broadcast showed many soldiers, who were forced to obey their orders to open the roadblocks, crying for having to do that. Overall, the army is playing a positive role; this week also has witnessed footages of the army thwarting thugs and motorcycle gangs mobilized by influential parties within the government to beat the demonstrators. Will the army keep this positive attitude and not bend to the pressure of politicians who thus far seems adamant not to back down? Only time will tell. If you go to any of the multiple sit-ins, you will find participants from different age groups. Yet the extensive participation of the Lebanese youth and women is remarkable. Young people under 20 seem to be participating in significant numbers, blocking roads, cleaning the garbage, and chanting. Women are no exception. Their participation is not only substantial in numbers, but they are also defending demonstrators by making lines between them and security forces. Therefore, their role was essential in limiting the violence so far to the minimum. During the week of demonstrations thus far, most Lebanese TV channels were broadcasting live. Day and night, they were giving demonstrators an open platform to voice their grievances. Well, it turned out that people are fully aware of the root causes of their country’s ailments. Corruption, sectarianism, and lousy administration were on every tongue. Furthermore, the years of hate speech and incitement towards the Syrian refugees seemed to have made minimal impact on people. Yes, everyone is aware of the enormous pressure Lebanon is suffering from with the presence of the biggest per-capita percentage of refugees. Still, people knew better than to blame the refugees for Lebanon’s complex problems and corrupt elites. What is the way forward? Today, neither the demonstrators nor the ruling elite seems willing to relent. The entrenched interests of the post-civil-war ruling elites make it very hard to accept a peaceful and smooth transition. The elites are betting that the people will eventually need to leave the streets and go back to work and earn their living. While many of the demonstrators seem aware that they have nothing to lose, and if they relent, they will lose big time. Lebanon is open to all possibilities, and only time will tell which direction the country will take."

It’s attempting to ‘get back out there’, and meet new partners, only to find a very different ‘dating scene’ to the one it remembers and expected. Firstly, let’s talk about the money. There has been much made of the economic promises and warnings from both sides. The simple truth is that no-one can know how much GDP growth is being lost or gained because of Brexit. That prediction involves summoning a counterfactual, an alternate timeline where the UK didn’t commit sepukku in 2016. Our current path has diverged from that so widely, that for anyone to claim they can still see it, is grossly unrealistic — and likely disingenuous. However, every economist would agree that markets don’t like uncertainty, and the Brexit process has definitely been uncertain. There hasn’t been such a long-running will-they-won’t-they story on television since Ross & Rachel. As such, Brexit has, at the very least, incurred a significant short-term cost to the UK, the EU, and indeed, the world. The next challenge is reinvention — once the UK leaves the EU, what will it do? From Brexit supporters, I have heard optimistic musings of becoming a ‘Singapore-on-the-Thames’, a small, agile financial centre, and prosperous trading hub. To their credit, this goal isn’t without some basis- they are essentially imagining the Britain of an earlier time, although perhaps through rose-coloured glasses. Furthermore, Singapore too left a larger union (in its case, Malaysia, in ’65) and was greeted with newfound wealth and importance. The goal is fair, and it might even be viable. However, the dustbin of history is full of small states, too proud of their independence and too sure of their manifest destiny, who ultimately came to grief*. From personal experience, isolation is wonderfully liberating, until the moment you need help. Speaking of which, we now turn to the ‘dating pool’: the diplomacy of the Drumpf era. As the UK casts around for new partners, it will likely turn first to old ones. The UK is still at the heart of the Commonwealth of Nations, and might view that as an increasingly important circle of friends, for trade & security. However, although these nations share a history with the UK (although often not a purely positive one), their actual usefulness is questionable. The nearest Commonwealth nation to the UK is Malta. The next is Cyprus. Then Canada. In short, the Commonwealth doesn’t supply any partners who are both close, rich and powerful. To continue with the divorce analogy, the Commonwealth nations might make for decent rebound lovers, but they are not a real substitute for a family— what Europe was to the UK. Of course, there’s always the US. Leering across the Atlantic, eyes locked only on your…assets. Repeatedly saying things behind your back, claiming they don’t want a relationship, treating every interaction as a transaction. So…yeah, there’s that. Curiously, some Brexiteers seem to acknowledge that the EU is the only viable strategic ally for Britain, and make reference to likely trade deals they’ll be able to make with the EU, post-Brexit. To continue with the analogy, they seem to be assuming that the UK & EU will ‘still be friends’ after the breakup. Needless to say, this assumption is…unlikely. The EU, after being used as a political boogeyman by Boris Johnson and Co., is unlikely to be sympathetic to their fortunes. Even beyond some understandable personal ill-feeling, there is also a strategic case for making sure that the UK feels some pain. The EU doesn’t want to encourage any other members to leave (especially the increasingly Euro-skeptic Eastern states), and thereby has a motive to make the divorce messy. The more pain and chaos for the UK, the better. The next consideration is the children. Specifically, Northern Ireland & Scotland. In the case of Northern Ireland, Brexit was always going to be problematic. Essentially, the logic works like this. The UK wants to be in a union with Northern Ireland, with no barrier to trade, money or people. The UK also has a commitment to ensuring there is no onerous border between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland, as implied in the Good Friday Agreement. The Republic of Ireland is part of the EU. Do you see the problem? If the UK decided to create a legal barrier between Great Britain and Northern Ireland, it’s hard to imagine that not ending in Northern Irish independence. If they construct a hard border between North & South Ireland, they’re inviting the IRA to resume a terrorist campaign in protest. And if they do neither, they are de facto still in the EU, but without the voting rights. As for Scotland, the 2014 Independence Referendum was only narrowly defeated, with 45% of the country voting to leave the UK. Considering that Scotland voted overwhelmingly to Remain in 2016 (63%), it seems likely that Scotland would opt to leave the UK, and return to the EU, given a chance. As such, it seems likely that if Boris Johnson is successful in achieving a hard Brexit, he’s going to lose custody of the children. Without Northern Ireland and Scotland, he will have been responsible for turning the UK into just the K. In all likelihood, Britain will be much reduced by the Brexit process. It will have less territory, less money and fewer friends. I predict that in fifteen or twenty years time, the alcoholic, estranged and bankrupt ex-husband that will be 2040’s Britain will be forced to seek readmission to the European Union, in order to preserve any relevance at all. In twenty years time, the only difference that Brexit will have made is that it will have transformed a large and prosperous nation, into a smaller and poorer one. ‘You never really know a person until you divorce them.’ So says Zsa Zsa Gabor, who famously divorced seven different husbands, and is presumably an expert of the matter. Although I have never been divorced myself**, I would imagine that it’s the adversity, the harrowing loss of divorcing a life-partner, that grinds back the veneer of one’s personality, and exposes the real person beneath. In much the same way, for better or worse, we’re going to get a glimpse of the real UK in the months ahead. *Ironically, many at the hands of the British Empire. **though I’d be more than happy to, if the right woman came along."
Medium.com,Society,Australian Media Redact Their Front Pages to Protest Secrecy Laws,World,https://medium.com/@jamietarabay/australian-media-redact-their-front-pages-to-protest-secrecy-laws-d7c6624d7276?source=topic_page---------226------------------1," Print, online and on-air news outlets joined together in a concerted campaign to pressure the Australian government to soften its restrictive secrecy laws. Journalists showing newspapers with redacted front pages outside Parliament House in Canberra, Australia, on Monday. Credit: Rod McGuirk/Associated Press SYDNEY, Australia — Australian news outlets from across the political spectrum, including Rupert Murdoch’s tabloids, united on Monday to protest the country’s encroaching secrecy laws. Newspapers ran redacted articles on their front pages in a show of solidarity, and online and on the air, prominent journalists called for change. “When government keeps the truth from you, what are they covering up?” was the question that ran on the cover of newspapers including The Australian, owned by Mr. Murdoch; the liberal Fairfax newspapers; and smaller city and rural newspapers. The question was accompanied with lines of text that had been heavily blacked out. The campaign is intended to pressure the federal government to change laws that threaten jail time to certain whistle-blowers and journalists, and which allow the authorities to withhold information that is often unrelated to matters of national security. The laws fall under an umbrella of secrecy that consecutive Australian governments have created over nearly two decades. No other developed democracy has as strong a stranglehold on its secrets as Australia. For years, governments on both sides of the political aisle have granted law enforcement and intelligence agencies more powers, and diminished those of its citizens. Australia is also a democratic nation without a Bill of Rights. “It’s something that’s been a creeping culture over many years, and that culture is prioritization of secrecy at all costs over the accountability of public institutions,” said Hugh Marks, the chief executive of Nine Entertainment, which merged with Fairfax Media last year. Television networks including the Australian Broadcasting Corporation and radio stations will run advertising calling on the government to overhaul its secrecy laws. Despite widespread media opposition to the laws, it has taken years for news organizations to agree to take a concerted stand. But two raids by the Australian Federal Police in June — one on the home of a journalist, and the second on the offices of the Australian Broadcasting Corporation — brought to light the ease with which the authorities could execute search warrants on journalists, and how few rights journalists and their sources had. “We argue that legitimate journalism should have a defense,” Mr. Marks said. “The presumption is you’re a criminal. The balance of secrecy and disclosure, the balance between what journalists can and can’t do, that balance has been redrawn too far toward secrecy.” The heightened determination to prevent terrorist attacks in the wake of the Sept. 11 attacks found its way to Australia from the United States, with the government of the prime minister at the time, John Howard, passing increasingly invasive legislation, including a terrorism financing bill, a telecommunications interception bill, and an anti-hoax law that carried a 10-year imprisonment for offenders. George Williams, the dean of law at the University of New South Wales, said that since 2002, successive Australian governments have passed more than 80 pieces of legislation, purportedly for national security reasons, that go far beyond those of other countries that have higher terrorist threat ratings. And they go beyond freedom of the press, he said. “There’s an even larger number of laws that go to the suppression of free speech,” he said. “It’s extended to doctors in overseas detention camps facing jail for talking about conditions there.” As part of the campaign, known as #righttoknow, Australian news outlets have highlighted instances when their reporters were blocked from obtaining documents under Freedom of Information requests that bear little connection to national security matters. The Daily Telegraph, a News Corp. tabloid, referenced stories on confidentiality clauses preventing the publishing of assaults against older patients in care facilities and suppression orders on the identity of sex offenders as examples of government secrecy that had become endemic. It said its redacted front page was “a bleak warning of a future where laws continue to erode media freedom so governments can cover up information from the public.” The #righttoknow coalition has six key demands at the heart of its campaign, including a review of Freedom of Information laws, the right to contest search warrants before they are issued, the overhaul of defamation laws and limits on what documents can be marked secret. “What is normal here is exceptional overseas, but people just don’t see that,” Mr. Williams said. “We’re almost in this bubble with our own quite unique system of lacking decent free speech protection.” Currently, some federal cabinet documents can be marked secret for 25 years, whether they relate to national security matters or not. Freedom of Information requests often return to a journalist months after they were initially made, heavily redacted. “The government has been unable to point to an example where a genuine media outlet” has risked national security, said an editorial in The Sydney Morning Herald, “and we take our responsibilities in this area very seriously.” “But the public has a right to know about abuses of power and mismanagement which, under current laws, governments effectively have the power to cover up,” it continued. A parliamentary inquiry into press freedom, set up after the June raids, will release its findings next month. Prime Minister Scott Morrison has said that while he believes in freedom of the press, no one is above the law. “The rule of law has to be applied evenly and fairly in the protection of our broader freedoms,” he said. “And so I don’t think anyone is, I hope, looking for a leave pass on any of those things, I wouldn’t and nor should anyone else.” Jamie Tarabay is based in Sydney, Australia, and has been a foreign correspondent for 20 years. She has reported from around Australia as well as from countries across the Middle East, Southeast Asia, Europe and the United States. @jamietarabay A version of this article appears in print on Section B, Page 3 of the New York edition with the headline: Australian Media Protest a Rise in Secrecy Laws.

Medium.com,Society,Why privacy will be a key public policy issue for the Trudeau government — and what it means for…,World,https://medium.com/@xtinaonos/why-privacy-will-be-a-key-public-policy-issue-for-the-trudeau-government-and-what-it-means-for-d01cd24c6118?source=topic_page---------227------------------1," Canada’s future as a global hub of technology innovation is both impressive and full of potential. Data-powered artificial intelligence (AI) is expected to add CDN$17 trillion to the global economy by 2030. How much of this value is actually reaped by Canada will depend on the policies of the newly re-elected government. It also will depend on organizations prioritizing cybersecurity and data accountability to achieve consumer trust and protect the privacy rights of Canadians. Canada’s economy is fast shifting away from natural resources and more toward digital technologies. A data-driven economy gives Canadians access to technologies with the potential to improve, if not solve, important social issues like education, healthcare and homelessness. It also creates high-value jobs, supports new business opportunities and enhances products and services. By 2023, an estimated 50 billion Internet-enabled devices will connect more people than ever before. We may see smart robots being used to help with basic house chores (especially by seniors), and semi-autonomous vehicles being the new mode of transport for many Canadians. All of this technology will require access to massive amounts of data. All of this technology will require access to massive amounts of data. Maintaining consumer trust and positive engagement in the data economy requires effective privacy protections. The high levels of privacy concern that Canadians have need to be addressed also. Awareness of consumer privacy concerns has steadily increased over the last few years. This is in large part due to major events including the Edward Snowden revelations, introduction of the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) in the EU, and the Cambridge Analytica scandal. According to PwC’s 2019 Consumer Intelligence Series, 85 percent of consumers say cybersecurity and privacy risks are among the biggest of any issues facing society today. The re-elected Trudeau government announced their vision of privacy as Canada’s Digital Charter in May 2019 and was represented within their re-election platform. The Charter promises Canadians stronger privacy protections including: the ability to erase personal data from online platforms; increased transparency on how Canadians’ data are being used; and more enforcement powers for the Privacy Commissioner of Canada. Just as important, it seeks a balance between privacy protection and business growth; it recognizes that regulation must not stifle innovation. The Liberals have been accused by their political opponents and privacy advocates of not doing enough to protect privacy. To the contrary, in the last four years the Trudeau government has introduced mandatory data breach notification and has expanded the powers of the Office of Privacy Commissioner of Canada (OPC). It also led to a series of thoughtful, nationwide consultations with industry, governments, academia and consumer groups. These have culminated into a set of privacy reform recommendations included in the Digital Charter. Updates to the privacy law governing the private sector, the Personal Information and Electronic Document Act (PIPEDA), could be initiated any time after the new government is formed and Parliament resumes in early 2020. The real challenge for the re-elected Trudeau government will be working with, and getting support from, other parties during a coalition or minority tenure tin order to effectively pass legislation. The Liberals also could be faced with a vote of non-confidence which would result in another election being called (historically this has happened within two years of a minority government). The Digital Charter champions a healthy harmonization of protecting Canadians’ privacy while fueling business innovation. It recognizes the importance of sound, balanced government policies for privacy and cybersecurity, as well as the need for industry measures — including codes, standards and certifications — to enhance privacy accountability and enhance trust with consumers. Companies need to support the vision of the Digital Charter and be more transparent about how they collect and use personal data; enhance security measures; and articulate the value of data-run services. This will help create the trust that is absolutely essential to ensure full participation by all Canadians in the emerging data-powered economy. Canada’s emerging leadership in tech will be best fortified with policies that enable companies to be innovative and competitive on the global stage, while effectively protecting the privacy of Canadians. Citizens and companies across the country should not have to choose privacy at the expense of economic prosperity, or vice versa. It is critical for our newly re-elected Liberal government to accomplish the dual objectives of business innovation and citizen trust.

Medium.com,Society,"From Half a World Away, They Await; Venezuelan Americans Watch Friends and Family Caught in the…",World,https://medium.com/@BethelleDesmond/from-half-a-world-away-they-await-venezuelan-americans-watch-friends-and-family-caught-in-the-1f095ad034fc?source=topic_page---------228------------------1," I
t’s almost not believable. Two governments running in parallel? The refusal of international aid to fuel the denial of the existence of a humanitarian crisis? 3.7 million people pouring across borders in search of food, medicine and clean water? But sadly, it is true for Venezuela. The madness we see erupting now in Venezuela has been seething for some time. Hard, cruel statistics tell the story. A harrowing 94% of Venezuelans are living in poverty. Food imports, which account for 75% of diets, dove 66% from 2012 to 2016, while consumer prices rose by 800% and GNP contracted by 18.6%. To drive these numbers down to an individual level, a recent university study just out indicates that Venezuelans reported losing, on average, 11 kilograms (24 lbs) in body weight last year due to malnutrition. With economic crisis comes health crises. Venezuela’s health care system is in a state of collapse. Hospitals, crippled by power outages, struggle to give even rudimentary care. Operating without essential supplies, hospitals are asking patients to bring in their own surgical gear, and medicine. All this with one-third of physicians having already left the country since 2014. The country of Venezuela is in a free fall — and no one seems to know how to stop it. So what happened to Venezuela, or ‘Little Venice’ as Spanish explorers named it, in praise of the beautiful seaside homes erected there. As the local lore would tell it, despite having created a sophisticated Andean civilization, the indigenous peoples of Venezuela didn’t need to employ the farming tactics they discovered — so bountiful was the land, ripe with the fruits and fish from their forests and waters. Through the epic explorations of Christopher Columbus and others, Venezuela was discovered and colonized by Spain starting in 1522. The area was exploited, and natives were held captive as slaves, eventually fomenting uprisings across the region. From 1819 to 1825, Colombia, Venezuela, Ecuador, Peru, and Bolivia were all liberated. But successful independence did not come easily, bringing with it decades of civil strife, wars, and coups. Conflict raged on with a succession of dictators, and revisions of the country’s constitution, all seemingly aimed at keeping Venezuela’s bounty in the hands of the few. Finally, in the early 1900s, however, the nation was given a foot up with the discovery of huge oil reserves, which began to pump much needed capital into the otherwise agricultural economy. Oil prices boomed, but peaked in the late 1970s, dropping precipitously in the ’80s, once again pitching the nation into crisis. “Dutch Disease,” or the practice of growing only one sector of the economy, disadvantaging all others, spurred the initial demise of Venezuela. Slumping oil prices meant no capital for infrastructure improvements, crippling Venezuela’s oil production. Riots flared throughout the country and, in turn, were violently repressed. Conditions deteriorated so quickly, and to such a large degree, even economic experts were stunned. Luis Almagro, secretary general of the Organization of American States (OAS), was quoted as noting, “I have never seen a country going down so fast, at every level: politically, economically, socially.” Venezuela’s modern political landscape began with the presidency of Hugo Chávez Frías in 1997, who famously removed term limits on presidential rule and was able to remain in power until his death in 2013. Chavez was succeeded by Nicolás Maduro who attempted to initiate several socioeconomic programs, but abject poverty and corruption persisted. In May 2017, Maduro announced that he would rewrite the constitution and skip the next public election, drawing widespread dissent across the nation. In June 2017, an opposition-led National Assembly announced it would invoke articles of the Venezuelan constitution in order to establish a new government. On January 23, 2019, the President of the Venezuelan National Assembly, Juan Guaidó, was deemed the country’s interim President by that body, and was immediately recognized as the legitimate Venezuelan President by many Western nations, including the United States. In turn, Maduro disputed Guaido’s claim and promptly cut off ties with nations recognizing the Assembly President, closing borders with Brazil and causing countries around the globe to shut embassies and remove personnel from Venezuela. After weeks of paralyzing power outages, lapses in cell service and limited access to water and medicine, tens of thousands of Venezuelans have taken to the streets to demand the resignation of Maduro, who many hold responsible for their crippled economy. Citizens already suffering from years of hyperinflation say the crisis has worsened over the past month. Maduro continues to accuse Guaido of orchestrating the massive power and phone service outages, accusing The National Assembly of cyber- and electromagnetic terrorism. The nation remains divided. Ironically, this relatively small nation has become the world’s stage as super powers align with warring politicians. Maduro is supported strongly by Russia, China, Iran, and Cuba while Guaido is backed by most of the Western world. Severe sanctions by the United States and their allies have yet to produce the desired result of pressuring Maduro’s government to secede, as the world’s communist nations continue to prop up the ruling party. Maduro, in turn, blames Guaido, and the U.S.- led sanctions for his citizens’ intense and enduring suffering. The conflict is heating to a boil, and Maduro has called for 1 million more volunteers for his 2 million strong army. Senior officers are being closely watched for any signs of transgressions, keeping the country locked in a deadly game of chicken, while the Venezuelan people continue to starve. How can we help Venezuela? To the relief of humanitarian aid workers globally, Maduro finally started to allow international health organizations to provide both the food and medicine Venezuelans so critically need. But where will aid continue to come from? Venezuelan Americans across the country are furiously organizing charitable efforts to answer just that question. Luis Quintero, owner and founder of Venezuelan restaurant El Cocotero in NYC, is one of those people. Luis came to this country 25 years ago and opened El Cocotero ten years later with his brother Arturo and partner, Mirian Mavarez. He has found over the years that although people have been forced to leave their homes, they still carry their country with them. That can be reflected by the amount of Venezuelan restaurants, businesses, and foundations cropping up wherever Venezuelans settle. “We always had the clear idea that we [wanted to be] a completely Venezuelan restaurant, from how our food is made, to our relationships with the customers — with the same passion as if we were in Venezuela.”, says Luis. “People who come to the restaurant end up feeling like they have connected with Venezuela directly. And they say, it’s like being at home…”. In addition to running two restaurants now, he and his partners have also started El Cocotero Foundation to help Venezuelan’s trapped in the ever worsening situation there. “The situation with the food in Venezuela is absolutely something you cannot believe. People are dying of starvation. And the government doesn’t do anything, doesn’t even care about it. People in Venezuela have to hunt, for even their basic needs. Milk, butter, eggs — the staples of any kitchen. Often even if food can be found, many people can’t afford to buy that food.” “Our foundation project began in 2002.”, explains Mirian. “In Venezuela it is problematic to talk about ‘humanitarian aid’, more so if it comes from the United States so we have a different strategy. We send our donations to individuals, and they are the ones that make the delivery to pediatric and geriatric medical centers. I believe we can change the situation…because we are so many now abroad, we have to have a coalition of forces. Venezuelans abroad have the desire to help, but not everyone has the means to. That’s why we are here to help. We will just keep working, keep helping.” Kathleen Kent — https://www.linkedin.com/in/kathleenlkent/ Nicholas Bayer — nicholas.k.bayer@gmail.com Vanessa Marquez — vanessa.marquez@nyu.edu"
Medium.com,Society,The Coming Collapse of World Water,World,https://medium.com/@TheW2O/the-coming-collapse-of-world-water-5ca1f4c347cd?source=topic_page---------229------------------1," “Water, water, everywhere, and not a drop to drink.” I come back to this familiar line from The Rime of the Ancient Mariner by Samuel Coleridge because it so desperately expresses the dilemma faced by people the world over with the crisis faced in the collapse of fresh water supply everywhere. It is no distant problem. It is all around us, even in places we think of as water rich — places on the ocean with watersheds and rivers that have formed and sustained local settlement and culture for generations, places like where I live today. The negative forces are well known: fossil fuel emissions, climate change, temperature rise, extreme weather, drought, deforestation, erosion, pollution, and unrestrained consumption by burgeoning population that does not expect water limits or exhaustion, does not conserve water resources, does not see the connection between available water and human health, or stands by to watch commodification and privatization of water under ever-increasing corporate control. It will never happen here, they say, until it does. Consider some startling facts. Today, over 17 countries are under high water stress, and one fourth of the world’s population faces running out of water. A recent World Resources Institute report lists the major world cities: São Paulo, Brazil; Chennai, India; Cape Town, South Africa; each of these have passed what is called “day zero,” when all the water behind the dams in the reservoirs is dry. A New York Times article describes certain conditions as follows: “Mexico City is drawing groundwater so fast that the city is literally sinking. Chaka, Bangladesh relies so heavily on its groundwater and its water-guzzling garment factories that it now draws water from aquifers hundreds of feet deep. Chennai’s thirsty residents, accustomed to relying on groundwater for years, are now finding there’s none left.” The Times continues, “World Resource Institute researchers concluded that of the cities with more than 3 millions residents — 33 of them — with a combined population of 255 million, face extremely high water stress, now, with serious repercussions for public health and social unrest. By 2030, the number of cities…is expected to rise to 45 and include nearly 470 million people.” Perhaps such numbers are so large and incomprehensible that they are meaningless. But the world is already experiencing the movement of “climate refugees,” from places where water scarcity and failed agriculture force re-location to other places, a vast social upheaval that is evident in the desperate personal passages from the Middle East and Africa to Europe. And the disruption is evident in the United States as well: in the southwest where drought and water limits are more evident and disruptive than ever; in the south, particularly Florida, where aquifer loss, salt water intrusion in wells, and the inexorable shrinking of the Everglades, threatens metropolitan coastal cities with exhaustion. We have wildfires in drought-prone areas everywhere that cannot be extinguished because there is no water. What must be done? The problem is enormous, but can only be first solved by local action. Existing local supplies must be conserved. Commercial operations, such as fracking, that poison waterways must be prohibited; watershed must be preserved and restored, to include adjacent land protection, development restrictions, and regulatory enforcement. Infrastructure for sanitation and distribution has been allowed to deteriorate as a result of political indifference, restricted budgets, and corruption. Necessary capital is limited and inhibited by tax resistance, often targeted to other apparently more pressing needs. All this must change. What actually can be a more pressing issue than a water supply inadequate to basic human need for families and communities, than irresponsible policy and facilities for general health and sanitation, than in equitable distribution through the conflicting demands or agriculture, manufacturing, and public need? Water is the most valuable natural resources on earth. I’ve said it over and over again: we can live without oil and gas, without diamonds and chocolate, without most anything else, but we cannot live without the water essential to nurture our bodies and our souls, each day and forever. What will it take to understand that this cannot be any longer sublimated to profits and vested interests, to complacency and ignorance? What will it take for every one of us to realize that if we fail on land then we must succeed on the sea? It will be to the ocean that we will inevitably turn for water to sustain our millions, the billions of our total world population, into the coming years, decades, and generations. We have the wealth, we have the technology, but when will we find the political will? We will wait until it is too late, and there is not a drop to drink?"
Medium.com,Society,Age versus Success - a Nigerian Tale,World,https://medium.com/@Uzoma_Sparkle/age-versus-success-a-nigerian-tale-25d6929bdfb8?source=topic_page---------230------------------1," I recently attended the 25th Nigeria Economic Summit - the mission of the event this year was to, “set a new agenda for Nigeria in the Fourth Industrial Revolution; and that marks a critical strategic shift to a competitive private sector economy by 2050”. Our President, His Excellency Muhammadu Buhari, gave the keynote, and the two-day programme was essentially a who’s who of industry titans for Nigeria. Dangote, the Emir of Kano and my own father, PGD, were part of the proceedings. These are people who have literally built Nigeria. However, one of the panels that struck me in particular was one focussed on Under 40s; Leadership in 2050: Insights from Tomorrow’s Leaders. Throughout the session, my ears pricked up, and in fact, I shuddered each and every time I heard, “you young ones have done really, really well so far”. Imagine having your accomplishments diminished so breezily? Imagine, in your late thirties, being referred to as a youngster, after you’ve grown your business in a competitive environment? Why do older Nigerians feel the need to make the distinction between age and success? France’s President Macron is 41 years old. He became President of his country at 39 years old. Would we refer to him as a “youngster” and commend him on his achievements to-date, in such a patronising way? The man is a statesman. The whole dialogue and means of addressing [and keeping in check] the so-called “youngsters” irked me. But it did not surprise me. I have been in many situations, in meetings with older or titled people, where the salutation is ""Young man”, with them hastily then making comments to ensure I knew that they knew my father. Whether intentional or not, to set the tone of the meeting I would not know, but a seed had been sown... Still, the language around our young people at the Economic Summit made me consider the cold hard facts around age-bias in Nigeria. We are a nation of youth, dominated from the top down by leaders in their sixties and seventies. Over 80% of Nigeria’s population is under 30, yet where is the representation of so many millions of people, in our Government, Federal and even Corporate bodies? The disconnect between the two ages is almost two generations. How will that serve us as a country for the future? Quite simply, it can’t and it won’t. However, let me be clear - this is not old age-bashing in Nigeria. I am not calling for an end of over 65s in Government or positions of power and I am not naïve to the social and cultural mores that have long dictated our hierarchical systems. There is a huge need for experienced operators at every level of our society; experience that does, often, come with age. However, our reliance on age as an indicator of ability is not helpful. What I am arguing for is more diversity, more space at the table for younger people to influence the same levels of society. Whilst youth initiatives are commendable in nature, they are also more often than not tokenistic and fruitless. The majority of young people’s voices are not currently being heard; we do not have a structure in place in Government, or indeed in large corporations, or indeed any large-scale bodies [private or public] that will allow for this, because they are all centred around age + experience. A case in point is the banking and financial services industry. Fola Adeola was 36 when he started GTB and voluntarily retired at 48 before 50. Atedo Peterside started IBTC, the foremost investment banking powerhouse at the time, at 33. These men are recognised as some of the most formidable financiers in the country. All from taking a risk in their thirties. Today, with the way the CBN has structured the regulatory system, you have to be at least 45 to become an MD of a bank, simply because the rules dictate that you need 20 years’ post first degree and a professional qualification, or higher degree, and of those 20 years, 15 must be in banking. This is taking into account leaving school at 22 or 23 + time out for NYSC [an absolute given for a Nigerian bank MD]. What does 20 years’ banking experience bring to a world where financial services is changing rapidly and physical entities such as pass books and cheque books will now just make good history stories? How will we drive forward the banking sector in Nigeria like this? These successful people were young when they started. The system allowed them then, but not now. Atedo Peterside has summed this up succinctly, “this economy is rigged against the youth, we are killing the youths from growing”. His in-depth discussion on this is highly recommended viewing if you want to know more about how older people, who were allowed to grow then, can now see the challenges that are stacked in the way of today’s 22 year old entrepreneur. We need more visionary statesmen and women, like Atedo Peterside, to be outspoken and push the agenda to secure a pathway for younger entrepreneurs in Nigeria Looking at the new wave of businesses that are addressing head-on the very real challenges business in Nigeria throws at us - payments and logistics, for example, we see the likes of Paystack and Kobo360, started by young people, are building simple, transparent solutions to age-old problems. The people behind these companies are using technology to catalyse and scale entire sectors. They understand the power of tech to make an impact. The future of Africa is digital - the adoption and strategic implementation of technology will be central to everything we do to build the country. The global technological revolution is currently owned and deployed by the younger generation. Not just in Nigeria. Facebook, Apple, Microsoft - all companies started and grown by young people, and all companies that are massive driving forces in business. Back to Nigeria, we know that many of our country’s problems will be solved by mass adoption of technology. What do I mean by this? Using drones in agriculture, applying fintech solutions to bring millions more into the financial system via mobile, using robotics to scale and automate manufacturing processes… the list could go on. So what can be done? I reiterate, I am not advocating instant board or C-suite dismissal for the over 65s; there is a place for age + experience. But we can no longer revere and prioritise age and status over youth and innovation, as we have done for so long in Nigeria. The mindset must be that we all, at all ages, continue to learn and re-learn. Just as 30 year-olds are learning, so must 65 year olds. We can’t assume that the sum of their experiences after 40 years of work, qualifies them for business in 2019. Global work and enterprise are changing fast, and we must all adapt if we are to make sure Nigeria stays competitive. I apply this to myself as well - I worked in finance and corporate banking for 25 years. In reality, I probably have only 5 years’ experience in terms of setting up my current venture, Sparkle. And even with that, I apply the learn and re-learn mantra to my decision making periodically. Nigeria discovered oil 70 years ago, how well did we exploit that resource? Today we have a dynamic entrepreneurial class of leaders, making a name for Nigeria from the innovate creative solutions they have created for Nigeria and Africa. How well are we going to exploit this resource this time? Not by keeping them out of the action, wheeling them out for their own special panels once in a while. We urgently need more respect and acknowledgement from the ruling [political and business] elite of the accomplishments and value Under 40s bring to Nigeria, in terms of business. Let’s not belittle the “youngsters” by giving them a pat on the back and a panel dedicated to youth, whilst the big boys and girls play everywhere else. Let’s not throw them scraps from the table. Let’s get more young people a seat at the table. We have to do better with the real engine of growth, our youths, than we have done with our oil in Nigeria."

While this came as a surprise to many, it should not have. Donald Trump began his campaign criticizing the interventionist administrations preceding him, such as Bush Administration with Dick Cheney and the Obama administration with his opponent, Hillary Clinton. As the 2020 election crept closer, Trump needed legitimacy for his claims to be an isolationist (especially following the 2017 Syrian airstrikes and the increased rate of drone strikes under his presidency). While domestically useful, this move will push away critical allies and give ISIS what it needs to restart its caliphate."

Medium.com,Society,Has the US Already Declared a Cyber War on Iran?,World,https://medium.com/citizen-truth/has-the-us-already-declared-a-cyber-war-on-iran-fdf5597eab7b?source=topic_page---------233------------------1," The U.S. is believed to have launched at least two secretive cyber attacks on Iran in the last six months, the most recent came following two drone attacks on Saudi Arabian oil facilities on September 14. To the best of public knowledge, Iran has not conducted any cyber attacks on the U.S in recent months. But given the growing tensions between the two countries and their shared desire to avoid firing bullets, cyberspace could be emerging as the new alternative battlefield of choice. The ongoing U.S.-Iran tension was triggered by Washington’s withdrawal from the Iran Nuclear Deal, known as the Joint Comprehension Plan of Action (JCPOA). The U.S. under President Trump claimed the deal was not adequate in halting Iran’s nuclear ambitions despite repeated assurances by an international monitoring agency that Iran was in compliance with the deal. President Trump then also reimposed sanctions on Tehran after withdrawing from the JCPOA. The rift escalated after Iran announced it would reduce its compliance to the JCPOA by enriching uranium exceeding the level allowed in the JCPOA. That announcement was followed by a series of attacks on oil tankers crossing the Strait of Hormuz which the U.S. blames on Iran despite a lack of evidence supporting the U.S. claims. The September 14 cyber attack was reported by two unidentified American officials to Reuters who claimed the operation was aimed at crippling Iran’s ability to spread propaganda. The U.S. attack came in retaliation for the drone strikes on Saudi oil facilities which the U.S. believes Iran carried out despite Houthi rebels in Yemen claiming responsibility. The American officials told Reuters the attack affected “physical hardware” without specifying more detail. The Pentagon refused to comment on the Reuters report, stating, “As a matter of policy and for operational security, we do not discuss cyberspace operations, intelligence, or planning.” Iran also denied the Reuters report with Iran’s Minister of Communications and Information Technology Mohammad Javad Azari-Jahromi telling Reuters: “They must have dreamt it.” It’s possible but unknown whether Washington has carried out any other cyber attacks on Iran since the end of September. However, one thing is clear, the September attack on Iran was not a first and suggests cyber warfare may be increasingly favored by U.S. administrations intent on avoiding actual military confrontations. The U.S. Army conducted a previous cyber attack targeting Tehran last June as retaliation following U.S. allegations that Iran had shot down American surveillance drones entering Iranian airspace. According to The Washington Post, President Trump himself ordered the U.S. Cyber Command to carry out the Iran cyber attack following the drone shooting and recent attacks on oil tankers. The order for the attack reportedly came the same day that Trump called off airstrikes targeting Iran. The attack hit computers used to control the launching of rockets and missiles, but no casualties were reported, according to The Post. U.S. officials claimed the June cyber attack hit a “critical database used by Iran’s paramilitary arm to plot attacks against oil tankers and degraded Tehran’s ability to covertly target shipping traffic in the Persian Gulf,” as the N.Y. Times reported. Officials also brandished the attacks a widespread success, claiming the attacks crippled Iran for months. The Obama administration also reportedly favored cyber attacks. In 2016, a documentary called Zero Days alleged the Obama administration spent millions developing a cyber operation known as Nitro Zeus to be used as a contingency plan if negotiations with Iran never came to fruition. The operation was never launched due to the successful signing of the JCPOA. Despite U.S. concern about an Iranian cyber threat, it is Iran that is more vulnerable to such cyber attacks and was on the receiving end of perhaps the most damaging industrial cyber attack of all time — Stuxnet. Though neither has openly admitted it, the U.S. and Israel are believed to have jointly developed the malware Stuxnet, a powerful computer virus that paralyzed Iran’s nuclear program in 2010. A 2012 report by the N.Y. Times said Stuxnet was a cyber threat effort started under the George W. Bush administration and continued by Barack Obama known among intelligence officials by the code name “Operation Olympic Games.” The attack severely damaged Iran’s nuclear enrichment program by damaging an estimated 1,000 of the 5,000 centrifuges used for uranium enrichment at Iran’s Natanz facility. The N.Y. Times described the attack as “America’s first sustained use of cyberweapons.” While Stuxnet was initially used to target Iran’s nuclear facility in Natanz, the malware accidentally escaped and spread throughout the global web. Stuxnet’s legacy, however, is the escalation of cyber war, achieving results previously only obtained through conventional warfare. “It appears to be the first time the United States has repeatedly used cyberweapons to cripple another country’s infrastructure, achieving with computer code what, until then, could be accomplished only by bombing a country or sending in agents to plant explosives,” the Times reported. Following Stuxnet was another cyber attack on Iran named Flame, discovered in 2012 but possibly developed around the same time as Stuxnet. The Russian anti-virus firm Kaspersky Lab told Wired that Flame “dwarfed” Stuxnet in size and complexity. but that its similarity to Stuxnet suggested it was likely developed by a nation-state and perhaps by the same group that developed Stuxnet. According to Wired, Flame was able to turn on a computer’s microphone and record audio, take frequent screenshots of a computer’s activity and send them to an unknown recipient, as well as act as a Bluetooth beacon and scan for Bluetooth devices to grab contact information from. Though the U.S. has not admitted to developing Flame, the Washington Post wrote in 2012 that the U.S. and Israel were responsible for the development and deployment of Flame on Iranian targets as part of the original Operation Olympic Games. It’s unclear how sophisticated Iranian cyber capability is and how serious of a cyber threat Iran can pose. However, the Stuxnet attack is credited with accelerating Iran’s cyber capability and providing Iran with many valuable lessons to help develop its cyber warfare technology. A June 2019 assessment of Iran’s cyber capabilities by the Center for Strategic & International Studies (CSIS) described Iran as having “rapidly improved its cyber capabilities” though “it is still not in the top rank of cyber powers.” “Three military organizations play leading roles in cyber operations: the Iranian Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC), the Basij, and Iran’s ‘Passive Defense Organization (NPDO).’ The IRGC is the perpetrator behind a series of incidents aimed at American targets, Israeli critical infrastructure, Saudi Arabia, and other Gulf States. The Basij, a civilian paramilitary organization controlled by the IGRC, manages what Basij leaders say are 120,000 cyberwar volunteers. The number is probably exaggerated, but the Basij uses its connections with universities and religious schools to recruit a proxy hacker force,” the CSIS report detailed. While the CSIS report admits Iran’s cyber sophistication is far from the U.S.’ it warns that poorly defended U.S. targets are vulnerable: “Iran has probed U.S. critical infrastructure for targeting purposes. How successful an attack would be is another matter. The kind of massive denial of service attacks Iran used against major banks in 2011–2013 would be less effective today given improved defenses. The most sophisticated kinds of cyberattack (such as Stuxnet or the Russian actions in the Ukraine) are still beyond Iranian capabilities, but poorly defended targets in the United States (of which there are many) are vulnerable — smaller banks or local power companies, for example, or poorly secured pipeline control systems. What stops Iranian action is not a shortage of targets but rather questions about the utility of such attacks.” In addition to the 2011–2013 Iranian attack on the U.S. financial industry, Iran reportedly launched a successful malware attack on Saudi Aramco in 2012 and attempted to gain remote access to gate controls of a New York dam in 2013. Last May, the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency, a federal agency tasked to protect the U.S. from cyber threats, claimed that Iran is likely to carry out digital attacks on the U.S. using destructive malware. “Iranian regime actors and proxies are increasingly using destructive ‘wiper’ attacks, looking to do much more than steal data and money. These efforts are often enabled through common tactics like spear phishing, password spraying, and credential stuffing. What might start as an account compromise, where you think you might just lose data, can quickly become a situation where you’ve lost your whole network,” CISA said in a statement. However as the CSIS report stated, “Iran’s development of cyber power is a reaction to its vulnerabilities. Iran is the regular target of foreign cyber espionage.” Iran, most likely, does not want a cyber war with the U.S. knowing it is outmatched, but Iran may already be trapped in just that. If one believes the CSIS report, “What Iran’s leaders fear most, however, is their own population and the risk that the internet will unleash something like the Arab Spring.” Yet, as IRGC Deputy Commander Hossein Salami said in May of 2019, Iran is already caught “in an atmosphere of a full-blown intelligence war with the US and the front of enemies of the Revolution and the Islamic system . . . This atmosphere is a combination of psychological warfare and cyber operation, military provocations, public diplomacy, and intimidation tactics.” Read the original article and sign up for our newsletter at https://citizentruth.org"
Medium.com,Society,"The Results Are In, Now What? Next Steps and Predictions After the 43rd Canadian Federal Election",World,https://medium.com/@sachaforstner/the-results-are-in-now-what-next-steps-and-predictions-after-the-43rd-canadian-federal-election-4ceeb05f1ecc?source=topic_page---------234------------------1," After 40 long days of campaigning, the results are in. Canadians have elected 338 MPs to sit in the lower house of the 43rd Parliament of Canada. At the time I write this, 157 of those MPs are set to be Liberals, 121 will be Conservatives, 32 will belong to the Bloc Québécois, 24 will be New Democrats, three will hail from the Green Party, and one — interestingly — will be an independent. These numbers might shift slightly as the final polls report in and mandatory recounts are completed in the ensuing days, but suffice it to say they won’t change much. The dynamics of this Parliament will be different than the last. The governing Liberal Party has lost its majority, the Conservative Official Opposition has been toughened up, and the Bloc Quebecois are resurgent after more than eight years without official party status. So what happens, now that the ballots are cast and the votes counted? How do we go from election night speeches to Question Period in the House? And with no majority, how will governing work? In the ensuing paragraphs, I hope to answer some of those questions. The Right Honourable Justin Trudeau, leader of the Liberal Party, remains the 23rd Prime Minister of Canada, at the head of the 29th Canadian Ministry, as it was sworn in on November 4th, 2015. Nothing about the past six weeks has altered that fact, and — based on the results of the election — it doesn’t appear that the demise of the Ministry is imminent. So the Government will be continuing. Nothing special needs to happen for this to occur — no formal audience at Rideau Hall, no ceremony for the Governor General to perform. Parliaments and Governments are two different things. We elected a new Parliament, and the Government headed by the Prime Minister carries on until it is resigned or dismissed. It should be noted that legally, there is no distinction between so-called “majority” and “minority” governments. Cabinet, through the Crown, carries the same executive powers it always does. That means the Liberals will retain exclusive control over: Of course, some things will change. Having just been through an election, with a set of platform commitments to implement, and cognizant of the fact it no longer holds a majority in Parliament, the Government will doubtless spend some time revisiting the structural choices it made in 2015 regarding core machinery of government questions such as Cabinet committees and decision-making processes within the Prime Minister’s Office and throughout government. It will also be necessary to make some changes to the Cabinet. Some incumbent ministers lost their seats as MPs this time around, and though it is not obligatory to be a Parliamentarian in order to serve in Cabinet, it is a very well-respected custom, and a central aspect of responsible government. We can expect a significant Cabinet shuffle sometime in the next couple weeks. This shuffle will take into account a wide range of considerations, including: As if that wasn’t already complicated enough, the shuffle will also have a secondary goal of rewarding some “star” candidates who won hard-fought seats, and shoring up support in ridings that were nearly lost. While this article will not speculate as to who might be in and who might be out, I will provide a brief outline of the process: One question that is worth asking is whether the PM will choose to include any Senators in his revamped Cabinet. The Leader of the Government in the Senate was not a Minister during the 42nd Parliament, but was during the 41st Parliament (in the previous Government). However, if Trudeau wants to make sure he has Saskatchewan or Alberta representation at the Cabinet table, this would be one of the few avenues left open to him (since he will no longer have MPs from those regions in the new Parliament). Absent a majority, the Government will need to test Parliament’s confidence relatively soon in order to retain enough legitimacy to govern seriously. Presently, all the election results are being verified in each riding by the Chief Returning Officers. Some of those results will require recounts — maybe even judicial recounts, depending on whether they trigger a particular legal threshold. As each result is verified, the Chief Returning Officer for the riding enters the name of the elected member on the writ of election previously issued by the Elections Canada, and then returns the writ to the Chief Electoral Officer. At this moment, an MP is officially elected. The latest date for all writs to be returned is November 11th. Before an MP can take their seat in the House, however, they must be sworn in. Although the Governor General can perform the swearing-in, in practice the responsibility is delegated to the Clerk of the House of Commons. Every MP — including the Prime Minister and the Leader of Her Majesty’s Loyal Opposition (a position that will again be held by The Honourable Andrew Scheer), must take the oath (a simple and straightforward oath of allegiance to the Queen of Canada). An MP’s term of office lasts until the new Parliament is dissolved prior to the next election (5 years at maximum). But when will the new Parliament actually sit? By virtue of a proclamation issued by the Governor General back in September, Parliament is currently set to be recalled on November 18th. However, history suggests that the Prime Minister will request that this date be prorogued, possibly by up to a few weeks, while his government works on putting together a Speech from the Throne. And some thought must be given to the task of obtaining the House’s confidence. All governments, without exception, must hold the confidence of a majority of MPs in the House of Commons in order to continue governing. If confidence is lost, then either the Government must resign or Parliament must dissolve for a fresh election. So how do we test this all-important principle? The concept of confidence essentially refers to the House’s willingness to let the Government keep doing the things it wants to do without rebuke. This means the House must be broadly in favour of a) the Government’s central policy agenda, and b) the Government’s fiscal and spending priorities. It must also be willing to appropriate all necessary funds from the Consolidated Revenue Fund (the place where your tax dollars go) for the Treasury, when asked to do so by the Governor General (via something called a royal recommendation, which gets attached to government bills when spending is required to implement them). All of this is to say, the things you expect to be confidence motions, are: It goes without saying that explicit motions of non-confidence (usually tabled by opposition members on days when the opposition controls the agenda) are also confidence issues. Finally, it should be noted that these are just the items where the Prime Minister must do something if the Government loses the vote. The Crown will view such a failure as a loss of confidence, and expect the PM to either offer advice or a resignation. However, since the PM can at any time (after roughly 6–9 months) advise the Governor General to dissolve Parliament and hold a new election, his Government is free to say they consider any other bill a matter of confidence, and — in effect — dare the opposition to trigger an election by voting against it. Such measures are not always well-received, however. If confidence is lost within the first six months after the election, the likely scenario is that the PM resigns and the Governor General invites the opposition leader to try forming government. Of course, if nobody can “make it work,” then an election will occur. So how does the PM secure confidence, without a majority? He has a few options. Canadian media often throws around the word “coalition” incorrectly. It has a specific meaning: a government made up of multiple parties working together. In a Coalition Government, all parties involved have seats at the Cabinet table. They work collaboratively, and not in opposition. Disputes between coalition partners are settled internally. Such arrangements can be seen in other countries, such as Germany or New Zealand. A formal coalition in Canada is very unlikely. The last time we saw one, the world was at war. The reason for this is because our electoral system generally rewards parties with unique value propositions, and being the lesser partner in a coalition is very similar to disappearing from sight (and ergo, a poor showing at the polls in the next vote). A more conceivable arrangement is a Supply and Confidence Agreement between the Government and another party. Such an agreement outlines the other party’s promise to back the Government on confidence matters, provided the Government delivers on specific policy objectives. The lesser partner is not in government, and thus can still broadly oppose (ie criticze) the governing party. The Government of BC has such an agreement. Nevertheless, the 43rd Parliament of Canada, a similar arrangement is unlikely, simply because there are so many places the Government can go for support, depending on what it wants to do. Rather than make specific concessions to one specific party in writing, the Government can get more done by dividing and conquering, turning to different parties for backing on different objectives. This ad hoc approach ultimately allows the Government to implement as much of its agenda as possible, and is the approach most likely to occur in the new Parliament. Of course, minority Parliaments in Canada rarely last more than about two-and-a-half years. Quite a few have lasted for a year or less. So it may not be long before Canada gets to enjoy the past 40 days all over again."
Medium.com,Society,Why It’s Taking so Long to Deliver Brexit,World,https://medium.com/@frankparker/why-its-taking-so-long-to-deliver-brexit-90564fa92e23?source=topic_page---------235------------------1," My Perspective I have been a proponent of the European ‘project’ ever since I was old enough to take an interest in national and international politics. I recall the UK’s repeated applications to join what was then the 6 member EEC in the early 1960s, and disappointment at our repeated rejection by France. In 1988 I became a founder member of the Liberal Democrats, having previously been a member of the Liberal Party. I served both parties as a councillor at county and district level. During that time I had the opportunity to visit some of the EU institutions and to learn something about the way they operate. Upon retirement, 13 years ago this month, I left the UK and came to live in Ireland. My son, his Irish wife and their daughter were already here. So I am one of the approximately 3 million UK citizens domiciled in another EU country. I believe passionately in the ideals that underpin the EU. In the years of the cold war it provided a bastion of political and economic strength against the might of the Soviet Union. Of course NATO provided the military backing, but economic and political unity were, I believe, key components of the defence of Western civilisation against communism. With the collapse of the Soviet Union it was important that the countries of Eastern Europe, released from the yoke of Russian domination, were welcomed into the EU and provided with the opportunity to realise the benefits of life in a free society. There is far more, culturally and historically, that unites us than divides us. We now face new threats, from climate change to the rise of China as a global power. European solidarity therefore remains a priority. The European Union The EU is first and foremost an international trading bloc. The Single Market ensures that goods traded between the member nations are produced to an agreed set of standards in circumstances that minimise the exploitation of workers. The Customs Union, by removing tariffs on goods traded between member nations, removes the need for customs barriers at the borders between those nations. At the same time the UK is able to take advantage of free trade agreements reached between the EU and around 70 other nations in order to trade with them on favourable terms which will need to be renegotiated if the UK leaves. In common with other members, the UK has secured exemptions from certain of the rules and regulations that enforce these standards. It is not a member of the Eurozone, retaining its own currency. It is not a member of Schengen, a scheme that facilitates visa free travel, residence and work throughout those nations that are signed up to it. Instead, the UK, as a member of the Single Market, is obliged to permit freedom of movement of people for the purpose of work and education. This does not extend to the automatic right to social welfare payments. The citizens of one member nation, whilst resident in another, must be economically self-supporting. If, after a reasonable period, they have not found a job, they are obliged to leave. The UK government chose not to enforce this aspect of the legislation which many UK citizens were, and, it seems, still are, unaware of. Similarly, when Eastern European nations became members there was a transition period during which existing members were permitted to control the number of workers they accepted from those nations. Again, the UK government chose not to apply those controls, probably under pressure from business sectors, such as agriculture and hospitality, that saw an opportunity to exploit the availability of comparatively cheap labour to do jobs that UK citizens were unwilling to take on. Sometimes such migrant workers were employed in breach of EU laws of which ordinary citizens were unaware so that, once again, the EU was blamed for creating conditions that were actually well within the ability of the UK government to control had it chosen to do so. The Budget The fundamental principle under which the EU budget operates is that the richest nations contribute and the poorest regions, some of which are within the richest nations, receive. The simple theory behind this is that by helping the poorer nations and regions to develop and, thereby, improve the economic welfare of their citizens, the possibility of conflict over resources is reduced. It is a principle with which not everyone agrees and is certainly one of the factors underlying the desire of some UK citizens to see the UK leave. So long as it can be shown that supported schemes meet specific criteria, the way that EU funds are distributed and spent is left to the recipient national or local governments. Thus it is unfair to blame the EU if such funds are used to support unnecessary or inappropriate schemes. They are intended to be used for social and economic infrastructure developments that increase the ability of the recipient region to attract private investment that creates long term employment. If you want the EU to exercise greater control over such spending you need more, not fewer bureaucrats, and to give up, not reclaim, local control. The Exercise of Democracy In most EU member states elections are conducted using systems that produce a result in which the number of representatives of each party in parliament or legislative assembly is roughly proportional to the number of votes cast for that party. This is also true of the EU institutions. The practical effect of this is that, more often than not, no one party has a parliamentary majority and two or more parties have to come together to agree a programme that is broadly in the national interest. That also tends to mean a centrist approach, either centre-left or centre-right. The extremes at either end of the political spectrum have little say. It should be no surprise that I, as a centrist, approve of such systems and the results they produce. In the UK, however, the system regularly produces a majority for one party (not always the same party) even though that party may have fewer than 40% of the votes cast. Thus the majority of UK citizens are used to a situation in which their needs are ignored in favour of those of a minority. The 2016 referendum provided a rare opportunity in which they were assured, albeit dishonestly, that the wishes of the majority would be respected. It was presented as a simple choice between leaving or remaining, with the question of what kind of relationship, if any, the UK might seek to establish with the EU after it left, buried under a fog of speculation. In or out of the Customs Union? The Single Market? A relationship like the one Norway has? Or Switzerland? The Irish Problem This is something that was barely touched upon during the 2016 campaign but has proved to be an impenetrable stumbling block ever since. To understand why, it is necessary to review, however briefly, 850 years of British and Irish history and religion. Around 100 years after the Norman conquest of England two childhood friends became respectively King of England and Archbishop of Canterbury. They disagreed about the extent to which the King should interfere in the affairs of the Church. At some point the king is supposed to have said something along the lines of “Will someone rid me of this troublesome priest.” Like most such remarks uttered in moments of frustration it was not meant to be taken literally. But a few knights who wanted to curry favour with the king did. They murdered the Archbishop in his cathedral. It so happened that the Pope was exercised about the fact that the Church authorities in Ireland were backsliding so, when an Irish provincial king was deposed, he used that fact to persuade the English (Norman) king to come to his aid. The king, needing to appease the Pope, agreed. As a direct result, Ireland became subject to the English Crown, its land parcelled out to assorted knights and barons who had assisted with the invasion. Move forward 4 centuries to the reformation and the long period of conflict in the British Isles between protestantism and Roman Catholicism. The Irish refused to be reformed, despite Cromwell’s massacre of tens of thousands and the confiscation of land from Catholic owners, giving it to protestants. These religious wars were effectively brought to an end when a Dutch Prince defeated a largely Catholic army on Irish soil and was crowned King. Troublesome tenants were removed from Scottish land to be replaced by sheep. They were granted large parts of Ulster in a further attempt to dilute Catholic influence on the island. At the beginning of the 19th century Ireland, which had hitherto had a degree of autonomy but with its own Parliament still subject to the Crown, became a part of the United Kingdom. Throughout the next century the Irish campaigned for independence until, just under a hundred years ago, it was granted. But throughout the campaign the Ulster Protestants objected, so the treaty that granted independence drew an arbitrary border around 6 of Ulster’s 9 counties. They would remain in the UK whilst the other 26 counties of Ireland became an independent republic. That division remained controversial, and a civil rights campaign in the 6 counties at the end of the 1960s escalated into widespread acts of terrorism on the island and within England. This ultimately led to the Good Friday Agreement, an international treaty, underwritten by the EU and the USA, which, among other things, enshrined the idea that citizens of the 6 counties have dual citizenship, able to choose to hold UK or Irish passports, and total freedom of movement of goods and people between the two parts of the island. That is, of course, perfectly practical so long as both the UK and Ireland remain members of the EU. It is incompatible with the UK’s desire to leave the EU in order “to control our borders”. There is a lot of talk about technological solutions, and the arrangement agreed in principle in December of 2017 was that, until those solutions are available, the 6 counties will remain in the Single Market and the Customs Union (the “backstop”). It is this part of the Withdrawal Agreement, reached by Prime Minister May and the EU at the end of last year, that failed to secure the support of a majority in Parliament. Prime Minister Johnson’s new version leaves Northern Ireland in the Customs Union, an arrangement which can be ended by a vote in the Northern Ireland Assembly in four years time. Parliament has approved this in principle but requires more time to debate the details. The Prime Minister has paused that process, awaiting a decision from the EU on the granting of an extension beyond 31st October. The duration of that extension, if granted, and how it might be used, are in doubt. It could simply give time for amendments to be introduced, such as a request for the whole of the UK to remain in the customs union, a move to hold a second referendum, or a general election. My preferred solution? Cancel Brexit, although this could only happen after a general election or second referendum. Failing that, the whole of the UK should remain in the customs union. This is an updated version of an article that originally appeared as a guest post on Jill Dennison’s Filosofa’s Word blog."
Medium.com,Society,The Human Cost of Your Smartphone,World,https://onezero.medium.com/the-human-cost-of-your-smartphone-d583a2b6f356?source=topic_page---------236------------------1," here is no trace of toxic dust on the sleek, shiny iPhones lined up in the Apple Store — that would be terrible for marketing campaigns. And there is nothing mentioned about the 40,000 children in the southern part of the Democratic Republic of the Congo who are forced to mine cobalt with their bare hands to create mobile phone batteries. But there is toxic dust in those mines, and those children are almost always given nothing to protect themselves from it. Inhaling cobalt dust can cause fatal lung diseases, chronic rashes, vomiting, and convulsions. If the children want to keep these jobs they need to survive, they have no other choice but to work in these horrendous conditions. At the beginning of 2019, there were more than 5.1 billion unique mobile phone users in the world. But very little is disclosed about how mobile phones are made, particularly the suffering that takes place at the beginning of the supply chain. Starting advertisements with clips of young children coughing and spluttering wouldn’t be very glamorous. Instead, electronics companies do everything they can to cover up all the links between their supply chains and the horrific human rights abuses. There are more than 40 different chemical elements in a mobile phone. Many of these elements have shady sourcing practices. The human rights issues surrounding cobalt especially are so dubious that the metal is often referred to as “the blood diamond of batteries.” Cobalt is primarily produced by reducing the byproducts of copper and nickel mining. It’s expensive, and manufacturers have spent a long time searching for an alternative, but for the foreseeable future, it remains an essential component in all lithium-ion rechargeable batteries. The copper belt found in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) and its neighboring country Zambia yields most of the world’s cobalt production, and it is where most companies source the chemical. This is also where the worst human rights violations occur because many of the mines are controlled by armed groups. The DRC alone produces at least 50% of the world’s cobalt. Around 20% of the DRC’s cobalt is extracted by hand in a process called “artisanal mining.” The remainder is produced by large industrial mines that are typically owned by foreign companies — many of which are Chinese. China also owns most of the companies that buy products from the children who work at these mines. The hours are long, the conditions are bad, and the wages are very low. A 2016 investigation by Amnesty International revealed that several major electronics brands were not even attempting to carry out the most basic inspections to make sure child labor wasn’t used to mine the cobalt for phones. These brands included Apple (which has a net worth of more than $1 trillion), Samsung (also with a net worth of more than $1 trillion), and Sony (with a net worth of about $74 billion). The job of sourcing cobalt is often designated for children as young as seven years old, who spend up to 12 hours every day in mines. With every breath these children take, they inhale potentially deadly mineral dust whose lethal consequences may not happen until years later. And with each rock they dig, they risk causing a fatal tunnel collapse that could kill them instantly. In return, they are often paid the equivalent of $1-$2 (U.S.) per day. Amnesty’s report, This Is What We Die For, documents these hazardous conditions. More than three years after these problems were exposed, the human rights abuses remain widespread. All major electronics brands publicly state they will not tolerate human rights abuses in their supply chains. But it’s easy to say this; verifying it is another matter. The reality is that supply chains are so complicated that very few companies are able to verify the information they receive from their suppliers — and some companies aren’t even trying. Perhaps more shockingly, even the companies that do carry out investigations have not revealed to the public any risks and abuses they’ve found. A 2017 Amnesty International report revealed how the richest, most powerful industry giants are still failing to tackle child labor allegations in cobalt battery supply chains. At a glance, the solution seems simple: Just stop buying from the DRC. But there are many issues with boycotting cobalt sourcing from the entire country. In addition to cutting out the world’s largest cobalt producer, it would be likely to endanger citizens’ lives even further. The entire reason they are doing this work is to escape poverty. As hopeless as the job might be, so few alternatives for work exist that cobalt mining is the only means of survival for many people there. Many of the mines are controlled by armed groups, but a large portion of them are not. As a result, a complete boycott of all minerals from the DRC — even in places where there is no conflict — would be detrimental to the people who work there and would likely cause further damage. When it comes to mines that are controlled by armed groups, the issue is that virtually none of them are entirely dependent on mining revenue for their existence; it is just one of many methods they use to funnel money into their pursuits. So if these cobalt mines were to disappear, the armed groups would still function, but the people who rely on the mines for their income would lose what is likely their only means of survival. Tracing the supply chain is not as simple as it may seem. In most of the DRC, state capacity is extremely low, and there is virtually no road infrastructure. Setting up the systems required to regularly assess the thousands of mining sites that are spread all across the DRC would be a severe challenge. As a result, it is extremely difficult for companies to prove exactly where the minerals were sourced, which means that carrying out basic checks for human rights violations becomes even more difficult. Demanding that companies prove where their cobalt was mined would merely incentivize buyers to pull out of the region and source their minerals from elsewhere. When an estimated 8 to 10 million people in the country are wholly dependent on artisanal mining for their livelihood, forcing companies to pull out from the DRC could lead to mass devastation and result in causing many more complicated problems than it solves. Apple is leading the way in responsible sourcing. It became the first company to publish a list of its suppliers in 2017. For the last few years, it has focused on tackling child labor in the supply chain of Huayou Cobalt, China’s largest cobalt producer. And in March 2017, the company decided to further investigate the working conditions in the mines of the DRC, temporarily putting a hold on purchases of artisanal cobalt from the country. However, putting even a temporary hold on cobalt purchases has consequences for miners in the DRC. In August, the Swiss mining giant Glencore suspended cobalt production for at least two years in the southern part of the DRC as a result of the closure of the Mutanga mine — the producer of almost 20% of the world’s cobalt. The company asserted the mine was no longer economically viable. This resulted in more than 3,000 jobs lost. Around the same time, Huayou Cobalt pulled out of a deal to invest $66.3 million in a cobalt mine in the DRC following a slump in the price of cobalt. It’s clear that boycotting minerals from the DRC will simply cut off the income of workers who need it most. What we really need are companies to directly engage with initiatives in countries like the DRC to encourage more responsible mining practices. One such company is Fairphone — a phone manufacturer whose unique selling point is “caring for the people and the planet” by improving the conditions of the workers lower down in their supply chain. Fairphone is partnering with a number of initiatives in an attempt to help formalize the sector and increase the transparency of the supply chains for the minerals used in mobile phones. This requires visiting suppliers in the DRC, building relationships on the ground, and taking steps to cut out the middlemen and buy directly from factories. But the company currently has only a very small market share, and we need to put more pressure on the industry giants to follow suit if we can hope to make the slightest difference. It is vital that our increasing drive for renewable energy is not powered by the misery of workers being forced to work in horrific conditions. But as renewable technologies that require lithium-ion batteries become more popular, the drive for cobalt is likely to increase even further. According to one prediction, cobalt demand will exceed 120,000 tonnes per year by 2020 — an increase of approximately 30% from 2016. In 2018, Elon Musk tweeted that “we use less than 3% cobalt in our batteries & will use none in next gen,” but there is no guarantee that other battery manufacturers are on the same timeline. And if we do stop using cobalt, what happens to people living in the DRC who rely on cobalt mining for their livelihood?"
Medium.com,Society,Strong & Free: Maxime Bernier and the PPC,World,https://medium.com/@jackmacparsons/strong-free-maxime-bernier-and-the-ppc-9c79660e09e2?source=topic_page---------237------------------1," The presentation room in the Halifax Club on Hollis street was full of chairs, the number of which said that there were more people to expect. The projector remained off, and the podium was empty. There were four people in the room, each fidgeting with their phones or double-checking cameras and equipment. At that point Maxime Bernier was 20 minutes late. The tardiness of the federal leader was to be expected. The father of the People’s Party of Canada, which formed in September of 2018, had been met with protests for much of his visit, forcing his campaign team to cancel or reschedule much of his itinerary for the trip, including a radio appearance on News 95.7 and a press event at the Halifax Club. Depending on who is being asked, the enigmatic PPC leader is either a racist xenophobe who hates immigrants, or a charming Quebecois fellow who wants to balance the budget and bring immigrants here legally to enjoy a better quality of life. The protestors outside the Marriot hotel in downtown Halifax believed the former. “Since the PPC’s conception, they have been inundated with neo-nazis, racists, islamophobes, all sorts of different types of bigots, and they are the party of choice for the far-right political movement that’s manifesting in Canada,” said Against Hate protestor John Brown, a sentiment that was shared by the other chanting protestors. But these accusations mean very little to PPC supporters. “No politician, wants to have a discussion about that. It’s too risky. Maybe you’ll be a radical, or a racist, or a white supremicist,” said Bernier about lowering the number of immigrants, eliciting a laugh from his crowd of party members and supporters in Halifax. Bernier is not a stranger to Canadian politics, having served as a Conservative MP since 2006, under the fledgling Harper government, before splitting from the conservatives to form his own party following his failed conservative leadership bid. He lost to Andrew Scheer with 49.05 per cent of the vote to Scheers 50.95 per cent. His father Gilles Bernier, was also a politician representing the same riding of Beauce in Quebec. Much like his son, Gilles began as a Conservative MP but did not end his career as one, instead becoming an independant. Bernier attributes some of his grassroots success with the PPC to his father’ techniques. “If you want to be in politics, you have to be able to like your relationships with people, that’s the basics. That’s what I learned from him, to listen, to be out there, to be on the ground, and that’s what I like. That’s what I did during the campaign when we started to create the party a year ago,” said Bernier. It is true that Bernier seems to prefer a tongue-in-cheek attitude towards his public appearances, a trait of similar populist leaders such as Donald Trump. At the PPC rally he joked about the comparisons between he and Trump. At least one person in the crowd of the rally was sporting a hat that said “Make America Great Again”, the U.S presidents signature 2016 campaign phrase. The PPC rally was held in a big, well-lit room at the Marriot, full of people in suits drinking water out of wine-glasses. This contrasted the dreary scene of the hoodie-clad protestors in the wind and rain positioned outside the front of the hotel. “They’re scared of us, they’re scared we’ll become popular,” one PPC supporter could be heard saying, speaking of the protestors outside. Outside moments earlier, protestor John Brown could be heard yelling at people entering the hotel. “Why are you here? Who do you hate? Who do you hate?” he said. Whatever Bernier is doing, it is prompting reactions along the entire spectrum of political opinion, and opinions appear to be polarized strongly for or against. Bernier, for his part, refrained from directly attacking his political opponents at the rally. He spoke positively about his relationship with Green Party leader Elizabeth May, and how they were seat-mates in the house of commons. He did use this point to highlight the successful growth of his party, however. “Elizabeth asked me ‘how many members do you have?’ and I said ‘about 28,000,’ and she looked at me and she was being honest, she said ‘Maxime, you can be proud because after 35 years we have only 19,000 members across the country,’” said Bernier. Bernier delivered his speeches, smiling and cracking jokes along the way, choosing not to attack his opponents, but instead to tactfully undermine campaign promises or show how his party has outperformed rivals, such as with Green Party member numbers. As for his campaign promises, Bernier took his hardest stances against Andrew Scheer. He repeatedly took aim at politicians who only promise what people want to hear, saying that his party knows what their beliefs are, and will represent Canadians with those beliefs. He also doubled-down on his promise to balance the budget in two years, as opposed to Scheers five-year plan to do the same. Policy wise, Bernier has firmly positioned himself and his party unapologetically to the right of Scheer, who he has called a centrist. Although polling numbers and seat projections for the PPC remain the lowest of the six major parties, Bernier and his new party represent a niche of Canadians that reject establishment politics and what they view as the “political correctness” of politics in Canada. He may not find much success this time around, but the future of this upstart leader and his party is certainly going to be unpredictable. Whether one agrees or disagrees with him, it will be worth keeping an eye on Maxime Bernier."
Medium.com,Society,"Despite reports to the contrary, Israel is more united than ever",World,https://medium.com/@ibnezra/despite-reports-to-the-contrary-israel-is-more-united-than-ever-b670e9d3744b?source=topic_page---------238------------------1," For the first time in more than a decade, an Israeli politician other than Benjamin Netanyahu will be given a presidential mandate to form a new government. Now that Mr Netanyahu’s rival Benny Gantz has been given a mandate to try to form a coalition government after the incumbent prime minister tried and failed to do so twice, it might seem that Israel is divided beyond recognition and the political stalemate reveals systemic problems at the core of Israel’s democracy. This, however, is not the case. The two elections should instead be seen as referendums on Netanyahu the person, not the politician. Former military general Mr Gantz, head of the Blue and White party, will now have 28 days to form the next Israeli government. It is unclear whether Mr Gantz will be able to negotiate the tricky seas of Israel’s political landscape but one thing is clear: the negotiations will not really discuss the nature of Israeli policies. Those appear set in stone, especially when it comes to the Palestinians. Far from being divided, Israel is paralysed over Mr Netanyahu and his waning grasp on power. He is under investigation in several corruption cases that also implicate members of his family. The first indictments could take place as early as December. Throughout this year of election campaigning, Mr Netanyahu has barely shied away from his desire to use the prime minister’s office to protect himself from criminal prosecution. Yet despite these brazen attacks on the cornerstone of Israel’s democracy, a majority of Israeli voters continued to vote for Mr Netanyahu. Using his vulnerability to their advantage, Israeli politicians have tried to extract large concessions from Mr Netanyahu in exchange for their partnership in the next government. No party has ever won an outright majority to govern Israel’s 120-seat parliament. That means small parties play an outsize role in the complexion of ruling governments. This election was no different as small parties offered Mr Netanyahu their partnership in exchange for a promise that ultra-orthodox Jews would continue to be exempt from mandatory military service. This has ruffled feathers of leading right-wing political blocs that have pushed to remove this exemption in recent years. Over the past month, Mr Netanyahu attempted to form a government based on an alliance of right-wing and ultra-orthodox parties. Missing from the coalition was the real kingmaker throughout this year of elections: the head of right-wing nationalist Yisrael Beiteinu, Avigdor Lieberman. While Mr Lieberman’s positions have fluctuated recently, he has pushed for a secular nationalist government comprising Mr Netanyahu’s Likud party, Blue and White, and Yisrael Beiteinu. This would require Mr Netanyahu to abandon the ultra-orthodox , which he refused to do, and Mr Gantz to backtrack on his position that he would not partner with Likud as long as Mr Netanyahu was facing indictment. In the end, the deal fell through, leaving Mr Netanyahu with no viable options. The majority of international coverage of Israel’s political woes has painted a picture of a country in search of core identity and unable to agree on core principles. This is not the case. Rather, this is an election about Israel’s most powerful politician and whether the country will allow him to use his power to fend off criminal investigations. When it comes to actual policies and the major questions facing the country, there is little difference between the main parties. Mr Gantz, who has been portrayed as a real alternative to Mr Netanyahu, has helped entrench his polices with regard to the Palestinians. Mr Gantz will now attempt to sway centre and left parties, including the majority Palestinian Joint List, which won an impressive 13 seats in the September election. The Joint List publicly supported a Gantz government over Mr Netanyahu after the last election but no Palestinian party has ever joined a ruling Israeli coalition. Moreover, three Joint List politicians from the Balad party refused to back any candidate so it is unlikely that Mr Gantz could form a government with Joint List participation. Mr Gantz will have to court Yisrael Beiteinu but Mr Lieberman — who has not ruled out joining a Gantz government — has repeatedly stated he will not join Palestinian parties in a coalition. The Blue and White leader has his work cut out for him over the next 28 days but the notion that Israelis are deeply divided is not based in reality. The former general has stated that the West Bank will never be given back to Palestinians and he has presided over several vicious Israeli military campaigns in Gaza. There simply will not be any significant change on the ground regardless of whether Mr Netanyahu and Mr Gantz are able to form a government, and this confirms something important about the nature of Israel and its underlying Zionist ideology. In his new biography of Israel’s first prime minister, David Ben Gurion, the Israeli journalist Tom Segev argues that the “price of Zionism” is permanent conflict, which can be managed but never resolved. After months of Israeli elections with little mention of the ongoing occupation of the Palestinian West Bank or the myriad unsolved issues between Israel and the Palestinians, Segev’s point is more powerful than ever. Israelis have accepted the permanent state of conflict to such a degree that they have no issue squabbling for years over whether they want corrupt politicians ruling them."

Medium.com,Society,"Apple App Store removes Hong Kong protest mapping app, sparking user outrage",World,https://medium.com/swlh/apple-app-store-removes-hong-kong-protest-mapping-app-sparking-user-outrage-9b85cc79bde7?source=topic_page---------241------------------1," As of October 10, 2019, Apple has removed the HKmap.live app from the App Store, stating that the app “has been used in ways that endanger law enforcement and residents in Hong Kong.” Apple originally rejected HKmap.live from inclusion in the App Store on October 1, claiming that it allowed users to “evade law enforcement”. After reversing this decision three days later, the company has now flip-flopped again. HKmap.live is a website and application that uses crowdsourced information to track the locations of protesters and police, along with road closures caused by the ongoing pro-democracy protests in Hong Kong. According to the app developer’s Twitter account, the iPhone version of the app has been downloaded more than 120,000 times, making it the most downloaded travel app in Hong Kong since the beginning of October. A version of the mapping service is still accessible on the HKmap.live website. The Android app is also still available on the Google Play store. HKmap.live shared on Twitter Apple’s official statement about the app’s removal, which reads: HKmap’s developers responded, “There is 0 evidence to support Cyber Security and Technology Crime Bureau (CSTCB)’s accusation. HKmap App never solicits, promotes, or encourages criminal activity. HKmap App consolidates information from user and public sources, e.g. live news stream, Facebook and Telegram.” Pro-democracy Hong Kong legislator Charles Mok has publicly sided with the app maker. Mok Tweeted on October 10 that he had sent a letter to Apple CEO Tim Cook, in defense of HKmap.live. “The user-generated information shared using HKmap.live in fact helps citizens avoid areas where pedestrians not involved in any criminal activities might be subjected to police brutality which many human rights organisations such as Amnesty International have observed,” Mok wrote. “We Hongkongers will definitely look closely at whether Apple chooses to uphold its commitment to free expression and other basic human rights, or become an accomplice for Chinese censorship and oppression,” he added. The New York Times reported that Mr. Cook wrote an email to his employees addressing the issue. He said that he had received “credible information” from civil authorities and citizens in Hong Kong “that the app was being used maliciously to target individual officers for violence and to victimize individuals and property where no police are present.” Nevertheless, skeptics continue to view Apple’s rejection of the app as evidence of mainland China exerting control over the company. In 2017, Apple removed the New York Times App from its China website. The decision came after the Times reported on billions of dollars in secret perks and subsidies that the Chinese government provides to the world’s biggest iPhone factory. In September of this year, Apple removed the US news app Quartz from the App Store in China. Quartz had been regularly reporting on the Hong Kong protests. Apple’s official notice said that the app was removed “because it includes content that is illegal in China.” When Apple made the decision on October 4 to host HKmap.live on the App Store, state-run Chinese media outlets condemned the move. Tens of thousands of internet users took to the Chinese social media site Weibo to express their outrage. The day before Apple removed the app, China Daily published an opinion piece criticizing Apple’s decision to allow “toxic apps” on the App Store. Although the article didn’t mention HKmap.live by name, it argued that Apple was “helping Hong Kong rioters engage in more violence”. The writers continued, “Providing a gateway for ‘toxic apps’ is hurting the feelings of the Chinese people, twisting the facts of Hong Kong affairs, and against the views and principles of the Chinese people. Apple and other corporations should be able to discern right from wrong. They also need to know that only the prosperity of China and China’s Hong Kong will bring them a broader and more sustainable market.” Apple’s stake in the fate of China’s economy is sizable. The New York Times reported that Apple generated nearly $44 billion in sales in “greater China” (a designation that includes the mainland, Hong Kong and Taiwan) from July 2018 through June 2019. This number represents almost a fifth of the company’s global sales. In addition, Apple manufactures the majority of its products in China, with 10,000 direct employees in the country. Overall, Apple’s presence in China has created about about 5 million jobs, according to the BBC. In 2017, Cook spoke at the Fortune Global Forum in Guangzhou, where he discussed the company’s rich history and future in China. When the country’s politics came up, Cook said that while he disagreed with some Chinese policies, Apple must comply with local laws. Maya Wang, a senior China researcher at Human Rights Watch in Hong Kong, told the New York Times that Apple’s decision about the HKmap app only encourages the Chinese Communist Party. “I think the party concludes from this that intimidation, harassment and pressure work for most people, in most places,” she said."
Medium.com,Society,Marapu: Unrecognized Religion within ‘Religious Country’,World,https://medium.com/@barahamin/marapu-unrecognized-religion-within-religious-country-71b40b97fbe6?source=topic_page---------242------------------1," “I will soon finish my bachelor's degree,” Umbu Borung Kanatar said. He smiled. “I’ll be back home to do research for my thesis.” Kanatar, 21 years old, a law student at university in Surabaya, East Java, is from the east part of Sumba, an island within the East Nusa Tenggara of Indonesia. His village, Praiyawang, is one of few last remaining indigenous settlement of Marapu believers. Marapu is an indigenous religion in Sumba island. Half of its population still practicing Marapu. Indonesia, the fifth-biggest country in the world with over 250 millions population, is entirely made of more than 17.000 islands. The third biggest democracy country in the world where only six religions received official recognition from the state; Islam, Protestant, Catholic, Hindus, Buddhism, and Confucianism. “There is no direct ban towards Marapu, but we also have no official recognition,” Rato Rumate Lado Rigi Tera said. He is the Marapu’s leader at Tarung village, in West Sumba. Rato has been campaigning and demanding for the state to recognize of Marapu. He’s not alone. Along with him also other indigenous religious leaders in Sumatera, Java, Sulawesi, and Kalimantan. State recognition brought direct implications towards indigenous peoples who are still holding their traditional religions. Includes being excluding from their rights to be recording as citizens. “I have to write Catholic in my ID card in order to be registered as a student at public school,” Kanatar said. “My parents decided to succumb before the state rules rather than to see me growing up uneducated and illiterate.” Kanatar completed his twelve years of basic education — from elementary school until high school — as Catholic. He learned the Bible and went to church every Sunday during his time as a student. Going to church is an obligation in many parts of the country. A student needs to recorded her visits to church as required by ‘Religion Subject’ that being taught in educational institutions. However, Kanatar is still practicing Marapu whenever he comes back to his village. “I’m only Catholic at school, but I’m a Marapus deep within. I was born, raised and will die as Marapus,” Kanatar said. He stopped going to church when he went to university. Kanatar is part of Marapu’s ‘lost generation’ who earned their rights as Indonesian citizens proved by an ID after the older generations found out if that is the only option left if they wanted to have access for basic state services. The Indigenous Peoples Alliance of the Archipelago, known popularly for its Indonesian abbreviation AMAN, is the largest such grouping in Indonesia whose more than 22 millions of its members come from 2,336 indigenous communities, strongly criticized the state apparatus towards indigenous religions believers. AMAN has been advocating indigenous rights since it was founded back in 1999. “Having an ID card and freedom to embrace our indigenous religions are parts of our civil-political rights. By ignoring it, the Indonesian state shows their lack of commitment towards the indigenous peoples and violating our human rights,” Rukka Sombolinggi said. She is the general secretary of AMAN — the Indonesian abbreviation of the organization. AMAN has been fighting to pass the Indigenous Rights Bill for more than a decade. The bill will be supposed to protect indigenous peoples’ land and other rights are now in limbo in parliament. “Having no ID card brought us lots of difficulties. One can not travel out of the island due to the required official documents needed. One also will be excluded from exercising other rights, such as rights to vote,” Rato Rumate said. On April 17, Indonesian are welcoming it general election where for the first time in the nation history, where both presidential and legislative elections will be held at the same time. “When the general election is now less than a week, we still having the problem where huge numbers of our members will not able to exercise their rights to vote due to not having ID cards,” Rukka said. According to the Indonesian General Election Committee (KPU) rules, one needed to show to the election organizers their ID card or reference letter confirmed that they have been through the data recording process but still not having ID. AMAN considered these electoral regulations are adding weight upon indigenous peoples whose rights upon ancestral domains and access towards basic state services are being ignored for decades. “Our land has been taken away and we still face the ongoing discrimination regarding our social and cultural values. We’ve been struggling to get our rights through different ways, including our political decision to fight from within the parliament,” Rukka said. AMAN has frequently sent their indigenous representatives to compete for a seat within legislative councils at different levels since 2009. In the upcoming 2019 general election, they have 163 candidates in 16 different political parties. These peoples were elected from the grassroots communities and carrying a mandate to be the voice and face of the ongoing struggle of Indonesian indigenous peoples. Their task is to be the front-liner of the indigenous communities all over the country who are currently fighting to defend themselves from different threats brought by ‘development’. “But it seems like the state keeps moving away to finish line every single time we get closer, as shown by their ignorance to limit indigenous political participation through discriminatory regulations such as ID card as mandatory conditions to vote,” Rukka said. According to AMAN, there are 12 million of their individual members have the rights to vote for the upcoming election. Half of them are live within the forest areas or in remote islands all over Indonesia. About four millions of the total are yet to be registered by the state due to different reasons including religion, as happened in Sumba towards Marapu community. “To be noted, demanding state to give us ID cards is only one issue within our long term struggle which is beyond the electoral event as we are demanding the state to recognize our full and completed rights through the Indigenous Rights Bill,” Rukka said."

Medium.com,Society,Why the “Strong Highball” is Booming in Japan,World,https://medium.com/one-table-one-world/why-the-strong-highball-is-booming-in-japan-unseen-japan-5a646f6bbc18?source=topic_page---------244------------------1," By Jay Andrew Allen As I’ve written before, Japan’s fame as a drinking culture is somewhat belied by the country’s recent “alcohol flight” (酒離れ; sake-banare). Beer production among the top five manufacturers has declined year over year since 2014. Per-person alcohol consumption has dropped year over year as well — especially among the young. The flight is especially pronounced among the young: only 10.9% of males age 20–29 say they drink regularly. Naturally, alcohol manufacturers, bars and restaurants are fighting this trend tooth and nail. The “all you can drink” option (飲み放題; nomi-hodai) is one tactic many yakiniku shops and izakaya use to entice customers to drink. Others are sponsoring “subscription” services that provide unlimited booze in exchange for a monthly fee. But perhaps the best way to entice today’s post-Bubble, budget-conscious Japanese consumer into drinking is to make it cheaper to drink at home. And Japan’s booze manufacturers have found just the thing in the form of strong chuhai, or the strong highball. The term chuhai comes from 焼酎ハイボール ( shochu haiboru), or “shochu highball,” and originally referred to cutting the traditional Japanese liquor shochu with water, soda, or fruit juice. It’s now a general term that refers to any alcoholic drink made with soda, some fruit flavoring (lemon, lime, grapefruit, pear, etc.), and distilled liquor. Canned highballs have been a staple of Japanese supermarkets and convenience stores for years. And, normally, they have a similar alcoholic profile to commercial beer — around 5 to 6% ABV. In 2008, however, manufacturers upped the ante. Asahi and Kirin both came out with highballs that contained 9% ABV. Then, in 2009, Asahi announced its Strong Zero line of 9% strong highballs. (The “zero” means that no additional sugar is added beyond natural flavors, which makes Strong Zero both potent and diet-conscious.) The rest, as they say, is history. Walk into any conbini in Japan today, and you’ll see that the strong highball options in the booze section abound. JP Link: History of Canned Chuhai — History of 9% Chuhai What is the appeal of the strong highball? Sure, it tastes good. But it’s also cheap as hell. As opposed to a 350ml can of beer, which will run upwards of 220 yen, a similar can of a strong highball drink averages about 124 yen. That’s about as cheap as you can get wasted in the privacy of our own home. Why is the strong highball so cheap? The reason, says writer Kurare at Mag2News, is simple: taxes. JP Link: The Back Story on Strong Highballs. How the Country Bullied Alcohol Producers into Losing Their Shit For taxation purposes, under Japan’s alcohol taxation system, beer is broken down into three categories. The first category is traditional malt beer. The second is low-malt beer. The third is “beer-like products” not made through malting or fermentation but through the addition of distilled alcohol. Malt beer is taxed the highest: a single 220 yen can of beer carries a 77 yen alcohol tax, plus around 22 yen in consumption tax. In other words, nearly half of the price of a can of beer is taxes. By contrast, a strong highball is essentially treated as a soda or fruit drink with distilled alcohol added to it. A can of strong highball only carries about 22 yen in tax. Furthermore, while third-level beer is also taxed at a fairly low rate, the taxation rate isn’t set to increase as much as the tax on chuhai drinks in the coming years. That makes the strong highball the cheapest booze option on the market — and thus a veritable cash cow for alcohol producers. The strong highball love shows no signs of letting up. In fact, one company last year introduced a 12% highball into the market. The strong highball is fueling a “drink at home” (宅飲み; takunomi) trend: last year, the number of people who reported drinking at home rose around 3% compared to the previous year. Fans of the drinks have talked about the satisfaction they find in opening a cold can from the convenience store. One user notes, “It’s less a sake for getting drunk and more one for becoming incoherent.” While this may be good for alcohol producers, it’s raising public health alarms in Japan. Thanks to strong chuhai’s high alcohol content, it can only take moderate drinkers a couple of cans until they’re good and toasty. Many strong highballs also come in a “long can” (500ml) form, which makes one’s Mean Time to Drunkenness even shorter. Medical experts call that a potential fast track to alcoholism. Medical professionals such as Chief Kawamukai Tetsuya at the Akimoto Hospital in Chiba Prefecture say they’re seeing a rise in alcohol-dependent patients as a result of the cheap access. JP Link: The Popularity of the High-Alcohol “Strong Series…We Asked Experts on How to Avoid Alcoholism Kawamukai seems to think the ultimate solution would be to make strong chuhai more costly. But he also advises those who are concerned about becoming dependent to limit themselves to a single can an evening. “I’d like people,” he says, “to enjoy delicious sake appropriately and in moderation.” I’m the publisher of Unseen Japan.

Medium.com,Society,The extinction path of global nation states,World,https://medium.com/@michaelrynn/the-extinction-path-of-global-nation-states-447df8c3ea9c?source=topic_page---------245------------------1," I was listening to parts of the Australian Federal Parliament house of representatives session on radio, 22nd October 2019. It was like trying to make sense of the inmates of a lunatic asylum, given the actual predicaments that Australian Fossil Fool Civilisation now faces. Nearly every speaker requires a mental illness diagnosis. There were a couple of sane adults in the room, but everyone else seems to be living in a delusion bubble, set by the major party lines controlling the puppetry. I checked late in the evening the corresponding Hansard of 22nd October 2019, which gets promptly published in for each day. I searched for the key word “emergency”, as I had heard a “climate emergency petition” was being tabled. I have signed quite a few of these in the past. The Hansard PDF text indicates how far away government politicians have strayed from reality. The government seemed more interested in mouthing the holy mantras of economic growth, and pumping for more emissions export growth, despite a massive climate emergency petition, growing activist disruptions in the streets, ongoing worse droughts, collapse of Australia’s farming sector, signs of ecological collapse, and warning signs that the entire real fossil fool system is heading for economic collapse. An E-Petition asking the parliament to declare a climate emergency, with just over 400,000 signatures, was presented, and was completely ignored by the government. Very much like the effort to declare a climate emergency from the Labor Opposition only a few days previously. The member for Jagajaga (Ms Kate Thwaites — Labor) got in first with a motion of support, for the petition, ending with the words “Let’s set the culture wars aside and all get on board with a genuine approach to combating climate change”. The independent member for Warringah, Ms Steggall, presented the petition formally. She read it, and noted it had been approved by the standing committee on petitions. What followed from government members, was as if it had never happened. The most disgusting member for Hinker (K Pitt, LNQ), soon after carried on like a regional radio jockey reading advertisements for the local shopping mall. “I say to everyone out there who might be listening to this on the broadcast: if you’re spending at Christmas time and you want to get your purse or wallet out, get downtown and make sure you’re shopping local. I know, Mr Deputy Speaker Hogan, you are waiting with anticipation to see what in my electorate you can buy from local shops. Firstly, you need to bang at the door of Buck’s Butcher Shoppe in Childers — their speciality is Buck’s ducks. That is what they are very keen on in Childers. There’s Nanna’s Pantry — not your mum’s mum but Nanna’s Pantry, the shop, “ — and so on. — I was disgusted. A Western Australian member expressed concern about slowing economic growth. — Economic growth builds infrastructure which requires yearly energy consumption which creates more greenhouse gas emissions. Economic growth defeats climate mitigation again, and always will, until resulting global systems failures pull civilisation down faster than it can be maintained, as a catabolic collapse. Mr Simmonds wanted to celebrate 75th anniversary of the Liberal Party — “The Liberal Party has always represented a broader cross-section of the Australian public than any other political grouping. Labor would seek to pigeonhole us for political purposes. But, in truth, we are for the upward movement of all ambitious Australians, regardless of race, religion, sex or income.”. — Yes, that is right, the party for only people on the make. No global heating petitioners allowed. Joel Fitzgibbon (Hunter — as coal mining electorate — Labor — but a global heating denier) asked about the drought — “Prime Minister, why won’t you listen to the member and, more importantly, to farmers and rural communities and convene a cross-party drought cabinet to adequately respond to the growing drought crisis?” — Same reason Prime Minister doesn’t listen to climate emergency petitions, I guess. What followed was a lot about how much aid money is being targeted at drought assistance relief. No mention of global heating likely to continue on worsening drought impacts in Australia. This was reported the next day by requests from drought — afflicted farmers for “quit packages”. Question from Ms Sharkie, (Mayo — Centre Alliance ) My question is to the Prime Minister. As of July this year, Australia had just 27 days supply of automotive fuel physically in the country. This leaves us incredibly vulnerable. When will Australia increase our stocks to the recommended 90-day supply of automotive fuel physically held in the country?. — Now there was a good question. If only we can get the supply and consumption close to zero days of fuel, permanently, then this would be something to help the climate emergency. In Angus Taylor’s answer as Minister for Energy and Emissions Reduction — “There is one other certain way to improve our fuel security, and that is to make the most of Australia’s ample oil and gas reserves. The Northern Territory Labor government have shown great leadership on this, with the work they are doing on the Beetaloo Basin. We have contributed $8.4 million to getting that very prospective basin for oil and gas into operation. I call on all states, including the Victorian state Labor government, to remove blanket bans and moratoria on gas and oil exploration. I also acknowledge the great potential for oil and gas developments in the great state of South Australia. It’s time to get on, and deliver on Australia’s oil and gas potential in the coming years.” — Yes, Angus and his on the make friends want to exploit all of Australian for our great potential for increases in national and exported emissions. The Minister of pretending to have emissions reductions. No chance of global heating mitigation from this minister and this government. “Since we have come to government, the economy has continued to grow” — Treasurer Josh Fryedenberg, in response to a Dorothy Dixer. (Question from member of one’s own party) — Not growing quite so well, with rural economy collapsing with drought, and global economy collapsing with always increasing energy costs of mining fossil fuels, passing costs with increasings debt along to all businesses, and only surviving the debt bubble as interest rates are now scraping into the negative. — Definitely more greenhouse gas emissions then. Another Dixer from member for Wentworth (Dave Sharma, Liberal) “My question is to the Minister for the Environment. Will the minister outline to the House how the importance of the Morrison government’s stable and certain economic management is ensuring the protection of our environment?” — Now some listeners may have already reached their puking tolerance level. Matters of public importance — more serious stuff, longer speeches. Dr Andrew Leigh — Growing casual work and unemployment in Australia. Scott Morrison — Response of government to royal commission into child sexual abuse. I skipped much stuff — hours have gone by. — At least the inland railway is a lower emissions cost mode of transport, compared to truck. With drought, is it only going to be servicing the mining industry? Treasury Laws Amendment (Prohibiting Energy Market Misconduct) Bill 2019 — Many have noticed the Australian Stationary Energy network supply is still pricey and emissions intensive — - Mark Butler, — ALP — attacks the lack of coherent energy transition policies, giving details. Adam Bandt — AU Greens — who says the point of this unnecessary bill is to protect coal fired power stations from early redundancy. He manages to place the climate emergency petition in context. “The people from all walks of life who are marching in the street know that the government doesn’t have global warming under control. What they are all begging for from this government is a plan to bring down pollution and address the crisis in global warming and the climate emergency, but also address the crisis in the energy system, which the government has broken. Because of the government’s intervention in the energy system, it’s worth noting one fact: this comes from the government’s independent Australian Energy Regulator; not from the Greens, not from the commentators but from the Energy Regulator.” With this government resisting changes while we progress on the collapse of industrial civilisation, it looks like Australian government will carry on regardless until Australian becomes drastically crippled, and population wiped out, by 3 degrees plus of warming, with frequent unlivable heat and droughts, way beyond the current imaginations of the Canberra politicians. — Much the same comments and tripe were coming from the radio the next day’s parliament session about a draconian fossil fuel bill for our grid energy system. The government had given non-binding “promises” potential punitive measures wouldn’t be used to push coal and oligarch interests. Doesn’t matter what it says, this government only carries out the will of coal and gas oligarchs, and doesn’t listen to anybody else. Since national governments are incapable of taking sufficient climate mitigation action, and are under the control of vested fossil fuel interests, it is about time that such governments, where-ever they may be, are divested of such powers that allow them to impose global ecological suicide on all of their subjects, and all other global nations. Powers to veto new fossil fuel projects need to reside in the people, not in absolutely corrupt governments. Billionaire bought elections do not constitute a peoples mandate. Monumental social changes (and troubles) in the 21st century will be misunderstood (and thus worsened, I believe) insofar as people … continue interpreting events according to a [pre-ecological] worldview that insufficiently recognizes human society’s ultimate dependence on its ecosystem context. - William R. Catton Jr — https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_R._Catton_Jr.#cite_note-Catton-2008-3 When the earth’s deposits of fossil fuels and mineral resources were being laid down, Homo sapiens had not yet been prepared by evolution to take advantage of them. As soon as technology made it possible for mankind to do so, people eagerly (and without foreseeing the ultimate consequences) shifted to a high-energy way of life. Man became, in effect, a detritivore, Homo colossus. Our species bloomed, and now we must expect a crash (of some sort) as the natural sequel. — Overshoot — p170 — Downloadable PDF - https://monoskop.org/images/9/92/Catton_Jr_William_R_Overshoot_The_Ecological_Basis_of_Revolutionary_Change.pdf — detritivore : an animal which feeds on dead organic material, especially plant detritus. This is the Australia Federal Parliament , mostly lost all over the wrong places, without the benefit of a restraining ecological worldview. They have a world-view, of “national government” exploits first, which is a very common global social disease, contracted by fossil fuel usage. This is typical, not exceptional. Extinction Rebellion — motto is “Tell the truth” and “Act like it is real”. XR presents a simplified ecological world-view, which is why they are treated as terrorist threats to national democratic government. They frighten the lack of wits out of extreme right wing conservatives and authoritarians. Bow down and go extinct, we are told. World view of most global national governments, including so-called representative democracies, is dreadfully simple. — “Hide the truth”, “Pretend it isn’t real”. Exploit all economic resources first, let others suffer consequences later. Torture and imprison any and all inconvenient truth-tellers. The cruelty of human punisher instincts tends to be unbounded, ignores and abuses existing human rights law, because this protects the punishers in power from suffering the emotional costs of their actions. A vicious feedback, like the French Revolution, leading to the extermination of the upper classes and royalty. You have been warned. Humans have violence thresholds, and most nation-states lead by example and frequently exceed them. Extinction Rebellion apparently has caused far greater policing costs in the city of London, than the long police vigil for that other abused truth-teller, Julian Assange, when holed up in the Ecuadorian embassy. Compared to XR, Julian Assange so called revelations and so-called “secrets” are trivial, null-surprise, and caused no lasting harm to any exploitative imperial government, apart from proving them to be absolutely police states, bent on murdering in secret. Julian Assange’s current awaiting extradition, because Australian and UK are abject vassals of the US, and are only too willing to exact royal revenge entirely for the sake of global exploitative vested interests of the fossil fool rich. Unfortunately for general naive homo sapiens, these global police states haven’t learned any real lessons, because they are getting much worse, as fossil fool economics stagnate and decline. XR simple truth is that Global Heating threatens survival of all large multi-cellular species on this planet, even the ones that never started to burn fossil fuels. We need to protect from extinction, all those slow reproducing and none-ecological thinkers like humans, and even the idiotic detritivores whose exploitative lifestyle are still protected at all costs by national governments. Or should we just let these extinction consequences run to completion?"
Medium.com,Society,Canada’s Post-Election Divide,World,https://medium.com/@jamessomaeck/canadas-post-election-divide-55741a411ab1?source=topic_page---------246------------------1," The 43rd Canadian general election is now in the books, and while the result was largely predicted by pollsters, there are many Canadians who felt that they lost in this election. Canada’s post-election divide is clearly illustrated on the electoral map between regions which care about the environment and those which care about increased economic prosperity. Justin Trudeau will return as prime minister, albeit with a reduced Liberal caucus in a minority Parliament. Though playing this election off as a win, the message that electors sent to the federal government is one that raises the spectre of chaotic political times to come. For the governing Liberals, they will now form a government with a huge gap from western Canada, having failed to elect a single MP from Saskatchewan or Alberta. These two provinces have been most hostile for Trudeau, as they struggle with serious issues. Alberta, once considered the engine of the Canadian economy, is singularly focused on being able to export its energy resources to overseas markets. It can be argued that the campaign in Western Canada was less about economic issues; however, and more about amplifying an anti-Trudeau sentiment in the West. The Liberal government expanded employment insurance benefits for Albertans hard-hit by the downturn in the energy sector, and purchased the TransMountain pipeline. The government’s ownership of the pipeline makes the expansion a certainty, and the prime minister has indicated on a number of occasions that this project is one that is in the national interest. Yet, Albertans didn’t wait until all of the votes were counted before fanning the flames of separatist intent. #Wexit, or Western Exit, began trending on Twitter as it became apparent that Justin Trudeau would win the night. Though the sentiment is rooted in real economic pain, it isn’t a logical path to prosperity for Alberta for two reasons: first, it’s Canada, not Alberta, that owns the TransMountain pipeline. Second, even if Alberta were to succeed in securing sovereignty for itself, there remains a geopolitical problem of getting its oil resources to overseas markets. British Columbia isn’t going anywhere if Alberta secedes, and there is fierce opposition to the pipeline expansion in British Columbia. A sovereign Alberta would be in a more tenuous negotiating position, which is why #Wexit is just a fatally-flawed, knee-jerk reaction to the election result. On the other end of the country, the Bloc Quebecois has gone from comatose to dancing its way back to relevance on the federal scene. The Bloc Quebecois made gains throughout the province at the expense of all of the federalist parties, and leader Yves-Francois Blanchet made clear that he cares only about bringing the will of Quebec’s National Assembly to the House of Commons in Ottawa. The sovereignist BQ will make up just under ten per cent of Parliament at a time when attention ought to be given to uniting the country under common themes such as affordability, health care and the fight against climate change. Though Blanchet made clear that a referendum is not part of the BQ mandate for this Parliament, the Bloc’s performance only revives the thought of sovereignty in Quebec, along now with an expanded base of support. Justin Trudeau may have come out of last night’s election with the privilege of forming government, but the only real winner last night was the Bloc Quebecois and Mr. Blanchet. Generally speaking, a good night for the Quebec sovereignty movement means a bad night for the rest of Canada. Mr. Trudeau winning a plurality of seats for the Liberal Party is unquestionably a remarkable feat. Trudeau’s personal brand has been decimated over the last two years. The prime minister is now longer the towering head of a new Trudeau dynasty, but a leader occasionally displaying a flair for the dramatic while at times looking disingenuous. Trudeau has spouted on about his feminist credentials while expelling two prominent women from his caucus; he has lectured about the rule of law while attempting to circumvent prosecutorial independence; he has tried to position himself as a champion of national unity while now governing a country that is fractured at both ends; he’s self-proclaimed as “Mr. Diversity” and yet was caught more than once in black and brown face. Justin Trudeau has arguably underestimated millennial anger vis-a-vis his broken promise on electoral reform. Mr. Trudeau no longer has the coattails he once did, and his personal approval numbers are tanking. He may have won a plurality of seats and will form government with the distinction of having commanded the lowest popular vote totals of any winning party in an election, at 33.1 per cent. This is the worst result since Canada’s first general election in 1867, when John A. Macdonald won a majority government with 34.8 per cent of the popular vote. This was an election the Liberals should have lost. Andrew Scheer, the leader of the Conservative Party of Canada, is spinning last night’s election result as a preparatory one for the next election. The Conservatives secured 34.4 per cent and won the popular vote, and increased their caucus size by 26 MPs. Though having expanded their vote share and caucus, this election cycle had the most favourable conditions for any Conservative Party in the country’s history, and failed to win the election outright. Throughout this election, Mr. Scheer has proven to be more secretive than Stephen Harper was ever feared to be when he contested his first federal election in 2004. Secret dual citizenship, questions about his work history and evading questions on his beliefs with respect to women’s and gay rights have all blemished his character in the eyes of many Canadians. Any federal Conservative Party with the same electoral conditions — an incumbent prime minister mired in scandal and a wall of provincial conservative support from Alberta to Quebec — should have won this election handily. Had the Conservatives been led by a Rona Ambrose or, even Stephen Harper, we’d be talking about a Conservative majority government today. Instead, Conservatives will once again occupy the opposition benches as the government-in-waiting. Mr. Scheer insists that he will stay on as leader, but Conservatives would be well-intentioned to start shopping for another leader. At the left of Canada’s political spectrum, there is a looming identity crisis, and much of their electoral fortunes in the next election will rest on the political maneuvers that take place during this minority Parliament. The New Democrats have lost their base of support in Quebec. Their only remaining Member of Parliament is Alexandre Boulerice in Rosemont-La Petite Patrie, in Montreal. All of the gains hard-won by Jack Layton have been eliminated by poor leadership decisions in Thomas Mulcair and Jagmeet Singh. In particular, Mr. Singh continues to appear unprepared and uncertain about his own political positions, and it is difficult to see how he can remain as leader after this poor election result. Mr. Singh’s leadership has been called into question well before the writ dropped, and with the party essentially broke, the NDP will need to seriously consider finding a new, dynamic and competent leader which can reverse the party’s fortunes. Despite these losses, if New Democrats play their cards right, not all hope is lost. They hold the balance of power in the new Parliament, and can prop up the Liberal minority government. Initiating a leadership contest will be necessary in order to make them relevant whenever the next election is called, but they do have strong MPs who can manage the day-to-day legislative wrangling that will inevitably occur as the prime minister governs with a minority government. Peter Julian, Charlie Angus and Alexandre Boulerice would make competent interim leaders. The Green Party, like the Conservatives, had many of the conditions conducive to a big electoral breakthrough. Elizabeth May had a platform filled with ideas that appeal to young people and performed very well in the leaders debates. For the first time, millenials made up the largest voting bloc in a federal election, and coupled with the recent environmental demonstrations, the Greens had hoped for major gains across the country. Though they grew their popular support nationwide to over a million votes, and made a breakthrough in New Brunswick, they only secured three seats. Ms. May may be competent on policy and an experienced campaigner, but talk of her handing over leadership of the party to Jody Wilson-Raybould (who won re-election as an independent in Vancouver-Granville) may have led people to believe that Elizabeth May was a lame-duck leader. When you’re running to become prime minister, Canadians do not tend to support someone who appears to have one foot out the door. What is clear with the Green Party is that the message is resonating with Canadians, but ever slowly. The Greens would be well-served to start thinking about a transition in leadership if they want to be considered as the serious progressive option in the next election. In Canada’s post-election divide, the Green Party may have opportunities to bring people together, but they will need a leader who seems to want the job more than Ms. May currently does. Liberal strategist David Hurley has suggested throughout the campaign that it would be the last election for at least two of the major party leaders. Had Canadians elected a majority government of any stripe, he would have been proven correct last night. His prophecy will take a few days or weeks to come to fruition. What is clear is that supporters of all of the major parties (save the Bloc Quebecois) have a reason to start looking at potential leadership contenders. Mr. Trudeau is damaged beyond saving, and will have a more difficult relationship with his caucus. Andrew Scheer could never hope to have better electoral conditions than he did last night. Jagmeet Singh always seems unprepared, ill-informed and unserious. Elizabeth May has had one too-many elections as leader, with no significant breakthrough for her party. All of the parties have reasons to start thinking about new leaders. The opposition leaders will try to hang on to their jobs, and one of the arguments they will inevitably use is the uncertain timing of the next election. In a minority Parliament, a single confidence vote would trigger a new run to the polls. Perhaps the only thing Canadians have in common with all of the opposition parties is their thirst for another election. This is especially true for the New Democrats, who financially would not be able to fund another election at the moment. This factor alone compels the NDP to support the Liberal government. They may oppose TransMountain, but the Conservatives would prop up the government on any bills that move the pipeline expansion forward. All of this suggests a stable Trudeau minority government, potentially strong-arming its progressive opposition with the threat of a snap-election. Canada’s post-election divide is not a new phenomenon, but nationally there appears to be consensus on the most divisive facet of this election. Maxime Bernier’s right-wing People’s Party of Canada is no more. Born out of being a sore loser in the Conservative leadership contest, Mr. Bernier’s political philosophy was soundly rejected when it failed to elect anyone. Bernier himself lost his own seat in Beauce to the Conservatives he had spent the last year characterizing as “morally and intellectually bankrupt”. Even if the party survives (and that is very unlikely), Bernier’s political career ended with his defeat last night. The only other thing Canadians may agree on this morning lies in the notion that this Parliament will be a dysfunctional charade casted by leaders no one really wants. It would be surprising, and utterly disappointing, if the next election features the same people vying to be prime minister."
Medium.com,Society,Could Global Tourism Go Extinct?,World,https://gen.medium.com/could-global-tourism-go-extinct-3aff38ff9651?source=topic_page---------247------------------1," here’s no more disreputable evangelist than the libertine who spends his youth lost in drink, drugs, and depravity, only to find religion, fetishize sobriety, and spend his life’s second act scolding others for indulging in the perdition he himself so copiously explored. But I think I’m about to become that person. And so, too, I’m pretty sure, are a lot of you. My vice hasn’t been booze, dope, or cheap relationships. It’s been travel. I’ve been to 49 states (Maine, if you need it) and somewhere in the region of 75 countries. I’ve bunked down in grotty guesthouses in the Philippines, crashed on friends’ couches in Germany, upgraded to four-star suites in the Caribbean, and enrolled in loyalty programs from Starwood to Motel 6. For a number of years, I made my living as a travel writer and editor, enjoying the globetrotting lifestyle and encouraging others to partake. I wrote travel guides and books. I briefly edited a magazine for one of those cruise lines. I enjoyed the work, liked my co-workers, accepted the money. Back when I started traveling a lot in the 1990s, this made me a mildly interesting person to talk to at parties. But this is no longer the case. I have a schoolteacher, IT guys, government workers, even unemployed people in my life with more stamps in their passports than I have. According to various surveys, at least half or more of millennials would rather travel than do traditional things like buy a house and pay off debt. Americans aren’t unique: Tourism has become the habit of the world. In 2019, the United Nations World Tourism Organization (UNWTO) announced that international travel had increased, yet again, to 1.4 billion tourist arrivals. Like the data about warming oceans and melting polar ice, the figures measuring mass tourism have been surpassing forecasts years earlier than anticipated and are expected to continue their exponential climb. The UNWTO predicts a 3% to 4% annual increase in international travel. Travel is a drug, and a damn good one. Like any other user, I want to take a few more tokes while the good shit lasts. California offers the most striking example of wanton visitor growth in the United States. In 2018, the state saw 281.4 million tourists. That’s like inviting everyone in Indonesia, the world’s fourth most populous country, to traipse through the union’s most populous state each year. The Golden State’s popularity among visitors might account for the $35 I paid at New Brighton State Beach, south of the redwoods near Santa Cruz, to “camp” a few summers back. I pitched my tent in a site that literally abutted someone’s backyard. The flicker of the TV emanating from a room in their two-story house, not from my fire ring (a modified oil drum), provided atmosphere. That was the night I finally swore off camping in California. Elsewhere, the views are uglier, the reactions more dramatic. From Croatia to Thailand, anti-tourism campaigns are spreading. Most have appeared in a more or less organic and unconnected fashion. But it feels like only a matter of time before they metastasize into the next global cause célèbre."

Medium.com,Society,"To Stop Ebola, Scientists Are Trying to Predict Its Next Target",World,https://onezero.medium.com/to-stop-ebola-scientists-are-trying-to-predict-its-next-target-ae9ac5df082f?source=topic_page---------249------------------1," ore than 2,000 people have died in the Democratic Republic of Congo since an Ebola outbreak was declared last August, the second largest such outbreak ever recorded. The number of such outbreaks has ballooned since the disease was discovered in 1976. One reason it’s been so difficult to control is that Ebola is hard to track. Karin Huster, a nurse who worked with Doctors Without Borders on the front lines of the record-breaking Ebola outbreak of 2014–2016, says that medical professionals often lack the tools to know whether an outbreak is happening and contain it when it is. “We knew some of the signs, [but] we didn’t have the tools,” she tells OneZero. But two new tools for identifying outbreaks could soon prevent those situations from taking place. A team led by David Redding, PhD, and Kate Jones, PhD, professors at the Centre for Biodiversity and Environment Research at University College London, created a computer model that predicts where Ebola outbreaks will most likely occur in the future, together with their magnitude and causes. Their model, described in a paper this month in Nature Communications, successfully predicted the 2014–2016 outbreak and the current one, Redding tells OneZero. Its predictive power can help public health professionals prepare for outbreaks before they occur. “You identify new hot spots that you didn’t have on your radar before.” Researchers still track the spread of Ebola through contact tracing, a labor-intensive process that involves in-person interviews with patients and the people they came in contact with. Computer models can help, but they are limited if they rely on public data on Ebola outbreaks, which Redding and his co-authors say isn’t enough for accurate pattern recognition because it spans only 40 years. Instead, the new model takes into account environmental and socioeconomic factors like climate change, population growth, and changing health care practices. By 2070, the model predicts, there’ll be a 1.75-to-3.2-fold increase in the rate of Ebola outbreaks in Africa. The model also predicts climate change will lead to a “subtle” increase in the risk that it will spread to humans, Redding says. Because Ebola is a zoonotic disease — one that begins in animals and is passed on to humans — and climate change could broaden the geographic area in which some animals survive (mostly fruit bats and, to a lesser extent, apes and duikers), the risk of infection could rise. Redding says, though, that population growth and poverty remain the biggest factors in future Ebola outbreaks. The new model allows for more holistic predictions, which may identify at-risk areas that haven’t been considered before. The model predicts Ebola outbreaks in the eastern, southern, and western parts of Africa, where they haven’t occurred in the past. While the model can predict where Ebola might strike next, another new tool can help contain the disease when it has already struck. Earlier this month, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration gave market approval to the OraQuick Ebola Rapid Antigen Test, a powerful diagnostic tool. Instead of taking days to produce a test result from potentially infected individuals, this new test can diagnose Ebola in 30 minutes. Importantly, it can be used on living and dead bodies, allowing people like Huster to quickly determine when an outbreak has already begun and whether families can safely bury their dead without first decontaminating the bodies. “This tool is super useful,” says Huster, who used a trial version of the tool in Sierra Leone in 2014. Because it’s simple to use, doesn’t require specialist training, and isn’t reliant on electricity, it can be used in remote areas by medical workers who need urgent results. “You identify new hot spots that you didn’t have on your radar before,” Huster says. “So you can intervene much faster than if you had to take the blood, bring it to a lab that might be far — a day, or two, or three — away, and by that time, the virus has already gone from one person to another.” “But Ebola is not the only thing we’re going to have more of and going to have to deal with.” The new diagnostic tool comes with its own drawbacks: It isn’t as accurate as a polymerase chain reaction (PCR) test, considered the “gold standard” for Ebola diagnosis. Hunter fears that false negative readings from the rapid test could result in infected individuals being sent back into the community instead of quarantined. Huster and Redding both say that the recently developed Ebola vaccine has been key in containing the current outbreak in the DRC. But to prevent future outbreaks, we need disease-specific tools like computer models and rapid tests, Redding says. And as climate change raises the risk of outbreaks of other zoonotic viruses like West Nile — something the new model can also predict — even the slightest head start on diagnosis and prevention will be extremely valuable. “I don’t think this is unique to Ebola,” Huster says. “It might be a good tool for us to use, because Ebola is so scary for most people that it might make them move on the climate crisis because they don’t want to have Ebola in their countries. But Ebola is not the only thing we’re going to have more of and going to have to deal with.”"

But it wasn’t, and Prime Minister Justin Trudeau has secured himself enough seats in the House of Commons to continue as Prime Minister, albeit as the head of a minority government. His win comes despite the Liberal Party finishing with around 240,000 fewer votes than the Conservative Party. But in Canada’s parliamentary system, it is seats in the House that matter, and while the Liberals don’t have enough to claim an outright victory, they are in the strongest position to form a minority government, with support of either the New Democratic Party or the Bloc Québécois. The Conservatives achieved a swing of 4.4% against the Liberals, and if this swing were uniform across every riding in Canada, we would be talking about the possibility of a Prime Minister Andrew Scheer. So why did they finish so far behind? The Conservatives achieved significant swings in two particular regions of the country. Unfortunately, those regions weren’t the most optimal place for the Conservatives to pick up seats. The region where the Conservatives achieved the largest swing was in Atlantic Canada, where a 13.8% swing went partway to reversing the large swing in the other direction in 2015. But the Liberals won all 32 seats in the region, many of them by very large margins, and taking these seats back would be difficult. But on a uniform swing, the Conservatives should have picked up a few more than this, including seats like Saint John — Rothesay (NB) and Egmont (PE). I don’t see signs I’d expect to see if this were down to tactical voting, as the Conservative candidates in these ridings underperformed their vote change. The Prairies is another area where the Conservatives achieved a large swing against the Liberals. This has, in recent history, consistently been a very strong part of the country for the Conservatives; in 2015, they only lost in 18 of 62 seats. Five of the seven Liberal losses to the Conservatives could have been won on the national uniform swing, as well as both the seats they picked up from the NDP, and so the extra swing on top of that only got them two additional seats (though the satisfaction of defeating Ralph Goodale, which they wouldn’t have done on the national swing, must be worth something). The Conservatives did slightly over-perform in their swing in British Columbia. There were a handful of Conservative targets in BC for them to go after, including in Mission, Coquitlam, and Kelowna. Here, the Conservatives finished roughly in line with what I would expect them to achieve if the national swing were applied across the province. And because it would be rude for me to completely ignore the North, it’s worth mentioning that they did achieve a large 14.5% swing in Yukon, larger than in the other territories. Unfortunately for them, they finished 72 votes behind there, so just missed out on the seat. The big story in Québec was the surge of the Bloc Québécois and the collapse of the NDP in the province. There were a couple of seats here in the Conservative target list, and they did hold the seat they took from the Liberals in a by-election last year. But they missed out on very little by under-performing here. Where the Conservatives underperformed the most is Ontario, the one province that had the majority of battleground ridings. In fact, the Conservatives’ vote share was actually down nearly 2% in this province, and the only reason they managed to gain seats is because the Liberals went down even more. They did even worse than that in the key battleground areas, losing nearly 3% of the vote in the 416 and, even more critically, 4.3% in the 905 (the Liberals dropped less in the 905 and gained votes in the 416, allowing them to keep nearly all of those seats). The Conservatives only picked up two seats net from the Liberals in this province (the NDP lost one each to the Liberals and Conservatives). If they were able to take the swing they achieved nationally and apply it in every riding in Ontario, they would have picked up another 17 seats, including Whitby, Burlington, Cambridge, Oakville, and both Lakeshore and Streetsville in Mississauga. Add to it a couple of NDP seats that they could pick up, and these Ontario seats alone would be enough to bring the Conservatives and the Liberals to a near-tie. The Conservatives needed to gain over 40 seats from the Liberals, as well as a handful from the NDP, to finish in first place. On the battleground, this would require them to fill the entire first two columns, as well as a few seats in the third. While they would have done that if the 4.4% swing they achieved nationally were uniform in every riding, the inefficiency of their gains in vote share means that they missed many of the seats that would have put Andrew Scheer in 24 Sussex."
Medium.com,Society,People told me to boycott Japan. I didn’t. Here’s my story,World,https://medium.com/@Iamjuwonpark/people-told-me-to-boycott-japan-i-didnt-here-s-my-story-98e6bc40069d?source=topic_page---------252------------------1," “AVOID ANTI-KOREAN MARCHES IN JAPAN” was the message that stood out among the usual annoying flood of caution messages sent by Korean foreign ministry to my phone when I landed at Narita airport earlier this month. The ministry sends these messages to travelers — whether they want to receive them or not — with warnings tailored to each location. Upon landing in the Philippines, South Korean travelers are warned of both hurricanes and terrorism, in Russia, the possibility of street violence. Nowadays, the ministry feels compelled to warn Koreans that their safety could be imperiled in Japan, which is, by nearly any measure, one of the world’s safest counties. This perceived danger has its roots in politics and history. Over this summer, South Korea and Japan have been engaging in an unprecedented trade war. The turbulent relationship between the two hit rock bottom in July when Japan imposed trade restrictions on South Korea, posing a significant challenge to its already sluggish economy. South Koreans responded with tit-for-tat action by boycotting everything Japanese — from beers, cars, apparel to even travel to the country. Little did I know that this feud would affect my recent vacation to Japan."
Medium.com,Society,"From trade deals to climate change, middle powers are steadying the ship even as Donald Trump is…",World,https://medium.com/@Rashmee/from-trade-deals-to-climate-change-middle-powers-are-steadying-the-ship-even-as-donald-trump-is-f7ddb96c8444?source=topic_page---------253------------------1," In the global jungle, is it possible for anyone but the biggest beasts to command all that is within sight — and most of what is not? Do middle powers even matter in a world in which the US is steadily undermining the international institutions it helped build and in which China is in the ascendant? The issue was partly addressed in Canada’s recent election campaign — if only by leaving it largely unaddressed. International issues such as climate change and migration were raised but Canada’s larger foreign policy challenge — that of relevance — was not. Stefanie von Hlatky, an associate political studies professor at Canada’s Queen’s University, noted towards the end of the campaign: “It’s hard out there for a middle power. Even the most creative foreign policy ideas that candidates could propose might sound like magical thinking in the age of Trump.” In real terms, a middle power is not about being mid-sized; the term is not a reference to geographical area or even GDP So does middle-power status now really mean a profound and debilitating lack of power? Not really. Collectively, middle powers do have influence. Taken together, for example, Japan, Germany, the UK, France, Canada, South Korea and Australia account for more than one-fifth of the global economy. They are also important trading nations. This is a good reason to pay attention to both the theory and practice of middle-power status. More broadly though, middle powers have an urgent and compelling shared interest in maintaining a world order with rules that respect their economic and security interests and protect them from the whims of great powers. Historically, a middle power was first defined in the 16th century by Giovanni Botero, a mayor of Milan. The system of European states was crystallising and Botero created categories: grandissime, mezzano, piccioli — or empire, middle power, small power. To be a mezzano, a state had to be considered capable of standing on its own without help from others. In real terms, a middle power is not about being mid-sized; the term is not a reference to geographical area or even GDP. A generally accepted definition of a middle power comes from a 2012 thesis by a King’s College London PhD candidate. It says a middle power is “a state actor which has limited influence on deciding the distribution of power in a given regional system, but is capable of deploying a variety of sources of power to change the position of great powers and defend its own position on matters related to national or regional security that directly affect it”. That is a mouthful, but it is clear that a middle power will not be pushed around. The concept of middle powers featured in diplomatic debates at the peace settlement of the Napoleonic Wars in 1815 and in the early stages of the establishment of the United Nations after the Second World War. At the time, Canadian prime minister Mackenzie King suggested that “middlepowerhood” could secure the international influence of countries like his. Australia’s foreign minister raised this idea as well. Ever since, middle-power status has been considered a trademark of both countries’ foreign policy. But in the years since Donald Trump’s election to the US presidency, middle powers have been faced with a greater responsibility than simply managing their own interests. They now need to protect the very rules-based order within which they have flourished for more than 70 years. They have taken up the task relatively seriously — at least in terms of rhetorical intent. Earlier this month, Dutch prime minister Mark Rutte told the Sydney-headquartered Lowy Institute think-tank that middle powers such as Australia and the Netherlands must work together “to influence and shape international debate”. If not, he said, “a world in which might makes right is never far away”. As an example of the “direct and tragic” real-world ramifications of a breakdown of “the international rules-based order”, Mr Rutte cited the shooting down of Malaysia Airlines flight in July 2014 over eastern Ukraine. It claimed 298 lives, including 193 Dutch citizens and 27 Australians. What he clearly meant was the difficulty of bringing anyone to account for downing the aircraft. There have been other significant declarations of intent by middle powers. Earlier this year, the Franco-German proposal for an “alliance for multilateralism”, Shinzo Abe’s promise that Japan would “preserve and continue the free, open, and rules-based international order”, and Canadian foreign minister Chrystia Freeland’s insistence on “doubling down on an improved rules-based international order”. A little further back in time, there was former UK prime minister Theresa May’s promise that “a new, global Britain” would energetically defend “the rules-based international system on which the stability of our world continues to rely” and India’s chief career diplomat Vijay Gokhale’s call to “strengthen multilateralism” by pushing back against unilateral efforts to undo the “established international mechanisms governing the global commons”. Aside from talk, however, have middle powers managed to accomplish anything in the past few years? Three limited successes are worth noting. From October 2018, Canada has convened what it calls a “working group of like-minded nations” to reform the World Trade Organisation, not least its slow dispute resolution system. Second, after US President Donald Trump withdrew from the 12-country Trans-Pacific Partnership, Japan urged the remaining members to continue without the deal’s principal and biggest sponsor. A renamed agreement — covering about 13 per cent of the global economy — was launched. Significantly, it is still open to the US — as indeed to other interested countries such as South Korea, Colombia, Indonesia, Thailand and the UK — thereby holding out the prospect of creating a multi-regional global economic trading zone in the future. Third, the Paris climate change pact did not collapse — despite the US withdrawal — because middle powers reaffirmed their commitment. They also enlarged the sphere of co-operation to include regional government leaders, such as the California governor, to show the strength of the effort on the ground. Perhaps middle powers now matter even more than empires."
Medium.com,Society,When Venezuela Accused Me of Being a Terrorist,World,https://medium.com/muros-invisibles/when-venezuela-accused-me-of-being-a-terrorist-b403de1f66a8?source=topic_page---------254------------------1," “Do you know it’s a 10-year minimum sentence for espionage and another 10 for terrorism?” said the officer from SEBIN, the political police charged with persecuting and torturing those considered threats to the Venezuelan regime. I had heard a lot of stories about SEBIN during my time reporting on Venezuela — none of them good. He paused, staring at me. His manner was poised- his posture perfect. He adjusted his wire-frame glasses. “Of course, we will have to charge your friend with sedition, treason and perhaps espionage as well. It will be more difficult for him than for you.” He made the threat as if he were commenting on the weather- his manner detached and terrifyingly polite. He began fiddling with my phone, scrolling through my text messages. “What kind of information does your friend pass to you?” he asked. An hour before, I was detained on the Venezuelan border while working as a journalist. Now I was being accused of being a spy and a terrorist. All of the stories of torture and violence in Venezuelan prisons I had heard in the last two years swirled around in my head. Maintaining a calm exterior was becoming increasingly difficult. Twenty-four hours before that charming conversation, I arrived in Maicao, Colombia, on the border with Venezuela, to work on a story about gasoline smuggling. I was travelling with a Venezuelan named “Jose Rafael”, a journalist from Caracas. I was glad to have company. Maicao isn’t the sort of place in which one wants to be alone. It is a blisteringly hot trade-town on a lawless frontier. Venezuelans come from the western part of the country, where ongoing shortages are the most severe, to buy goods. The region is also a smuggling hub for gasoline, food and cocaine. During the day, the entire city is an open-air marketplace for every good imaginable- from clothes to cheap electronics to bulk food to diapers to anything else one can imagine. There is little police presence and after dusk the streets empty as Maicao transforms from bustling market town into a silent city of phantoms. After sunset we stayed in our cheap hotel room killing roaches, writing and waiting for the sun to rise. In the morning we went to La Raya, the neighborhood on the frontier. As Jose and I walked towards the unmarked border, we spied a Venezuelan checkpoint about 100 meters in the distance. A large billboard featuring Nicolas Maduro, president of Venezuela, with his arm draped around Hugo Chavez bid us welcome. “I want to go have a look.” Jose told me. I had no desire to go anywhere near the checkpoint. I told him I would wait there, presumably in Colombia. I took a seat on the curb, well away from the officials checking documents. I waited as he wandered off. A few passersby tried to sell me rides to Maracaibo in Venezuela, but mostly people just smiled at me. I chatted for a few minutes with a curious fruit vendor about life in New York City. Then I noticed a Venezuelan National Guardsman approaching me. Alarmed, I stood up and slowly backpedaled. “Please stop moving, sir.” he shouted, with his right hand on his holstered pistol. “Hello. I’m just waiting for a friend.” I replied, continuing to slowly back up. Why was he following me? I thought maybe if I could keep mobile, I could attract the attention of one of the few immigration officials from the Colombian side. “I told you to STOP MOVING!” he yelled. He un-holstered his pistol and shifted into a combat stance- feet separated, elbows raised with both hands on his weapon, which he kept pointed downward. I stopped moving and raised my hands to shoulder level. “Uh, is there a problem here?” I asked. He didn’t respond, but kept advancing. When he reached me, he holstered his pistol, but kept his right hand on the weapon. “Identification.” he stated bluntly. “Sure, officer.” I said, slowly taking out my wallet with my right hand while keeping my left hand raised. “Here is my Cedula”, (Colombian identification card). I knew my appearance and accent had already given me away as American but I thought maybe I could buy some time. Venezuelan officials would not react well to a reporter from the Evil Empire, the name Chavez gave the United States. I looked towards the Colombian immigration office. There were no officials in sight. He pocketed my identification. “Come with me.” he said, placing his left hand on my shoulder, his pistol hand still on the weapons’ grip. “Listen. I think there is a misunderstanding here. I’m not doing anything. I’m just..” “Shut your mouth.” he told me. “Come with me now.” “Surely we can work this out.” I said, removing some Colombian money from my wallet. “I told you to shut your mouth.” I did. He gripped my arm and pushed me along roughly towards the checkpoint in the distance.. “I’m no thief.” he told me as we approached a small, two-story dilapidated concrete building near the military checkpoint. It seemed like a strange comment to make. It turned out later he and I have very different definitions of the word. Jose Rafael was chatting with an immigration guard in the distance. He spotted me being escorted away and bee-lined towards us. “Hey! Wait a second!” he shouted. “What’s the problem here?” he asked as he approached. The guard he had been chatting with followed behind. “You’re with him?” said the guard detaining me. “Yeah, he is my friend.” Jose replied. “I just went to get…” “Come with me,” said the guardsman who wasn’t a thief, cutting him off. The soldier that had been following behind placed his hand on Jose’s shoulder. They ignored our protests as they escorted us into the building, dumping us in a concrete cell that contained a desk, three chairs and a barely functioning fan. “What are you doing in Venezuela?” the guard asked after patting me down. “You brought me here. I was waiting in Colombia.” “No. You entered Venezuela without permission. Are you a spy?” he said as he opened my backpack. I laughed. The idea seemed ridiculous. I had been sitting in plain sight on a curb in the middle of the street chatting with passersby. If I were a spy, I would be the worst secret agent in the history of espionage. “What are these?” He held my cameras up before me, frowning. “Journalists.” said the other guard, smiling. My heart sank. “Please wait here.” said the guard who wasn’t a thief, as if we had a choice. He left the room with the cameras and our phones. Jose paced with his hands on his face. “Brother, I don’t think you realize how bad this is. They disappear people like me.” He pulled on his hair as he circled the room. He stopped, looking me. “How much money can you get a hold of? Right now.” “Not much. Maybe if I made some phone calls and emptied my account I could come up with a few thousand dollars.” “It’s not enough.” said Jose. He sighed. “Look. If we can’t get some money together you’re going to be on a bus to a prison in Caracas. They’re not going to kill a gringo. If I’m really lucky I will be there beside you.” He resumed pacing. “But it’s more likely I will be buried outside in a ditch.” An hour or so later, the official from SEBIN arrived. He was average height, lanky, perhaps about 45 years old with a neatly ironed uniform, wire-rimmed spectacles and a grim expression. “Gentlemen, this is a very delicate situation you are in. You have material against Venezuela on your cameras. You snuck into the country, and you are here to commit espionage and terrorism.” He waved off our attempts to respond. “Please be quiet while I am speaking.” He arranged his papers in front of him. “In short, you are a spy.” he said looking at me. “And perhaps a terrorist.” He then looked at Jose, “And you are a traitor, a collaborator with a hostile foreign power and perhaps a terrorist as well.” “But you are lucky. I would rather avoid any international problems. I believe that I can hush this incident up and all can move on if you can transfer ten-thousands dollars to a bank account here in Venezuela. I will provide you with the account number.” He stood up, still holding his papers. “Now Jose Rafael, you will accompany me, please.” he said, gesturing towards the door. Jose followed him out of the room. I didn’t know it at the time but he was taken to another cell with a metal chair in the center of the room. Next to the chair was a table on which rested a car battery, rusty terminal clamps, a knife and a pair of pliers. They sat him in the chair and began to explain in minute detail the precarious position we were in. Jose eyed the torture implements nervously as they spoke. Another agent from SEBIN entered my cell as they left. His demeanor and appearance the opposite of the first; younger, perhaps 30, muscular and nonchalant. He carried himself with the easy swagger of a gangster- all slouches and threatening smiles- insultingly informal and dangerous. If the first official was terrifyingly polite, he was street-thug intimidation. He turned the chair around and flopped down before me, uncomfortably close. He leaned in, his face inches away. He wore way too much cologne. It made my eyes water. “You know what we do to gringos in the prisons here?” he asked me. He was here to scare me, to underscore and exaggerate all the worst possibilities, and intimidate me physically and with threats. It worked. He scared me, though he seemed like a cartoon cutout- the “bad cop” as it were. I felt like he had been watching terrible police-dramas to practice for this. It made me laugh a little inside to think of him as an overly dramatic actor. I needed the laugh because he was describing beatings, open-air prisons where the inmates would be just as dangerous as the guards, cells shared with a dozen other occupants and serial torture at the hands of officials seeking information. The scary part wasn’t his demeanor, rather it was the fact that he wasn’t lying. I’ve talked to people who have been in those prisons. It was all true. He threatened me for 15 minutes then left me to think. I did not think happy thoughts. After awhile, “Good-cop” returned with Jose. Jose had convinced the Venezuelan officials that he could obtain a few-thousand dollars. I told them I could do the same. But one of us would have to go back to Colombia to do it. Jose Rafael volunteered and the agents from SEBIN agreed. They would keep me as collateral. It was the best outcome we could hope for. As Jose said, they weren’t going to kill a gringo- especially a journalist. As he was leaving, Jose grabbed my phone. He said he would need my contacts in order to raise money. Jose and I shook hands. “I will see you in a few hours, brother,” he said, looking me in the eyes. I had serious doubts that he would. Would he just run off? I couldn’t blame him if he did, there was no way he was going to be able to enter Venezuela again after this ordeal-he was lucky to be escaping with his life. They threw me back in the oppressively hot, concrete cell and left me alone. I don’t know how much time passed. I sat in the chair, staring at the electric fan. My heart raced. My thoughts dwelt on prisons in Caracas. I closed my eyes and slowed my breathing, trying to calm myself. A panic attack wasn’t going to improve my situation. The rising terror was preventing me from thinking clearly. That’s when the power went out. I sat in the darkness, sweating, waiting, trying not to scream."
Medium.com,Society,Huge Aboriginal art festival begins in South Australia,World,https://medium.com/@TheLeadSA/huge-aboriginal-art-festival-begins-in-south-australia-f5f920bae20?source=topic_page---------255------------------1," The world’s largest celebration of Australian Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander art and culture has started in Adelaide and will feature in France next year. Tarnanthi: Festival of Aboriginal & Torres Strait Islander Art 2019 features the work of more than 1000 artists from across Australia in a range of mediums. The festival was launched at the Art Gallery of South Australia (AGSA) on October 17 and runs through to January 27. The Art Gallery will host 30 collaborative or solo projects involving 195 artists during the festival while another 33 events and exhibitions will be held at 30 venues across South Australia. AGSA has also announced that in 2020 Tarnanthi will feature an exhibition in France for the first time. The gallery, in collaboration with APY Collective and the Regional Council of Brittany, will present Kulata Tjuta at the Musée des Beaux-Arts de Rennes, in Brittany, France, in October 2020. The centrepiece of the Brittany exhibition will be the signature work of the 2017 Tarnanthi festival — a spectacular installation titled Kulata Tjuta, meaning ‘Many Spears’, which comprises more than 500 spears, suspended in mid-air. AGSA Director Rhana Devenport said she was thrilled the Tarnanthi legacy would be shared beyond Australian shores next year. “As Tarnanthi shows so vividly, art can communicate across cultures and across continents,” she said. “And through art, Tarnanthi articulates a message about the depth of culture in this land — a message that shapes lives locally, attitudes nationally and, increasingly, awareness internationally.” Tarnanthi is a Kaurna word that means the first light of day or the first sight of a seed sprouting. The Kaurna are the original people of the Adelaide Plains. This weekend in Adelaide features the Tarnanthi Art Fair at Tandanya National Aboriginal Cultural Institute where works from 50 art centres and more than 500 artists will be available for purchase. Tarnanthi Artistic Director Nici Cumpston said Adelaide and South Australia had become a gateway to Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Art through the annual festival, which was first run in 2015. She said the festival attracted visitors from around Australia and the world and was also an important commercial opportunity for many of the artists. “For Aboriginal and Torres Straight Islander people being able to showcase their works of art and having their art for sale is a really important part of their lives to survive and to continue making work and Tarnanthi provides that opportunity across many different levels,” Cumpston said. “It’s also an opportunity for Australians and people from around the world to really gain an understanding of Aboriginal people and our culture. “The artists are really pushing themselves, pushing their ideas and Tarnanthi is providing that opportunity through the support we can give financially but also through meeting people who can help them realise their ideas.” The South Australian Museum, next door to AGSA on Adelaide’s cultural boulevard, North Terrace, is home to the world’s largest collection of Aboriginal material, culture and art. The museum is hosting two exhibitions during Tarnanthi: Still in my mind: Gurindji location, experience and visuality and Kondoli: the Keeper of the Fire. Still in my mind reflects on events preceding and following the seminal Gurindji Walk Off in 1966 — when Vincent Lingiari led over 200 countrymen, women and children off Wave Hill Station to protest slave labour conditions and human rights abuse. Kondoli is a sculpture of a southern right whale woven from freshwater rushes created by Lead Senior Ngarrindjeri Weaver Aunty Ellen Trevorrow. It tells the story of Kondoli, the ancestor who brought fire to the Ngarrindjeri people. SA Museum Head of Humanities Professor John Carty said the giant woven whale was one of the most important pieces that had come into the museum in decades. “Kondoli created jealousy. He was speared, he dived into the water and the spear wound became his spout and he became the whale,” Prof Carty said. “It’s the story of this bringer of fire and we feel that Aunty Ellen and the Ngarrindjeri weavers have brought their created fire here to the South Australian Museum by weaving this extraordinary whale to share with everyone at Tarnanthi and it’s a very special gift.” Tarnanthi: Festival of Aboriginal & Torres Strait Islander Art is presented by the Art Gallery of South Australia in partnership with BHP and with support from the Government of South Australia."
Medium.com,Society,"Well, frig, maybe we should just have another election already",World,https://medium.com/cravenly-stupid-frustratingly-shallow/well-frig-maybe-we-should-just-have-another-election-already-e0cea454191e?source=topic_page---------256------------------1," As I write this, droves of folks are trudging to their local school gymnasium to cast their ballot. The top two contenders are not just disliked, but desperately so. Both Justin Trudeau and Andrew Scheer have slapped each other around to the point that they’re both pretty bruised. Trudeau has warned Scheer would roll the clock back on the good times, Scheer has warned Trudeau would spell disaster for your pocketbook. Neither warning feels particularly honest. Maybe that’s why, throughout the campaign, no matter how much voters saw of the two front runners, their impressions seemed to only worsen. The other three, for all their charms, are going to be lucky to garner 75 seats. Yves-François Blanchet, in Quebec, has done well on a very traditional Bloc pitch — you might not care about federal politics, but let me go get you funding for a new metro line and more say over regional development. May has tried to activate disenchanted, young, and non-voters with an urgent call to action on the climate that never seemed to quite convince the public that it is feasible. And Jagmeet Singh, buoyed by a late-campaign bounce, has won over a bunch of skeptical voters with a neatly-packaged plan to build a bunch of stuff with rich people’s money. So we wake up tomorrow, hung over, and find ourselves with a minority Parliament of two parties led by men the public seems to deeply dislike, tasked with cobbling support from parties who did well in spite of them. A Liberal-NDP partnership makes most logical sense, but it’s shaky as all hell. If the CBC poll tracker has it right, it would give the party a 2-seat majority (1, if the speaker is elected from either of the two parties.) That leaves the government on perpetually shaky feet. A formal coalition would be a bit safer, but not by much. A Liberal-NDP-Green deal gives a bit more wiggle room, though May’s conditions for supporting a government appear wide and changing. In either of these scenarios, May has ruled out a coalition — but Singh and Trudeau haven’t. Bringing the NDP inside the tent is sure to keep the party incentivized to keep voting for Liberal bills. A Liberal-NDP-Bloc coalition of chaos is obviously a much more stable alternative to some other dance cards. But how, exactly that is supposed to work is unclear. Blanchet has ruled out a coalition, but said he would support a government which kicks in money for Quebec’s effort to bring high-speed internet through the province — and, beyond that, who knows what else. In this scenario, the Conservatives begin firing from all cannons on Trudeau’s contribution to reviving sovereignty. A Conservative-Bloc deal would, notwithstanding Scheer’s current histrionics over the idea of a deal with the Liberals, make some sense. There’s a reason why Stephen Harper entertained working with the Bloc in the past. And the Tories’ and Bloc’s brands of Quebec nationalism are, generally, pretty compatible. But the Conservatives may have already backed themselves into a corner on this — and there’s no telling that they would even have enough seats, combined, to govern at all. A Conservative deal with anyone else feels unlikely. A Conservative-Liberal unity government? No chance. The Greens will work with anyone, but won’t have enough seats to be king-or-queen-maker alone. A Scheer-Singh partnership would be a real odd couple scenario. So who forms government? Maybe a party just wins enough seats to govern alone. Maybe the NDP-Liberal deal works effortlessly. But I have a hard time seeing it. The Liberals ran an arrogant campaign and seem allergic to the idea that they could be reduced to relying on others to govern. That attitude will probably carry into those negotiations. The NDP, meanwhile, have always been friendly to the idea of a coalition but never seem to know what to do with themselves when they get close. The Tories and the various third-party advertisers, meanwhile, have been gearing up for coalition talks. Ontario Proud is already set to try and torpedo public support for any coalition talks. If you thought the election was angry, just wait til’ that comes around. It frankly feels like the most likely scenario is the one we’ve seen a few times in the past 20 years — the largest party will be forced to marshal support from the other parties on a vote-by-vote basis. That is absolutely not the most effective way to govern. So maybe we should just have another one of these. Not right away — the government will need to be funded, for a start. But another vote doesn’t feel like a particularly bad thing. Israel just had an electoral re-do. Spain is heading back to the polls shortly. Maybe a mulligan makes sense — especially if the NDP and Greens can finally convince trepidatious Trudeau that 2019 should be the last election held under first-past-the-post."
Medium.com,Society,The slow rise of the political video meme,World,https://medium.com/swlh/the-slow-rise-of-the-political-video-meme-40cd8135607d?source=topic_page---------257------------------1," A Canadian politician running for Prime Minister — Jagmeet Singh — is the first Western politician to ever use TikTok for a national election campaign. Could the meme become the future of political messaging? At first, the video is a bit confusing: A politician alternates between shaking his head and smiling, as text appears everyone and a rap song is heard on the background. But as you watch it til the end — and inevitably at least a second time — Jagmeet Singh’s trick will probably elicit a smile. Or if you’re young, maybe a cringe. It’s a TikTok.

Medium.com,Society,"Peacekeeping mission is finished in Haiti, but UN’s commitment to the country remains strong",World,https://medium.com/@UNPeacekeeping/peacekeeping-mission-is-finished-in-haiti-but-uns-commitment-to-the-country-remains-strong-373b4c51084a?source=topic_page---------258------------------1," By Jean-Pierre Lacroix, United Nations Under-Secretary-General for Peace Operations. An important chapter of the United Nations’ peacekeeping history has come to a close in Haiti. Our deployment in Haiti spanned more than 15 years, the time marked by many joint achievements for the UN and the Haitian people. But it also was marked by the tragedy of a devastating earthquake in 2010 and a series of lessons learned as to what we did well and what we could have done better. Today, as we collectively reflect on all of these aspects, we see not an ending but the beginning of the next chapter of the UN’s partnership with Haiti. The peacekeeping operation’s closing in Haiti does not mean that the UN’s support of the country will cease. Indeed, it will adapt and continue in another form as the Bureau Intégré des Nations Unies en Haiti (BINUH), starts its operations alongside the entire UN country team. Right now, the country faces a political crisis, civil unrest and very real socioeconomic challenges. These, in turn, affect the security environment, which further feeds political instability — a cycle that the country has seen, tragically, many times before. When we look back, however, we also can see how far we’ve traveled. In 2004 ,when our peacekeeping mission — known as MINUSTAH — deployed, the country was on the brink of collapse, with political instability, a dysfunctional police force and almost non-existent state authority. Vicious narcogangs controlled entire neighborhoods of the capital, Port-au-Prince. Fifteen years on, homicide rates have dropped by almost 50 percent, a result in large part of concerted efforts to vet, recruit and train Haitian National Police (HNP) personnel. Since 2004, the number of Haitian police recruited have jumped from 2,500 to more than 15,000 today, doubling the police-to-population ratio. Of the total number of police deployed, more than 10 percent are women. National human-rights institutions are also able to function independently and better protect citizens, and key legislation has been put into effect, dealing with legal aid and the judiciary. Although prison overcrowding remains a major concern, progress has been made to address the judicial backlog, notably in the capital, where the prolonged pretrial detention rate has dropped by 14 percent during the past two years. The $7.5 billion invested by the international community toward the country’s stabilization over 15 years of peacekeeping represents a fraction of global costs that the unfolding crisis would have triggered in 2004, had a U.N.-backed multilateral effort not been launched. But peacekeeping is not — and never can be — the sole answer. The achievements of UN peacekeeping do not mask the fact that Haiti continues to need the support of the international community and the United Nations. Too many Haitians still live in poverty, the rule of law and security sectors are nascent and fragile. True stability remains elusive. As UN peacekeeping wraps up in Haiti, we also remember the difficult parts of MINUSTAH’s legacy and those who have been adversely affected by it. The end of peacekeeping does not put an end to the work of the United Nations in eliminating cholera.; nor does it put an end to our efforts to address sexual exploitation and abuse and related paternity cases. The sustained efforts to support the government of Haiti to eliminate the transmission of cholera and alleviate the suffering of the Haitian people remain a key focus of the United Nations, under the leadership of Special Envoy for Haiti Josette Sheeran. These efforts have led to enormous progress. The United Nations will also continue to address pending sexual exploitation and paternity cases from the peacekeeping period and provide support to the victims and their families. We will work with national authorities and institutions in Haiti and other concerned member states to ensure that the rights and dignity of the victims remain at the center of all our efforts. Haitians have faced enormous hardships over the years and they continue to face challenges today. At the same time, they have consistently demonstrated remarkable resilience and an ability to adapt to and overcome these prodigious obstacles. I believe peacekeeping in Haiti opened space for political and democratic processes to take place, however nothing can substitute political solutions led by local actors. Many of the causes of socio-economic and security problems are related to political factors. The two consecutive peacekeeping missions, MINUSTAH and MINUJUSTH, invested in promoting political solutions to such issues, while simultaneously addressing many other challenges. The transition from peacekeeping is now an opportunity to refocus the priorities of the UN system and how it provides the right support at the right time for Haitians. The UN’s renewed presence in Haiti following the closure of MINUJUSTH is well tailored to the needs on the ground. It embraces an integrated approach that includes the role of the newly deployed special mission, BINUH, focusing on political solutions, and the UN humanitarian and development agencies focusing on a range of tasks to support the people of Haiti. The UN remains fully committed to the Haitian people and this engagement, along with full national ownership and accountability. It will support the country’s vision for stability and prosperity. Now is the time for all our potential partners to redouble our collective commitment to the people of Haiti. Too much is at stake for us to fail. This piece originally appeared in the Miami Herald.

Medium.com,Society,‘Silent Miscarriages’ Are Linked to Air Pollution,World,https://onezero.medium.com/silent-miscarriages-are-linked-to-air-pollution-dab4dc27506d?source=topic_page---------259------------------1," he smog in Beijing can get so thick that it’s impossible for residents to see their own fingers in front of them, and most days it’s impossible to avoid breathing it in. The danger is significant for pregnant women living and working in the megacity, who put their fetuses at risk by inhaling polluted air. Last week, researchers from five Chinese universities reported in Nature Sustainability that pregnant women exposed to Beijing’s suffocating smog have an increased risk of a first-trimester “silent miscarriage” —a fetal death that goes unnoticed. “Pregnant women or those who want to become pregnant, must protect themselves from air pollution exposure not only for their own health,” the researchers write, “but also for the health of their fetuses.” Other documented effects of air pollution include bronchitis, asthma, impaired lung growth, brain development issues, and even lung cancer — risks that could be lessened if citizens knew where and when it was safe to breathe. The Chinese government has deployed stations that monitor air quality in an attempt to provide actionable information to citizens. But the effort is limited by budget constraints, and they take only a limited number of readings throughout the day. Meanwhile, a crop of new devices and apps created by private companies can measure pollution where those stations can’t reach, providing people with local information to plan their day-to-day lives. Some, like AirVisual, Blue Map, and Airpocalypse, are available for use in China, but rely largely on public data. Elsewhere, products are increasingly reliant on crowdsourced data. The information they provide is limited, but together they might supply an increasingly useful patchwork. For example, a trio of college students based in New Delhi — another megacity with chronically poor air quality — have developed a way to track air quality with an Android app, Air Cognizer. It allows people to use their smartphones to measure the amount of PM 2.5, the smallest breathable pollutants, in the air. The app uses two machine learning models to interpret air quality from photos of the skyline, saving smartphone users the cost of buying an additional device. Many or most of them don’t work, are misleading, and/or sensationalized. “Delhi is not far behind Beijing in terms of air pollution,” Tanmay Srivastava, one of the app’s creators, tells OneZero. “Air pollution monitoring is one of the key factors in controlling the level of air pollution. When you know the severity of a problem, then you can act upon it.” Elsewhere, developer Adrian Dybwad had concerns about his family’s exposure to air pollution from the gravel mine by his home near Salt Lake City. He created PurpleAir, a line of indoor and outdoor air quality monitors. The small devices, which range in price from $179 to $259, can be easily attached to exterior or interior walls. The hyperlocal data they collect gets aggregated and displayed on the company’s website in a map that’s free to use. Dybwad says the immense smoke caused by the historic fires in Northern California in 2017 and 2018 generated a lot of interest in his products. “We’ve had quite a great response in terms of people who are just grateful to have it as a resource to be able to help know where the bad air is,” he says. A similar device is the Flow, created by Plume Labs, which attaches to a person or a bag, monitors air quality as you go about your day, and then sends that data to a smartphone app. Company spokesperson Tyler Knowlton says the Flow can help people make more informed decisions about their exposure to air pollution, but he sees it as a complement to existing data. “Having mobile sensors is a different approach to things,” he says. “It’s not a replacement. It’s an enhancement.” Each of these air quality monitoring methods has its shortcomings. PurpleAir takes readings more regularly than government sensors and can cover a broader area if enough people buy them, but they are stationary. That’s where the mobile Flow can help, but only for those who can fork over $179 for a new device. The Air Cognizer could solve issues of affordability, if it proves to be accurate. But Benjamin Barratt, a professor in Chinese environment at King’s College London, cautions that, in general, mapping and measurement tools have a long way to go. “Many or most of them don’t work, are misleading, and/or sensationalized. There is no standard or quality control in these areas, resulting in poor-quality products and services being marketed with dubious claims,” he tells OneZero, adding that “purely commercial enterprises, even if they are driven by good intentions, are more likely to overstate usefulness and accuracy.” Though he says the PurpleAir is a good example of an air quality monitor, he maintains university-backed and government air quality efforts are usually among the most reliable. Personal monitors may become moot as Google wades into the air quality measurement game. Earlier this month, the company rolled out the Environmental Insights Explorer, which displays air quality data collected by Google Street View cars in a block-by-block breakdown of air pollution in a city. So far, it has emissions data for 35 cities — none in China — but it plans to expand to 50 other cities soon. Google will collect emissions data in these cities for a year to get annual median and average measurements, then will periodically return to collect fresh data, but the hope is that cities eventually do the monitoring themselves. When you know the severity of a problem, then you can act upon it. Karin Tuxen-Bettman, program manager at Google Earth, tells OneZero the company hopes that cities can use this data to target policies to neighborhoods that need them the most, as well as reduce exposure to vulnerable populations, like children, pregnant women, and elders. However, until Google reaches China, its citizens have pretty much the same tools as everyone else: government-provided air quality monitors and personal monitoring devices, for those who can afford them. There are PurpleAir devices in China, although not in Beijing, according to the public map. For its part, Plume Labs’ website displays air quality data from Beijing. The data available is patchy at best, but when it comes down to avoiding a smoggy street for the sake of an unborn child, even a patchwork is better than nothing. “We are basically trying to figure out how we can provide the information that cities need to take action on air quality issues in their cities and which are very much related to climate change,” Tuxen-Bettman tells OneZero. “And we hope that expedites their decision-making because experts are saying we have about 10 years to make real changes before climate change becomes unmanageable or irreversible.”"
Medium.com,Society,Socialist Somalia: The legacy of Barre’s military regime,World,https://medium.com/@f.ali15594/socialist-somalia-the-legacy-of-barres-military-regime-7c8789b56a5e?source=topic_page---------260------------------1," We in Somalia cannot boast of having done much in terms of ameliorating the quality of life of the people, but at least the people do not have a master, and those in power have been democratically elected by the same people even if it has been demonstrated that it is not efficient, but this is only because of inexperience and because of the lack of means — Aden Abdulle Osman, Somalia’s founding president, diary, February 28, 1963 On October 21 1969, in the young Somali Republic, Radio Mogadishu had been playing unusual militaristic music most of the morning, deviating from its usual programming, which began with a round-up of world news. Just a week earlier the incumbent President Abdirashid Ali Shermarke, had been assassinated in what some historians believe was an act encouraged by the Soviet Union. And just the day before Prime Minister Muhammad Egal was distributing money which he’d plundered from the Somali Central Bank among corrupt politicians. He would find himself placed under house arrest the next day, on October 21 by a group of rogue soldiers, whilst his accomplices were driven past rapturous crowds to a presidential retreat in Afgoi where they would be detained with other MPs. The government was informed that it had been dissolved by the military. “You are nothing,” one of the guards told them. The public enthusiastically welcomed the coup d’état, and only several days later would it become known that Siad Barre, commander of the Somali armed forces, masterminded the operation which ended Somalia’s short-lived and hopeful but troubled democratic era. Adan Shire Lo, an MP who was arrested, was the brother-in-law of Barre’s wife. Upon learning about the coup, Adan’s wife visited former president Aden Abdulle Osman, who lost the 1967 election, and told him “this is the beginning of the end of Somalia”. Her words were prophetic. This was one of the defining moments in Somalia’s post-independence history, with Siad Barre — arguably the country’s most influential leader — using authoritarian methods to develop the country, before a series of challenges exacerbated by his heavy-handed approach to governance turned Somalia into what contemporary observers often say is a “failed state” after his regime fell. His shadow still hangs over Somali politics to this day, dividing the victims of his crimes from those who look back nostalgically at their lives in a much more peaceful Somalia. Barre’s Socialist era Born in the early 20th Century in Italian Somaliland, Siad Barre was in many ways a product of the colonialism he later rebelled against. He joined the Italian Carabinieri and even served in a campaign for Italy against Ethiopia. When Somalia fell under British Military Administration, he continued his rise to the highest office a Somali could hold as police inspector. When Somalia became independent and the Police Force of Somalia turned into the new republic’s army, he eventually rose to the top of the Somali armed forces, following the death of former commander General Daud Abdulle Hersi in Moscow, before overthrowing the government in 1969. On October 24, in his first speech after the coup, Siad Barre would set a new tone for the country. “Intervention by the armed forces was inevitable,” he said. “I would like to ask all Somalis to come out and build their nation, a strong nation, to use all their efforts, energy, wealth and brains in developing their country,” he continued. “The imperialists, who always want to see people in hunger, disease and ignorance, will oppose us in order that we may beg them… let us join hands in crushing the enemy of our land.” By November 1, he would suspend the constitution, dissolve parliament, ban political parties and abolish the Supreme Court. Without a hint of irony, the country was later renamed the Somali Democratic Republic, and the conspirators founded the Supreme Revolutionary Council. Mohammed Abdulrahman, who would later work in the Ministry of Livestock, was a secondary school student when the coup happened and recalls the event vividly. “We were all jubilant,” he said. “Students went outside running in the streets, we were throwing our books. I remember that day, it was a really special day, and we had huge hopes of what was to come, and in the coming eight years a lot was achieved.” He added: “That was the turning point for Somalis, people were fed up of the old corrupt and tribalistic government which claimed to represent us. At the time, the government was so bad that we didn’t think about the consequences.” Barre immediately began mobilizing Somali society with the Jupiterian powers he had concentrated in the government’s executive branch, with the hope of building a socialist society. Hantiwadaag, literally ‘sharing of wealth’ in Somali, or socialism, was to soon be the new ideology. Somalis were also ordered to call each other ‘jalle’, the Somali equivalent for comrade. Barre would take the title Guulwade, or Victorious Leader, as he began working to create a cult of personality. When asked about the compatibility of Islam — the faith majority of Somalis adhere to — and socialism, Barre responded: “No chapter, not even a single word, in our Koran opposes scientific socialism. We say, ‘Where is the contradiction? The contradiction was created by man only.” “There has to be a distinction made between the first few years and from 1976 onward” Professor Abdi Ismail Samatar, author of Africa’s First Democrats told me. “The way they dealt with the droughts, that prevented a wide scale famine for example. The introduction of a written Somali language that is still used today in Djibouti, Ethiopia and Somalia, the award-winning literacy campaigns, healthcare improvements, universal education and better infrastructure. Those were the highlights, but there was always a creeping authoritarian trend in his rule.” Modern Somali culture also really took off, says Professor Samatar, often with a strong anti-colonial and pan-African character with music hits like There’s a Bone in this Date and Together Reject Colonialism. “They really mobilized the population with music, theater, public relations and other things,” says Abdulrahman. “And we were proud of the role we played in supporting other African liberation movements in Zimbabwe, South Africa and elsewhere.” This was consistent with the foreign policy of the Somali government in Africa, supporting, both materially and morally, independence movements across the continent, a policy largely shared with the Soviet Union, with which Somalia signed a treaty of friendship in July 1974. “They saw us as ‘messengers of heaven’,” wrote Georgiy Ivanchenko, a Soviet author who visited the country. “Around that time I was expecting to come to the UK, on scholarship, but that changed because Somalia began drifting away from the West,” says Mohammed Abdulrahman. “At the time Somalis loved Russia, we had a problem with the West because of the experience of colonization, and what they were doing to other Africans.” “Those years, until the Ethiopia war were the best years, the golden era of Somalia” he says. “When we lived in Mogadishu life was so different,” he recalls, showing me photos of the city in the 70s. “Every day was like a weekend in Somalia. We worked until midday and slept until the Asr, this was our siesta, and when we woke up we’d spend our evenings on the beach. We’d sit at Jazira and Lido play football, swim in the sea and drink tea until Maghrib.” The Ogaden War, the beginning of the end The Soviet Union had heavily invested in the Somali National Army (SNA), building one of the most formidable militaries in Sub-Saharan Africa. By 1977, with Ethiopia in turmoil, and the balance of power decisively in Somalia’s favor, Barre launched a ground invasion of Ethiopia to wrestle the Ogaden, or Western Somalia as Somalis referred to it, from Ethiopian control. The invasion failed, dealing a serious blow both materially and politically to the military regime. “That defeat in many ways de-legitimized the Barre regime’s right to govern,” says Professor Samatar. “I think it was a turning point in the sense that it exposed the bankruptcy of the regime in terms of public governance and management of the country.” He adds: “By the early 80s you could see that the tension was thick in the air. People weren’t so happy, and the regime was heavily in debt. Internal squabbles came out into the open, factionalism became rife and Barre’s government started to deteriorate and the creeping authoritarianism turned openly brutal.” Without a committed superpower patron — as Barre’s enduring irredentist foreign policy failed to win him sufficient Western support — and an accident in 1986 which hospitalised him, the Barre regime resorted to violence to maintain its rule. “The car accident happened near my old home,” Abdulrahman told me. “And the road often became very slippery when it rains, so his car flipped and hurt him badly. When he returned he didn’t have full control anymore, but he and his officers started treating people very badly.” Despite his condition, he was nominated by his party for the presidency — the country’s sole legal political entity — and won an uncontested election which gave him seven more unstable years. This was exacerbated by Ethiopian support for rebel groups across the country which led Barre to hire mercenaries to bombard major cities like Hargeisa and Burao, causing thousands of civilian casualties. Eventually, clan-based rebel groups overcame his regime after he flip-flopped on promised elections. The capital Mogadishu fell into the hands of warlords with much of the south descending into anarchy, whilst the Somali National Movement consolidated its gains over time and eventually seceded, declaring the rebirth of the Republic of Somaliland. The legacy of his period remains contested among Somalis, many of whom remain caught between nostalgia in a country which has been without a central government for almost as long as it has had one, and those who were victims of the Barre regime’s crimes. Another person who spoke on the condition of anonymity, whose father was part of the Somali Youth League that was overthrown by Barre, said: “We didn’t have a lot those days and the crimes were unforgivable. Some of my family members died, but much like me, people often say we had a country which though troubled was ours. The regime needed to end, but we all hoped things would go differently after 1991.” Another person I spoke to said: “The problem with dictators is that they destroy everything they build.” He recalled being imprisoned as a child during a protest against Barre’s repressive policies against religious people who dissented against some of his social reforms, which ran roughshod over religious views on inheritance and dress. “Some say overthrowing him the way we did was a price worth paying. I have sympathy with that view, but there are still a lot of people who look around almost three decades on and aren’t convinced. It has become hard to make the case that things are better now.”"
Medium.com,Society,How Women are Creating Treasure Amongst Afghanistan’s Ruin,World,https://medium.com/@callister.olivia/how-women-are-creating-treasure-amongst-afghanistans-ruin-e51d3cc712c1?source=topic_page---------261------------------1," Fereshteh Forough is propelled by an insatiable passion to rebuild Afghanistan. Her hope for the future is inspired by a poem of the past. “Where there is ruin, there is hope for treasure,” wrote 13th century renowned poet Rumi. Fereshteh, who lived in war-ridden Afghanistan, gains strength from this poem. She was born in a refugee camp in Iran, after her parents were forced to leave Afghanistan during the Soviet invasion. At 16 years old, she was finally able to return to her home country for the first time. “Being born as a refugee and living a decade of my life in a conflict zone in Afghanistan, this really resonates with me and reminds me that, from the ruins of a shattered nation and the lives of refugees can come treasure. And for me, the treasures are the girls in Afghanistan,” Fereshteh told Inverse. From the start, Fereshteh understood the important role financial independence plays in empowering women. Her own mother was the archetype of this notion, and her biggest inspiration of all. “My mom was a role model to me from a very young age. Having 8 kids in our family, she taught herself to stitch and together with a group of women from our community began a business making shirts,” Fereshteh told POCIT. “When she started they didn’t even have a sewing machine, yet through hard work they made money, invested in a machine, and were able to grow their business. Financially supporting our family was deeply empowering for her. She was able to buy us more school supplies and support us in our educational path. That’s how she became an entrepreneur and I learned from her.” In 2015 she opened a nonprofit programming school, called Code to Inspire (CTI), that teaches female students how to code in Herat, Afghanistan. The program helps students who graduate find work in areas such as web development, game development, mobile app development, and graphic design. CTI is two years long, and works as an after school coding “boot camp” with mentors and project managers. One project involved students in CTI’s graphic design class creating a set of stickers that “challenge the stereotypes of Afghanistan by building a future of peace and unity”. The stickers, which can be used on Whatsapp, Viber and Telegram, include depictions of empowered Afghan women. One sticker shows a woman working on a laptop along with the phrase “seek knowledge”. The program was born in a nation where girls face education oppression along with a variety of other cultural roadblocks that prevent financial independence. Under Taliban sovereignty from 1995 to 2001, Afghan women were forbidden to go to school and get an education. “To me, education is a very basic human right,” Fereshteh says. “Shelter, food, and health are very important for every human being. I think education is also a necessity, and no one should be discriminated because of their status.” During her time as a woman in technology and education, Fereshteh says she has seen all kinds of discrimination and threats toward women who are vocal. Because of this, she wanted to create a safe space for women to achieve the same education and skill levels as men. Most importantly, she wanted women to be able to monetize their skill and gain financial independence. By 2025, Fareshteh hopes to expand the school within Afghanistan. The program has gained momentum, and many girls are now expressing their desire to be a part of it. “Every day I get messages and emails from girls around Afghanistan asking me when we’re going to open more schools in other cities,” she says. “ I see that momentum. A lot of girls know about us and they want to go to our school. I’d love to open two to three other locations within Afghanistan and expand the school.” In time, Fareshteh’s dream is to empower women in developing countries and underprivileged communities all over the globe. She believes that if she can accomplish something in Afghanistan, which is deemed by many as an impossible place, she can do it anywhere. “A lot of great work can start with empty hands,” she says. “It doesn’t matter what you have or where you are. The most important thing is that you have faith in yourself.”"

Medium.com,Society,Devil in Disguise: Twenty Years of Vladimir Putin Manipulating American Leaders — Political…,World,https://medium.com/@christopheredward.rhodes/devil-in-disguise-twenty-years-of-vladimir-putin-manipulating-american-leaders-political-b89e6f4c3f4e?source=topic_page---------263------------------1," “The greatest trick the devil ever pulled was convincing the world he didn’t exist.” The sentence from The Usual Suspects has become ingrained in the American psyche, not just because it was a great line in a cool movie (unfortunately tainted by later revelations about star Kevin Spacey), but because it remains applicable to so many real-world situations. Among other situations, it’s an apt description of the past twenty years of Russian President Vladimir Putin’s foreign policy towards the United States. Now Vladimir Putin is not the devil, although there are a few people who think he might be pretty close. Earlier this year, a Siberian shaman named Alexander Gabyshev walked 3000 miles (by his estimate) towards Moscow to perform an exorcism on the Russian President, gaining a significant following — both literal co-walkers and approval on social media — along the way. Gabyshev, who was detained by Russian security forces and deemed mentally unfit, has not been the first person to accuse the Russian President of demonic influence. Five years ago, amidst bloody fighting in eastern Ukraine that followed the Russian annexation of Crimea, the head of the Ukrainian Orthodox Church — Kiev Patriarchate made similar accusations. Patriarch Filaret, whose branch of the Orthodox Church broke away from a larger, Russian dominated hierarchy in the 1990s, said that Putin had “ become possessed by Satan “ and was forcing Ukraine into fratricidal conflict reminiscent of the biblical Cain. Yet, if you ask current US President Donald Trump, Putin is not the bad guy that others have made him out to be, much less the incarnation of evil. In the midst of many worrisome meetings and contacts between Trump and his team and various Russian operatives, Trump has often cited his ability to get along with Putin, characterized the Crimean seizure as Putin “outsmarting” Barack Obama, and dismissed or even laughed off Russian election meddling. Critics have consistently worried that Putin is at best manipulating the easily flattered Trump and at worst is exercising some sort of leverage over the American president. Whatever the answer (and I don’t think you need to go to conspiracies to understand Donald Trump’s affinity for dictators), Putin’s attempts to influence America’s top leadership didn’t start with Trump. Some context is necessary. For decades, Moscow was Satan — the enemy — as far as Washington was concerned, but that fear collapsed alongside the Soviet Union. The Russia that emerged in the 1990s was pro-capitalist, democratizing (or so it seemed), and too dysfunctional to be harmful; the main US military fear shifted from Moscow launching nuclear weapons at the US to the Kremlin simply losing track of those arms. Vladimir Putin came to power in 2000, determined to reverse the loss of the Soviet Empire, which he infamously called the “ greatest geopolitical catastrophe” of the 20 thcentury (which, if you at all paid attention to the 20 thcentury — wow). Throughout the Russian president’s two decades in power, he’s attempted to rebuild Russian influence as a regional and global power. Locally, he’s encroached upon former Soviet territory when the opportunity arose; before Crimea, the devil went down to Georgia (the Republic, not the US state), with Russian forces taking de facto control of the Abkhazia and South Ossetia regions of that country. Putin’s also attempted to spread Russian geopolitical influence more broadly, connecting with pariah states like Iran, Syria and Venezuela and recently making inroads in sub-Saharan Africa as well. Along the way, the Russian president has made a point of trying to convince American leaders that he’s not attempting to re-establish a Soviet style dictatorship and expansionist state. And despite increased repression within Russia and continual meddling abroad, Putin’s efforts have paid off more often than not. George W. Bush famously “looked into [Putin’s] eyes” and saw the latter’s soul, cultivating a relationship that remained friendly throughout the Bush years even as Putin consolidated autocratic power at home. Putin also took advantage of the Bush administration’s War on Terror to crush opposing forces in the majority-Muslim breakaway territory of Chechnya, framing Russia’s brutal efforts in that region as a fight against Islamic extremism. Sometimes, Putin’s strategy has failed outright — Barack Obama and his foreign policy advisors remained incredibly skeptical of Russia throughout the Obama years, and Secretaries of State Hillary Clinton and John Kerry were highly critical of Putin. Russia thumbed its nose at its American adversaries during these years, flagrantly annexing Crimea from Ukraine and fomenting unrest in that country as a way to counter its drift towards the West. Putin didn’t pass up opportunities to put the US and its leaders in tough spots, such as when it engineered the Syrian chemical weapons compromise as Obama and Kerry dithered on how to respond to Bashir al-Assad crossing the “Red Line” of using these weapons on his own citizens. And it was Putin’s personal hostility towards Hillary Clinton that initially provided much of the motivation for interfering in the 2016 US presidential election, before Putin realized that electing Donald Trump was a bigger prize than simply frustrating Clinton. Candidate Donald Trump initially took an adversarial approach toward Russia, despite maybe having friendly interactions with Vladimir Putin during the 2014 Miss Universe pageant. As an aside, it still remains unclear whether the two actually met in Russia during this time, or if Trump exaggerated how greatly he got along with the Russian President — it wouldn’t be the biggest lie that Trump has told. (Seriously, read the comments that Trump made about Putin from that time. They definitely read as remarks of someone trying to convince you they’re best friends with someone they’ve never actually met. It’s perhaps the thirstiest a presidential candidate has been for a foreign leader’s attention). Candidate Trump and Putin quickly reached a rapprochement, driven by flattery from Putin and common antipathy towards Clinton (again, the idea that other factors, like potential Russian financial leverage over the Trump organization or even blackmail material, played a role has not been proven, and probably isn’t necessary to explain the relationship between the two leaders). Though Robert Mueller couldn’t prove criminal wrongdoing, one need simply look at what Trump said and did publicly to see a complementary, if not concerted, effort by Trump and the Russians to undermine Clinton’s campaign. Combined with the help of a lot of Russian bots on social media (seriously Zuckerberg, get on that), these efforts paid off. Now, President Trump believes (and finds it convenient to believe) that Putin’s Russia is not an adversary, and furthermore, that it can actually be a partner in the world. Trump has been willing to cede US influence around the world to Russia — Syria is the latest high-profile instance of this, though sub-Saharan Africa may be a more significant example in the long run — and even turn a blind eye while Russia undermines American efforts against countries like Iran and Venezuela. Trump has maintained his disturbingly friendly relationship with Putin in defiance of critics, and shows no signs of changing course now — as Nancy Pelosi forcefully accused him last week, “all roads lead to Putin.” And while Vladimir Putin may be no Beelzebub, he’s likely to remain an adversary to US interests, even as President Trump (or perhaps future President Gabbard) remains convinced that the threat does not exist."

The latest — and by far the largest — refugee exodus began on 25 August 2017, when violence erupted in Myanmar’s Rakhine State, forcing more than 745,000 people to seek refuge in Cox’s Bazar district in the far southeast of Bangladesh. Nearly 1 million refugees now reside here in temporary shelters, making it the world’s largest refugee settlement. To make matters worse, Bangladesh is also one of the globe’s most disaster-prone countries, exposed to a variety of natural hazards including cyclones, floods, and earthquakes. The Rohingya are entirely dependent on humanitarian assistance and the EU and its partners have provided aid to refugees in Cox’s Bazar since the onset of the crisis."
Medium.com,Society,"Hope Is What We Give, But Is It Enough To Save All The Refugee Children?",World,https://medium.com/@lauradiane1/hope-is-what-we-give-but-is-it-enough-to-save-all-the-refugee-children-ede7e7e7b5ae?source=topic_page---------267------------------1," Living in a constant state of traumatic fear is just a part of life for many refugee children. In Greece, at the refugee camp Moria, 9-year-old Ayesha has been lying motionless in a catatonic state for the past two weeks. She has been diagnosed with resignation syndrome, or human devastation syndrome; a psychological effect of trauma common in children who have experienced extreme negativity. “It affects mostly children, who first exhibit symptoms of depression and then withdraw from others. Eventually they stop walking, eating and talking, and grow incontinent. In the worst cases, they slip into a state of seeming unconsciousness and fail to respond to pain or other stimuli.” (The Economist, 2018). An article in The Guardian explains how her experience in Moria sent Ayesha into resignation. “In Ayesha, the condition did not emerge in the immediate aftermath of seeing her nine-year-old brother die just a few feet away in an Afghanistan bomb blast. It didn’t emerge during the subsequent excruciating surgeries on her right leg (a steel cage still encircles it) or even during the torturous boat crossing to seek refuge here. Until then, she continued to speak and eat. Instead, her father tells me, she fell into a catatonic state only weeks ago when a teenage boy was stabbed to death close to their tent.” (Montague, 2019). The psychological effects of trauma on refugee children that have fled violence is a topic that has received little media coverage or public support. When people think of refugees, they should envision all of the children like Ayesha, lying there with her hands over her face, trying to escape a world that seemingly has no hope to offer her. “Many children experience trauma after all the fighting and violence they have witnessed in their home countries and elsewhere. But the journey is frightening too.” (UNHCR, 2016). Living in the age of the 24-hour news cycle, our society is continuously bombarded with crisis news through multiple channels. The specter of compassion fatigue is as imposing as the constant headlines that contest for your attention. In the years leading up to 2019, the term “Refugee Crisis” has been heard so much that it is being disregarded. However, there are still millions of refugee children that need help and need the media to share their stories. The United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) has states that there are currently an unprecedented 25.9 million refugees globally. Over half of those refugees are children. If anyone needs aid, support and well, hope right now, it is the refugee children living in camps, who are still trying to cope with what has become their semi-permanent situation. The overcrowded refugee camp Moria on the Greek Island of Lesvos, surrounded by olive trees and razor wire, is home to over 13,000 refugees, which is approximately four times the intended capacity. Lesvos to any tourist would seem like an idyllic island located off the Turkish coast in the blue Aegean sea. To those living in Moria, life is far from peaceful. After the trauma that has occurred for these children in their home countries, and then the endurance of a dangerous journey to safety, they find little safety in camps, and many children fear assaults. For example, “In (Moria) bathrooms and latrines are no-go zones after dark for women or children, unless they are accompanied. Even bathing during daytime can be dangerous.” (UNHCR, 2018). Ideally, learning more about the refugee crisis should not send us into a tailspin of compassion fatigue and scrolling on to find some meme to numb the feelings. Instead, you should be asking yourself, “What can I do?” Honestly, the answer is simple. There are millions of people around the globe who have taken action to help, if you don’t want to join the ranks to become one of those people, then simply give towards their cause. Daod, a Palestinian child psychiatrist, believes that “Children’s brains have high elasticity. If you do the right intervention as the trauma is happening, it allows you to transform a traumatic experience into an empowering one.” He is one of many working to make a difference. There is hope, we just have to join forces to create it. War Child is an organization that provides education and psychological care for children in conflict zones across the world. The work of War Child helps children like Ayesha, visit their website and support them in their movement to protect children from the brutal impact of war."

It has handed down prison sentences of nine to 13 years to nine Catalan leaders (some of whom, such as Jordi Cuixart did no more than urge peaceful dispersal by protestors in Barcelona). As Mr Bershidsky writes: “Few other democracies would have sent people to prison for such a long time for what is essentially no more than extreme speech.” And last year, he says, “the European Court of Human Rights ruled against Spain in a case involving two Catalans who burned a photograph of the Spanish royal couple during the king’s visit to Girona in 2007.” They had been convicted for inciting violence against the monarchy, but the European court did not agree. In fact, sedition laws are not generally considered necessary in healthy democracies. Mr Bershidsky points out that “Germany only has one on hate speech, carrying a maximum prison sentence of five years. England, Wales and Scotland abolished sedition as an offense in 2009 and 2010. Australia did the same in 2011, choosing instead to punish ‘urging violence’. The US has a rarely-applied law against ‘seditious conspiracy’, but it can only be used against people plotting a violent overthrow of the government.” The offense of sedition, legal scholar Anushka Singh says in her 2018 book ‘Sedition in Liberal Democracies’ is “a dilemma within liberal democracies”. I suppose, the question this raises is about the quality of Spain’s liberal democracy and how it uses the law to maintain (or undermine) democracy. It’s the sort of issue that must legitimately concern the European authorities."
Medium.com,Society,Typhoon Hagibis kills over 70 and inflicts widespread damage in Japan,World,https://medium.com/@themillennialsource/typhoon-hagibis-kills-over-70-and-inflicts-widespread-damage-in-japan-de6750892e63?source=topic_page---------271------------------1," Typhoon Hagibis, the worst storm to hit Tokyo since 1958, made landfall southwest of the Japanese capital city around 7 p.m. local time on October 12. Wind gusts of up to 216 kilometers per hour (134 miles per hour) were reported in some parts of the country. CNN reported that the typhoon brought “record-setting heavy rains and windstorms.” The mountainous town of Hakone, southwest of Tokyo, received almost 1 meter (3.3 feet) of rain in 24 hours. Many other areas received as much as 40% of their average annual rainfall over the course of two days. The Japanese Ministry of Land, Infrastructure, Transport, and Tourism told CNN that the heavy rain also caused 146 landslides sent 47 rivers spilling over their banks. Hagibis struck Japan just a month after Typhoon Faxai, which killed three people and injured dozens. Ahead of the storm’s arrival, more than 230,000 people were evacuated. Unfortunately, even with this precaution, Japanese public broadcaster NHK has reported 74 confirmed deaths nationwide as of October 16, with 10 others reported missing. Fukushima Prefecture, in the northeast of Honshu Island, suffered the highest casualty rate with at least 25 deaths. The Japanese Fire and Disaster Management Agency said in a release that nearly 10,000 houses had been flooded across the country. The nation’s Cabinet Office estimated that 5,500 people are currently living in shelters as a result of the storm. As of October 14, Industry Minister Isshu Sugawara said that 34,000 households are still without power; restoring electricity is expected to take more than a week in severely flooded areas. The Cabinet Office also reported that more than 133,000 households do not have water service. Over the weekend of October 12–13, Hagibis caused widespread transportation disruptions. According to NHK, a third of bullet trains in Nagano were flooded or otherwise damaged, resulting in multiple train cancellations. Debris on tracks caused by flooding, wind and landslides delayed the restart of service on several lines. East Japan Railway Company (JR East) said that it would take up to two weeks to fully resume operation, NHK reported. Meanwhile, at Japanese airports, over 1,600 flights were canceled. Japan is currently hosting the Rugby World Cup and Formula One Grand Prix. Due to the typhoon, three Rugby World Cup matches and all Formula One events scheduled for Saturday, October 12 were canceled. Officials have stated that it is too early to estimate the financial impact of Hagibis. However, insurance and reinsurance payouts associated with Typhoon Faxai, which hit the country in September, give some indication. Those payouts will likely total $5 billion to $9 billion, according to Risk Management Solutions. Reinsurer Munich Re estimated that Japan suffered $34 billion in losses from natural disasters in 2018, including two typhoons, two earthquakes and multiple floods. As of October 15, three days after the storm hit, search and rescue efforts were in full swing in affected areas. Cabinet Secretary Yoshihide Sugasaid that 110,000 firefighters, police officers and Japan Self-Defense Forces personnel had been deployed in the search for survivors. Rescue operations employed over 100 helicopters. Prime Minister Abe said at a session of the Upper House Budget Committee that his government would designate Hagibis as a “severe natural disaster“, which will help affected regions to obtain government subsidies to begin reconstruction. He added that the government would draw on a 500 billion yen ($4.6 billion) special reserve to help the nation recover from the storm. “It is urgent to provide adequate support for the victims,” Abe said, according to a translation published in Japan Times. “There are concerns that the impact on life and economic activities will be prolonged,” he added."

Technology seems to come to us at a blinding pace. You can watch streaming movies as you fly at 600 mph above the earth in a plane. This same technology has allowed news and information to spread from one side of the planet to the other in the blink of an eye. Protests in Hong Kong meet viewers from all over the world. Basketball games being played in every corner of the United States are shared across China. This strange mixture of protests in Hong Kong and basketball adds to our bizarre times. A recent tweet in support of Hong Kong protesters by the general manager of the Houston Rockets set off a firestorm of controversy and business disasters as it quickly traveled across the globe. “Fight for Freedom. Stand with Hong Kong.” The tweet above was sent out by Daryl Morey on October 4th and within a few days he was already apologizing. According to the New York Post, Chinese partners of the NBA would immediately cut ties with the Houston Rockets. The team had been extremely popular in China due to them drafting a native son, Yao Ming. “I’m not saying this is a state-affiliated operation. But I’ve only seen so many brand-new accounts used at one time when it was a state-affiliated operation.” — Clemson University researcher Darren Linvill, comment to The Wall Street Journal Within 12 hours after the initial tweet, Morey would be mentioned 16,000 times from accounts that appeared to be backed by the Chinese government. In analysis done by the Wall Street Journal of 170,000 tweets over 6 days, it appears that 50% came from accounts with fewer than 13 followers. It looks like Morey may have been the victim of an organized troll mob. Morey wasn’t only attacked by the twitter mob, he also received incoming fire from the NBA itself. LeBron James would criticize Morey’s tweet as well, along with some other NBA stars and officials. “So many people could have been harmed, not only physically or financially, but emotionally and spiritually…” — Tweet from LeBron James James’ tweet hit on something that’s the whole underlying issue of the controversy — financially. According to the Atlantic, the NBA is estimated to make about $4 billion annually from China. 300 million people in China play basketball for fun and nearly 500 million have watched at least one basketball game. It’s no wonder why Morey changed his tune so quickly and the NBA tied itself in knots to apologize. It’s only common sense that billions of dollars would be a good reason to avoid a conflict with a benefactor over an issue taking place in a city on the other side of the planet. NBA players and management have actively gotten involved in plenty of social issues previously. However, it’s never been punched in the face with cash like this before. This is something entirely new."
Medium.com,Society,Chile’s resource economy has to reckon with inequality,World,https://medium.com/@saleemhali/chiles-resource-economy-has-to-reckon-with-inequality-77a069f90dd6?source=topic_page---------273------------------1," The shocking violence in Santiago, Chile in recent days has alarmed analysts worldwide since this South American nation has been championed as an economic success story — even winning admission to the Organization of Economic Cooperation and Development in 2010. It is also the only Latin American country to have visa-waiver access for its citizens to the United States, which reflects the perception in the U.S. State Department that it has economic and social stability. So what has gone wrong in a country which boasts the world’s largest copper and lithium reserves, and a flourishing agricultural and fishing industry, alongside a robust service sector as well? One phrase sums up the issue: rising inequality. I have been to Chile around 6 times over the past decade and have been impressed with the level of development and prosperity. However, below this veneer of glitz is a painful underbelly of deprivation which is so acute that even a 4% hike in public transport fares would lead to thousands of people coming out on the streets in violent protests. All those economists, going back to the late Nobel laureate Milton Friedman, who have been celebrating the country’s fiscal policies and free-market entrepreneurship have largely neglected the plight of the poorest Chileans. If there is any core lesson in the Chilean protests it is that gross inequality cannot be ignored indefinitely. Another Nobel laureate economist Amartya Sen warned us of this reality for decades. Yet there appears to be an inexorable tendency among global leaders to believe that wealth is somehow deserved by those who have it. This perception has its roots in the world’s largest economy — the United States — whose income inequality is only two ranks behind that of Chile on the OECD! Much of the argument to justify such wealth difference is that the rich will spend and invest on the economy or be philanthropic and thereby create more wealth. Yet, when the rubber meats the road, the philanthropy of the hyper-wealthy is often elusive and deceptive. Yes, they all give some money to philanthropies but as a share of their total income the number is generally quite small. A Center for Philanthropy panel study revealed that in fact the poorest cohort gives a greater percentage of their wealth to charity than the wealthiest cohort. Furthermore, a study by Google and the Center for Philanthropy at Indiana University notes that of the $250 billion in annual donations, less than $78 billion explicitly targeted poverty-related causes. Chile has its own class of hyper-wealthy individuals similar to the United States. Take the example of the Luksic family who own several mining enterprises as well as a wide range of other businesses in Chile. They are no doubt philanthropic with their educational investments in scholarships but the impact such efforts can have on a national level is highly limited. There is a culture of silence that has been created regarding the idiosyncrasy of how the wealthy give funds. The poor supplicating minions who seek elite funds do not want to offend them and risk losing the crumbs thrown their way. Often for the hyper-wealthy giving up millions which may seem a huge sum to us is cognitively inconsequential to their lives. I recall being seated at dinner next to CNN Founder and philanthropist Ted Turner at the World Conservation Congress Equator Prize Ceremony in Barcelona in 2008 and he admitted that setting up the United Nations Foundation with a gift of a $1 billion in 1998 was fairly painless for him since he had just gained that amount in stock value without much effort the year before and had least expected it! While Turner or the Luksic families deserve praise for creating a transparent and professional philanthropic organizations, they cannot replace the role of government. What is being called for is not even a vast redistribution of wealth but a recognition that inflation and quality of life for the poor must be kept in mind as economies grow. Chile’s government as well as the private sector need to rethink meritocracy, remuneration, profit margins and who bears the pain most for resource scarcity. An example in point recently brought to light by a Netflix series Rotten deserves attention. The booming avocado industry in Chile has led to massive profit margins for farmers but the water that they are using is a public good and has come at the expense of many poor peasants and small-landowners being parched without much recourse for income. Such deprivations are a corruption of meritocratic capitalism which must be addressed with more ecologically and socially appropriate policies. As Santiago prepares to host a major international summit on climate change later this year, it is high time Chile’s government and as well as global economic leaders in both the public and private sectors recognize that the social climate is also changing. No longer will people accept the trickle-down mantra of the elite economists and accept a smaller share of growing aggregate prosperity."

yanmar is perhaps an ideal battleground for regional supremacy, and Asia’s last frontier for plundering natural resources. It has a lot to offer; a strategic location between South and Southeast Asia, common borders with both China and India, a long coast line, abundant natural resources, precious stones and a sparse population. And there is a ruling regime all too eager to join the plunder. The foremost contender for this much sought-after prize is China, followed by Japan, India and, a distant fourth, Russia. None of these countries have criticized Myanmar for the appalling violations of human rights by the state, and each has sheltered it from condemnations at the international forums. China has made good use of the numerous Ethnic Armed Organizations (EAO), especially those along the common border, to keep Myanmar on a short leash. It was the only source of help for Myanmar during its long years of isolation until 2011. The Rohingya situation came as a golden opportunity to further tighten this grip, as Beijing conveniently sheltered the Myanmar regime from scathing international condemnations. It is also flooding the country with mega infrastructure projects under the Belt and Road Initiative (BRI), buying up most of the Jade from its murky mining and trading practices, and keeping the Tatmadaw, Myanmar Armed Forces, happy with large supplies of arms, funds and training."
Medium.com,Society,A Short History of the Turkish-Kurdish Conflict,World,https://medium.com/@kiliccote.atahan/on-october-10th-the-turkish-military-stormed-over-the-syrian-border-into-kurdish-controlled-lands-469039db38c4?source=topic_page---------276------------------1," On October 10th, the Turkish military stormed over the Syrian border into Kurdish controlled lands and began solidifying their control over a “buffer” region to allegedly prevent terror attacks. This came after the U.S. military pulled out of several military bases on October 6th. Many Kurds felt that this U.S. withdrawal was a betrayal of the Obama era promises of implicit support for an independent Kurdish state. As a Turkish American dual citizen, the Turkish invasion of Kurdish controlled lands in Syria does not surprise me. Turkish-Kurdish racial tension goes back to the formation of the modern Turkish state and is only exacerbated by the modern social media political revolution. We’ve all heard of the 1915 Armenian Genocide, which Turkey still denies, but countless Kurds were also massacred in the same period. In the 1920s, when Turkey fought for its independence from Greek and British imperialism following the first world war, the Kurds also rose up. Between 1922 and 1931, there were 4 major Kurdish revolts in eastern Turkey. In 1927, the most significant Kurdish revolt, the Ararat Rebellion, established an independent Kurdish state for 3 years. The revolt was crushed by the Turkish Military. According to the Turkish Communist Party, between 1925 and 1938, more than 1.5 million Kurds were deported and massacred. The book, “People Without a Country: The Kurds and Kurdistan”, written and published in France in 1980, describes the history of the Kurds. The book lays out that villages were razed to repress the Kurdish population and that, to prevent these events from harming Turkey’s international image and reputation, foreigners were excluded from the entire area east of Euphrates until 1965. The Turkish constitution, enacted in 1924, endeavored to ethnocultural unite the country under a distinctly western Turkish identity. This was done by repressing specifically Arab and Kurdish minority cultures. The Turkish language was “Westernized” and purged of Arab influences. The Kurdish language was banned, the words ‘Kurds’ and ‘Kurdistan’ were removed from dictionaries and history books, and the Kurds were referred to as ‘Mountain Turks’. Further, until 1991 a law outlawed the use of non-Turkish language in public communications like music, radio, and literature. Education of foreign, non-Turkish, language was strictly regulated. In the 1970s the PKK, the Kurdistan Worker’s Party, was formed demanding an independent Kurdish state. In 1984, PKK members began attacking Turkish military targets which expanded into terror attacks on civilians, including mass shootings and suicide bombings. Since 1984, 37,000 people have been killed in this conflict. Long-lasting ethnic conflict between Turks and Kurds, exacerbated by government censorship and organized suppression, has created a strong separation in heritage and traditions. Generally and especially in poorer more nationalistic demographics, Turks think of Kurds as a separate, lower ethnic class. Turkish firms do not make an effort to hire Kurds, and there are no affirmative action laws like in the U.S. This separation and conflict have been strip-mined for all its political usefulness by the AKP, the Justice and Development Party and the party of the current leader Erdogan. The AKP voices racial-nationalist narratives that are akin to the U.S. alt-right. They also create social media propaganda. With a 62% smartphone market penetration, Turkey is a modernized and technological society with more Islamic cultural values than Western Enlightenment values, especially in the rural east. After a recent anti-AKP protest, the AK Trolls, a state-sponsored social media task force was created to spread misinformation on the internet. They have been widely successful in stirring nationalist fervor and xenophobic hatred in a culture already steeped in ethnic conflict and genocide denial, spreading the narrative that all Kurds, even women, and children refugees, are terrorists, that they hate Turkish people, and that they would destroy the Turkish nation if given the opportunity. Where the conflict will lead is difficult to predict, but the Turkish government does not have a good track record on human right’s abuses. Erdogan’s recent approval ratings are yet to be reported, but the previous year had the lowest rating in his presidency. But the fact remains clear that the U.S. withdraw from the region has implicitly given the Turkish Military the green light on their occupation of the Syrian border region. If that leads into a wider ethnic cleansing, then it is Trump’s and our fault for allowing these ethnic groups to come into a wider conflict."

Medium.com,Society,The Brexit Referendum Should Have Required a “Special Majority”,World,https://medium.com/@andrewhorton_85407/the-brexit-referendum-should-have-required-a-special-majority-ff45caca7ca7?source=topic_page---------278------------------1," “The only reason we wouldn’t come to a free and open agreement is because politics gets in the way of economics.” Liam Fox (July 2017) In a calm, matter of fact manner, Liam Fox (then Secretary of State for International Trade) claimed achieving a deal on Brexit with the EU would be “one of the easiest in human history.” The confidence of his conviction was shared by a number of others in the government and looking back on it now in hindsight, it appears incredibly naïve. Of course, one would not have needed the benefit of hindsight to know that settling on a deal with the EU would always have been difficult. The reason for this is simply due to the arithmetic. In an interview with the Daily Mirror prior to the Brexit referendum in 2016, prominent Leave campaigner Nigel Farage stated: “In a 52–48 referendum this would be unfinished business by a long way. If the Remain campaign win two-thirds to one-third that ends it.” The admission here clearly states that such a small majority would not be a clear mandate to shut the door on the Brexit debate. However, the vote swung the other way by the same margin, and it was treated by the government as a clear instruction from the British people. In July 2016, less than a month from the narrow victory, Theresa May famously declared “Brexit means Brexit and we’re going to make a success of it.” The following year she would trigger “Article 50” (the section of EU law that initiates the two year process of leaving the EU) and declare “What people voted for last year was for us to leave the European Union and we will leave the EU on 29 March 2019.” These two quotations summarise one of the biggest issues that still resides with us today (20th October 2019); a 52–48 winning margin can hardly be treated as the “will of the people” and Brexit means different things to different people. May was clearly wrong about leaving on the 29th March 2019 — we are now awaiting another possible extension beyond the new leaving date of the 31st October. The truth is, discussions in parliament on such a divisive issue were always going to be extremely difficult because of the lack of consensus. Had the referendum been a two-thirds majority, even the most dedicated Remainer would have had to concede defeat and a deal might have been agreed with the ease that Liam Fox had predicted. If there was ever evidence needed for the importance of having a “special majority”, the Brexit referendum would be the perfect example. A House of Commons report on “Thresholds in referendums” explains a discussion on special majorities: “incorporates the idea that major constitutional change is something more important than the result of ordinary elections, and therefore should be the result of something more than a simple plurality of the votes.” The Brexit debate has clearly proven to be one of these issues. The changes made, depending on the type of Brexit the UK ends up pursuing, will have long-term economic and social impacts that cannot be simply reversed in future elections. Having such a thin majority raises too many questions that are hard, or even impossible to answer. For example, analysis of the voting data shows that 73% of 18–24-year olds voted to remain and 60% of over 65s voted to leave. Each year that passes there is the possibility of older Brexit voters dying and younger (statistically Remain) voters becoming eligible to participate in a referendum. Would it be fair to say that the “will of the people” is the same now as it was on the 23rd June 2016? And if it would not be fair to say this, would that be enough to raise the question of a second referendum? The BBC reported in August 2018 that: “If there were to be a second referendum now, 52% would vote Remain and 48% Leave, an average of polls over the past three months suggests.” Yet, this would not be enough for those who voted leave to accept that a second referendum is a desirable outcome. The issue remains the same, 52% clearly isn’t enough for either side to claim victory. If the issue of whether it is best to leave the EU was entirely a numbers game (and it most certainly isn’t), the numbers haven’t proved conclusive. If it had been decided before the referendum that there needed to be a bigger majority to encourage the government to act on the advice of the public, we might have saved the country from the amount division that has arisen in the last three years. There would inevitably be questions about what the majority should be, but it is safe to say somewhere in the region of 60% would be much better than 50%."

As such, work ethic in Asia has turned down the path in which performance is valued more than the health of the employees. This can be seen through the Chinese 996 and the Japanese karoshi. What Is 996 and Karoshi? 996 describes a six-day work week, in which people work from 9 AM to 9 PM; a full 12 hours. It’s particularly common amongst IT companies. Founders of successful websites — such as Jack Ma who created the online shopping website Alibaba and its competitor Richard Liu, the founder of JD (former 360buy) — support this work system and reason that it’s a blessing and makes it easier for people to achieve success. Despite these companies being successful and having lucrative rewards, they essentially keep their workers so busy that they cannot have a life outside of their job. For example, companies might serve their employees all three meals of the day and have a gym accessible. This sounds like an incredible benefit but is actually implemented to keep people at the office at all times. The pressure to perform is so high that even on off days, workers might be called in to do new tasks, and finishing your tasks and leaving early is highly frowned upon; even by colleagues. The Japanese term karoshi translates to ‘death from overwork’. Just the mere presence of the term solidifies the reality of its existence. Workers are under so much stress, combined with a poor diet, that they increase the risk of strokes and heart attacks. People who should be young and healthy have reportedly died; the first known case was back in 1969 and the term karoshi was later invented in 1978 after even more occurrences. As with 996, karoshi stems from the pressure to perform and always be available for your job. Both cases are, according to their countries’ laws, illegal. In China, workers mustn’t work more than 44 hours per week, but 996 amounts to 72. And overtime is also not allowed in Japan, which means workers do not log the many extra hours they put into their jobs. Online Protesting It is no wonder that society is in uproar and dissatisfied with the conditions they are expected to simply deal with — if they want to keep their jobs and be considered as doing well, that is. Earlier this year in March, an online movement against 996 was created. The slogan become “developers’ lives matter”, published under “996.icu”. The campaign uses “ICU” in their name to vocalize the absurdity of working so strenuously that you end up in an intensive care unit. The main goal was to have a list of companies supporting the 996-work schedule and within just a couple of days had over 200.000 ‘stars’ (much like favoriting a tweet or liking a Facebook post) on GitHub, the programming website that hosted it. 996.icu thus ended on the trending page, but unfortunately had to be shut down due to spam. Despite the seeming failure of 996.icu, a movement called “The Anti 996 License” emerged from it, which has managed to prohibit companies supporting 996 from utilizing GitHub’s open source codes. Thinking About Joining the Asian Workforce? While 996 is unique to Chinese law and karoshi is a Japanese term, they both refer to overtime that literally kills people by destroying their health. And that’s a phenomenon that is common outside the two countries as well. South Korea is also highly affected by such “work ethic” which is not just a boss having high expectations of you, but also your peers. Is there even a solution to such serious and deeply-rooted problems? The trouble with protesting and refusing to comply with a company’s “expectations” is that there is often someone else who is willing to do the job; in times of increased unemployment, people will take any job, just to have one. It is difficult to say what can truly make a change. Can enough employees stand together and make a stance? Or must it start at a higher level, with executives and the like lowering the requirements? Surely, that would mean less focus on the economy of a company, just enough to let both company and workers thrive and be well. Which is an unlikely perspective to have, unluckily.

Medium.com,Society,Biggest Protest in Years as Lebanese Demand ‘Fall of the Regime’,World,https://medium.com/citizen-truth/biggest-protest-in-years-as-lebanese-demand-fall-of-the-regime-28c325c71e4?source=topic_page---------280------------------1," Tens of thousands of Lebanese residents continued protests for the second day in a row, on Friday, demanding economic reforms and a change of government. The demonstrations are being reported as the largest in years as thousands gathered outside the government headquarters in central Beirut on Thursday evening. The current wave of protests forced Lebanese Prime Minister Saad Hariri to cancel a meeting of his cabinet, set for Friday, over 2020’s draft budget. The unprecedented popular uprising was sparked by Hariri’s plan to raise taxes on Whats App calls but protesters are also angry over accusations of government corruption. The Whats App tax is believed to be the straw that broke the camel’s back, as Lebanon has endured through economic hardships for many years now. According to Al Jazeera, the protests have been marked by clashes between Lebanese riot police and protestors and have contained some reports of vandalism. On Friday morning, police reportedly confronted angry crowds with tear gas while reports of tires being lit on fire in the evenings and broken storefronts and billboards also circulated. The National News Agency reported that two foreign workers died from smoke inhalation after a building close to the protests in Beirut caught on fire. The protests began Thursday as civilians gathered to call for a new Lebanese government. According to Al Jazeera, several thousands of protesters gathered in Beirut and chanted, “the people want the downfall of the regime.” While protesters in the town of Jeita, 12 miles from Beirut, chanted, “We are one people united against the state. We want it to fall.” In response to the mounting popular pressure, the Lebanese government promised its citizens it would find a solution to the protesters’ outrage within 72 hours. It also ordered schools across Lebanon to close doors on Friday. Addressing the crowds at Beirut’s Martyr Square, Harriri said, “Either our government coalition’s partners give a clear answer or I will have something else to say. I have set a very short deadline.” In reaction, the angry crowds demanded the resignation of Lebanon’s political leaders including Hariri, President Michel Aoun, Parliament Speaker Nabih Berri and Foreign Minister Gebran Bassil. On Thursday, the Lebanese Minister for Telecommunications Mohammad Choucair announced that the government planned to raise a new fee of 20 cents a day for calls via voice over internet protocol (VOIP), used by applications including Facebook-owned WhatsApp. Later on, as protests spread, Chouciar said that the proposed plan to raise the tax had been revoked but protests have continued on unabated. Lebanon was devastated by war from 1975 through 1990 and has struggled to recover. The country is considered to have one of the world’s highest debt burdens, and economic growth in the country has been crippled by both regional conflict and instability. Lebanon’s unemployment rate among youth under the age of 35 is estimated at 37 percent. Adding to Lebanon’s difficulties has been an influx of hundreds of thousands of Syrian refugees from the Syrian war that erupted in 2011. As the Guardian wrote, international donors have demanded that Lebanon implement economic changes in order to get loans and grants pledged at an economic conference in Paris in April 2018. International donors pledged $11 billion for Lebanon but they sought to ensure the money was well spent in the corruption-plagued country.

Medium.com,Society,"Brexit won’t be bad for the economy, it already is!",World,https://medium.com/@henrikouam/brexit-wont-be-bad-for-the-economy-it-already-is-96dc75b8fff5?source=topic_page---------281------------------1," The United Kingdom is no clearer on how to leave the European Union. Following months of brinkmanship and uncertainty, parliament has passed the Letwin act, to ensure Prime minister Boris Johnson asks for an extension should his agreement fail to garner enough votes. He did imminently. The recent impasse was brought about by a need to prevent a no-deal exit, which would cause the pound to depreciate, prices for goods and services to rise, queues in ports and cause our industries to become less competitive. Although the economy is unlikely to come crashing down, there is ample evidence that Brexit is having an adverse impact on the U.K economy. The Bank of England’s most recent monetary policy report showed an increasing number of companies are preparing for a no-deal exit, which diverts resources that could have otherwise been used to invest in Brexit contingency planning. Even as unemployment is at record lows and is poised to average 2.75%, capital investments have been growing at a much slower pace since the financial crisis. Admittedly, this cannot be attributed solely to Brexit, even as the decision to leave the European Union has caused unprecedented levels of uncertainty and amplified the falling business investment. The global economy is slowing, and geopolitical uncertainty, as well as rising risks of protectionism, have done little to abate the downturn in business investment. As such, manufacturing activity has contracted in recent months, with business sentiment falling as well as prospects for employment. It is, therefore, plausible that business investment will be somewhat higher in the absence of Brexit, even as the exact extent remains unclear. The reason for this is, very few understand the extent to which the U.S. — China trade war has caused businesses to shelve investment plans versus the uncertainty stemming from Brexit. As such, while we ascribe falling business investment to Brexit, it is important to disentangle this from the slowdown in the global economy and risks emanating from the trade war. Furthermore, vacancies have slowed from 100,000 at the start of the year to 70,000 at the end of Q2 2019. Although there is little to worry given record-low unemployment and rising wages, the falling trend in business investment is not only causing the economy to grow at a slower pace, productivity is much lower and the potential growth rate could be lower in the coming years. This bodes ill for an economy that is becoming increasingly digitized, financialised and service-driven, the £6.2bn earmarked for contingency planning could, perhaps, be used to facilitate a climate and skills-driven transition. One that will focus on upskilling the labor force via wage subsidies, rather than merely incentivize business investment, which focuses on plant and machinery. Meanwhile, the September Purchasing Managers Index hit a four-month high of 48.3 points (see chart above). This, however, points to a contraction in the manufacturing sector, with falling new orders, and employment falling at the fastest rate since February 2013. This points to a worrying trend and shows how quickly employers could adjust to political uncertainty in an attempt to reduce waste and insulate their profit margins from further declines. It is unclear that recent amendments passed do anything to reduce business uncertainty, but it reduces the probability of a no-deal exit and ensures an organized exit from the European Union. Similarly, the service sector, which contributes 60% of U.K. GDP also contracted in September and saw the fastest rate of job shedding since August 2010. The latest survey shows businesses have switched to international markets and it is unclear that any post-Brexit trading plans have outlined exactly how to attract businesses and incentivize investment in specific sectors. So the question now isn’t whether and how Brexit is sorted, the challenge for the government will be to attract business back into the U.K and brand it as an attractive destination for businesses. Continued uncertainty bodes ill for such an outcome and will only serve to make us attractive as a low-tax destination. The net positive effects of a larger and more competitive sector are unlikely to compensate for the lost tax revenue. Even as business confidence and resultant investment remain uncertain, households’ buttressed by higher real incomes continue to support the economy. As illustrated in the chart above, there has been a continued increase in total retail sales i.e 3m/3m. Nevertheless, inflationary pressures remained somewhat contained, as the recovery in the pound and falling demand likely placed downward pressure on price increases. Meanwhile, tepid demand caused a similar trend to emerge for input prices; this will enable producers to stay competitive as lower overheads are unlikely to necessitate higher prices for consumers. This is consistent with the Bank of England’s outlook for inflation to average 1.8% in 2019, but a Brexit-induced depreciation in the pound could test this call. The Bank’s monetary policy report will depend on the interplay between FX, inflation, and output. Depending on the severity of a downturn, if at all, the Bank might choose to stimulate the economy and allow inflation to overshoot its target momentarily. Depending on the severity or persistence of the downturn, a more accommodative stance might be appropriate. The logical thing for the Central Bank to do is lower the policy rate by 25bps, but given the circumstances that will be unwise. Fixed business investment is falling as a result of Brexit uncertainty, coupled with rising risks of trade protectionism and geopolitical uncertainty in the Gulf. If the Bank were to cut interest rates by 25bps, there is no guarantee this will incentivize businesses to make capital investments and higher more workers. If anything, it will only reduce the Bank’s ability to respond to a downturn and will illustrate an imbalance in deliberating the attainment of the inflation target versus financial stability risks. I advocate a pause if a Brexit-induced uncertainty doesn’t exacerbate structural factors, which can intensify a slowdown. Meanwhile, vehicle registration — a bell-weather for consumers- eased slightly in Q2 2019, despite a slight pickup in the registration of alternatively fuelled vehicles i.e (+5.0%) (see chart above). Nevertheless, it is unclear that lowering the policy rate by 25bps will cause households to spend more as lower interest expense will increase households' disposable incomes, enabling them to purchase other goods or services. Together with businesses, they might await greater clarity from the Brexit negotiations before making longterm purchases. As a result of the slowdown caused by uncertainty, lower interest rates should only be used as a last resort, rather than preemptively as the Fed and other Central Banks have sought to do in other to stave off the adverse impacts of the U.S. — China trade war. Brexit increases the risk of a recession, but its adverse impacts are already being felt in employment and business investment. Lower interest rates will are unlikely to change this picture just yet, but might only serve to avert a crisis."
Medium.com,Society,"Putin, Assad, Erdoğan and Khamenei — the four horsemen of the apocalypse 2.0",World,https://medium.com/@KounalakisM/putin-assad-erdo%C4%9Fan-and-khamenei-the-four-horsemen-of-the-apocalypse-2-0-56da4cbeef9a?source=topic_page---------282------------------1," Texas tornadoes are potentially caused by the “flap of a butterfly’s wings in Brazil” according to the Butterfly Effect theory. Determining the ultimate cause and effects in weather is a tough call, however, given how many random physical factors ultimately come into play. But it’s fascinating to think that a distant and peacefully fluttering butterfly has so much potential power. Easier to determine is how one man’s wanton tongue wagging and temper tweeting can not only cause a political storm but has now unleashed the four horsemen of a modern regional apocalypse: Turkish President Recep Erdoğan, Syrian President Bashir al Assad, Iranian Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei, and the ever-present Russian President Vladimir Putin. Donald J. Trump, in his “ great and unmatched wisdom,” has shown that not only can he distract a domestic electorate but that the power of his presidency can create limitless distant chaos, death and destruction with the tap of a thumb and the flip of a finger. Now that’s power. Trump’s causal tweet-to-terror relationship reanimated the biblical fearsome four horsemen who, in their initial iteration, represented Conquest, War, Famine and Death. This is no small feat. In one feckless action, the president of the United States has whipped up the apocalyptic forces that one hoped the world’s most powerful man would instead be able to tamp down. The first horseman rode in, chuffed and bare-chested on his nag, a vision of strength and wearing the religious symbols of a loving God. But in the form of Putin, this rider drew behind him a fierce and unmerciful flock of jet-powered birds dropping bombs on the sick and infirm, raining explosive charges on targeted Syrian hospitals both to sow fear and remind the beleaguered recipients of his desire for conquest — that he alone can decide individuals’ fate. Turkey’s Erdoğan galloped in as the second horseman, but always saw himself as the first to plow the field that borders his earthly realm. He, too, seeks conquest, but initiates this latest war against not only Kurds, but the rest of humanity. His steed leads both mechanized infantry and coordinated shelling. Irregular troops, mercenaries and retributive forces walk the plains to find families it can force to flee. Contemptible men seek the already suffering in order to show them the real meaning of torture. They reveal their true colors and cruelty when a bound and frightened prisoner must not only face a Geneva Convention-breaking level of humiliating indignity, but is ultimately put down like a dog in a ditch. For Armenians, this is a tragically familiar story. Horseman Assad, the “Butcher of Damascus,” initially came to his people hidden, Trojan horse-like, in the form of a healer, an ophthalmologist who presumably once took the Hippocratic Oath to “First, do no harm.” Instead, he rode his father’s coattails and despotic style to defy the healing gods and apply his brutal hand to blind a nation to the distant freedoms it could once see. His marauders now ride roughshod with Russian ravagers over territory where a few short days ago American troops balanced a relative peace. Assad enforced a famine that starved his opponents and deprived them of medical supplies. He now has civilian enemies on the run while his starved dogs of war eat from the abandoned American tables. As a result, we all taste the bitterness of Trump’s dishonorable retreat. Let us not forget the final of the four: Iran. America’s president effectively invited the Persian potentate to come to town, enlivening his proxies and apostles of death. Ayatollah Khamenei keeps his robes clean while he deploys merciless men who seek to extend his revolution from the Gulf to the Mediterranean. They never left Assad’s side and never lost sight of completing their Shia crescent. Iraq had already entered Iran’s sphere of influence; Assad was always Tehran’s partner in crime. A policy-indifferent Trump who, willy-nilly, dumps allies and revokes treaties has created another opening to an empire-oriented Iran with great ambitions, educated people, oil reserves aplenty and a willingness to flaunt its confederates’ firepower, whether with refinery-destroying drones or ship-sinking stealth. The Ayatollah is on a roll. Lo and behold this prophesy: The four horsemen of the regional apocalypse are revealed to be upon us now. Neither the desire to rein them in by Trump’s handwringing congressional sycophants, nor the post-American retreat media spin, nor any post-tragedy justification from he who unleashed the beasts can lasso them back into the stable. Trump catalyzed a war “7,000 miles away” in a “land that has nothing to do with us.” He let his tweet fly. The Butterfly Effect has whipped up the winds of war that are now sweeping across the Middle East in renewed violence. Let us pray that they do not grow and gust at biblical proportions. Markos Kounalakis mounts Western, not English, and hopes to ride off peacefully to a distant California sunset near the Hoover Institution, where he is a visiting fellow."
Medium.com,Society,Is it OK to say thank God for Russia?,World,https://medium.com/@Rashmee/is-it-ok-to-say-thank-god-for-russia-fb384864302a?source=topic_page---------283------------------1," Is this the time to give limited thanks that Russian President Vladimir Putin made Russia relevant again? That’s a controversial question but it’s pertinent now that Russia and Turkey are the only active international armies in northern Syria. Never mind the 120-hour “ceasefire” negotiated with Turkey by the Americans. US President Donald Trump may call it a “great day for civilisation” but it is a very temporary pause, the terms are unclear and half of those in the area — the Syrian government and Russia — are not part of the US deal with Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan. More to the point, Turkey and the Kurds understand the agreement very differently. Ankara sees the ceasefire as a chance for the Kurds to clear out of its self-declared “safe zone” in Syria; the Kurds say they will only cease fighting in two areas. When Erdogan goes to Russia October 22, that’s when the real deal will be struck. Until October 15, all talk was about a looming humanitarian disaster in northern Syria. It had been six days since Turkey’s move into Kurdish-controlled territory after Trump green-lighted the action during a phone call with Erdogan and disparate estimates were being tossed around of the desperation on the ground. More than 150,000 civilians were said to be fleeing Turkish air strikes. Aid agencies warned that the Kurdish-governed, hitherto relatively safe, reasonably autonomous part of Syria was roiled by violence and uncertainty, as well as incipient medicine, food and water shortages. On October 18, the Times in London, reported that white phosphorus, a banned chemical, may have used on Kurdish civilians. More to the point, even before Turkey began its incursion on October 9, with the promise of liberating the area of “terrorists” and creating a safe zone within which to relocate Syrian refugees from Turkey, there were fears of a bloodbath. Military officials who had served in the region and analysts who had studied it forecast a massacre. The Syrian Kurds, everyone agreed, faced an existential crisis, having been abandoned by Trump’s America to a determined Turkish Army. Then the Russians moved in. The Russian Defence Ministry said in a statement that its military police was patrolling “the north-western borders of Manbij district along the line of contact of the Syrian Arab Republic military and the Turkish military.” A spokesman for the US-led coalition said on Twitter that its forces had left the formerly Kurdish-held town of Manbij. “Coalition forces are executing a deliberate withdrawal from north-east Syria,” US Army Colonel Myles B. Caggins wrote. “We are out of Manbij.” The takeaways were obvious. Russia and Turkey were soon to be the only international armies in the area. Considering the Turks’ stated intentions towards the Kurds, it seemed right and proper to be at least somewhat glad that the Russians were around as well. With the abrupt departure of the United States — admittedly a small contingent of 1,000, just half of what it was in December — the only sense of some sort of supervisory presence came from Russia. Cue its special envoy for Syria, Alexander Lavrentiev, who offered assurance that Russia and Turkey were in contact to prevent clashes between Syrian government troops and Turkish-led forces. That message — of vigilant oversight — was also stressed by the Kremlin. It provided information about a phone conversation between Putin and Erdogan, during which the Russian president pointed out the importance of “avoiding conflict between subdivisions of the Turkish Army and Syrian government forces.” The Russians also said they were facilitating talks between Syrian President Bashar Assad’s government and the Kurdish militia. What’s in prospect was clear even before recent events. The United States’ uneasy shouldering of responsibility in the 8-year-old conflict in Syria has decisively shifted to Russia and Trump is sanguine about the turn of events. “Anyone who wants to assist Syria in protecting the Kurds is good with me, whether it is Russia, China or Napoleon Bonaparte,” Trump tweeted. It couldn’t be Bonaparte and it isn’t China but Russia stands as the only good friend or at least interlocutor in the region — for the Syrian Kurds, for Moscow’s long-time protege Assad, of course, and perchance for Turkey, too. This may mean a major advance in Putin’s attempts to restore Assad’s control over all of Syria, especially the oil-rich north-east, said Elena Suponina, a Moscow-based Middle East expert. There is also the chance of a potential, if controversial, solution to Moscow’s attempt to draw a post-conflict road map for Syria. The Kurds’ alliance with the United States prevented negotiations with Damascus. Now, that process has begun and the Kurds can be included in the stalled Russian process aimed at drawing up a new Syrian constitution. It’s not clear any of this will work. Russia may find the additional responsibility for the larger conflict onerous or even ruinous. Trump may have intuitively got it right when he predicted that Syria may prove to be another Afghanistan for Russia. The former Soviet Union is now called Russia because it “lost so much money in Afghanistan,” he said. Longer term, Russia’s return to relevance on the world stage will create other testing issues. That said, right now, it’s rather better it has risen again than not. Originally published in The Arab Weekly"
Medium.com,Society,The media is trying to normalize a radical rejection of Canadian parliamentary tradition,World,https://medium.com/@jjmccullough/the-media-is-trying-to-normalize-a-radical-rejection-of-canadian-parliamentary-tradition-8d34a06ea1d4?source=topic_page---------284------------------1," Along with imminent predictions of a “Green Party breakthrough,” there is no trope of Canadian election coverage more predictable and tiresome than condescending media “explanations” of Canada’s parliamentary system from self-appointed experts. While purportedly neutral, such explainers, clarifiers, guides, and so on, exist primarily as a tool of argument, rather than education. Their purpose is to intimidate the reader into accepting a certain political outcome as normal and uncontroversial, and not contest or question it. Important facts are accordingly omitted or only selectively reported in order to make the argument appear as powerful and undebatable as possible. Currently, the press is spending much time and effort attempting to normalize the idea that Justin Trudeau could remain prime minister of Canada even if the Conservative Party wins the most seats in the House of Commons in the October 21 general election, and the Liberals drop to second place. This, we are told, would be perfectly defensible, since supposedly an incumbent prime minister “gets the first chance to test the confidence of the House of Commons,” or, in other words, gets to remain in office for some unspecified amount of time between the election and the first sitting of parliament (the scheduling of which he controls). Accepting this premise would obviously be of maximum strategic benefit to the Liberals. It would give them the ability to deny an election night victory to Andrew Scheer and the Conservative Party, turning what would ordinarily be a clear-cut win into something empty and illegitimate. It would award Trudeau weeks, or possibly months of post-election breathing space to figure out a way to hang on to power by negotiating some sort of coalition-type deal with the NDP and/or Green Party. It would also allow Justin Trudeau the ability to continue using the many powers of the prime ministership and executive branch to govern the country unilaterally, as much of the day-to-day functioning of the Canadian government doesn’t involve parliament. However, it should not be overlooked just how radical and unprecedented such a move would be. If the Conservatives win more seats than the Liberals, it will shatter 94 years of precedent if Andrew Scheer is not permitted to become prime minister. Despite being a supposedly entrenched tradition of “our system” no incumbent prime minister in modern Canadian history has ever sought to hang on to power and “test the confidence of the House” in the way some are suggesting Trudeau should do. For the last 94 years, every single time an incumbent prime minister has been defeated in an election, he or she has promptly stepped down and initiated a transfer of power. This has happened in cases when an incumbent prime minister has been replaced by a majority government, as well as in cases when an incumbent prime minister has been replaced by a minority government. No defeated prime minister in modern history has exercised his or her supposed prerogative to remain in office until the first sitting of the newly-elected parliament in order to “test the confidence of the House.” The sole exception to this precedent, in all of Canadian history, came in 1925, when Mackenzie King held on as prime minister despite the Conservative Party having won more seats in that year’s election. King’s decision was deeply controversial at the time, and the Conservative leader angrily characterized it as a “usurpation” of power. It wound up causing one of the greatest constitutional crises of Canadian political history, the so-called “King-Byng” affair. Canada is alone among major western democracies in not having any laws that clearly outline basic facts of our political system, including the mechanics of how, exactly, someone becomes prime minister. As a result, convention and tradition have always played an enormous role in determining what is right and wrong, normal and abnormal. Traditions evolve over time, and with them, new standards of what sort of behavior is proper and ethical. It is now a deeply, deeply entrenched standard of Canadian federal politics that if a party wins the most seats on election night, that party’s leader should be sworn in as prime minister of either a minority or majority government within a few weeks. This is the whole reason why a Canadian can even use a term like “minority government” in the first place and take it for granted that other people know what he’s talking about. This is why all of our television stations have ready-made graphics saying things like “Conservatives/Liberals win minority government!” ready to fill the screen on election night. This is the reason Joe Clark became prime minister in 1979, Lester Pearson became prime minister in 1963, and John Diefenbaker became prime minister in 1957. This is the reason why Justin Trudeau correctly stated that letting the party with the most seats govern “is the way it’s always been” in Canada. This is the reason Prime Minister Paul Martin, with class and dignity went before an audience of Liberal supporters on election night, 2006, and declared: “I just telephoned Stephen Harper and I offered him my congratulations. The people of Canada have chosen him to lead a minority government. I wish him the best.” Should he face similar defeat on Monday night, one hopes Prime Minister Trudeau will be equally gracious, and ignore the many voices in the press demanding otherwise."
Medium.com,Society,With or without EU: the relationships breaking down over Brexit,World,https://medium.com/@eleanor.langford/with-or-without-eu-the-relationships-breaking-down-over-brexit-dfe78bc6deb4?source=topic_page---------285------------------1," When Camila Fernández came to the UK five years ago, she fell in love. Swept off her feet by a British man named Jack Wilson, she built a life in her adopted country complete with a husband, house and children*. And then, Brexit happened. Around her, the language surrounding Brexit crept lower and lower, making Camila feel increasingly uncomfortable in her adopted country. The more the media spouted anti-immigrant rhetoric, the more she felt unwelcome in Britain. Eventually, Camila decided she had no choice but to return to Spain, renouncing her British citizenship in the process. Her message to her husband was simple: “I love you, but I just feel like I can’t live in this country”. Their marriage broke down, and divorce proceedings started. Cases like this have become increasingly common for family lawyers such as Kaleel Anwar of Stowe Family Law. As our exit from the EU approaches, more couples are finding themselves on opposing sides of the political debate. What they are saying is, I love her, and she loves me but it’s this bloody Brexit that has ruined everything for us. “It’s quite sad just how much this guy’s life has just been turned upside down because of her views,” Kaleel said, commenting on the case. “She’s issued an application to relocate with the children to Spain, because to do that without permission would amount to child abduction. It’s a really strange case because what they are saying is, I love her, and she loves me but it’s this bloody Brexit that has ruined everything for us. It’s ruined the marriage.” Toby Atkinson, a partner at Stewarts Law, has also seen Brexit push many marriages over the edge. “We have been completely flat out for the last three years,” he said. “The current climate of political and social uncertainty seems to be creating unique pressures for families. Would these marriages have broken down without Brexit? It’s hard to say. In Toby’s view, leaving the EU has hurt more relationships than it has helped. “For couples who voted different ways in the referendum, the difficulty of reconciling opposing political views may be the final straw,” he said. “I was recently consulted by a client who told me that although her marriage was already in intensive care, her husband’s decision to vote Leave made her realise they were well and truly incompatible. “I have yet to meet a client who has told me that Brexit has had a positive impact on their marriage. During times of financial uncertainty, it can be more tempting to ‘vote leave’ when a marriage is already under strain.” Our break from Europe has also created quite a burden for family lawyers. The ever-moving deadlines of Brexit have only exacerbated the process many marriages facing a dissolution across borders. I have yet to meet a client who has told me that Brexit has had a positive impact on their marriage. And, the ever-moving deadlines of Brexit have only exacerbated the process for many marriages facing a dissolution across borders. This creates quite a task for family lawyers. “There are various policies and preparatory notes being circulated to family lawyers at the moment saying, oh, this could happen to the law, and also this, but no, scratch that, they’re saying that won’t happen anymore, but this could happen. It’s all just a huge question mark,” Kaleel said. This confusion has the potential to impact a lot of couples. In mid-2017 there were nearly 500,000 EU citizens living in the UK with a British partner, with more than 130,000 of those couples residing in London alone. At current divorce rates, that could mean as many as 4,200 married couples a year facing uncertain futures. Tom Sewell*, from Brighton, thought things were going great with his girlfriend of three months. That is, until the topic of the EU came up one evening as the couple watched the news together. “She became very vocal about her views on Muslims and anyone outside of England. It was clear she didn’t really know what she was talking about but was just repeating words she had heard somewhere,” Tom recounted. “I’m not a hardcore hippy, but I lean to the left and, while she was very much on the other side. We didn’t realise this when we got together. “I told her I didn’t agree. We had been having a great evening, so asked her to leave the politics and focus on having a good night. But this just seemed to spur her on more, she spoke about how she believes Farage is a great man and then went off on a racist rant I won’t repeat. We ended it soon after.” Charlotte Ayres*, on the other hand, just managed to save her relationship amid the referendum chaos, but it was a close call. She met her boyfriend whilst working at a pub in Birmingham, where Charlotte was studying acting. I’ve had to ban conversation about it entirely. I’ve genuinely said if one thing will eventually split us up it’s our differing political beliefs. “My boyfriend and his brother were the only two people across all staff and regular customers that voted Leave, and a lot of the regular customers refused to be served by them for a while because of how strongly they disagreed,” Charlotte explained. “I’ve tried to have an open conversation with him about his reasons why, but it never feels like he’s open to hearing why I voted remain. I’ve kind of had to ban conversation about it entirely. I’ve genuinely said if one thing will eventually split us up it’s our differing political beliefs.” Tom and Charlotte aren’t alone. A 2016 survey by the relationship charity Relate found that around a fifth of counsellors had worked with clients who had argued over Brexit. As counsellor Gurpreet Singh explains, the heightened tensions of Brexit can reveal cracks in a relationship. that went unnoticed before. “Arguments over Brexit, who to vote for and other topical debates, can bring up underlying issues within the relationship as they highlight where couples have a lack of shared values,” Gurpreet told The Independent. Arguments over Brexit, who to vote for and other topical debates, can bring up underlying issues within the relationship “Our values are hugely important to us so when our partners don’t agree with them it can feel quite concerning. Despite this, some difference in beliefs and values can be a healthy thing as it can help to keep things interesting and help us to see things from a different perspective.” Fame and fortune don’t make you immune from the stresses of Brexit either. Actor Michael Sheen revealed last year that his four-year relationship with comedian Sarah Silverman ended shortly after the Brexit referendum and the election of Donald Trump. The reason for their breakup was a little more positive, though. Both Sheen and Silverman felt compelled to tackle the extreme right-wing views being championed in their home countries, sparking their desire to “consciously uncouple” and become more involved in their nation’s politics. While dinner table feuds over politics are hardly uncommon, some families have found their differences have become more prominent since the Brexit referendum was first announced. Sam Estall, from Camberley, is one person who can attest to that. “Prior to Brexit, I had a healthy relationship with my extended family. There was a lot of love each way and we were always civil, but the day the vote was cast, I started to notice increasingly racist rhetoric on their Facebook accounts,” Sam said. “Most notably a post from my aunt about wanting to deport ‘the Chinese’ next door because either they smelled, they ‘are all rude’ or any other kind of backwards logic. This led to a lot of arguments. It got to the point where I wasn’t letting it go and she blocked both me and my parents. “With my granddad, it was after the People’s Vote march. I posted a status about going and how great the atmosphere was and was met with every bit of snide ‘your generation don’t care, the will of the people etc’ from my granddad. I genuinely love my granddad and to see him belittle me for standing up for what I believe in was the last straw, so I deleted Facebook from every device I own.” It got to the point where I wasn’t letting it go and she blocked both me and my parents. Cath Roberts, from Farnborough, has also felt the strain in her family. Contact with her father-in-law has all but ceased after political arguments soured their relationship. “My father-in-law is pro-Brexit and continually harps back to when the agreement to go into Europe was signed and that the politicians lied to the public about the extent of the UK’s involvement in the EU. He says people voted for a common market and not the other things that have developed over time. He doesn’t see the investment the EU has made in Wales where he lives as a positive thing. “He just disagrees and flatly refused to listen to any other view if it disagrees with his own, even when faced with the information in black and white. It’s put a huge strain on our relationship and I rarely see him now.” Even long standing friendships have taken a hit. Faye Summers, from Reading, lost contact with a friend and roommate over their opposing Brexit views. “My ex-housemate and I had been friends for a number for years, probably around seven or so before we decided to live together. When the time came to vote, we had avoided the topic as we both knew we would be voting opposite ways. “I had heard her talk to her other friends saying she didn’t care about the majority of people and wanted to keep her high paying job and family money because that’s all that affected her. Even though she agreed that it would probably be more beneficial that we Leave, for purely personal reasons to make sure she was comfortable she wanted to Remain. She said that she was really upset and disappointed that Brexit had happened, and I was part of the reason why. “When the results of the polls came in early the day after the vote, we were getting ready to leave for work when she said that she was really upset and disappointed that Brexit had happened, and I was part of the reason why.” Faye’s roommate eventually decided to move out, claiming that she only wanted to move in with her boyfriend. But, Faye suspects that their differing political views was the real underlying factor. “The tension between us had started because of the referendum and our relationship never got back to how it was. We haven’t spoken properly in just over a year. I have no hard feelings about the situation and I accept that people will always hold different views, but I think that it’s a huge shame how much division it’s caused between so many people.” With the Brexit crisis is reaching its crescendo in the Commons, we appear to be a country at breaking point, our people split into leavers or remainers. A deal, or a lack of one, is only the beginning of the struggle. But, as the future of the country hangs in the balance, many of us are feeling these divides much closer to home. *Names have been changed to protect the identities of those involved This piece was written as part of the author’s final project for their Newspaper Journalism MA at City, University of London."

Medium.com,Society,The Audacity of Joy,World,https://psiloveyou.xyz/the-audacity-of-joy-2f9d02b0705d?source=topic_page---------287------------------1," So the world is going to hell in a handbasket right this very minute. According to the Council on Foreign Relations’ Global Conflict Tracker, there are 26 armed conflicts currently going on in different regions of the globe. CFR helpfully separates the bloodshed into categories according to the potential impact on the U.S.: Critical, Significant, and Limited. For example: Afghanistan = Critical, Syria = Significant, and Mali = Limited. I doubt the residents of Mali feel there’s anything limited about the impact of violence and chaos on their lives. But I digress. As you go about your day, you and all the rest of us are scrabbling on the brink of global war. And our leaders seem able to do little but shove us toward the cliff. While everybody’s fighting and screaming, the climate is going haywire as we hurtle toward the Sixth Mass Extinction. Zillionaires respond by sopping up all they can of the world’s resources while we little people work ourselves silly, hoping to glean the crumbs. Our children can’t assume they’ll have the lifestyle we enjoyed growing up, or even the lifespan. But perhaps they don’t notice: social media is turning them into boggle-eyed strangers in thrall to their screens. There are a million reasons to despair. Despair is easy. Despair is bullshit. The world may indeed be in more existential trouble than it has ever been. But it is also the repository of wonders and the wellspring of miracles. While the news media is hypnotized by fighting and division, human curiosity and ingenuity persevere. Assuming you believe in things like science — actually it doesn’t matter to science if you believe in it or not, a feature it has in common with reality itself — scientific discoveries and achievements in the less than two decades of 21st Century are astonishing. We’ve sequenced the human genome. There is water flowing on Mars. Dark matter really is a thing. We can make robotic body parts and grow human organs from adult stem cells. A German company has developed a technique that turns water into fuel. And the Ligo Project in the U.S. has detected gravitational waves. Which means that time travel, at least of a sort, may actually be possible. Mind-blowing, right? At the same time, artists and filmmakers and musicians and writers and actors and dancers keep on doing their breathtaking, spellbinding stuff. Much of it is accessible to us at the click of a YouTube channel. And I don’t have to tell you how much better television has gotten in the era of Netflix and Hulu and their brethren. Meanwhile, seeds keep sprouting, birds still spangle the sky like flying jewels, people keep meeting and laughing and talking and sometimes falling in love. Babies keep getting born, each one of them a unique, unlikely, and wildly vulnerable miracle. All of this is happening on this little whirling planet, the only home we have. We protect what we love, and love is powered by joy, not despair. So while it’s understandable if you get down in the dumps from time to time — especially if you spend too much time watching TV news — please don’t stay there. Do the courageous, maybe unreasonable, thing. Find your happiness. Embrace every good thing you can find in every moment you’re given. This doesn’t mean turning a blind eye to misery, greed, and peril. Do what you can to make things better. You can’t save the world by yourself (unless, maybe, you’re Elon Musk), but you’re far more likely to take whatever action you can if you hang onto hope. And you’ll be happier for it. The Earth Island Journal, in its 2019 winter edition, carries an interview with Greta Thunberg, the Swedish teenage climate activist who is so effectively riling up the planet’s plunderers. She famously ditches school every Friday to sit in front of the Swedish Parliament building, demanding that Sweden align itself with the Paris Agreement. It’s mostly not glamorous. She hangs out from 6:30 AM until late afternoon, reading and keeping company with her handpainted sign. But here’s what she says about it: I feel like my life has a meaning, that this is something I have to do and, yeah, except from being pretty tired, I’m very happy. Greta’s life has meaning, and so does yours. Find your happy. The world in all its messiness needs you, or you wouldn’t be here. Just trust me on that."
Medium.com,Society,"BoJo, Brexiteers Say Goodbye To The Union",World,https://medium.com/@tidalsoundings/bojo-brexiteers-say-goodbye-to-the-union-6a8e07dd3d8b?source=topic_page---------288------------------1," As we wait to see if the historic Brexit deal will pass today or, the more likely result, the Letwin amendment passes and the real vote comes sometime next week, there is at least one thing that is absolutely clear about the deal that Boris Johnson has struck with the Europeans and that is the continued existence of the Union is subservient to the Brexiteers’ desire to leave the EU. As Josh Marshall wrote, “has this[sic] UK in their epic reclamation of ‘sovereignty’ agreed to a customs barrier WITHIN their own country?”. The decision to basically hive off Northern Ireland from the UK was certainly a way to get a deal with the EU. But the Tories have basically abandoned the Unionists in Northern Ireland and vastly increased the likelihood of a unified island of Ireland. The ridiculous scheme will undermine the already fragile peace in Northern Ireland and provide a magnet for smuggling, VAT fraud, and associated crimes. In addition, those in Northern Ireland, especially the Unionists, are fearful of being frozen out of future deals the England, or whatever is left of the UK, will make. On the other hand, For certain business, moving to Northern Ireland under the proposed agreement would potentially provide a competitive advantage. That is certainly what those in Scotland believe. The SNP leader in Westminster stated that Northern Ireland would now have a competitive advantage over Scotland and, even worse, will be essentially allowed to vote on remaining in the EU, an option that is not available to Scotland. He raged, “This prime minister and his Brexit fan club in Number 10 don’t care about Scotland…This is the beginning and end of their precious union.” Nicola Sturgeon told the SNP conference that the government “has shattered the case for the Union” and would seek to hold another independence referendum in 2020. Polls show that support for independence has now reached about 50% and would actually be higher if the UK goes through with Brexit. Whatever Parliament ultimately decides, Johnson’s decision to essentially cast off Northern Ireland in order secure a deal with the EU, whether just a cynical ploy to get him to a new election or not, has made the Brexiteers’ position, in both Labour and Conservative parties, quite clear — if the Union must dissolve in order to get Brexit, then so be it. David Cameron made this outcome likely. Boris Johnson has just confirmed it. Lastly, it is worth mentioning that Johnson is bringing this deal up for a vote in Parliament with absolutely no economic analysis of its impact. The government has said it will not provide any economic analysis of the plan before today’s vote. This, in effect, is yet another reprise of the original Brexit vote where the voters were asked to vote on an option that provided almost no clarity on its real impact other than bogus propaganda."

Medium.com,Society,Trade Woes Pushes the International Monetary Fund to lower Global Growth Forecast to 3%,World,https://medium.com/goods-services/trade-woes-pushes-the-international-monetary-fund-to-lower-global-growth-forecast-to-3-22e7318d01f4?source=topic_page---------292------------------1," Rising trade tensions, Brexit uncertainty, huge debt level, and constant geopolitical uproars saw the IMF, on October 15th, cut its global growth forecast from 3.2% to 3%. This is the weakest growth level since the 2008–2009 global financial crisis. Earlier in July, the IMF slashed its global growth forecasts from 3.3% to 3.2%. In April, it cut its growth forecast from 3.5% to 3.3%. The US-China trade war exhibited by tit-for-tat tariffs, rounds of trade talks, short-lived truces, and escalating tit-for-tat tariffs has stunned the global economy and global markets. The Tit-for-tat tariffs have lowered investment, disrupted global supply chains, slowed global growth. As a result, it has left global trade in goods almost stagnating, provoking Central Banks to slash rates to stimulate growth. In the US, the Fund expects a further slowdown from 2.6% to 2.4%. The tit-for-tat tariff war with China is hindering short term investment, manufacturing, and exports.

The Chinese economy will slow gradually from 6.2% to 6.1% due to weak export orders as a result of its trade tension with the United States.

With the German economy suffering due to the US-China trade war, weakening auto sales, and Brexit uncertainty, the Eurozone will further slump from 1.3% to 1.2%.

The Fund has also slashed the growth forecast of the UK from 1.3% to 1.2%. It’s still uncertain whether the UK and EU will strike a deal to preserve their economic ties before the October 31st deadline.

Japan’s growth is estimated at remain constant 0.9% for 2019. The economy of India is projected to slow from 7% to 6.1% due to weaker-than-expected domestic demand and the impact of the ongoing U.S.-China trade war. As world economic leaders and financial policymakers congregate on Washington from October 15th–20th, a lack of coordination is in the air from both advanced and emerging economies. Germany has low national debt and runs budget surpluses. Thus it does have scope to act. However, Berlin has an aversion to borrowing (Schwarze null, or black zero) due to its past history — Hyperinflation in the Weimar Republic. Such caution would limit any German stimulus, to the dismay of the Eurozone. Higher fiscal spending will be a hard sell in Berlin. Already, it has expressed concern that the ECB rate cuts and Quantitative Easing will fuel higher inflation. Rate cuts provided by central banks in both developed and developing countries will encourage firms to take on a level of debt that risks becoming a $19tn (£15tn) time bomb. Yuan’s devaluation, subsidies, and forced intellectual property transfers are various policies that America seeks to change. However, should Beijing foot drag on implement the Phase 1 Agreement, the US will surely reinstate a 30% tariff on $250 billion worth of Chinese goods that was delayed as part of the agreement. The trade body monitors member states’ trade policies, provide a platform to negotiate new trade agreements, and resolve trade disputes. However, the trade body is rift with problems. Over two-thirds of the WTO’s 164 member states continue to claim “developing country” status. This designation allows them to take advantage of exclusive benefits (tariffs, subsidies) and exclusions to obligations not granted to developed economies. The West accuses China of being a non-market economy and a developed country, therefore not entitled to enjoy a preferential treatment at the WTO. The West also criticize the World Trade Organization for failing to implement and penalize China’s unfair trade practices. Members cant even reach a full consensus regarding rules and agreements. Thus trading partners have turned to bilateral or regional free trade agreements such as the Comprehensive and Progressive Agreement for Trans-Pacific Partnership. Global trade is in crisis. The United States no longer sees itself as the leader in trade policies. However, don’t expect a new leader to rise. The two likely contenders, China and the European Union, have diverging interests — China (Belt and Road Initiative); European Union (EU integration)."
Medium.com,Society,Lebanon’s Protests: Some Thoughts After the 2nd Day,World,https://ginosblog.com/lebanons-protests-some-thoughts-after-the-2nd-day-e0d6838c4265?source=topic_page---------293------------------1," It’s been a rough couple of days on the streets. I can’t even remember how many times I’ve been to Riad El Solh and Martyrs’ Square to protest anymore. It’s a bit eery how familiar that has become: the back and forth with riot police, the stampedes, where to buy water, what the security forces do before they charge and even where best to park for a quick and safe exit. However, this time a lot of things are different, and I can feel it in my bones and during every conversation with both strangers I’ve never met, and old friends I’ve stood shoulder to shoulder with the countless times we were gassed before. This leaderless, unorganized unrest has never happened before. Even with the garbage crisis protests, it wasn’t the same. People are taking the initiative, no one has a microphone, no schedules are set. This might be frustrating to some participants who prefer a more “under control” format, but it’s also a nightmare for the political class: they don’t know what to do or how to stop it. That’s something good for this grassroots movement. Another question is whether this loose coalition of people from every walk of life and background, would get the message clearer if there was consensus and sticking to a script. I disagree. Most of the people on the streets have many things in common, but also differ greatly on other topics. Trying to unite might hurt, not help. What’s certain is that they are all fed up with the status quo. What’s unanimous is that these vicious new taxes, including the ill-advised “Whatsapp tax” with absolutely no reforms and the perks of the ruling class left untouched, are something everyone is against and wants to fight. So, at this stage, with protests from Nabatieh to Tripoli, Bekaa to Keserwen and everything in between, something amazing is happening. Places that never saw protests have people coming out, expressing their outrage and finally adopting the idea that the entire ruling class needs to leave. Setting ground rules in a country as segregated and diverse and Lebanon, is sure to alienate many if not most. So, its unorganized nature, is the forte of this movement at the moment. Which brings us to the question many people asked me these two days: what’s next? The moment that made me get in my car and drive down to protest, was seeing men and women in Dahieh and Nabatieh coming out and showing clear dissent towards the Shia duo of Hezbollah and Amal. Who can forget when some protesters criticized Hezbollah and its leader, and were coerced the next day to go on TV, holding Nasrallah’s photo, and apologize? This hasn’t happened this time. The situation of the base of these two parties has become so dire, that the usual top-down mechanism of controlling the streets isn’t working anymore. At least not as swiftly and decisively as before. Personally, I see this as a seismic shift, where the wall of fear has finally crumbled for many of our Shia brothers and sisters. I can think of a similar moment in Lebanon’s not-so-distant history: 14 March 2005. When the Future Movement’s Sunnis abandoned their mostly friendly, or at least symbiotic relationship with the Syrian Occupation, and joined the traditionally persecuted Christian factions demanding Assad withdraw his forces after 29 years of occupation. This is significant. The chokehold that the Amal-Hezbollah had on their communities duo has faltered. The situation has become bad enough that people cannot excuse the rampant corruption and the absence of any prospect of progress: only more taxes and less rights. It’s clear that this somewhat rare mingling of Lebanese from different backgrounds and sects is still tricky. On the one hand, you have the scooter-riding young men with huge Imam Ali swords on their necks, on the other you have yoga instructors who speak mostly French and are strictly gluten-free. You see this tension when the second group calls the first thugs, or agents of destruction. You see it when the first group yells homophobic slurs like “looteh” to the gluten-free camp. This unfamiliarity has led to the downfall of many grassroots movements in the past. However, this time, it has somewhat dissipated. The different groups (not just these two of course, these were examples I chose) are realizing that they are all in the same mess, and are all certain of who is to blame. This is beautiful. Lebanon, whether we like it or not, is heavily segregated into mostly homogeneous communities. Your neighbors are probably the same sect, you probably went to a school run by the religious establishment of your sect and you will probably fall in love and marry a person from that community. Outside of a few pockets in Beirut, especially campuses like AUB, it’s rare to have these communities mingle, understand and even empathize with each other. This is happening to a certain extent in the protests. When some would recoil in fear at the scooter motorcades, today they cheer for them, with some even yelling “ija el da3em” (the support has arrived). With this unprecedented, organic movement, those in power are mostly silent, unsure what to do. Their electronic militias though are hard at work, and taking pointers from Trump and Brexit, they are working hard on misinformation. One example is the disturbing image of bound citizens stacked on the ground, their faces on the asphalt and their phones on the side. An image circulated purporting it was a fake, showing a screenshot of a Facebook user’s profile saying it was from Tripoli’s Beb El Tebbeneh in 2018. Of course, I reverse-searched the imaged, and couldn’t find it, and the alleged 2018 post on the screenshot was public, yet I couldn’t find it. I even recognized one of the detainees. Hours later, the user shared that the photo was doctored, and he never shared such a photo. You can see it below: This shows the tactics the sulta is adopting to confuse and scare people. That, coupled with the narrative of “civilized vs uncivilized”, “violent vs peaceful” have worked well in the past. So have claims that these are conspiracy with “foreign hands” involved, etc. However, this time it doesn’t seem to be as effective. No one’s taking the bait, and those that are, are being challenged with the facts by more alert protesters, showing how this is a tried and tested tactic of the sulta: divide, share fake news and shatter people’s trust in an honest, grassroots movement trying to make life less horrible for Lebanese. No one knows. If anyone says otherwise, they are not being honest. One thing we all know though, is we can’t continue with the current situation. Crises are raining down on us each week. Shortages in fuel, foreign currency, even bread and medicine have shaken people’s faith, and memories of the Civil War chaos immediately boil up to the surface. The ruling class has done absolutely nothing to show us they will change their now 40+ year pattern of behavior. They didn’t touch their own benefits, but stripped what little benefits an average citizen had, while hiking up taxes on basic commodities, with unemployment at record highs and an optimistic projection that growth in Lebanon this fiscal year was 0% (it’s probably much worse than that though). Can we handle another 50-day theater piece like the Kabrchmoun incident? Can we spend another few months on quarreling over seats in a cabinet that needed to be formed quickly? No, we can’t. Is vacuum better than what we are in now? Who knows. What I am convinced of is that of the millions of Lebanese, I am certain we have better and more qualified people to run our government. People who are actually knowledgeable in the cabinets they hold, not just appointed as a favor or to ensure dominance on what they see as a cash-cow. People who think about their jobs, not going on TV or what their tweet of the day will be to their mostly bot followers, amplified by their cyber militias retweeting each other to make a hashtag trend and make it to the evening news of whatever TV channel is close (or owned) by them. One thing that is definitely worse, is a military coup and rule. We love our soldiers, and support them when they defend us against ISIS and Israel, but we also can’t deny their terrible human rights record when it comes to dealing with civilians. Even though it might not be as horrifying as the ISF’s, it would only take a quick glance at the Military Tribunal, and their behavior towards unarmed protesters, refugees and detainees to understand that we definitely should not be under military rule. Ideally, a transitional cabinet without the unnecessary 12 or so extra ministries we have now might solve our dilemma. Professionals, people like Ziad Baroud or Damianos Qattar, who have shown how adept they are and are untarnished by the stench of corruption. Both did fantastic jobs, but were hindered by the political class and their efforts thwarted or even reversed when their term ended, or they resigned in protest. Early elections might help too, with Lebanon as a single electoral district, one vote per citizen, and voting aged lowered to 18 instead of the unjustifiable 21 rule. Truth is, I don’t know, and I don’t think anyone else does. What I do know though, is this is it, we have reached our breaking point. The proverbial camel’s back has finally broken. The day most people wished for or dreamed of, seems to be here. Being gased two days in a row is a new record I’m not happy to add to the long list of unfortunate events growing up and living here. Without warning, using aggressive tactics and attacking indiscriminately is shameful and unacceptable. It also wore off really quick. The second night, the blitz of teargas rounds didn’t end the protest, but people waited till the toxic fumes dissipated and kept returning. That’s when the army was brought in, and extreme force was used. Protesters were detained and beaten without any reason. They were chased into small alleyways and streets. Bystanders having a drink in the few places that were open were assaulted, threatened at gunpoint and verbally abused by soldiers. We also saw plain-clothed personnel masquerading as protesters, join in this free-for-all attack on citizens, with obvious orders to end the protest at any cost, no matter what, after the prime minister’s convoluted 72-hour ultimatum which people are still trying to decipher. Rayya El Hassan has been a huge disappointment. The first female interior minister seemed like an improvement, removing unnecessary road blocks and even talking about restarting a push for civil marriage. The past two days, we saw indiscriminate violence and disregard for Lebanese lives and their safety, as well as rights, trampled on so much that Machnouk seems like an angel now. Police and soldiers who have been caught on camera beating, choking and trying to run over citizens with their cars need to be arrested and taken off the streets. They are a risk to public safety, and mustn’t carry the weapons and have the powers they enjoy. They are thugs in uniform, and an extension of the corruption and lack of accountability that is the root of all of our seemingly endless problems in Lebanon. Be kind to each other. Talk to people you don’t know at the protests in the coming days. Empathize with them. If this is the first time you share a street with a scooter-rider, don’t be afraid, understand how hard his life must be to want to bash an ATM machine in anger. Imagine how difficult their decision was to finally stand up to Amal and Hezbollah, despite the risks. Embrace them, don’t ostracize them. Welcome them to the side of the people, help them realize it was the right decision, not feel discarded like they did with their political parties for years. Take care of each other. We are facing a group of warlords who will do anything to stay in power. Lie, beat, kill, torture and try to gaslight you. I love you all. And thank you. This took so much energy out of me, but I had to write this down before I could get a couple of hours sleep before going back down to protest."

Medium.com,Society,Boris Johnson Is Here To Stay,World,https://medium.com/discourse/boris-johnson-is-here-to-stay-fa54401ee8f8?source=topic_page---------295------------------1," After about a year in the political limbo, Boris Johnson emerged as the Leader of the Conservative party and therefore the Prime Minister of the United Kingdom on the 24th of July 2019. His most important appeal, the reason he won, was his promise to take the UK out of the EU by October 31st. He seems to have delivered, at least partially as he managed to negotiate a Brexit deal with the EU. Its an agreement that even Jean-Claude Juncker (President of the European Commission) calls, “a fair and balanced agreement”. On Saturday October 19th, the UK parliament will vote on this deal. Predictions indicate that 259 (conservative) MPs will vote ‘aye’ while 306 (Labour, SNP, DUP, IGC, PC, Green along with 9 independent) MPs will vote ‘No’. This leaves 74 MPs (Hard Conservatives, some labour and independents) up for grabs to reach the magic 320 votes to approve the deal. The outcome of the voting is widely speculated to result in a ‘No’. However, regardless of the outcome, Boris Johnson will emerge politically victorious. Opinion polling in the UK shows the conservatives leading in the polls by about 9 percentage points (Conservatives 34% vs Labour 25%). The most likely allies of the conservatives, the BP (Brexit Part) is polling at 12% . When asked “Which of the following do you think would make the best Prime Minister?” and offered a choice between Boris Johnson and Jeremy Corbyn (leader of Labour), about 43% choose Boris Johnson as opposed to 21% who choose Jeremy Corbyn. If Saturday’s vote goes through (UK parliament votes to exit the EU), Boris Johnson will be viewed as the leader who got Brexit delivered. If the vote does not go through, Boris Johnson can force a general election and campaign on his efforts in the past few months being stonewalled by the ‘elites’, ‘insiders’ and the ‘establishment’. This most likely will work. Since the referendum, the uncertainty of Brexit has only led to an increase in the resentment of the political process. This culminated in The Brexit Party, a Party that was founded six months before the election, to gain the most seats in the European Elections that occurred in May 2019. Brexit still has a strong support in the UK. About 42% say that “Britain was right to vote to leave the European Union” as opposed to 47% who say it was wrong. In a protentional second referendum, 45% are projected to vote leave vs 50% who would vote to remain. The margins in these polls show how uncertain and unpredictable opinion on Brexit is. This is the reason why the Labour Party, under Jeremy Corbyn, has been so vague on its policy on Brexit or a second referendum. This has allowed the conservatives to capitalise on the uncertainty, to their political advantage. Boris Johnson is a politician who is a master at ‘the charm’ and ‘the spin’ that every politician desires, this will allow him to navigate the political confusion to his advantage."
Medium.com,Society,Why The Conflict With The Syrian Kurds and Turkey Matters,World,https://medium.com/@tonyblass_45299/why-the-conflict-with-the-syrian-kurds-and-turkey-matters-34294750082c?source=topic_page---------296------------------1," As reported by major news media outlets, Turkey has begun attacks against the Kurdish Forces located in northern Syria. While this is a major geopolitical issue, the media has placed more focus on President Trump withdrawing troops from the region rather than how America got in this position in the first place. This Turkish operation matters because it is the epitome of disastrous foreign policy by the United States of America, and this is not a one-off failed policy. Instead, this an example of the global position leaders of the United States have put the country in, and it is untenable. It is essential to understand that this is not a Trump issue, no matter how the major news media spins it. President Trump did not create the situation the country finds itself in, but he does have some culpability in our current actions. As a country, our foreign policy should have never allowed us to literally be in the middle of a conflict with two allies. Yet here we are, and now there are two things we must do. We must understand how we got it in this position and We must have a strategic plan to correct our foreign policy to again be the global leader. The United States’ current foreign policy of interventionism began at the end of World War Two. America, at the start of the Cold War, took a stance of prosperity through interventionism, meaning the United States would spread Democracy and thwart Communism by intervening on that Countries behalf. The problem with this is the country either did not ask for such intervention or was unaware altogether. There is a laundry list of locations, including Syria, Iran, Cuba, Guatemala, Lebanon, Vietnam, and Chile, to name a few. These are important to have an understanding that this is not a very recent occurrence. The policy of interventionism is, however, unique to the United States and Russia to an extent. The United States has taken its playbook from the Cold War, and instead of updating it is still using it without Russia in mind. September 11, 2001, changed the United States focus, not its global strategy. America does not know any other way, and 18 years later, we are still enthralled in a war that can not come to an end. The attack on 9/11 rated a response and had international support. We knew who attacked and where they were. It is American arrogance that has kept the United States in Afganistan, not an enemy they have yet to defeat. While Afghanistan demonstrates the United States’ need to be among the peanut gallery, Iraq is American interventionism on full display and center stage. The United States invaded Iraq based on intelligence relating to the country possessing chemical weapons. Whether Iraq possessed these weapons is irrelevant. The chemical weapons were a prelude and reason that provided the United States justification to interject itself. The real question we should be asking is, should we have inserted ourselves in the first place? Would the fact that Iraq having possession of chemical weapons affect the people of the United States? The truth is that this was not an American Problem, but we made it our problem and in the process, made the region less stable. The invasion of Iraq was the tipping point for the colossal disaster the Middle East finds itself in currently. All the events that transpired since the invasion of Iraq have led us to this point. We are quite literally the monkey in the middle of a conflict between two allies, a position we should have never found ourselves in. This is, however, the exact position we find ourselves in, and it does not matter that it is 74 years in the making. It is the current reality, and just ignoring that fact is not how we correct it, and this is where Trump has culpability. It is essential to understand that we are not talking about a fight between two friends, and you are stuck in the middle. These issues are complicated, having regional and global ramifications. The geopolitical understanding of the term ally is also important. Turkey is a strategic ally of the United States, both regionally and globally. The Kurds are an operational ally but do not play any role on the global stage. With this geopolitical understanding, it is easy to see why Trump withdrew troops that were directly embedded with the Kurds. The President, though, missed a huge opportunity to be a global leader while changing the United States interventionism policy. This President, along with many Americans, including a large population of veterans, wants to bring the troops home. This is a massive step in fixing American foreign policy, but it must be done strategically and with a more significant leadership role in mind. War is big business, and interventionism keeps the United States engaged in conflicts. It is no surprise that an industry that has a revenue of 760 billion with a profit of 81 billion in 2018 that the executives want the current American policy to remain the same. Both political parties bring in big money from their lobbies to ensure that it does. The problem for President Trump is how to collapse a current system with the problems we created. The answer is strategic leadership. Turkey would not have begun its invasion on the Kurds if the United States made it clear that we have troops in the area. Then started actively working towards a regional solution. This is evident by the sure speed a ceasefire was accomplished. Trump should have begun the new era of American leadership by being the facilitator and mediator to a peaceful resolution. To systematically change our foreign policy, we have to take an active role in cleaning up our mess. We should and need to bring our troops home and take up a facilitator role. Over time we need to foster our current alliances and plant the seeds of new ones. This will be a hard pill to swallow for present American political minds, but we must allow people of other countries to live their own lives. Our attention should be turned to building a stronger relationship with the United Nations. We must be the driving force on policy-level decisions. Many of you may not like the idea of strengthening our relationship and influence of the United Nations. This is key to the United States, leading on the World stage and providing impact without intervention. In this new era of American leadership, the US stops trying to change the world forcefully and instead utilizes influence to effect change and prosperity. This is both American and World influence. We have to allow the people to facilitate the type of world they want to live in and pressure, regional players to handle problems affecting their region. Stopping humanity’s worst atrocities must be a global effort. The days of the United States acting alone or as the majority force should end. The United States should be the ultimate trump card for any of our allies. We must demonstrate that any attack on the United States will not be met with reciprocal force. Instead, the United States will levee total devastation and leave rebuilding and reconciliation to the collective of the United Nations. The United States can lead the world, but first, we have to stop trying to make the rest of the world exactly like us. America has to be the guiding model, not the conquistador saving the rest of the world by forcing them to be just like us. This policy shift will take time and true leadership, but it can and should be accomplished."
Medium.com,Society,“They Can’t Digest Pasta”: The Sinister Side to Italy’s Passion for Food.,World,https://medium.com/@melanzanefritte/they-cant-digest-pasta-the-sinister-side-to-italy-s-passion-for-food-95707a7e78b9?source=topic_page---------297------------------1," When a nation’s passion for food becomes more than a little problematic. Back in 2014, at the height of the ‘refugee crisis’ that ultimately brought the far-right Italian politician, Matteo Salvini, to popularity, there was a strange story in the Italian news. Accompanied by images of piles of individually packed meal portions, the story — in Il Giornale, a notoriously populist paper — was that the ‘immigrants’ didn’t like the food that they were being given by authorities. This, inevitably, was pasta with tomatoes and ‘meat’. It came at a time at which the press — particularly the right-wing press such as the Berlusconist Il Giornale — delighted in stories about the ingratitude and entitlement of the refugees, or the ‘clandestini’, as the spin generally depicted them — and as it depicts them today. The migrants demand Sky. They demand pocket money. They demand Wi-Fi. Yet, this particular story revealed something a little more than the breathless denunciation of these refugees. The interesting moment came from a member of Movimento 5 Stelle, the party who now governs Italy with the Partito Democratico — after the collapse of their previous coalition with Salvini’s Lega. Marialucia Lorefice, politician since 2013 and now president of the Committee for Social Affairs, made the striking claim that pasta couldn’t be given to immigrants because they ‘are unable to digest it’. Her comments also referred to the fact that, being all Muslims, they were prohibited from eating ‘meat’ too. Maybe she intended all this well — and it’s not like Il Giornale was sympathising with her position. However, the implication, in effect, is a sinister one, one whose particular discourse is mobilised by Italian politicians even now. The use of the imagery of food in politics has always been part of the populist repertoire. No matter which country you may come to look at — from Trump’s table of hamburgers to Theresa May’s fish and chips — food has always been a tool for politicians to demonstrate that they are, indeed, just like us. Yet, whilst in a country like the UK — which lacks a strong culinary tradition — the public response, from May to David Cameron to Ed Miliband, is one of scorn, it all goes down a little better in Italy. Of course, Italy’s passion for food — symbolising family, tradition, the good life — makes the Brits, in comparison, seem like barbarians. It is Salvini that has taken the use of food in his political imagery to the furthest degree. Known for interspersing his immigrant-bashing with images of kittens, bicycles, and him DJing, food fits perfectly into his particular man-of-the-people pose. From pizza to fried fish, regional delicacies to supermarket pasta, Salvini’s social media profile has it all. The image of his Nutella breakfast — on the morning of an earthquake in southern Italy — is only the most famous. And whilst this all seems pretty harmless, it isn’t. Since late 2013, when he was elected leader of Lega, Salvini has transformed himself from an obscure, extremist crank into ‘the Captain’, the biggest name in the Italian political landscape. And whilst haranguing his rightist audiences with tirades against rapist, terrorist, criminal Africans, he’s used this symbolism of food to lay claim to a national identity that sees itself as above and untainted by politics. By dressing himself in the garms of a foodie — and by juxtaposing images of national dishes (because it is always Italian dishes) with his anti-immigrant politics — he has drawn the connection between italianità per se and his ideas. And this only serves to give greater legitimacy to the latter. This particular tactic of the right — one, of course, in a whole armoury of others — is as old as politics itself, or, at least, as old as national identities. Roland Barthes, the philosopher and reader par excellence of the semiotics of everyday things, wrote in the sixties that ‘food permits a person … to partake each day of the national past’’. Cooking ‘is the repository of a whole experience, of the accumulated wisdom of our ancestors’. ‘Through the food’, he continued, one ‘experiences a certain national continuity’. This ‘national continuity’ is precisely why food is such a powerful weapon for the far-right — and why, in the Italian context particularly (unlike the UK), food functions so effectively in politics. It is, again, a neutral political ground. A ground of which nationalists such as Salvini and his party’s allies, Fratelli d’Italia — whose campaign, ‘Hands Off Our Parmesan!’, defended the cheese from being bought by ‘France’ — can claim to be the defenders. M5S’s Lorefice’s comments, on the inability of migrants to digest pasta, suggest that the Italian nationalisms that coalesce around food aren’t limited to the conventional far-right (from whom the ‘non-ideological’ M5S regularly borrow tactics, by the way). Rather, Lorefice’s comments are perhaps even more troubling — well-meaning or otherwise — as the importation of biology into national difference does not have a pretty history. What all of these politicians do, however, is to demarcate the boundaries of the nation and of legitimate citizenship by reference to a food that is ‘ours’ — with the implication that you can’t be Italian if you don’t like the food (this continues in the Italian press with a mesmerising regularity). And it finds its parallel in the complaints about the hipster ‘metropolitan elites’ who like ‘ethnic food’ — and, incidentally, in the UK’s strange half-joke-but-not-really about the ‘treasonous’ Brits who prefer coffee to tea."

Medium.com,Society,How Brexit changed my relationship with the UK,World,https://medium.com/@theanglodanishjournalist/how-brexit-changed-my-relationship-with-the-uk-57fcc70f9d79?source=topic_page---------300------------------1," It didn’t come completely out of the blue when Britain decided to call it a day and demanded a divorce. Even if the vote to leave the EU came as an overnight shock to many. Britain had always been a reluctant partner — suspicious of Europe after ‘standing alone’ in the Second World War. And still fantasizing about ruling the waves, while trying to come to terms with the fall of its empire on which the sun never set. The EU might have been a marriage made in heaven. But Britain failed to take full advantage of its special relationships to become the ideal relationship broker between the EU, the US, and the rest of the world. And the EU turned a blind eye to the warning signs and failed to change its ways in time. Many politicians, and certain parts of the media, also failed to focus on the positives, instead playing the blame game. Of course, I felt both sad and disappointed the morning after the vote. As someone committed to the partnership, despite its flaws, and appreciating the peace and prosperity that has flown from warring old nations ‘tying the knot’ and forming a union in the aftermath of the Second World War. It was a question of give and take. And as someone who had been able to travel freely from my native Denmark, and exercise my right to live, work and study in the UK. Still, like other EU citizens, without British citizenship, who have made the UK our home, I was denied a say in the matter. Yet the real let down, — a feeling I know is shared by many EU citizens living in the UK — could so easily have been avoided. Maybe I was naive, but I was waiting for that magical moment when the Prime Minister would step outside Downing Street and declare not just that the British people wanted us to stay, but that EU citizens already living in the UK would be granted an automatic right to stay. After all, Britain had willingly entered into the union and been the one, who had decided to leave. Hence I expected nothing less than a bit of dignity from a nation renowned for its politeness and good manners. Instead we became bargaining chips in the divorce negotiations with the EU and were caught up in the infighting and shouting match in the UK. Branded ‘citizens of nowhere’ and ‘queue jumpers’ by the Prime Minister, we were made to apply to stay in the country we had already made our home. Even though I would easily qualify for permanent residency, or settled status, as it is now called, it just feels very odd having to apply to stay after 27 years of living here. I was shocked to discover that if a hard Brexit goes ahead, and I haven’t applied for settled status yet, then I would have no legal protection guaranteeing my right to stay here. Even after all this time and with a British husband and dual nationality kid. I never expected to be kicked out, and lawyers tell me human rights laws would come into play, if such a case was to be tested in the courts. But I got the message, that we were now second class citizens. And it hurts. Maybe I felt a bit like Jerry Hall, when her marriage to Mick Jagger was declared invalid and void. And there has been no shortage of cases of Europeans who have been here for decades, many of whom have married a Brit and raised their children here, now suddenly required to apply to stay in their home country. Such as that of an 87-year-old grandmother, named Tove MacDonald, up in Scotland, who came over from Denmark in the 1960s after meeting a Scottish policeman. No wonder she felt sad and confused by it all. It really is a source of shame that the British government did not at least pass a law immediately after the Brexit vote guaranteeing our right to stay. But there are those who dismiss the anxieties and anger caused as unfounded. “What’s the problem, if you want to belong to the ‘club’ you just apply for British citizenship”, I was told by a Brexiteer. I tried to explain to no avail that until 2015 Denmark did not allow dual citizenship and that I didn’t want to give up my Danish citizenship, as the EU meant I didn’t have to in order to live here. Since then, the cost of around £1,600 means I have simply put it off. “That is the price you have to pay for belonging to the greatest nation on earth”, I was told by the same man and in whose eyes, I will probably never fully belong anyway. Even among Danes living in the UK I have seen heated debates on social media between those who feel upset by Brexit and bitter about having to apply to stay, and those who actually agree with Brexit and dismiss the application as a mere formality. And there is the uncertainty to what extent Brexit was about immigration, and whether the British people meant us, or other groups of immigrants. But at the end of the day, we are all in this together. And I have felt solidarity among other Europeans and Brits alike. It is not that I don’t believe in a proper register for everybody and within the first few years of living here maybe some sort of application process would have made sense. But it’s not our fault that the UK has failed to register people properly on arrival, like many EU states do, and even turned a blind eye to some illegal immigration, deemed beneficial to the economy by some. And identity cards for all citizens remain unpopular in the UK. After 27 years with the same bank account and a national insurance number, how hard can it be to find me in the system? I think I was just looking for some acknowledgment rather than having to prove myself after all this time. Then finally came the chance for me to have my say in the European Parliament elections. Only to discover that my name had been crossed out on the list of names inside my local polling station. An electoral officer was quick to inform me that I belonged to the wrong category of citizens, as he pointed to a notice on his table outlining different categories — each reduced to a letter indicating which type you come under. If I needed another wake-up call, then here it was. On my social media news feed, I had seen plenty reminders of registering to vote. So just in case, I had registered, only to receive a letter from my council stating that I was already on the electoral register, and that I didn’t need to do anything else. But it turns out I should have filled in an additional form to declare that I did not intend to vote in my country of origin. As someone who follows the news and Brexit developments on a daily basis, I couldn’t quite believe this had slipped through my daily news scan and passed me by. Some EU citizens were even told to go and vote in their home country. I haven’t voted in Denmark since 1992 — ironically when a referendum was held on the Maastricht Treaty — as you normally lose your right to vote in national elections in Denmark once you move abroad. Where was the campaign by the British government informing EU citizens that they were required to fill in this additional form? So there I was, after 27 years in the UK — I joined the estimated one million other EU citizens to have been denied a vote in the recent European Parliament elections. The estimated figure arrived at following research by this very campaign group, the New Europeans. I even became the subject of a story in the local newspaper I used to work for: As EU citizens, especially those of us from western Europe, we have of course been privileged. Maybe the Brexit vote has given us a taste of much greater challenges faced by other immigrants every day around the world. But in the end, I think Brexit has both questioned and ironically helped me confirm my identity and sense of belonging. Admittedly, I have, like many people who move abroad, or from the countryside to the city, felt torn between the two countries for years. Sometimes I still do. Like many immigrants I long for the parts of my country of birth and culture that I miss. But then suddenly find myself feeling terribly British when I go back to Denmark. As both the country and I have changed. I used to hold London up as an example of how multi-culturalism could work, when I felt somewhat alienated by the hard tone of the immigration/integration debate back in Denmark. I even teamed up with a camera man to produce a film, which followed a group of Danes in the UK, as they gathered to celebrate annual Danish traditions and take their children to Danish classes. The idea was to hold up a mirror to Danes living abroad — just to show that we are not that different after all. Then the Brexit vote happened halfway through filming and we all had to evaluate whether Britain was really the tolerant and open country we thought it was. I think I have gradually come to realise that whilst Denmark will always have a special place in my heart, Britain is now my home for better and worse. In the same way that there is nothing to stop people from feeling British and European at the same time. It seems much of the white working class had come to feel that being English had become a dirty word — and blamed the liberal left or multiculturalism. Much like many cosmopolitans were branded citizens of nowhere, as if we do not care for our roots or new found communities. I hope Britain will rediscover its strength as a multi-cultural society and discover that there is more that unite us than divide us. It is hard to see how the rich elite, who helped bankroll Brexit, really have the interests of the common man at heart. How deregulation and the lowering of taxes, which they seem to propagate, will bring a greater share in opportunities and prosperity for all. It will be ironic however, if the Brexit vote spells the end of the first-past-the-post electoral system and ends up pushing Britain towards compromise, thereby becoming more like other European countries. Who knows, the EU may even get a second chance. Maybe next time we try to renew the marriage vows the answer could even be yes!"
Medium.com,Society,"Turkish people trust local media more than before, report claims",World,https://medium.com/@oguzbakir/turkish-people-trust-local-media-more-than-before-report-claims-2c90b379d7fd?source=topic_page---------301------------------1," A recent international report on digital media and news consumption has shown a surprising increase in public trust in local Turkish media over the past year, despite the government’s growing control over this sector. However, some analysts warn that these findings should be taken with a grain of salt and that more research should be conducted before making final conclusions. According to the report by the Reuters Institute for the Study of Journalism and University of Oxford, the overall level of Turkish citizens’ trust in the news they get from the mainstream and online media has increased by eight per cent compared to last year. In 2018, only 38 per cent of respondents said they trusted the media in their country. The most trusted media outlets in Turkey in 2019 were TV stations Fox, CNN Turk, and NTV, as well as opposition newspapers CumhuriyetandSözcü. Of these five outlets, only two — NTV and CNN Turk — are owned by business groups with close ties to the government. The report’s authors found this increased trust of the Turkish people in the local media puzzling, noting that “there doesn’t seem to be any obvious explanation for such a dramatic change”. About 90 per cent of mainstream outlets in Turkey are under government control, due to the acquisition by a pro-government conglomerate of the country’s biggest media group. As a result it is almost impossible to get any objective, non-partisan news from those sources. Bilge Narin from the Faculty of Communication at the Ankara Haci Bayram Veli University believes that the findings of the Reuters Institute/University of Oxford report are somewhat deceiving and do not reflect the reality. “The methodology used in this report is quite problematic because the authors used only a limited number of people in their research and focused mainly on urban areas. More research should be conducted before making final conclusions on public trust in the media”, Narin said. Even the report’s authors admit certain shortcomings of their findings. “Data are from urban Turkey, rather than a fully nationally representative sample. This will tend to represent richer and more connected users”, the report reads. The Reuters Institute/University of Oxford report, as well as one published in May by the Turkish research agency Konda, revealed another important trend: people, especially those aged 15–29, use digital and social media as their main source of news. The Reuters Institute/University of Oxford report found that 72 per cent of Turkish citizens used their smartphones to access news, while two-thirds of people living in cities relied on social media for news content. Konda compared data from a decade ago with the findings from 2018 and concluded that, while television continued to be an important source of news for most Turks, the number of those reading newspapers had plummeted since 2008. Thus, 72 per cent of young people under 30 read newspapers in 2008, but a decade later only 22 per cent do so. Commenting on the apparent increase of public trust in Turkish media, Suleyman Irvan, head of the communication, new media and journalism department at the Istanbul’s Uskudar University, said it was probably caused by the fact that consumers can now access many different news sources on the internet rather than relying on the mainstream media. “Government supporters will continue to watch television to stay informed, but those who are critical of the government prefer to get their news from the internet because they don’t trust the mainstream media,” he said. For a long time Güzide Kara, a 43-year-old stay-at-home mother from Istanbul, used to read Cumhuriyet, one of the oldest newspapers in Turkey popular among secular Turks. She said she stopped buying it when the editorial policy became more nationalist, due to the changes in the paper’s steering board. These days, Kara uses Twitter and other social media as her main source of information on domestic and international affairs, although she knows they are not always reliable. “I’m well aware that social media is a fertile ground for fake news and misinformation,” she said. “However, I want to stay informed because I don’t want to feel disconnected from the world around me.” Atilla Topal, a 55-year-old engineer, used to be an active supporter of the ruling Justice and Development Party (AKP) and closely followed its political activities for many years. He used to read a conservative daily newspaper Yeni Şafak, known for its hardline support of President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan, but he eventually grew tired of an editorial policy which he said “lacks fresh ideas and repeats same things over and over again”. “These days, I prefer to get news from the radio during my ride from home to work, and I also stay informed through social media,” Topal said. He added that he gave up watching television news a year ago. “I am tired of watching the same people making the same comments every night. I would like to see some new faces and hear some fresh ideas, but that is lacking at the moment,” he said. Media experts emphasise that the government’s excessive influence on the mainstream media has backfired. “People are as interested in the news now as they were before the advent of the online and social media,” said Fatih Polat, chief editor of the leftist and working class-oriented Evrensel newspaper. “However, because the government’s manipulation with the mainstream media is so prevalent and so obvious, even their supporters start losing trust in the pro-government media and the information they provide. This excessive manipulation has seriously affected the relationship between the news providers and the audience.” Suncem Koçer, an associate professor at Istanbul’s Kadir Has University, warned against making generalisations. “It is obvious that online and social media report news that cannot be found in the mainstream broadcast and print media,” she said. “Therefore, it seems logical that the opposition and those who support them would seek the content they are interested in online because the internet is still largely free from the government’s control.” However, Koçer pointed out that her own research showed that, despite its shortcomings, “television remains the most trusted source of news in Turkey, regardless of one’s political and ideological preferences. People still see television as a trustworthy institution, so more research in this field would be necessary before making final conclusions”."
Medium.com,Society,Saying No to Child Marriage in Indonesia,World,https://medium.com/@UNICEFIndonesia/saying-no-to-child-marriage-in-indonesia-3aeee7f67a8a?source=topic_page---------302------------------1," By Jimmy Kruglinski, Communications Officer BONE, Indonesia — On a Monday afternoon in the small village of Warani, 16-year-old Fatma drove back home from school on her motorbike down the bumpy main road, her blue and white uniform fluttering in the wind behind her. She parked in front of the house and walked inside, thinking she would spend the afternoon like she always did — finishing homework and watching soap operas after dinner while she messaged friends on Facebook. But her hopes for a normal afternoon were shattered just as she entered through the door. “You’re getting married,” her little sister Irmawati told her, leaving Fatma in a state of shock and confusion. Their mother Sahari informed Fatma that while she was at school, a small group had visited their home with a marriage proposal. The suitor, a 34-year-old man, was a distant relative whom she had never met before. Fatma burst into tears upon hearing the news. “I don’t want to get married,” she exclaimed to her mother before running to the bedroom she shares with her parents and sister. She holed up inside, ignoring her family’s calls for her to come out. Indonesia has the eighth highest number of child marriages in the world, with one in nine women married before they turned 18 years old. In Bone, a mostly rural municipality on the island of Sulawesi, the practice of child marriage is more prevalent than in other parts of the country. Deeply rooted traditions and parental beliefs contribute to the higher rates. “There’s pressure from parents,” explained Pak Aminuddin, a part time counsellor at Fatma’s junior secondary school (SMP). “And if someone comes to propose, the family feels it would be rude to say no.” Economic factors also play a part. Many families like Fatma’s depend on the annual corn harvest for their livelihoods and supplement their income through additional part-time work. The suitor’s family had proposed a dowry of 50 million rupiah, about 3,500 dollars, more than most households in the village typically earn in a single year. Getting married would have meant that Fatma would have had to abandon her entire life. Her suitor had spent the past several years working as a labourer on the neighbouring island of Kalimantan and wanted to bring Fatma back with him once they were wed. His family also proposed a second marriage with Fatma’s little sister Irmawati, 14, to another older man in their family. Fatma, though, insisted that she didn’t want to stop attending school and leave her home. She refused to eat anything until her parents changed their minds. For a girl described as shy and introverted by family and friends, Fatma’s outspoken reaction came as a surprise to her mother. Worried for her daughter, Sahari finally relented later that night. “We wanted it [the marriage] for her. It was good for a man to come and propose,” she said. “But Fatma didn’t want it, so we turned down their proposal.” As she learned of her parent’s change of heart, Fatma felt a wave of joy rush over her. “I’m safe,” she told herself, breathing an enormous sigh of relief. Still dressed in her school uniform, she came out of the bedroom to face her family. “So, do you feel hungry now?” Sahari asked her daughter before they sat down to dinner that night. While Fatma was determined to speak up against her proposed marriage, many girls who find themselves in a similar situation struggle to voice their opinions for fear of going against their families’ wishes. “There’s usually silence from the girls which means yes for the parents,” said Pak Aminuddin. A recent amendment of Indonesia’s Marriage Act in September 2019 raised the age that girls can get married with parental permission from 16 to 19, in line with the age for boys, which is also 19. Parents, however, can still ask for a court to issue a “dispensation” which provides legal permission for underage girls and boys to marry. Although laws and policies impact the rate of child marriage, traditions and cultural attitudes remain at the heart of the issue. A UNICEF-supported initiative in Indonesia aims to empower adolescents to address the challenges they face in their communities, including child marriage. Through the Life Skills Education programme, students gain a comprehensive knowledge on important topics and the skills to manage risks and make informed decisions about their lives, such as when to get married. Pak Aminuddin is one of 30 teachers from 12 schools in Bone who have already participated in the training for the Life Skills Education programme. Many girls in the community marry too young, he says, which leads to health problems for their children such as stunting and lower IQ. He is planning to deliver the programme as part of an anti-child marriage campaign in the schools where he teaches. “I want to make the life skills education a part of the curriculum,” he said. In order to curb the rate of child marriage in the country, getting girls into school and keeping them there is key says UNICEF Child Protection and Gender Specialist Emilie Minnick. “Girls who have secondary education are up to four times less likely to be married as children,” she said. “By working together to keep girls in school and out of marriage, we can create a world where all girls and women are empowered and in charge of their own destinies.” After refusing the marriage proposal, Fatma’s parents now plan to send her to the nearby secondary school next year. She dreams of becoming a doctor so she can take care of her parents and help others, inspired by a visit to the local health centre (puskesmas). A patch stitched to the sleeve of her uniform indicates her membership in the school’s Red Cross club, where she learned to treat minor injuries and carry an injured person on a stretcher. Aware that the path ahead of her will be long and rigorous, Fatma believes the ideal age for her to get married is 25. “I want to continue my studies,” she said. “I’m still very young and I’d like to complete my education.” She takes a moment to imagine what would have happened if she had been forced into marriage. “I would have immediately demanded a divorce,” she said with a laugh. *Names have been changed to protect identities."
Medium.com,Society,Kenya’s Lamu Coal Fired Power Plant — Lessons learnt for Green Development and Chinese Investments…,World,https://medium.com/@nedopil/kenyas-lamu-coal-fired-power-plant-lessons-learnt-for-green-development-and-chinese-investments-b292f8ba9ad5?source=topic_page---------303------------------1," For a Chinese version, click here. On July 26, 2019, Kenya’s National Environmental tribunal ruled that the environmental and social impact assessment (ESIA) license for the Lamu coal fired power plant in Kenya was insufficient and that the construction had to be stopped. While this ruling explicitly states that this is not a legal case against coal-fired power plants, it nevertheless comes after 3 years of intense campaigning against what would be Kenya’s first coal-fired power plant: local NGOs and stakeholder groups organized under the deCOALonize umbrella and brought the legal case against the power plant’s consortium and the Kenyan government agency that issued the ESIA license in the first place. The Lamu 2 billion USD coal-fired power plant is built by Chinese enterprises, particularly two subsidiaries of PowerChina Group (Sichuan Electric Power and Design and Consulting, Sichuan №3 Power Construction Company) and China Huadian Corporation Power Operation Company and the Industrial and Commercial Bank of China (ICBC) finances the plant. Coal fired power plants had been the backbone of many country’s energy networks. For investors, coal-fired power plants have proved to be a sound investment with steady, and easily calculable returns, making them assets with controllable risks. This has allowed investors to gain substantial experience in valuing investments in coal-fired power plants. On the world’s stage, Chinese, Japanese, Korean and American were among the top investors and engineering, procurement and construction companies (EPCs) to invest in coal-fired power plants. In 2018, of the 399 GW of coal-fired power plants under development outside of China, Chinese financial institutions and corporations have committed or offered funding for 102 GW coal-fired power worth US$ 35.9 billion. However, due to climate and environmental concerns, coal-fired power plants have become increasingly under scrutiny. A number of coal-fired power plants have been postponed or shelved due to stakeholder-activism. Among them are the Rampal power station in Bangladesh due to potential harm to the UNESCO World Heritage Sundarbans, the Tamil Nadu 3.6 GW coal-fired power plant in India, due to inadequate Environmental Impact Assessment, or in Sri Lanka, where local residents pressured the consortium to build a LNG plant instead of a coal plant. At the same time, the cost of renewable energies have made coal-fired power plants increasingly uncompetitive. According to a study by Lazard, annualized levelized cost of energy (LCOE) for solar photovoltaic and wind energy have dropped by 88% and 69% respectively from 2009 to 2018, while these costs for coal and nuclear have increased by 9% and 23% respectively (see Figure 2). This risks that energy from most coal-fired power plants will be more costly than renewable energy. Kenya in 2019 had no operating coal-fired power plant. It relied mostly on renewable energy supplying 1,6 GW in 2017, particularly hydropower (827 MW), bioenergy (85,2 MW) and thermal power (672,9 MW). Renewable energy generation in Kenya has grown by over 200% from 2000 to 2017 (see Figure 3). But with energy consumption growing by 272% from 2,93 TWh in 1990 to 7,98 TWh in 2016, the Kenyan government saw a need to improve its energy supply: Based on the 2011 Least Cost Power Development Plan (LCPDP) issued by the Energy Regulation Commission (ERC), a semi-autonomous unit of Kenya’s Ministry of Energy, Kenya forecasted a 13,4% annual energy demand load growth and a 11,4% average annual peak demand load growth. Thus in the middle of 2013, Kenya’s government decided to build a 1050 MW coal fired power plant in Lamu — which would be the first coal-fired power plant in the country. The plant was to supply 1,050 MW of energy, first with imported coal from South Africa and Zimbabwe and later with the newly discovered coal reserves in Kenya’s Kitui county Mui Basin. After several rounds of bidding, the Kenyan government selected a consortium called AMU Power Company Limited in September 2014. The consortium included: The Industrial and Commercial Bank of China (ICBC) and the consortium signed the financing agreement for the project on June 8, 2015. According to this agreement, ICBC would arrange around 900 million USD export credit financing and would also serve as the financial advisor for the project. Accordingly, the Lamu project would be funded through 75% debt and 25% equity. Construction start date was set to September 2015 and the power plant was expected to be finished within 30 months by about 3,000 workers, including 1,400 Chinese workers. Before construction could start and the power generation license could be given, an environmental and social impact assessment (ESIA) needed to be undertaken with the goal to prove protection of basic environmental and social safeguards. AMU Power Company engaged Kurrent Technologies Limited to undertake the ESIA. The purpose of an ESIA process was to assist a country in ensuring social and environmental sustainability when commissioning projects, in line with the United Nations (UN) Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). In this process, stakeholder groups, such as Save Lamu, a coalition of 30 community organizations objected many of the claims of how Lamu would improve local lives. Save Lamu’s leader Omar Elmawi argued: “We at Save Lamu we are totally pro renewables and anti coal. There is nothing at all as ‘clean coal’. Coal is dirty energy, and by all means we strongly campaign against any plans to build a coal plant in Lamu”. (Source) The consortium also ran into problems for example with, e.g. land acquisition/land compensation. Only in September 2016, the National Environmental Management Authority (NEMA) issued the Environmental Impact Assessment License to AMU Power Company based on the ESIA. In February 2017, the Energy Regulatory Commission (ERC) of Kenya argued that all environmental, technical and economic issues raised by Save Lamu had been addressed and approved the construction of the project. Immediately, Save Lamu filed a lawsuit against AMU Power Company and the National Environmental Management Authority (NEMA) for not following the procedures and obtaining the ESIA license unlawfully. Nevertheless, in May 2017, negotiations for the power purchase agreement (PPA) reached their conclusion: Amu Power and China Power Global signed a $1,9 billion power PPA. And finally, in June 2017, construction of the Lamu project started. Yet, pressure kept mounting — both through regular protests and demostrations in Kenya, but also due to international scrutiny: four US senators urged the African Development Bank to not invest in the Lamu coal fired power plant due to ecological reasons and many large investors urged the American conglomerate GE not to invest its money into Lamu. Also, due to slower than expected energy demand growth, the Energy Regulatory Commission (ERC) of Kenya instructed AMU Power to half Lamu’s capacity for its 3 stages, from 350 MW to 150–200 MW. As a result of lower usage of capacity and thus lower efficiency, the average cost for a kWh produced at Lamu would go as high as 75 US cent — 10 times as much as its cost at full utilization (see Figure 5). As a consequence, retail prices for electricity in Kenya would increase beyond what was forecasted. From May 2017 to June 2019, the National Environmental Tribunal at Nairobi oversaw the case between the 6 appellants (including Save Lamu) and the two defendants — the National Environmental Management Authority and Amu Power Company Limited. On July 26, 2019, the court decreed that the environmental and social impact assessment (ESIA) license was not given according to the law, as both the consortium and the NEMA failed to follow procedures for stakeholder participation and missed to properly evaluate alternatives. With this, it effectively stopped the construction of the power plant as long as the grievances were not fully addressed. Overall, while the court did not rule on the viability of coal fired power plants, investors of the plant could be rightfully worried: costs of the project continued to rise while the project had actually not even commenced. For investors from China or elsewhere, the Lamu coal fired power plant can serve as an important learning example: while the national government originally both supported the construction of a coal-fired power plant and issued all licenses (albeit with delay), local environmental and social activism can derail investment projects. For investors this means:"
Medium.com,Society,Tunisian Elections and the Advent of a Fragile Democracy,World,https://medium.com/intpolicydigest/tunisian-elections-and-the-advent-of-a-fragile-democracy-1867964c5204?source=topic_page---------304------------------1," By Mohamed Chtatou Tunisia emerged as the only success story, so far, of the 2011 Arab Spring uprisings. While Libya, Yemen, and Syria sunk deeply into civil war and Egypt became a military dictatorship, Tunisia opted instead for a transition and the maintenance of its nascent democracy. As a matter of fact, Its transition has benefited from several structural advantages including; a homogenous population, a politically weak army, a strong civil society and a relative power relationship between Islamists and seculars. The Tunisian transition, however, remains very fragile, to say the least. In recent years, the Tunisian public has been bitterly disappointed with democracy for its failure to improve the economy and, consequently, their living conditions. The Essebsi case Essebsi helped unite an unstable political environment. He was a die-hard secularist but tried, nonetheless, to govern on behalf of all Tunisians. He also sailed raging seas, in a delicate coalition, with the moderate Islamist political movement Ennahda. After the dismissal of Ben Ali, complaints about the state of democracy in Tunisia continued relentlessly. In response, Essebsi founded the Committee for Individual Freedoms and Equality (Comité des libertés individuelles et de l’égalité) in 2017. The Committee was tasked with identifying unconstitutional laws and proposing possible reforms, acceptable to all. In collaboration with human rights and civil society organizations, the committee has duly recommended major changes to laws that limit gender equality. These include equal inheritance rights and the right to marry non-Muslims. At the time of Essebsi’s death, new inheritance laws were about to come into effect and were considered by the Islamists as a crude act of adversity to the precepts of Islam. The former president has, also, taken steps to improve the freedom of the press. According to Reporters Without Borders’ annual assessments, Tunisia’s press freedom rankings moved from 164 out of 180 countries to 72 under Essebsi’s regime. Essebsi’s mandate, however, was not flawless, in the least. Tunisia has experienced severe economic hardships since 2014. The country is, also, still facing, to date, a serious security crisis in the form of a violent jihadist insurgency. Tourism, a cornerstone of economic growth, has declined due to terrorism and the instability that has resulted, as a consequence. As a matter of fact, the reforms that have earned Essebsi much praise in the West have often provoked a strong reaction from conservative forces in Tunisia, especially Islamists. And despite giving more freedom to the press, journalists and other Tunisians continued to live under government surveillance. Their freedom of expression is always restricted today by Big Brother. A pivotal vote Voters have shown little confidence in current political parties and growing disenchantment with the actual format of the country’s democracy. Thus, the elections of September and October 2019 have been, no doubt, be a big test for the young Tunisian democracy. While the risk of military intervention and wider instability in the pre-election period has been extremely low, yet it will be important to focus on post-election events. It is very important that relations between conservative religious parties and secular and progressive parties remain civilized and peaceful. Even so, the rise of populist candidates and the relative decline of support for the dominant traditional political parties like Ennahdha and others could put the political standards created under Essebsi’s mandate to a harsh test. In the end, It will be a long road to democratic stability: sinuous and strewn with obstacles. But, all in all, Tunisia has resisted the trends observed in the region and Tunisians are ready to take up the challenge of continuing their long march towards freedom, rule of law and democracy. Perplexing poll results More than eight years later, Tunisia remains beset with many problems: the economy is sluggish, the standard of living has not improved and terrorist attacks have seriously affected the tourism sector and, as a result, the economy. But two events this past September — the first round of the presidential election and the death in Saudi Arabia of former dictator Zine el-Abidine Ben Ali — provided useful information on the progress made by this nascent democracy. Twenty-six candidates stood for election to succeed President Beji Caid Essebsi, who died in July. No candidate won more than 50% of the vote in the first round, including two poll leaders — Kais Saied, a little-known militant law professor, and Nabil Karoui, a media magnate imprisoned for tax evasion and money laundering. The ruling parties have been sharply criticized by voters and thus ignored at the polls, not to say, of course, completely rejected for their poor imagination as to what concerns the real expectations of ordinary Tunisians of today. However, none of the finalists inspires confidence. Kais Saied, who is independent and has conducted a discreet campaign, supports the reintroduction of the death penalty and believes that homosexuality is a foreign conspiracy. His opponent in the second round, Nabil Karoui, used his own TV channel Nesma to announce, with great pomp, his charity activities. He has been campaigning from a prison cell, after being jailed in August in what his supporters called a political machination against him and his promising political career. The fact that the Tunisians have turned to two populists will consternate a lot, but it is important not to lose sight of the significance of the election. The presidency is largely a symbolic one and the stakes will be higher for the parliamentary elections of October. What is remarkable, in fact, is that Tunisians have chosen to make their verdict through the ballot box, and this, after a dynamic and hard-fought election, that, as shown by the results of the first round, was truly open, free and competitive. This never happened under Ben Ali, the despot who ruled the country for 23 years and made it a corrupt and brutal kleptocracy, until he was forced to go into exile with his family when protesters invaded the streets of Tunis in January 2011 kickstarting the Arab Spring, in the process. Tunisia may be an imperfect democracy, but its resilience is a huge national and regional success story and cultural pride for all Arabs. However, the conservative university professor Kaïs Saïed has widely won the second round of the presidential election in Tunisia, which opposed him to the businessman and media mogul Nabil Karoui, according to two polls conducted at the exit of the polls broadcast Sunday evening October 13. A poll by the Emrhod Institute credited him with 72.53% of the votes and another survey, conducted by Sigma Consulting and broadcast by the Tunisian public television, awarded 76.9% of the vote to this retired law professor. The participation rate stood at 57.8%. As for the legislative elections of 2019, they were held on October 6, 20192 to elect the Assembly of People’s Representatives for a five-year term. These are the sixteenth parliamentary elections in Tunisia and the second since the adoption of the Constitution entered into force on February 7, 2014. The legislative elections took place between the first and second round of the presidential elections and gave rise to an extremely fragmented parliament. The Islamist-conservative Ennahdha party came out on top with less than a quarter of the seats (52 seats), ahead of Nabil Karoui’s populist party the Heart of Tunisia (38 seats). The center-left Democratic Party (22 seats) and the Salafist Coalition of Dignity (21 seats) rank third and fourth, the participation rate was established at 41.2%. The fragmentation of the parliament in strongly opposed movements augurs a long and difficult formation of a government. Disillusionment Nevertheless, disillusionment with the present political and economic situation has contributed greatly to the radicalization of young Tunisians. About 30,000 of them attempted or managed to reach the battlefields in Syria and Iraq to fight on behalf of Daesh -ISIS-. Many are now looking to come back although such a move will lead them, maybe, to prison given the present jihadist ongoing insurgency in the country. As a matter of fact, Tunis, the capital city, has been rocked by two suicide bombings in June that have been claimed by Islamic State. All in all, one must point out that Tunisia’s transition to democracy proved more resilient than some expected. The largely peaceful electoral campaign has raised hopes that the country will transfer its presidential office and position from one elected leader to another smoothly, a situation generally seen as a major obstacle to the development of young democracies. Nevertheless, the race was plagued with plenty of controversy and surprises. One of the finalists of the first round of presidential elections, Karoui, a media mogul, was jailed in August in a controversial case of tax evasion but remained on the ballot. He was freed only a few days before the second round of the presidential elections. The Conservative party of the late President broke into a rivalry between former leaders, while the country’s main moderate Islamist party Ennahda put forward a candidate for the first time. A little over two dozen candidates contested the big presidential race, including the remnants of the former autocratic regime in addition to the first Tunisian homosexual candidate, ever. Many attribute the success of Tunisia to a spirit of compromise of the country’s disparate political factions, which reached a pact in 2013 to avoid the dreadful fate of Egypt. The country had, also, set up a Truth and Dignity Commission (Instance Vérité et Dignité (IVD)), which shed light on past government abuses in a spirit of transitional justice, and the late President, Beji Caid Essebsi, guided the transition of Tunisia towards democracy, while being a senior official of the former regime, he pursued legal reforms and led his party to a government coalition with an Islamist party, Ennahda. Mr. Essebsi has not left a successor and since his death, several candidates vying for the secular conservative constituency he represented, including Prime Minister Youssef Chahed and Defense Minister Abdelkarim Zbidi. Ennahda, the moderate Islamist party Essebsi was working with, named Mourou as a candidate for presidential elections, after previously avoiding the presidency for fear of pressure that an Islamist government will have to bear from the public at large. Such a candidacy recalls how Tunisia managed to avoid the fate of Egypt, which elected Islamist President Mohammed Morsi in 2012 and then saw its brief experience of democracy ended in a military coup. Extremely divergent future visions The campaign of the presidential elections presented the citizens of this small North African nation with extremely different future visions. Mr. Saied wants to rewrite the constitution to give more power to local councils. He opposes openly recent proposals for progressive reforms to repeal Shari’a inheritance laws and to abolish laws that severely punish same-sex couples, and now that he has been elected president he will move forward with his agenda. Mr. Karoui, a businessman, is temperamentally more authoritarian than socially progressive. If he had won the presidential race, he would have likely consolidated greater powers in the presidency. Tunisia’s transition to a stable and mature democracy is still possible if people and leaders of the country subscribe to the idea that democracy is disorderly, unpredictable and sometimes antagonistic. But, the elected president, who has no previous experience with the past governments, will have to become, definitely, tolerant of uncertainty. A future under surveillance The authoritarian Arab neighbors of Tunisia, who wish to see this fragile and shy democracy, preferably stifled, closely monitor this country, small in space but big in innovation and ideas. After deposing Ben Ali, who died in September 2019 in exile in Saudi Arabia, Tunisians quickly adopted civilian and democratic institutions. This contrasts with Algeria and Sudan, where citizens overthrew aging dictators but not the entrenched military institutions; and Egypt, ruled by a dictatorship more authoritarian than the one that was overthrown in 2011. The future of Tunisia’s fragile democracy lies mainly in the hands of Tunisians, alone. But the strong men of the Gulf states will continue to fight for influence over the country, through foreign investment and direct financial support to Tunisia’s present political parties. The West can, no doubt, help this country by investing in its economy. But this must transcend past practices, in which coastal regions captured most of the funds from the IMF, the World Bank, and other institutions. This must change because the citizens of the periphery and the hinterland, deprived of their right to benefit from national economic development, may not be able to resist the attraction for desperate actions and mainly religious extremism. The West should, also, recognize that one of the best-educated people in the Arab world is desperate for win-win economic cooperation and partnerships that would create jobs, allow know-how transfer, and exchange of knowledge and expertise with the aim of long-term development and stability. Tunisians want badly democracy and rule of law, but they demand, also, economic progress and development. Life after the elections The newly-elected President Kais Saeid will have to contribute to strengthening national unity in coordination with the new government and the new parliament, addressing legitimate grievances and overcoming divisions in the country. Democratic consolidation of the country will have a fundamental role to play in protecting freedoms and improving the transitional justice process, stimulating economic growth, promoting collaboration among the parties, addressing national inequities and creating a strategic plan to promote decentralization policy and non-discrimination. Governing institutions should commit to achieving these goals on the basis of a political accountability charter. A North African saying has it that: “A life full of holes is better than no life at all,” in the case of Tunisia and the whole of the Arab world, it would be that: “A fragile democracy is better than no democracy at all.”"
Medium.com,Society,Bear with Balkans.,World,https://medium.com/@petrit/bear-with-balkans-b4bec5137457?source=topic_page---------305------------------1," There was a true storm in a twitter tea cup this week, when it became clear that France was insisting on vetoing any formal step of EU enlargement towards Balkans, stating that Europe needs to focus on reforming the accession process before entering “an endless soap opera” of membership talks. French President called the enlargement debate as “bizarre”,even questioning the wisdom of allowing visa-free travel for Balkan countries before opening the negotiations. EU Commission clearly stated that Albania had made a concerted effort to eradicatethe issue of corruption among its judiciary, while North Macedonia resolved a dispute with Greece when it changed the country’s namefrom Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia to Republic of North Macedonia, thus have clearly earned the right to start accession talks. Outgoing EU Commissioner Johannes Hahn called the lack of approval “not a moment of glory for Europe — it’s the third time in 16 months that we are discussing this important issue!” and clarified that the majority of member states had supported the European Council’s recommendation to start negotiations. Few months ago, Germany seemed also in doubt of the wisdom of allowing accession talks for Albania and North Macedonia but the geo-political considerations swayed German Bundestag to (conditionally) allow for negotiations. German EU affairs minister Micheal Roth stated that Berlin’s position was “crystal clear — the EU takes responsibility for stability, democracy, and reconciliation in the Western Balkans and that means keeping our promises”, adding “Much can be lost by creating a strategic vacuum there.” This was echoed by other member states. “There are other countries — Russia and China — who are just waiting for the EU to withdraw from this region,” Polish EU affairs minister Konrad Szymanski stated. Many others were concerned that EU failing to deliver the promised to Albania and Kosovo will have detrimental effect to the forthcoming talks between Kosovo and Serbia on the final peace settlement, a high priority for the new High Representative/Vice President-designate Josep Borrell. He had already announced that his first visit as High Representative/Vice-President would be to Kosovo,to help jump start the talks. “Good luck with that” — was the feeling of many commentators: “The dialogue [between Kosovo and Serbia] was launched offering enlargement as a reward for progress on resolving the dispute. If there is no tangible reward the EU can offer at the moment to the region, the incentive for compromise in the region diminishes,” warned Florian Bieber, Professor of Southeast European History and Politics and Director of the Centre for the Southeast European Studies of the University of Graz. Yet in the midst of the Balkans brouhaha in Brussels, few observers reflected on the reasons for French position. President Macron was rather consistent on his objection to further enlargement steps, if one remembers his statements made during Sofia Summit and Belgrade visit few months ago. [I wrote about this for the Atlantic Council earlier this fall]. The French public opinion (as well as German, Danish, Finnish, Dutch) is vehemently against EUenlargement. After a long and tough year battling Yellow Vests, last thing Macron needs is more headlines about the new wave of Albanians, Macedonians and other Balkanites arriving in French banlieues. Furthermore, Macron is probably also contemplating on the political landscape post-Brexit, and in that line of thinking, the enlargement policy is a “collateral damage”. Even more fundamentally, there’s an argument to be made that “key EU states, most notably France, never really wanted the EU to enlarge to the east”. One of the top former French diplomats, Ambassador Gerard Araud, who has served in the UN, the US and Israel, was indignant of, what he called the “carpet bombing”the French were experiencing on the question of EU enlargement, stating that enlargement debate is“avoiding legitimate questions about the future of the EU, ignoring the growing mistrust of our citizens vs Brussels and forgetting the major challenges the EU is facing.” He added “Business as usual can’t be the answer.” What’s the elegant exit from this quagmire? One clever proposal already came out. Gerald Knaus, the founder of European Stability Initiative, agrees that “France poses the right question”when it comes to the enlargement. Knaus argues that EU should extend invitation for the negotiations to Albania and North Macedonia, but should also reform the current accession process into a “merit-based process that brings Balkans closer to EU — an integration in substance”. The proposal put forth in a lengthy thread of tweets, is for the Balkan Six (Albania, Bosnia, Kosovo, Montenegro, North Macedonia and Serbia) not to be offered the actual full membership, but include them in an open process to join South East Economic area — covering the same issues as EEA, where countries like Norway are members. This proposal makes sense. Enlargement is realistically a non-starter for France and not only France, regardless whether Albania and North Macedonia open the negotiations or not. A new agreement called SEEA would the single market and enable the free movement of labour, goods, services and capital from and to those Western Balkans countries that provide evidence of progress in reforms. Such progress should also unlock cohesion funds for the best achievers. EU members could placate their public opinions with a promise that there will be no new enlargement until the existing members are in a consensus that absorption capacities allow for such an endeavour. As Vessela Tcherneva from the European Council on Foreign Relations commented, this proposal is based on the current thinking of several experts and there is a “coalition building around this idea, largely acceptable by the EU member states”. The reaction from the region was more muted. Agon Maliqi, one of Kosovo’s foremost analysts, commented from the margins of the Belgrade Security Forum that such a solution will weaken the EU pull and will project no symbolic power that the real accession has. He states that the “answers to region’s architecture will have to come from WB democratic grassroots — no more experiments from abroad.” Maliqi may be right that the real drive from reform must be sourced locally, yet reforms make sense only if people see palpable change within their societies but also in the interaction of their societies with the wider European family. Neither internal changes nor external projections of those changes are plausible without a far closer relation between the EU and the Western Balkans Six. A far bigger issue that remains when discussing new pre-accession mechanisms in ever-expanding toolkit of mechanisms is the fundamental problem of tense bilateral relations which are preventing any meaningful progress in the region. Having countries “progress” towards a firmer relation with EU either through current process or a future one is an exercise in futility if the remaining bilateral issues are not tackled first. Environmentally and economic standards or chapters may be fulfilled, but without first closing open bilateral chapters, SEEA risks becoming another Berlin Process — a mechanism enabling meetings where everyone tries best to ignore the raging elephants in the room. A correct chronology of steps can be envisaged to enable innovative thinking in EU enlargement process: Firstly, member states should create a level-playing field in the current process by delivering long-promised visa liberalization for Kosovo and starting of negotiations with Albania and North Macedonia. Secondly, an intensive round of diplomacy is needed to deal with most urgent bilateral issues. Josep Borrell — with the strong support of the member states and the US government — should help reaching of the agreement between Kosovo and Serbia. Simultaneously and promptly, France can give a contribution by becoming a leader it desires to be in working around the new set of credible carrots for and with the region, focused on SEEA type of agreement. As a part of this agreement, the process of the border demarcation between all Balkans Six candidates has to be completed as the very basic pre-condition to build regional trust — and the region’s trustworthiness. One thing that neither EU, nor the people of the Western Balkans have is time. Lack of agreement between Kosovo and Serbia will inevitably see Serbia increase diplomatic offensive against Kosovo with little or feeble reaction from the West. It doesn’t take much imagination or knowledge in game theory to know that in response, any future Kosovo government, will be pressured to reinforce its sovereignty in the north. The result can take the region back and make the public in EU member states even more sceptical of the enlargement. There’s one more reason for Balkans to be fast. As Tim Judah reported recently, folks from Balkans are fatigued with the lack of progress and they may all collectively, just say “bye bye Balkans”, before any of the countries in the region are able to finish what was started in Thessaloniki already 16 years ago. Petrit Selimi is the former foreign minister of the Republic of Kosovo and a Marshall memorial fellow at German Marshal Fund of United States."
Medium.com,Society,The Chinese Nuclear Program: Was it Worth It?,World,https://medium.com/@dennis.writing/the-chinese-nuclear-program-was-it-worth-it-e84b4788488?source=topic_page---------306------------------1," As one of the five permanent members of the United Nations Security Council, the People’s Republic of China enjoys the privilege of keeping an arsenal of nuclear weapons. During the unstable political environment of the Cold War, China’s journey of obtaining these weapons has been fraught with difficulty. Was it worthwhile for the country’s leaders to acquire nuclear weapons? We will analyze the decision of Chinese leaders during the Cold War to obtain these weapons of mass destruction. With a discussion of China’ evolving security environment before and after getting nuclear weapons, I argue that it was a worthwhile endeavor. We will analyze the history of the Chinese program then discuss the importance of global flashpoints and their relationship with China’s security environment. Through the fires of revolution, civil war, and foreign incursion, the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) took the throne to China while the Nationalist party escaped to Taiwan in 1949. As a nascent regime, the Chinese communists received financial and political assistance from the Soviet Union. It set out to enact several socialist reforms. However, states have yet to establish diplomatic relations with the CCP in this post-World War world. To the CCP, the world was a cold place. As the Cold War intensified throughout the mid 20th century, China experienced formative, attitude-defining conflicts. From the battlefields of Korea to the borders of Russia and Taiwan, China was caught between the bipolar struggle between the United States and the Soviet Union. National security became a prominent topic in the minds of Chinese policy-makers. Mutually assured destruction made direct confrontations between the two superpowers intolerable, but flashpoints can and will still occur elsewhere in the world. Residing in the communist camp, Cold War tensions and its consequent proxy wars threatened China’s regime integrity. The Korean War was a security threat to China. After the North’s invasion of the South in 1950, U.S. President Harry S. Truman ordered nuclear-armed B-29s to the Pacific Fleet. This decision occurred during a time when some individuals in Washington even argued in favor of using nuclear weapons against Communist forces in Korea and China. To the one-year-old Chinese regime, outcomes in the Korean War were pivotal to regime legitimacy and its ability to galvanize the nation and create propaganda. However, defeat would, on the other hand, demoralize the country and threaten regime survival. U.S. General Douglas MacArthur infamously advanced the Korean War to the Chinese border, drawing ire and military pushback. To the Chinese, the American offensive has the potential to bring the frontier of Soviet-American rivalry to its very borders. Furthermore, the Chinese leadership faced political pressure from the Soviet Union to engage with the American troops. Thus, a combination of security and political pressures compelled the Chinese to become entangled in this conflict, pushing back American troops. Another challenge to Chinese security arose during the First Taiwan Strait Crisis. The CCP government still considers the island of Taiwan to be under its jurisdiction and set out to militarily coerce the Nationalist government in Taiwan, sparking an artillery skirmish. The staunch anti-communist U.S. Eisenhower administration openly threatened China with its arsenal of nuclear weapons. The Chinese had little leverage against American nuclear compellence and was forced to back down. Not only did the country fear its security but it, similar to during the Korean War, also was under tremendous pressure from the Soviet Union to deescalate. Ultimately, lacking in credible nuclear deterrence and conventional arms ability, the humiliated CCP-led government backed down. The relationship between China and the Soviet Union deteriorated rapidly in 1959 after an ideological fissure following Joseph Stalin’s death, leading to border clashes between the two countries. Concerned about a costly conventional war with the vast Chinese population, Soviet leaders contemplated the use of a nuclear first strike. Though the Chinese nuclear program had already started, its relative size did not offer second-strike capability, and the Soviet threat proved useful. The Chinese leaders joined the negotiation table and ultimately backed down to the Soviets. This conflict stoked fear in the Chinese leaders, with Mao Zedong notably leaving Beijing to avoid a nuclear strike. Furthermore, this event was the only instance in Chinese history when its atomic force had been put on full alert. The border conflicts that arose soon after the founding of the People’s Republic spurred the nation to develop nuclear weapons. Pressured politically by the Soviet Union and militarily by the United States, China was forced to back down on multiple instances. From the security threat of the Korean War to the humiliation of backing down from border skirmishes, China’s unstable security environment motivated it to develop nuclear weapons. To Mao, it was imperative for the nation to gain nuclear deterrence in order for it to survive in the Anarchic international system. Thus, Mao negotiated with his Soviet counterpart and started his nuclear program in 1954 with Soviet assistance (note that this was before the Sino-Soviet split of 1960). The Soviet Union invited Chinese engineers for training and sent engineers to assist with the program. Under the support of its northern superpower, the Chinese, through sheltered pursuit successfully detonated its first nuclear device in 1964. The import of foreign expertise was crucial for the Chinese nuclear program. In addition to receiving support from Soviet scientists, Mao notably pushed for the return of Chinese scientists from abroad. For example, Qian Sanqiang described as the mastermind of Mao’s nuclear program, imported knowledge from meetings with scientists in East Germany. This program of knowledge import was crucial for the Chinese nuclear program, allowing it to “leapfrog” other countries in technological development, creating its first atomic bomb at breakneck speed. Indeed, had China not had the sheltered support from the Soviet Union, it would not of have developed the weapon at the pace that it had. Nuclear weapons improved Chinese national security. For example, the country did not have nuclear weapons during the time of the Korean War. Due to the lack of Chinese nuclear deterrence, U.S. General Douglas MacArthur held a powerfully aggressive stance on the Korean peninsula. U.S. forces also contemplated pre-emptive atomic strikes against Chinese locations. On the other hand, had China acquired nuclear weapons during the Korean War, the United States would be more careful of its actions in fear of nuclear escalation. Nuclear escalation on the Korean Peninsula with China also had the potential to spark a more massive atomic conflict between the Soviet Union and the United States, threatening mutually assured destruction, rendering restraint prudent. Furthermore, China’s nuclear weapons would compensate its inferiority in conventional arms. For example, Mao during the Korean War stressed the Maoist military doctrine of “people’s war”, a type of guerilla warfare utilizing attrition and sheer numbers. This strategy led to the tremendous number of Chinese casualties during the Korean War as they faced the technologically-superior U.S. force. The existence of nuclear weapons would allow China’s compensating of its inferior abilities through the doctrine of “escalate to de-escalate,” which is practiced by today’s Resurgent Russia in Europe. Similar to the way Russia compensates its weaker conventional abilities against NATO countries with nuclear weapons, a nuclear-armed China could better deter American incursion. Today, a nuclear-armed China uses its arsenal of nuclear weapons for “minimal deterrence.” For example, it would be unthinkable for U.S. policy-makers to fathom a conflict with China on the scale of the Korean War. U.S. forces suffering a nuclear strike by China would be unacceptable to the casualty-averse American public that acts as a domestic constraint to foreign policy. Furthermore, China’s nuclear deterrence gives it the ability to escape security dilemmas with neighboring countries. China, for example, borders the most number of states in the world, some of which are critical of the country’s recent economic ascendance. Nukes can stymie this distrust from developing into security dilemmas; thus, for China, these weapons are a tool for regional stability with competitors like India and Japan. In addition to the security benefit of nuclear weapons, China also gains political benefits from its nuclear weapons program. During the three conflicts mentioned in this article, China was forced to step down due to overwhelming political leverage of its atomic adversaries. Thus, the acquisition of nuclear weapons allows China to gain greater negotiation leverage in the shadow of mutually assured destruction as a looming threat. Nukes would have the potential to inflict unacceptable damage to Russian cities, U.S. Allies in East Asia, and also to the island of Taiwan, forcing these parties to become more friendly towards China. The political leverage of China’s nuclear weapons also seeps into the country’s dealings with some of its new allies. One example is Pakistan, where Chinese engineers helped develop the weapons program of this South Asian country. This relationship is beneficial for both parties because it allows them to balance the nuclear relationship between the United States and India, creating a stabilizing balance of power in South Asia. The value of a Chinese alliance also applies to North Korea. In the event of a regime collapse in the North, China’s nuclear program gives it the expertise to safely defuse the northern atomic program, putting China in the best position to prevent a nuclear catastrophe on the Korean peninsula. The political benefit of China’s nuclear weapons program also allows the country to gain internal political benefits. During the founding of the People’s Republic, Mao famously stated that the “Chinese people have stood up,” referring to the century of humiliation suffered at the hands of Western powers. The acquirement of nuclear weapons by the new regime contributes to its legitimacy by fulfilling the Party’s mission to revitalize the nation. In terms of security, Chinese nuclear weapons now allowed it to be more secure in conflicts with countries like the Soviet Union and the United States, deterring military action against China. Thus, in future conflicts, the country will be less likely to suffer humiliation and lose face. These weapons can be seen as a symbol of prestige for the Chinese. As the only Asian country of the United Nations Security Council Permanent members, nuclear weapons are seen as a source of pride and is consistent with the CCP’s mission. To revitalize the nation after suffering defeat by Western powers during wars of the 19th and 20th centuries, being part of the Western club of nuclear-armed states strengthens Chinese nationalism and CCP rhetoric. All in all, China’s security environment in the 21st century is vastly different compared to its 20th-century environment. During the Cold War, the country faced various existential threats due to the risk of a nuclear attack in conflicts like the Korean War, the Taiwan Strait Crisis, and the Soviet Border Crisis. Today, it would be unthinkable for foreign policy-makers to fathom a nuclear exchange with China in the shadow of atomic destruction. Since developing its program in the Cold War, China has continued to further solidify its deterrence capabilities with the creation of a nuclear triad, effectively making paralyzing first strikes against the country impossible. Using atomic submarines, the country has become more adventurous in surrounding waters and island disputes in the East and South China Seas. Indeed, China has become much more assertive in global affairs, taking a harder stance against Taiwan, South East Asia, and American allies in East Asia. In the South China Sea, the United States is more careful regarding its encounters with the Chinese in fear of a nuclear escalation. On the Korean Peninsula, the United States also have to become more accommodating to China, as the country becomes a more relevant stakeholder in issues on the peninsula like denuclearization. Chinese assertive is only on the rise. Militarily secure with its nuclear second-strike ability, the country can slowly consolidate its position in East Asia. Observers should also note that while nuclear weapons have allowed China to become more assertive, they have the potential to increase the destructiveness of conflict with China. Famous China scholar Graham Allison coined the term the “Thucydides’ Trap,” theorizing that due to China’s rising global position, it may engage in war with the United States. Accidents do happen in international relations, and Allison invites observers to consider the South China Sea as an example of escalation. As China continues to become more assertive, a naval accident with the United States in the South Sea has the potential to escalate into all-out nuclear war. Due to internal political constraints of nationalism among others, China could use a nuclear weapon to protect its territorial integrity. Therefore, rather than a tool for stability, nuclear weapons could increase the stakes of international conflict with the United States. Another perspective that observers should consider when studying the Chinese nuclear program and its effects is the phenomenon of the “stability-instability” paradox. A nuclear-armed, encouraged, and increasingly nationalistic China may engage in smaller-scale conflicts with its neighbors due to mutual nuclear deterrence. Candidates of conflict from the stability-instability paradox include India with its indigenous atomic program or Japan with its protection under the U.S. nuclear umbrella. Thus, in the 21st century, observers may be to see more smaller-scale skirmishes between China and its surrounding countries such as in Kashmir and the Senkaku Islands. However, all in all, China has experienced significant benefits from its development of a nuclear weapons program. Incentivized by humiliation in its conflicts with the United States and the Soviet Union, the country set out to develop a nuclear weapons program during the Cold War through the importation of foreign knowledge. These weapons have given China various benefits from military security to political leverage, and internal regime legitimacy. In the 21st century, it would not be likely for China to experience security threats to the degree that it has experienced during the Cold War. While leaders should be aware of the potential issues of nuclear escalation and the security-insecurity paradox, atomic weapons for China has contributed overall to a higher level of international participation. As China continues to rise economically, it will be interesting to see how its nuclear weapons program factors into political encounters with other states later in the 21st century.

Medium.com,Society,"Joe Biden’s Remarks in Davenport, Iowa",World,https://medium.com/@JoeBiden/joe-bidens-remarks-in-davenport-iowa-80fbc8405c2c?source=topic_page---------307------------------1," Of all the roles a president of the United States must fill, none is more consequential than Commander-in-Chief.

The power to deploy the might of the most powerful military in the history of the world is not an ego booster or a ratings booster.

To take the oath of office is to swear a solemn responsibility to our troops and their families — that their government will not risk their lives pointlessly. To our allies and partners — that we will stand with them in time of need. And to our adversaries — that the United States seeks peace, but will not hesitate to defend our vital national security interests. By this measure — like so many others — Donald Trump is a complete failure.

He is the most reckless and incompetent Commander-in-Chief we’ve ever had.

He has failed, repeatedly, to foresee the obvious consequences of his impulses.

And when the utterly predictable occurs — he seems not to care. Or he blames someone else. The buck never stops with him.

Talks with North Korea collapsing because they were based on nothing but a delusional promise from a bloody dictator. An erratic trade war with China that’s caused huge pain — including here in Iowa, where 160 workers in the Quad Cities were recently laid off, indefinitely, at Deere. Real pain for American farmers and manufacturers for virtually no gain, because he has no strategy.

Iran growing more provocative and restarting its nuclear program because Trump chose to renege on a diplomatic agreement that was working.

And now, Turkish forces invading Syria to attack our Kurdish partners because Trump tweeted our withdrawal.

The events of this past week in Syria have brought devastating clarity to just how dangerous he is to our national security, to our leadership around the world, and to the lives of our brave men and women serving in uniform. To building and maintaining the confidence of our allies. By precipitously withdrawing the small number of U.S. forces in Syria, Trump managed in one fell swoop to betray our Kurdish partners who helped defeat ISIS. Create a humanitarian crisis with innocent civilians and ethnic and religious minority communities in the crossfire, and up to 160,000 newly displaced people fleeing their homes. Force our troops into retreat, under fire, as forces from Turkey, Russia, and the Assad regime flow in. Give ISIS a new lease on life by forcing the Kurds to defend themselves against Turkey instead of fighting ISIS remnants and guarding prisons with 10,000 ISIS terrorists and supporters, some of whom have now escaped. And throw global confidence in American leadership into a free fall.

These consequences can be laid directly at Donald Trump’s feet.

He greenlighted Turkey’s invasion. Now he’s left asking Turkey to stop it.

But the damage has been done.

You don’t get do-overs when it comes to national security. These decisions are deadly serious.

Yes, the dynamics in Syria are incredibly complicated.

And yes, the conflict between Turkey and the Kurds dates back decades.

But before Trump’s tweet, the small number of U.S. forces, working together with our Kurdish partners, were actually keeping northern Syria relatively stable while keeping the pressure on what was left of ISIS.

Now that’s been blown apart.

Imagine how demoralizing this must be for our troops: Russian mercenaries taking victory laps inside the bases that President Trump ordered them to abandon. Turkey attacking the very people they fought alongside.

That’s why we need someone in the Oval Office who understands the gravity and the consequences of their decisions. Trump’s “great and unmatched wisdom” has undone years of hard-won progress across two administrations in a matter of days — including in our fight against ISIS in Syria. And as retired Admiral James Stavridis said, “everyone was absolutely flabbergasted.” Even Republicans in Congress know this is irresponsible. It’s about the only time they’ve mustered the backbone to publicly criticize Trump.

That’s how outrageous it is — even Mitch McConnell knows it’s wrong.

Trump tried to justify his decision to abandon our Kurdish partners by making the ridiculous charge that they: “didn’t help us in the Second World War, they didn’t help us with Normandy.”

Well, guess what: they helped us smash ISIS, a direct threat to the United States and our friends around the world.

Now, that didn’t happen during World War II, but some of it did happen during Trump’s first year in office.

You’d think he’d remember. He bragged about it at the time.

The Kurds stood with us to accomplish a vital national security objective of the United States — the destruction of ISIS’s territorial caliphate.

We achieved this without sending tens of thousands of U.S. forces and without spending a quarter of a trillion dollars, as we did during the Iraq surge. Instead, the Obama-Biden administration worked with and alongside partners in Syria with just a few hundred Americans supporting tens of thousands of local fighters to take the fight to ISIS on the ground.

Our strategy was so successful, it turned out that Trump’s secret plan to defeat ISIS was to just keep doing what we were doing — until last week.

These brave Kurdish and Arab forces paid a steep price, with over 10,000 making the ultimate sacrifice.

And then, Trump sold them out.

All it took was one phone call with the President of Turkey.

So now, instead of being a reliable American partner helping maintain stability and keeping a lid on terrorism — the Kurds have taken the only option available to them to avoid being wiped out by the onslaught of the Turkish military.

They’ve made a deal with twin devils — with Bashar al-Assad and Vladimir Putin — to hand control of the northeast of Syria back to the brutal, Russian- and Iranian-backed regime.

How does this keep America safe? How does this advance our interests in the world?

The answer is simple. It doesn’t.

You know who does benefit, though — America’s adversaries. Russia, which will be now be able to further expand its influence throughout Syria. Russia again, which gets to sit back and watch one NATO ally impose sanctions on another, furthering Putin’s ultimate goal of fracturing our Alliance.

Iran and Hezbollah, which will now be more emboldened to use Syrian territory to launch attacks against Israel. ISIS, which is already seeking to regroup, and now has hundreds of supporters released back into the region. And every single strongman, autocrat, and dictator around the world who has just learned that President Trump will abandon our partners under the smallest amount of pressure. All we’re left with is a Donald Trump-shaped hole in America’s credibility — and more chaos, more instability, more threats to the American people, our partners, and our allies in the region. And don’t be fooled by Trump’s argument that he’s pulling U.S. troops out of the Middle East and ending forever wars.

He may have caved to Erdogan and Putin, forcing our troops to retreat under fire, but he’s also authorized the deployment of thousands of additional troops to the Gulf and Saudi Arabia to deal with a yet another crisis that he helped create — the one with Iran. But this time, without our allies.

So don’t believe Trump’s con. This is not American leadership — this is bending to the will of strongmen.

And this is not an end to forever wars — it is a recipe for more wars.

He still has more than a year in office — God forbid he has four more after that.

Imagine what damage he could do in that time — either intentionally or through sheer incompetence.

We cannot let that happen. I will not let that happen. The next president will face an enormous challenge of picking up the pieces of America’s foreign policy, salvaging our reputation, and rebuilding confidence in the commitments made by the United States around the world.

They will have to address the world as it is in January 2021 — in whatever state of disarray Trump leaves it. And there won’t be time to lose building relationships from scratch.

We need a leader who can, on day one, pick up the phone to call our NATO allies and there won’t be any question of whether or not the United States will meet our treaty obligations or stand up for democracy and freedom.

I’ve personally met and built relationships with almost every world leader. I’ve negotiated with President Erdogan. I know how he operates.

In fact, the reason that the United States partnered with Kurdish militias in Syria in the first place is because Turkey dragged its heels on helping us fight ISIS.

I spent hours — literally — going over proposals with Erdogan.

He wanted to leverage our concern over ISIS to get the United States to essentially go to war against the Syrian government — which neither our Administration, nor the American people wanted.

So, unlike President Trump — I told Erdogan “no.”

But we kept working with Turkey, helping them cope with millions of Syrian refugees — designated as much humanitarian aid as we could to alleviate as much suffering as possible, while also welcoming those fleeing violence to our shores.

And we put in place the successful strategy with the Kurds that ultimately brought down ISIS, while preventing Turkey and the Kurds from coming to blows.

We shouldn’t fool ourselves — there may never be a solution in Syria that satisfies our best hope for a region at peace with itself.

No one wants American troops to be forever embroiled in conflict in the Middle East or “nation-building.” But there’s a big difference between sending tens of thousands of American combat troops to the Middle East indefinitely — which I oppose and will end — and using small numbers of special operators to support local forces doing the fighting to advance our common security.

We can be strong and smart at the same time.

And when we do draw down, there is a right way and a wrong way to do it.

And what Trump has done in Syria is disastrously wrong.

So as this Trump-created crisis devolves further into chaos — what should we be doing?

First, we should be working closely with NATO and the UN to bring more responsible parties to the table.

The United States and Turkey are allies — even if Turkey is not acting like one — so we should be inviting in a broader coalition of countries to pressure Turkey to pull back from its operation, refrain from ethnic cleansing or targeting religious minorities, and cease its callous disregard for civilians.

The international community should make it clear that we intend to investigate any reports of war crimes or violations of international humanitarian law, and to hold accountable those who are responsible.

Second, we should actively work to mediate a resolution between Turkey and the Kurds to end the violence. The United States should be willing to set up and facilitate those talks and engage all sides.

Leading the free world requires us to show up. To put skin in the game.

We shouldn’t be delegating this to Putin.

Third, we have an obligation to provide critical humanitarian support to mitigate the new refugee crisis unfolding before our eyes.

The Trump administration has released $50 million in humanitarian aid to Syria — but that’s only a quarter of the $200 million in aid to Syria it suspended last year. And how will it be distributed when frontline humanitarian groups have suspended services and pulled their staff out of areas where there’s fighting?

We should be willing to carry out airlifts of food, water, and critical first aid supplies to meet the need.

Fourth, we must remain laser-focused on preventing the resurgence of ISIS.

As the Kurds withdraw to defend their villages from Turkish attack, it is easy to imagine ISIS re-growing and filling the void.

We cannot let that happen. Because no matter how much Donald Trump tweets that it will be easy for the Europeans to recapture escaped ISIS fighters, or for us to “go back & BLAST” ISIS — that’s not how it works.

That’s not how it worked the first time, and it certainly won’t be how it works if we have to fight ISIS again.

During our Administration — we built a global coalition to take on ISIS that eventually grew to 81 partners.

Nations and organizations from all around the world stood with us, because the word of the United States was trusted under the Obama-Biden administration.

So ask yourself — after everything that Trump has done, after every international treaty that Trump has pulled out of, after every Ally that Trump has attacked, after leaving a partner to be slaughtered with no discernable strategy … who would stand with us today?

And if they don’t stand with us, how many more of our brave sons and daughters will have to carry the fight alone in the future?

And that brings me to the final point I want to make today. What President Trump is doing is bigger than Syria.

It’s more insidious than the betrayal of our brave Kurdish partners. It’s more dangerous than taking our boot off ISIS’s neck.

Donald Trump is demolishing the moral authority of the United States.

His incompetence is so extreme and his abuse of power is so rampant — that he is torching America’s influence and our ability to get things done.

Climate change, mass migrations, unfair trade practices, disruptive technologies, nuclear proliferation, an ascendant China and a resurgent Russia — how will we meet any of the real global challenges we face, if the United States is forever reduced in the eyes of the world to an unreliable partner? Diplomacy isn’t just a series of handshakes and photo ops.

It’s relationships that you are constantly building and maintaining.

Working to identify the areas of common interest while managing points of conflict.

It requires discipline. It requires a team of experienced professionals that you empower — not diminish and demoralize.

And it requires a coherent national security process to get everyone on the same page and to execute.

After almost three years as president, Trump still doesn’t understand any of this. And he never will. Because the only thing Donald Trump cares about is himself.

Not our allies. Not our obligations. Not our diplomats. Not our values. Not our leadership. Not our standing in the world.

Not the incredible human suffering caused by his decisions.

Not even the likelihood that ISIS will regenerate and once more gain strength to threaten our country.

There’s so much at stake in this election — issues that matter to every single American family — and one of them is this: What does America stand for in the world? Who do we want to be?

The United States builds alliances and works with our partner democracies — for the sake of our own national security and economic prosperity.

No country, even one as powerful as ours, can go it alone against challenges that respect no borders and cannot be contained by walls.

The investments we make in others come back to us ten-fold — in markets for our products, partners to help us tackle global challenges, and allies to deter aggression or fight alongside us when deterrence fails.

If we’re out of the picture, make no mistake — nations will make accommodations to work with those who are, whether that’s Russia or China or any other country.

And the world will move on without us.

Donald Trump’s vision is antithetical to everything generations of Americans have fought and sacrificed to defend.

I believe we are so much better than who Donald Trump thinks we are.

I believe we can and must still be the nation to which the world looks.

That mobilizes others for the common good.

The beacon of liberty, offering refuge to the oppressed.

The bulwark of democracy and self-determination.

The champion of human rights.

The leader of the free world.

All of that is on the ballot.

So we have to choose.

We have to choose the America we want to be.

We have to choose if we want to retake our place in the world, to keep the United States safe and secure.

We have to choose a president who will rebuild our credibility and restore the value of America’s word.

Thank you, and may God protect our troops."
Medium.com,Society,Zen and The Art of Experience Design,World,https://modus.medium.com/zen-and-the-art-of-experience-design-908326f7b6d?source=topic_page---------308------------------1," inding your way as a designer can be difficult sometimes. In this beautiful world that we live in, there are so many different ideas and iterations, it is easy to get overloaded. Sometimes a set of guiding principles is all that is needed to get started down a path and find your way. If you are anything like me, it is easy to get distracted or find yourself in a place where you’re asking “How do I do this?” or, “Am I doing this right?” A well-designed user experience, website, or graphic captures a user’s attention and makes the interaction with it meaningful and unforgettable. But how does someone begin to design something that does just that? As I immersed myself in design thinking, different ideas, and aesthetics, one idea that grabbed me and would not let go was the concept of shibumi. Shibui (渋い) (adjective), shibumi (渋み) (noun), or shibusa (渋さ) (noun) is a concept of simplicity and subtlety, natural beauty, and cohesiveness with that which surrounds it. I immediately fell in love with the concept and I now try to incorporate shibumi principals into the graphics and websites that I create. Originating in Japan, shibumi is an integral part of Japanese aesthetics. Emphasizing simple and natural beauty, shibumi concepts can be applied to a variety of disciplines in the design field, such as fashion, architecture, graphic and web design, and user experience (UX) design. Shibumi can be broken down into seven fundamental principles that designers and developers can use to convey better, more impactful messages. Koko represents restraint and omission. One of my favorite movie quotes is from Ocean’s Eleven, when Brad Pitt is coaching Matt Damon on how to talk and tells him, “Don’t use seven words when four will do.” As web designers and content creators, we want to design the next cool thing, develop new animations, or craft innovative content. However, what isn’t there can be just as powerful as what is there. The principal of koko implores designers to show restraint, only including what is necessary. This means that users will only see what is useful, and they will have a better experience as a result. There is beauty in simple, understated design. Websites that users can understand and navigate within seconds offer more value than applications that have many complicated features that are difficult to use. The principle of kanso forces designers to scrutinize what matters and remove what doesn’t to make room for what does. This is similar to what Apple has had so much success with in the past: emphasizing clean, simple designs and interfaces instead of packing in features. The concept of shizen refers to the balance that something strikes with its natural surroundings. A design that exhibits shizen is distinct from its natural surroundings and blends into them effortlessly. Blending in with nature is a hard concept to work with, especially when dealing with digital media like websites. However, designers can leverage natural patterns, shapes, and rhythms to create works that draw inspiration from nature. One of the underlying concepts inherent in the natural world is the flow or order of things. For designers, being mindful of the natural order of elements in a user interface or design, as well as how to guide the flow of a user’s journey, helps make interactions beautiful and seamless. Mystery piques curiosity. Yugen is an essential concept in traditional Japanese aesthetics. Sometimes, it is not what you put into a design but what you leave out that draws attention and captures the imagination. Information foraging is a natural reflex for humans and an important concept in UX design, touching on the innate drive to hunt down what we are looking for. Giving users a scent to track rather than delivering what they want in their feed helps to keep them engaged and draw them through the story. Incorporating this concept means leaving out just enough information to pique curiosity, keeping users engaged, and allowing their imagination and instincts to drive them. Drawing from nature again, often the most perfect things are imperfect. The concept behind fukinsei reminds us that there is beauty in designs that aren’t over-polished. Some fantastic examples of this in web design lay in the brutalist design movement that is gaining steam and the glitchy, dystopian designs that always draw attention. UX designers can use fukinsei by breaking up components on pages and arranging them in different ways. Reinventing layouts, while still allowing for easy and intuitive navigation, injects a sense of fun and uniqueness. There is wisdom in silence. Every day we are constantly bombarded with news, ideas, re-inventions of old ideas, and it can quickly get overwhelming. The concept behind seijaku is to silence and re-center your mind so that thoughts can flow freely. For designers, this is a crucial concept as it reminds us to take a step back from what we are doing. Remove the constant barrage of articles, new ideas, clients, and project milestones, and step back to calm your mind and take it all in. Stillness quiets the mind and opens the windows for air to flow, imparting new insights and soothing the soul. The concept of seijaku also has a place in design. Take a second to step back and look at what you are presenting to your users. By curating what you are presenting, you remove the noise and give users a better, more focused experience. People are creatures of habit. I find comfort when I get into a routine and know how things are supposed to go and what I am supposed to do without thinking about it. Datsuzoku means leaving those routines behind, breaking out of your comfort zone, and re-invigorating your habits. Comfort stagnates growth. Every designer should strive to get out of their box, ask questions, challenge their thinking and processes, and grow."
Medium.com,Society,A Beginner’s Geography Lesson,World,https://medium.com/power-lines/a-beginners-geography-lesson-633b82ff3b85?source=topic_page---------309------------------1," To further understand the world of power and narrative, we’re going to have to cover something that at first seems tangential: basic geography. Geography seems obvious, like water to fish. It surrounds us always; it just is. We trace our lines of path and fate along its contours, and at times we don’t even notice how its contours shape us in turn. But the deep, slow-moving forms of the earth have dramatically molded the palm lines of history. You’ve seen maps of the world before. There are hundreds, each charted from its own logic. No one map is “correct” or “incorrect”; rather, they are all different narratives of what the world looks like. Some focus on population; others on relative size of the continents; some highlight climate and ecology; others delineate the boundaries of empire. Each one tells its own story, and each story implicitly shapes the way we think about our universe. Today, we’re going to look at one specific element of basic geography: the nation. How many nations are there, how are they scattered across this mess of continents we see on nearly every modern map, and what do the boundaries signify? It might seem like a simple question to answer. There must be a concrete, and finite, number of nations. There is a finite allocation of land. But there’s a problem: not everyone agrees on how that land should be delineated, and into how many parts. So, who gets to make the “official” list? The most commonly used list of world states was defined by the United Nations. The United Nations recognizes 195 countries, 193 of which are members of the UN, and two of which are “observer states” — The Vatican and Palestine. The UN is the world’s most complete organization for global governance. It was formed as the successor to the League of Nations in 1945, with the drafting of the UN Charter. The UN consists of six “principal organs”: the General Assembly, the Security Council, the Economic and Social Council, the Secretariat, the International Court of Justice, and the Trusteeship Council. Underneath or related to these organs are a host of subsidiary offices, including the World Trade Organization, the World Bank, UNICEF, the World Health Organization, and hundreds of others (2). Opinions differ as to the extent of the UN’s power and role as a true governance system; some argue that it holds little real authority because it lacks most of the functions of any actual government, and at any rate, it does not functionally override the sovereignty of its member states. On the opposite end of the spectrum, there is the “One World Government” conspiracy theory that claims the UN was formed precisely to override national sovereignty, and to subject the world to a single inescapable authority. There is a whole host of opinions in between. Later, I will discuss these ideas more in their own article. But for now, suffice it to say that, whether or not it can truly be considered a government institution in possession of authentic coercive power, the UN undoubtedly [1] wields appreciable global influence, and, [2] its member states comprise most of the inhabited surface area of the globe. For these reasons, I’ve chosen to use their geopolitical list. But it’s important to keep in mind that this division is only one possible way in which we can see the world, and it reflects only one possible distribution of power. For maps are more than simply mirrors of the world as it exists; on the contrary, as cartographer and designer Denis Wood points out, they are actually propositions of a desired narrative. In their hearts, maps are an attempt not to describe reality as it is, but to insist that a specific version of reality is true. Maps will always leave out pieces of the truth, emphasize others, and distort others still. And whoever gets to decide on which parts are left out, emphasized or distorted wins power over the narrative of what reality looks like. That can be sizable power, indeed. Wood argues that, in fact, the explosion of mapmaking practices from the 1500s onward helped to build and consolidate the modern nationstate and its power. We’ve already discussed how the first empires exercised only weak, loose control over their territories; but according to scholars like Michael Mann, it was not until very recently in history that states gained the tight control over their empires that we recognize today (3). In Russia, Japan, the early United States, China, France, Thailand and elsewhere, maps played a pivotal role in the processes of state-building, uniting disparate groups of people under a sense of common identity and helping rulers visualize the vast areas that “belonged” to them (4). Wood writes: “From their inception it had been essential that states appear as facts of nature, as real enduring things, things like mountains; and at all costs to obscure their recent origins in violence and their tenuous holds on tomorrow. And maps were able to grant this precisely because maps too had been constructed as facts of nature: ‘We no more than show what exists,’ said the maps […] But then, this is what maps do, affirm the existence of the things on them. ‘This is here,’ maps say, ‘and that is there,’ as they do so simultaneously affirming the precedent existence of whatever is in question (the this, the state) and its location (the there, its borders).” He’s not alone in this sentiment. Even the British geographer J. B. Harley observed, “To catalog the world is to appropriate it”. (5) Most cartography throughout history was funded and monopolized by builders of empire. And it makes sense, according to Wood’s logic. The king’s desired narrative is that he owns an expanse of territory. So why not draw it that way on the map? If he commissions such a sketch, the narrative becomes real. Not only does he see the shape of the landscape — the better to plan its defense — but it is labeled under his domain. His subjects, his military, his merchants and adventurers, all see the world through his eyes. But the map is just a mirror of what is! It’s hard to argue with the fact that its contours seem real. After all, you can follow them somewhere, can’t you? The map was an instrument of state power, and as such it needed to be protected. Some empires, like the Japanese and the Portuguese, prohibited the transfer of maps or cartographic instruments to other states. The Spanish kept their trade routes secret and demanded the return of loaned charts when a ship’s captain returned from a voyage. The Soviet Union distorted its own maps in the hopes of confusing its enemies, altering coastlines, omitting scales of distance, and providing incorrect longitudes and latitudes. But just as serious cartography bloomed first in the service of empire, maps can also be (and have been) used to conjure up fantasies, to rebel against existing systems and narratives, or to chart counter-realities. This map, for example, attempts to visualize the world from the perspective of indigenous peoples. These peoples are almost always invisible on any map, even though they were usually there before the nations whose borders chop up the globe like steak cuts on a cow’s body. In many cases, these borders were drawn within the last century. As a result, many of the indigenous people, who have sometimes inhabited the land for thousands of years, sprawl irreverently across frontiers. This can become a problem, leading to immigration and migration issues, the loss of citizenship and social benefits as borders are drawn and redrawn, and other hardships such as loss of access to sacred sites and resources. A map such as this one changes the narrative: it describes a different world, one in which sovereignty over land belongs to first peoples, rather than modern governments. It also describes territory as more fluid, since most of these people don’t use hard boundaries to mark the limits of their habitat. It shows us a different perspective, a different story, a different reality. It’s important to understand the world from the perspective of those who make the rules — such as nationstates, and international governance organizations like the UN. These are the groups that have the lion’s share of the influence, that forge policies, that control the dominant conversation. But equally important is the ability to imagine other alternatives. What happens when we try to look at the map from a different perspective? What untold stories lurk in between the arbitrary lines and borders? The map tiles I’ve gathered here show the world as the UN sees it. But as you look them over, I encourage you to also try to see something different. Remember that this is not reality, it’s a story. And there is more than one possible story. The following visual aid shows the division of the world into 195 nationstates based on the way the UN has chosen to carve up the map. I decided to arrange the map tiles in alphabetical order by country name (in English). They are subcategorized by world region, and each region is presented in the historical order in which humans populated it. The UN observer states are listed separately at the end. Why did I arrange them this way? I wanted to help facilitate learning through mnemonics. By listing regions in the order that humans populated them, I hope to facilitate a rough visualization of historical human migration. I hope this will help you imagine the stories of the first humans as they discovered new landscapes and adventures, forging a history that has long since been erased. There is a storytelling mnemonic here. By grouping countries by region, I placed the world’s nations in bite-sized boxes — which will hopefully allow you to study and remember them a few at a time. This is a chunking mnemonic. By listing them in alphabetical order instead of by geographical location, I presented them in a way that you are unaccustomed to seeing them, thereby encouraging a fresh perspective. This is an emphasizing mnemonic, designed to make each country stand out as unique in your memory. I encourage you to come back to this article a few times, to study these map tiles, and while you’re looking at them: to really think about what those lines on the page mean. Why does a country have the shape it has? Which other countries border it? What history might it have? Who lives there? What are its current politics? What resources can be found there? What does it export to your country? Do you know anyone from there? Which empires have occupied it? What is unique about its culture?…And so on. Try to do this for as many countries as you can, to help you develop an understanding of some of the less-well-known(to you) places, until they become more than a vague name, or perhaps a word you occasionally hear in the news. Use this as an educational resource. Print it out if you want to. Save the images by themselves and pin them to your wall, a few at a time, until you’ve cycled through all of them. Just because we all have Google Maps at our fingertips these days doesn’t mean we shouldn’t still take it upon ourselves to get intimately acquainted with the world map. Our world has been globalized, and there are implications. We should really take some time to get to know the whole wheel that spins our lives around. If I could recommend a companion book for these exercises, it might be Tim Marshall’s Prisoners of Geography: Ten Maps That Tell You Everything You Need to Know About Global Politics. Enjoy. Next time, we’ll be talking about the empires that have filled (and overspilled) these global lines throughout history, as we look deeper into the concept of “empire”, and what it truly means."

Medium.com,Society,Putin Chums it Up With Saudi Arabia in Historic Visit,World,https://medium.com/citizen-truth/putin-chums-it-up-with-saudi-arabia-in-historic-visit-ec5e5e2e9916?source=topic_page---------311------------------1," On Monday, October 14, Russian President Vladimir Putin made a historic visit to Saudi Arabia, the first since 2007, aimed at exerting Moscow’s role in the Middle East amid Russia’s strong military presence in Syria and energy ties with the oil-rich kingdom. During the visit, Putin and the kingdom’s Prince Mohammed bin Salman (MBS) signed 20 multi-billion dollar contracts on energy, technology, health service, aviation and agriculture at the Al-Yamamah Palace in Saudi’s capital, Riyadh. The Saudi kingdom’s Energy Ministry Prince Abdelaziz bin Salman stated that the agreement aimed at boosting ties between both countries and stabilizing oil prices. The Saudi-Russian agreement came shortly after global oil prices hit their highest level in the past four months following two drone attacks on Saudi’s oil facility on September 14. One day after the incident, the Brent crude oil price jumped 19 percent to $71.95 per barrel, while the price of White Texas Intermediate rose 15 percent to $63.34. Saudi’s oil giant, Aramco, claimed that the monarch suffered a 5.7 million barrels per day loss due to the attacks. After leaving Saudi Arabia, Putin continued his Middle East trip to the United Arab Emirates (UAE) on Tuesday, October 15, to meet Prince Mohammed bin Zayed Al-Nahyan. Putin’s visit to Saudi Arabia is a significant marker for Moscow’s growing influence in the Middle East — perhaps the world’s most volatile region, often plagued by conflicts from the Israel-Palestine to the U.S-Iran tension following Washington’s withdrawal from the nuclear deal and the Yemen war. The Russian leader’s Middle East tour came amid Washington’s decision to withdraw around 1,000 troops from war-torn Syria, abandoning the Kurds rebels once the U.S.’ ally in fighting against the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria (ISIS). Turkey then invaded northern Syria, fearing that the Kurdish’s growing power close to its border would threaten Ankara’s security. Ahead of his Saudi trip, Putin expressed optimism that he could help to defuse the ongoing tensions in the Gulf, thanks to the Kremlin’s good ties with the Gulf Arab countries and Iran. “Russia sees the expansion of friendly and mutually beneficial ties with Saudi Arabia as particularly important,” Putin said in a statement during his Saudi visit. Putin defended Iran following accusations from the U.S. and Saudi Arabia that Tehran was behind the attacks on a Saudi oil facility on September 14, despite a lack of evidence indicating who masterminded the incident. “It is wrong to determine who is guilty before it is known reliably and clearly who is behind this act,” Putin said, adding that he was willing to help investigate. Three days after the attack on Saudi’s oil refineries rocked global oil prices, Russia offered its missile defense system to Saudi Arabia claiming it could help prevent such an attack from happening again. “We are ready to help Saudi Arabia so that she can protect her territory. She can do so in the same way that Iran has already done in buying the S-300 Russian missile system and the same way that Turkey has already done in buying the S-400 Russian missile system,” Putin said in a press conference in Ankara Unlike the U.S., who has not wanted to talk to key players in the Middle East (like Syrian president Assad or the Iran-linked Hezbollah), Russia often welcomes dialogue with all parties in the Middle East (except militant groups such as Al-Qaeda and ISIS). Thus, the question arises: Is Russia angling to become a mediator for Middle East conflicts? With the U.S. is in the midst of pulling troops from Syria, it could be an opportune time for Russia to step in. If both Washington’s allies and enemies put their trust in Russia, the U.S.’ influence in the Middle East could be on its way down, as a Brookings Institute January 2019 report warned. Saudi Minister of State for Foreign Affairs, Adel al-Jubei, dismissed the idea that Putin’s historic visit to Saudi could undermine the kingdom’s ties to the U.S., stating, “We don’t believe that having close ties with Russia has any negative impact on our relationship with the United States. We believe that we can have strategic and strong ties with the United States while we develop our ties with Russia.” But given the U.S.’ incessant drum-beating of a “Russian threat” will the U.S. really take kindly to a Saudi Arabian friendship with Russia?

Medium.com,Society,Was the Nobel Peace Prize for Ethiopia’s prime minister premature?,World,https://medium.com/adinkra/was-the-nobel-peace-prize-for-ethiopias-prime-minister-premature-e697718df750?source=topic_page---------314------------------1," By Nwachukwu Egbunike On October 12, barely 24 hours after Ethiopian Prime Minister Dr. Abiy Ahmed Ali was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize for 2019 , the organizers of a protest were arrested and from addressing a press conference in Addis Ababa. The demonstration, scheduled for October 13 in Meskel Square in the Ethiopian capital, was organized by the by Baladera Council movement to protest the “ ownership claim Eskinder Nega , an Ethiopian journalist and blogger who has been jailed several times by the government on various charges. Oromo politicians over Addis Ababa,” and the “suppression” of political parties and civil society. The Baldera Council is led by The Norwegian Nobel Committee announced the Nobel Peace Prize for 2019 on October 11, citing Dr. Abiy Ahmed Ali’s “decisive initiative to resolve the border conflict with neighbouring Eritrea.” The news was received with enthusiasm, but also some ambivalence. Abiy, a 43-year-old former intelligence officer, became the fourth prime minister of Ethiopia on April 2, 2018. He immediately launched a series of reforms that were not only unprecedented but which would have seemed impossible five years ago. His predecessor, Hailemariam Desalegn , governed Ethiopia with an iron fist, stifling free speech , sending opposition leaders and journalists to jail and violently suppressing political dissent. Ethnically-motivated conflicts are in Ethiopia, which has over groups. But the unrest and protests in Ethiopia’s two largest regions, Oromia and Amhara , sparked by encroachment on Oromia lands resulting from the expansion of the Amhara region, practically tore the Horn of African country apart from to early — and drove Desalegn to a “surprise” resignation in April 2018. Abiy contestedthe elections of the ruling Ethiopian People’s Revolutionary Democratic Front (EPRDF), winning to replace Desalegn as party chairman and, consequently, as prime minister of the country. 108 votes out of 180 An ethnic Oromo with a mixed Christian and Muslim background, along with military experience and expertise in military intelligence, Abiy was seen as a figure capable of easing the turmoil in the country. One Chatham House analyst writing about the elections his victory to the “secretive and complex alliance-building” among the four political parties that make up the EPRDF, and noted that he “seems early on to have persuaded many he can bring stability, unity and reform to the country.” In relatively short order, Abiy lifted the state of emergency the previous administration had imposed to quell unrest, and released thousands of political prisoners. The rapid turnaround of the political landscape paved the way for the unblocking of hundreds of websites and TV channels. Notably, Abiy amended that draconian tool of political repression, Ethiopia’s return of exiled dissidents and the anti-terrorism law . But his most outstanding achievement has been the historic peace deal with neighbouring Eritrea, which netted him the 2019 Nobel Peace Prize : Abiy Ahmed quickly worked out the principles of a peace agreement to end the long “no peace, no war” stalemate between the two countries. These principles are set out in the declarations that Prime Minister Abiy and President Afwerki signed in Asmara and Jeddah last July and September. An important premise for the breakthrough was Abiy Ahmed’s unconditional willingness to accept the arbitration ruling of an international boundary commission in 2002. But Abiy’s reforms have not proceeded without opposition. In June 2018, he survived that killed two other people during a political rally in the Tigray province. As Tanzanian MP January Makamba, one of Abiy’s generational peers, has noted in an otherwise laudatory an explosion tweet: “Ethiopia is a tough and complicated place.” Ethnic violence resulting in 2.9 million displacements in 2018 and a failed coup in the Amhara region last June are arguably two security threats capable of undermining the national elections scheduled for next year. In addition, Ethiopia still has the highest poverty prevalence rate in the world despite strong economic indices. Abiy’s “ liberal reformer “ image hinges on his ability to transform the Ethiopian economy. Ethiopia, under Abiy’s watch, also continues to shut down the internet amidst dynamics “ more complicated than they had been prior to the start of the political reforms.” A nationwide internet blackout occurred from June 11–14, during which SMS messaging services were also inaccessible. On September 26, Dr. Getahun Mekuria, Ethiopia’s Minister of Innovation and Technology, represented by State Minister of the Productivity Enhancement Sector Ato Jemal Beker, stated in his opening remarks at the Forum on Internet Freedom in Africa (FIFAfrica), that although the government has opened up digital space in the country, there remains “a strong need to temper internet freedom with mechanisms in place to control hate speech and mis- and disinformation online.” As the incident described at the beginning of this essay shows, Abiy’s ability to sustain freedom of expression and political dissent in this Horn of Africa nation hangs on a fragile thread. In spite of the problems that continue to plague Ethiopia, however, it is easy to see understand why Abiy has been welcomed as a breath of fresh air. In a continent ruled by elderly and sometimes ailing leaders, the dynamic 43-year-old represents a break from an old guard which, in many cases, has clung to power against all odds. Uganda’s 75-year-old President Yoweri Kaguta Museveni has held on to power since 1986, consistently shrinking the political space in the East African country by destroying any opposition to his rule. John Magufuli’s Tanzania is a practically a police state with the recent clampdown on opposition politics, human rights and press freedom. Nigeria’s Muhammadu Buhari, 76, also has scant regard for , or human rights , freedom of expression political dissent. But given the weakness of the competition, might it be rather too early to definitively sing Abiy’s praises? After awarding the 2009 Nobel Peace Prize to Barack Obama in the early days of his administration, one would have thought that the Nobel Committee would be more circumspect about awarding another fledgling sitting president. Obama, for instance, did not keep the peace in Libya; rather, he created a situation of that rages there until now. Other laureates have also failed to live up to their promise, notably Myanmar politician Aung San Suu Kyi, who won the prize in 1991 while under house arrest and has since, as de facto government leader of the country, presided over the ethnic cleansing of Rohingya Muslims. North Vietnamese leader Le Duc Tho famously rejected the award — jointly presented to him and the controversial Henry Kissinger in 1973 — on the grounds that peace had not yet been restored in his country. One assumes the Committee grants such awards in the anticipatory hope that it would encourage the laureate would to remain on a promising path of progress. But it would make more sense to wait until the end of an administration and objectively assess whether an individual has in fact lived up to their promise and really deserves the award. Another reason for caution is that most of the African leaders mentioned above did not start out as despots. Museveni fought and kicked out the murderous dictator Idi Amin. When Magufuli took the reins of power, he was the poster boy for transparency and frugal governance. Buhari’s integrity and apparent zero-tolerance for corruption made him the “Messiah” for which Nigeria long yearned. Even the late Robert Mugabe of Zimbabwe was once one of Africa’s foremost freedom fighters — only to leave office in disgrace after 37 tumultuous years. Critics also charisma to drive change,” rather than make use of institutional structures of government. While this might be efficient and useful for cutting through government bureaucracy, it might not provide an adequate foundation for sustainable long-term reforms. say that the PM “ relies on his Will Abiy be different from the others and continue on the path of peace and reform? Or will he follow the infamous route that his contemporaries in the continent have travelled? For both Ethiopia and Africa’s sake, I hope it is the former."
Medium.com,Society,Turkey and the Kurds: What goes around comes around,World,https://medium.com/the-turbulent-world-of-middle-east-soccer/turkey-and-the-kurds-what-goes-around-comes-around-364dd74bd040?source=topic_page---------315------------------1," By James M. Dorsey A podcast version of this story is available on Soundcloud, Itunes, Spotify, Stitcher, TuneIn, Spreaker, Pocket Casts, Tumblr, Podbean and Castbox. Turkey, like much of the Middle East, is discovering that what goes around comes around. Not only because President Recep Tayyip Erdogan appears to have miscalculated the fallout of what may prove to be a foolhardy intervention in Syria and neglected alternative options that could have strengthened Turkey’s position without sparking the ire of much of the international community. But also because what could prove to be a strategic error is rooted in a policy of decades of denial of Kurdish identity and suppression of Kurdish cultural and political rights that was more likely than not to fuel conflict rather than encourage societal cohesion. The policy midwifed the birth in the 1970s to militant groups like the Kurdish Workers Party (PKK), which only dropped its demand for Kurdish independence in recent years. The group that has waged a low intensity insurgency that has cost tens of thousands of lives has been declared a terrorist organization by Turkey, the United States and the European Union. Turkish refusal to acknowledge the rights of the Kurds, who are believed to account for up to 20 percent of the country’s population traces its roots to the carving of modern Turkey out of the ruins of the Ottoman empire by its visionary founder, Mustafa Kemal, widely known as Ataturk, Father of the Turks. It is entrenched in Mr. Kemal’s declaration in a speech in 1923 to celebrate Turkish independence of “how happy is the one who calls himself a Turk,” an effort to forge a national identity for country that was an ethnic mosaic. The phrase was incorporated half a century later in Turkey’s student oath and ultimately removed from it in 2013 at a time of peace talks between Turkey and the PKK by then prime minister, now president Erdogan. It took the influx of hundreds of thousands of Iraqi Kurds in the late 1980s and early 1990s as well as the 1991 declaration by the United States, Britain and France of a no-fly zone in northern Iraq that enabled the emergence of an autonomous Iraqi Kurdish region to spark debate in Turkey about the Kurdish question and prompt the government to refer to Kurds as Kurds rather than mountain Turks. Ironically, Turkey’s enduring refusal to acknowledge Kurdish rights and its long neglect of development of the pre-dominantly Kurdish southeast of the country fuelled demands for greater rights rather than majority support for Kurdish secession largely despite the emergence of the PKK Most Turkish Kurds, who could rise to the highest offices in the land s long as they identified as Turks rather than Kurds, resembled Palestinians with Israeli citizenship, whose options were more limited even if they endorsed the notion of a Jewish state. Nonetheless, both minorities favoured an independent state for their brethren on the other side of the border but did not want to surrender the opportunities that either Turkey or Israel offered them. The existence for close to three decades of a Kurdish regional government in northern Iraq and a 2017 referendum in which an overwhelming majority voted for Iraqi Kurdish independence, bitterly rejected and ultimately nullified by Iraqi, Turkish and Iranian opposition, did little to fundamentally change Turkish Kurdish attitudes. If the referendum briefly soured Turkish-Iraqi Kurdish relations, it failed to undermine the basic understanding underlying a relationship that could have guided Turkey’s approach towards the Kurds in Syria even if dealing with Iraqi Kurds may have been easier because, unlike Turkish Kurds, they had not engaged in political violence against Turkey. The notion that there was no alternative to the Turkish intervention in Syria is further countered by the fact that Turkish PKK negotiations that started in 2012 led a year later to a ceasefire and a boosting of efforts to secure a peaceful resolution. The talks prompted imprisoned PKK leader Abdullah Ocalan to publish a letter endorsing the ceasefire, the disarmament and withdrawal from Turkey of PKK fighters, and a call for an end to the insurgency. Mr. Ocalan predicted that 2013 would be the year in which the Turkish Kurdish issues would be resolved peacefully. The PKK’s military leader, Cemil Bayik, told the BBC three years later that “we don’t want to separate from Turkey and set up a state. We want to live within the borders of Turkey on our own land freely.” The talks broke down in 2015 against the backdrop of the Syrian war and the rise as a US ally of the United States in the fight against the Islamic State of the PKK’s Syrian affiliate, the People’s Protection Units (YPG). Bitterly opposed to the US-YPG alliance, Turkey demanded that the PKK halt its resumption of attacks on Turkish targets and disarm prior to further negotiations. Turkey responded to the breakdown and resumption of violence with a brutal crackdown in the southeast of the country and on the pro-Kurdish Peoples’ Democratic Party (HDP). Nonetheless, in a statement issued from prison earlier this year that envisioned an understanding between Turkey and Syrian Kurdish forces believed to be aligned with the PKK, Mr. Ocalan declared that “we believe, with regard to the Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF), the problems in Syria should be resolved within the framework of the unity of Syria, based on constitutional guarantees and local democratic perspectives. In this regard, it should be sensitive to Turkey’s concerns.” Turkey’s emergence as one of Iraqi Kurdistan’s foremost investors and trading partners in exchange for Iraqi Kurdish acquiescence in Turkish countering the PKK’s presence in the region could have provided inspiration for a US-sponsored safe zone in northern Syria that Washington and Ankara had contemplated. The Turkish-Iraqi Kurdish understanding enabled Turkey to allow an armed Iraqi Kurdish force to transit Turkish territory in 2014 to help prevent the Islamic State from conquering the Syrian city of Kobani. A safe zone would have helped “realign the relationship between Turkey’s Kurdistan Workers Party (PKK) and its Syrian offshoot… The safe-zone arrangements… envision(ed) drawing down the YPG presence along the border — a good starting point for reining in the PKK, improving U.S. ties with Ankara, and avoiding a potentially destructive Turkish intervention in Syria,” Turkey scholar Sonar Cagaptay suggested in August. The opportunity that could have created the beginnings of a sustainable solution that would have benefitted Turkey as well as the Kurds fell by the wayside with Mr. Trump’s decision to withdraw US troops from northern Syria. In many ways, Mr. Erdogan’s decision to opt for a military solution fits the mould of a critical mass of world leaders who look at the world through a civilizational prism and often view national borders in relative terms. Russian leader Vladimir Putin pointed the way with his 2008 intervention in Georgia and the annexation in 2014 of Crimea as well as Russia’s stirring of pro-Russian insurgencies in two regions of Ukraine. Mr. Erdogan appears to believe that if Mr. Putin can pull it off, so can he. Dr. James M. Dorsey is a senior fellow at Nanyang Technological University’s S.

That thing probably should have been helping others. Instead I have been laser focused on becoming a member of the elite. When I was seven, my parents took me from our suburban New Jersey town to a French restaurant in Manhattan, where they tried to dissuade me from ordering escargot by telling me that escargot are snails. It was a good strategy, but it didn’t work. I suffered through those gastropods, and then I suffered through homework and extracurriculars to get into a college with brand recognition. I got into Stanford, where I finally saw the elite in person. But I didn’t get to experience being an elite until the summer I interned in Manhattan at Newsweek magazine. Editors handed me stray invites: a press pass to the Democratic convention, a movie screening of Glengarry Glen Ross, a book party at a drag queen–filled nightclub in a former church. I went back to college knowing that if I could once again score invitations to these events, my life would be bigger, my curiosity more sated, my passed plates of hors d’oeuvres more free. I called this world where influential people congregated the Loop, and I vowed to get in. After graduating, I landed an interview with Martha Stewart to write for her first TV show. Before we ordered lunch at an expensive Italian restaurant in Westport, Connecticut, she asked if I wanted San Pellegrino. I told her that I didn’t know what San Pellegrino was. She laughed. I told her that I really didn’t know what San Pellegrino was. She laughed again. This went on for longer than you would think, with me wondering if San Pellegrino was pasta, wine, or some kind of birdbath made from Popsicle sticks. She ordered San Pellegrino from the waiter, and a few minutes later, I discovered that it is a sparkling water from Italy that was a little disappointing after all that buildup. In the year that I worked for her, I learned that the walls of the Loop were thick, and the semiotics of the club members consisted of words like semiotics. The Loop had its own jargon that included carpaccio, DUMBO, omakase, St. Barths, decanter, Birkin bag, oolong, Fresh Air, Pilates, Uffizi, McKinsey & Company, Philippe Starck, Hampton Jitney, Talk of the Town, lawyered up, and San Pellegrino. I tried my best to learn them. The Loop offers adventure, challenges, new perspectives, and significant financial savings if you nab enough passed appetizers to skip dinner. After two years of low-level magazine fact-checking jobs, I was hired as an editor for a new magazine called Time Out New York. It was enough to get me on the fringes of the Loop, and I grabbed on. I turned no entrance to the Loop down, going to movie premieres, Rangers playoff games, restaurant openings, and dance performances, even though I do not like dance performances. I called this velvet-roped life the Loop because I had not yet read the 1944 Memorial Lecture given by C. S. Lewis at King’s College London in which he dubbed it “the Ring.” A Christian apologetic, chair of Medieval and Renaissance Literature at Cambridge, and author of The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe, Lewis was less shallow than I was: Has the desire to be [inside the Ring] ever prompted you to any act or word on which, in the cold small hours of a wakeful night, you can look back with satisfaction? If so your case is more fortunate than most. . . The quest of the Inner Ring will break your hearts unless you break it. I don’t understand how Lewis could think this. Avoiding the Loop is the equivalent of telling those kids not to walk through the wardrobe. The Loop offers adventure, challenges, new perspectives, and significant financial savings if you nab enough passed appetizers to skip dinner. Nearly all the fascinating people I’ve met, the places I’ve visited, and the money I have came from getting on the right side of that invisible line. If I had the choice between getting in the Loop and writing those six boring Narnia books after The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe, I’d totally take the Loop. The closest I come to the center of the Loop is when I go to elite conferences. There are so many of these that a member of the elite could sell their home and live in conference hotels, flying from Davos to TED to the Aspen Ideas Festival to Bilderberg to Sun Valley, like a Deadhead who replaced Jerry Garcia with Eric Schmidt. If you want to judge the utility and the morality of elites, you have to come to an elite conference and observe them in their natural habitat. I have never turned an invitation to an elite conference down. I’ve been to Reboot, where about 60 Jews are given a free three-day trip to the Stein Eriksen resort near Salt Lake City to discuss how to reinvent Judaism and briefly double the number of Jews in Utah. I took a free trip to Newcastle for the British American Project, which tries to get Americans and Brits to overcome their vast differences and has many important members such as the Baron Mandelson, the Baron Robertson of Port Ellen, the Baroness Symons, the Baroness Scotland, and a woman who ran a brothel in Portugal she inherited from her father. I went to the Influencers Dinner, at which a dozen people keep their names and jobs secret until the end of the evening, at which point everyone relaxes because they’re no longer wondering if they were wasting their time talking to someone. This dinner led to an invitation to the Rising Glen Collective, which was described as “TED meets pool party.” I went to the Summit, a conference of 3,500 mostly under-40 elites that has become so popular that the organization purchased the largest ski resort in America and is turning it into a members-only, 500-home town in Utah. At the Aspen Institute, I tossed my return-flight ticket after scoring a ride home in a billionaire’s private jet. At a panel called “Membership Has Its Privileges” at the Vanity Fair New Establishment Summit, I heard the moderator tell the CEOs of the Soho House, the dating site Raya, and the women’s co-working space The Wing, “What you do well and I encourage you to do more is defend your exclusivity.” I took the stage at TEDx Stanford after a woman spoke about inventing a hand-cranked phototherapy machine to save jaundiced babies in third-world rural communities without hospitals. I began my speech with the sentence “This is my son’s penis.” Elites are true believers in diversity. Even people who approve of elites, such as my lovely wife Cassandra, are repulsed by elite conferences, the way that bird-watchers would get freaked out if 150 gulls landed in their backyard and all squawked at once about how happiness improves productivity. Elite conferences take place at luxury hotels in cool places that we never get to see because we’re in meetings. Cassandra cannot believe anyone would choose to spend their vacation going to meetings. Meetings are something people complain about even when they’re getting paid to go to them. Most of these people at these conferences have the money to do whatever they want over their vacations — ski the Alps, scuba in the Maldives, come to these same luxury resorts and not sit in windowless conference rooms. What Cassandra doesn’t understand is how much elites love a meeting. Our instinctual response to any problem is a cheery, “Let’s schedule a meeting!” We have work meetings, family meetings, and board meetings. When two of us get together to eat before 11:00 a.m., we call it a breakfast meeting. My favorite thing about an elite conference is the name tags. When you have thousands of loose connections, greetings are stressful. Which is why every elite conference requires participants to wear name tags the entire time. I wish everyone wore name tags all the time. Names are unmemorable, meaningless sounds assigned before birth. I can’t remember the names of cars, and experts are paid to come up with the perfect phonemes to evoke each model. Yet if I say, “Is that an Elantra?” no one yells, “You’ve met my car three times! It’s Altima!” Thanks to the name tags, I’m always reminded that I already know a fair number of people at these conferences, partly because some of them went to Stanford with me. Despite our championing for diversity, it’s rare to find an elite who didn’t attend a top-ranked university. Our success is largely based on who we were before we turned 18. If dating worked the same way, nearly every member of the elite would still be single. While most of the attendees at elite conferences have attended exclusive colleges, we are not all rich. Money is not a primary motivation for the elite. We are far more into impressing each other than into making money. The elite dream is not to own a yacht but to give a TED talk. Most rich people are not elite. They live far from the nation’s cultural centers and run boring businesses. One rich guy I met owned a bunch of truck stop motels in Texas, another made a part for gas pumps, and a third owned a lot of Arby’s in Omaha. You could own all the Arby’s in Omaha and you’d never be elite, unless you were already Warren Buffett, smoked weed, and got the munchies so bad that you bought all the local Arby’s. Donald Trump is a billionaire and was never invited to Davos until he became president. Though he went to the University of Pennsylvania and donated enough to politicians to attend social functions in New York, including Chelsea Clinton’s wedding, it was his singular focus on making money no matter how crass the venture that kept him outside the elite. If I were the 703rd richest person in the world, I’d constantly call up the 704th person and offering him wads of cash to drink a jar of pickle juice. Half of the attendees at elite conferences aren’t rich. They’re academics, journalists, artists, government employees, politicians, and people who work at charities, a word we find so distastefully unimportant sounding we call them “nongovernmental organizations.” There’s a priest at one conference I go to who has taken a vow of poverty. I don’t know what kind of workaround he’s devised for staying at a $300-a-night oceanfront resort, but I assume he dutifully removes his mattresses and sleeps directly on the box spring. The richest attendee at any of the conferences I go to is Silicon Valley venture capitalist and LinkedIn co-founder Reid Hoffman, a multibillionaire who, according to Forbes, is the 703rd wealthiest person on earth, but he doesn’t care much about money. He’s driven the same Audi for nearly 10 years, lived in the same four-bedroom house, and taken the Giving Pledge created by Warren Buffett and Bill Gates to donate half his money to charity. If I were the 703rd richest person in the world, I’d have way more fun with my fortune, constantly calling up the 704th person and offering him wads of cash to drink a jar of pickle juice. Making money wasn’t Reid’s goal. He planned on becoming a professor, studying philosophy at Oxford on a Marshall scholarship. He got rich by being really smart and being at Stanford at the perfect time. Which was the same time as me. So mostly the smart thing. Far more than money, Reid loves an elite conference. He goes to about a dozen every year and has even co-founded one. Which has helped establish him as an elite connector of the elite; the headline of the New Yorker profile of him is “The Network Man.” Reid is so elite that he is one of about a hundred non-Brits in history to be named an Honorary Commander of the Most Excellent Order of the British Empire, which gives him the power to approach Turkish businesswoman Suzan Sabanci Dinçer at any party and say, “Hey, I think we’re both Honorary Commanders of the Most Excellent Order of the British Empire.” Reid has believed in networking since he was 13. Upset with all the suffering in the world, he got each of his friends to agree to attain a different leadership position. One would be president, one would be CEO of IBM, and he’d be director of the CIA. Then they’d use their mutual trust to create a better, kinder structure for the planet. Reid’s philosophy is summed up by a map on his office wall. It’s not a map free of nations or physical distance. It’s a map of relationships. It has a dot in the center, with Reid’s name next to it. Thousands of lines radiate out from it to dots representing all the people he’s connected to via LinkedIn, and each of their dots connects to their connections. His dot is the densest, like a universe in the midst of creating itself. He’s the equivalent of the guy in your town who has a guy for everything: a hubcap guy, a football-tickets guy, a Cuban-cigar guy. Only Reid has a United-Nations-secretary-general guy, a former-president guy, a senator guy, and a CEO-of-Facebook guy. The map is the nerd equivalent of a wall of framed photographs of him with famous people. But it communicates Reid’s guiding thesis that people need to make personal appeals in order to accomplish anything. And personal appeals work better when you’re at a luxury hotel providing free alcohol where you don’t have to remember anyone’s name. You don’t even have to remember the hotel name. You just call it The Loop."

Medium.com,Society,How education is empowering the next generation in rural Kenya,World,https://medium.com/@craig.kielburger/how-education-is-empowering-the-next-generation-in-rural-kenya-1d5c8325623c?source=topic_page---------319------------------1," Together with Dr. Jonathan White, Chair of our US Board of Directors, I recently visited the inspiring students of the Kisaruni Group of Schools and WE College. Here is an incredible thought: many of the students at WE College started 1st Grade at a WE primary school in Kenya. Those students from multiple villages across the region started their primary education within our four walls, learned from the teachers who participated in our professional development training programs, grew-up eating the mid-day lunches provided, carried clear water back home from the school water dispensaries, studied agriculture in the school gardens to learn how their families could increase their crop yields, and sought medical care from the mobile medical units (and now hospitals) in the region. Over the years, those students thrived, reached the improbable milestone of attending Kisaruni high school, and today, they are pursuing their dreams of college education. What does this tell you? Well, for starters, we’re getting old! And more seriously, the 5-pillar development model transforms lives. We’ve exited out of supporting the core five pillars in many of the early Kenyan communities. Yet, the sustainable model continues to bring forth young primary school graduates, dreaming of Kisaruni and beyond, ready to improve their own lives and their community. For example, let me introduce you to Dennis Kigen. Dennis originally comes from a Kipsigis community, where he was raised along with his five siblings by a single mother. “It was difficult for my family,” he says. His mother is a small-scale farmer and it’s not always been easy to put food on the table for her six children. After spending 8-years at our WE Primary School in Enelerai, he was determined to earn acceptance to our Kisaruni Group of Schools, boys campus. Dennis feels a responsibility to help his mother support his siblings, and he knows that an education is the way to forever lift his family out of poverty. For extra motivation, he said that as a young boy he visited the Kisaruni campus countless times, just to imagine himself someday as a student at the high school. He never gave up, and his dedication was rewarded when he was admitted to a Kisaruni Boys school as a 9th grader at the beginning of 2019. In his first 6-months at Kisaruni, Dennis has excelled, to say the least. “There are two Kisaruni philosophies that are close to my heart,” he says. “Promoting Leadership and Encouraging Active Learning.” He embodies both values especially in his role on the student council, where he proudly represents his fellow students. As a 9th grader, his potential is truly limitless. Dennis told us that from his high school window, he can catch a glimpse of the WE College. His newest dream? To be the first in his family to attend."
Medium.com,Society,The Call for Prayer was never an Issue Before Gentrification,World,https://medium.com/@sanja.sv/the-call-for-prayer-was-never-an-issue-before-gentrification-fdae8adbe0aa?source=topic_page---------320------------------1," The light blue colour of the house represents exactly what you find inside the solid walls; freedom, imagination, wisdom, and loyalty. Standing in front of it makes you feel welcome. The palm tree in front of the house is more than 50 years old. The blue stairs next to the silent tree will lead you right up to the entrance where you’ll already have your senses aroused by spices from a delightful meal being cooked and the warm solid voice from a woman. When turning around you’ll look over Nelson Mandela Boulevard and enjoy the view of upper Woodstock. The scenery reaches towards the centre of Cape Town. The house is over 100 years old and the lovely family living inside these walls have lived here for 16 years. “Walmer Estate has changed a lot since I moved in, in 2002. Property prices have dramatically increased and more white people have moved into the area. There is a great blend of community spirit and the middle class. Some would say that Walmer Estate has been “gentrified” and that this gentrification process has caused the price spike in this area coupled with the great location with views of mountains, sea, and city.” Naz told me, who is the woman living on Bridge Street with her son Sufyaan who is now 16-years-old. Naz lived her younger life in London with her mum but moved back to Cape Town to be with her family who lives in the same area. Walmer Estate is a part of the Former District Six area in the province of Western Cape in Cape Town. Before apartheid District six was an impoverished but lively community, predominantly coloured people. Some of Walmer Estate’s residents were upper class ‘Coloureds’ (lighter skin colour, mostly described as coloured). The area also goes under the name Bishopscourt, or the “Black Sea Point”. It was once known as the soul of Cape Town because it harboured a rich cultural life in its narrow alleys and crowded tenements. The area used to be dominated by Afrikaans but over the recent years due to gentrification Walmer Estate alongside other provinces in Cape Town has dramatically changed. Bo-Kaap is one of the areas in Cape Town that suffer a lot from gentrification at the moment. Bo-Kaap was formerly known as the Malay Quarter when it was home for Cape Town’s Muslims. Most Europeans would know the area from the pictures of the coloured houses. It is one of the areas that wasn’t taken apart by apartheid. You’ll find more than 9 mosques in the area Bo-Kaap wherein one of them the Auwal Mosque in Dorp Street was the first mosque ever built in Cape Town. It is now more than 300 years old. Recently a lot of demonstrations have taken place against the gentrification. The community in Bo-Kaap, citizens from Cape Town with all different believes and religions would gather together in Bo-Kaap to demonstrate against the gentrification. It was announced some years back that the city of Cape Town Municipality has to declare this area a National Heritage site. However, the city has been very negligent in that they have not yet done so, hence, the area is not protected from shark developers (Blok Developments are currently fighting with the Bo-Kaap Civic and Ratepayers Association who are opposing the construction of a 12 story apartment block on Lion Street). “Developers have invaded Bo-Kaap. There are so many commercial sites there and now the rates have gone sky-high and people cannot afford to live there any longer. Bo-Kaap residents are suffering as a result and they have been living there for many generations. The gentrification of Bo-Kaap is very controversial because it is being overrun by tourists since it is the first settlement of the Muslims over 300 years ago and has a lot of history attached to it since slavery.” Naz explained. Furthermore, the tourism in Bo-Kaap has heightened and the tour buses are all over the place, tourists are walking around the area taking pictures of people’s homes. The negative effect to this (amongst other things) is that the criminals are aware of the presence of the tourists and therefor more crime and robberies is taken place in the area. Due to statistics from Crime Stats SA, Common Robberies in Cape Town Central have raised from 818 reports in 2012 to 1179 in 2018. Contact-related crimes (arson crimes involving burnings of cars and properties) were down to 3 in 2012 and rose to 11 reported crimes in 2018. “The sad thing is that developers want to create a commercial hub in the prime area of Cape Town city bowl and there is a very real danger that the magic and essence of Bo-Kaap will be lost. The white people in Bo-Kaap are already complaining about the call to prayer from the Mosques. There are a few mosques in that area and the call to prayer was never a problem until they moved in. “This is truly a travesty. The majority of residents in Bo-Kaap are Cape Malay. The City of Cape Town has now been given a certain amount of days to declare it a heritage site and get the job done and protect Bo-Kaap.” Naz tells me. Walmer Estate is one of the safer areas in Cape Town and does not suffer as much as Bo-Kaap. “The safety in the area is not too bad. The stronger a community is the safer it is because people are looking out for each other. Generally, people are proactive about dodgy looking characters and we don’t have many incidences of crime in Walmer Estate. Woodstock, further down, has more crime like car break-ins and house break-ins, etc.). We also have a designated police van or two in our area — they circle the area day and night. I feel safe walking in my area.” Said Naz. She explained to me later that she is worried about the future for Bo-Kaap. Directing your way from Walmer Estate towards the city centre you’ll pass the District Six area. The area looks empty and deserted. The upheaval about development here has not been fast enough and people have been waiting since 1994, some even died waiting. “Development has been sluggish but there are lots of plans in the pipeline for lower cost housing development so that we may reduce spatial apartheid.” Said Naz. District Six is finally in the process of development and many apartments have been granted to people and their families who were previously displaced. R2 billion (£107004429,68) has just been allocated in the new budget for new housing developments in and around the city and supposedly some of this will be allocated towards the District Six development. “I hope it will be a thriving community and not another ghetto in the future.” Said Naz. Manoeuvring your way through District Six watching the area that has been taken apart during apartheid, you’ll find the area looking quite vacant. People without a houses are lying around in the shade of the trees, garbage everywhere around them and yet so beautiful. The smiles on their faces, while they are surrounded with all the little they own. The endless tops of trees reaching towards the city, moving lazily in the wind. Brought to mind is the feeling of a calm, primitive paradise. The twisted misunderstanding of the lives these people are living and the majestic staircases on villas and hotels and the false freshness of the smooth milky, white houses. The feeling. The feeling you’ll get from this area full of history, trauma, and love brings a weird type of nostalgia to your mind."
Medium.com,Society,Asian Markets: Behind The Hong Kong Riots,World,https://medium.com/@harryb16725/asian-markets-behind-the-hong-kong-riots-a06d88c9d742?source=topic_page---------321------------------1," Protests. Violence. Revolution? The riots in Hong Kong are becoming increasingly disruptive, but how has it got to this stage? And what’s fuelling the fire? Hong Kong, the semi-autonomous gateway to mainland China, is one of the worlds key international and commercial hubs. However, recent events are putting this status under pressure… Beijing is calling this Hong Kong’s worse crisis since the 1997 hand-over. Protesters are flooding the streets, following a series of events that have continued to exacerbate pre-existing tensions. Carrie Lam’s extradition bill was seemingly the “straw that broke the camel’s back”, as the common idiom goes. But how have we got here? The story so far… Back in 1842, China ceded the island of Hong Kong to Britain, post the First Opium War. Addiction-driven tensions stewed between the two countries over the substance for some time. Following a series of wars fought over British trade in tea and opium, China proceeded to lease Hong Kong and the new island territories to Britain for a total of 99 years in 1898. This is how Britain originally claimed control. Fast forward to 1984 — the year of the joint declaration. Upon approaching the hand over date in 1997, China and Britain signed a preliminary declaration which outlined the conditions under which Hong Kong would return to Chinese rule. This was where “One Country, Two Systems” was born. Hong Kong would become part of one communist-led country, but continue to retain its capitalist economic system and partially democratic political system, for a total of 50 years following the hand over. The partial nature of this ‘democracy’ is still causing issues today. Trouble started to brew over the years following the joint declaration. In 1989, a large group of pro-democracy activists took to the streets in Tienanmen Square in what has been described as the greatest challenge to the communist state in China since the 1949 revolution. Demonstrators occupied the square for seven weeks, refusing to leave until their demands for democratic reforms were met. Distressingly, what followed was an outright massacre. Several hundred civilians were shot dead by the Chinese army, who had persistently warned throughout the day that they would do whatever it takes to clamp down on this so-called “social chaos”. The inhumanity behind their actions sent shock-waves around the world. In 1990, Beijing formally validated Hong Kong’s post-handover mini-constitution, or Basic Law. This legislation sated that “universal suffrage” is the ultimate aim for Hong Kong. Formally, universal suffrage permits the right of almost all adults to vote in political elections. However, the democratic nature of this reform has proved difficult to achieve. Two years on, and the last British governor of Hong Kong — Chris Patten — announced proposals for democratic reforms amongst Hong Kong’s institutions. This was primarily aimed at broadening the voting base in elections. However, after feeling as if they hadn’t been properly consulted, China were outraged. So much so, they said they would revoke the reforms immediately upon the transfer of power. This was not the first nor last blow to pro-democracy movements. Democratic measures were continually shunned from an early stage. And it didn’t stop here. The next event of importance came in the early 2000's, and was related to Article 23 in the Basic Law. This section of the legislation stated that the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region: “shall enact laws on its own to prohibit any act of treason, secession, sedition, subversion against the Central People’s Government, or theft of state secrets, to prohibit foreign political organisations or bodies from conducting political activities in the Region, and to prohibit political organisations or bodies of the Region from establishing ties with foreign political organisations or bodies.” On September 24th, 2002, the government of Hong Kong published a discussion document which included a suggestion to implement Article 23. They further introduced a national security bill to the legislative council in 2003. These jointly sparked major concern throughout Hong Kong, with the pro-democracy politicians seeing this as a threat to civil liberties. There were intense debates over the potential impact on human rights and freedom of expression. If implemented, it would have become a punishable act to resist the central government in its exercise of sovereignty over any part of the country. Following a mass demonstration by the residents of Hong Kong in 2003, the government proceeded to withdraw and shelve the proposed bill. It is believed that more than 500,000 people turned out to march for their rights. As the years passed, tensions continued to rise, as did Hong Kong’s determination to achieve universal suffrage. Protests in Hong Kong remained persistent. Two of the most notable, pre 2014, include the 2010 anti-express rail movement and the 2012 anti-national education movement. However, 2014 saw the emergence of the historic Umbrella Revolution, which was initially sparked by demands for reform amongst the Hong Kong electoral system. To give some context, proposals were issued by Beijing to install universal suffrage within the Hong Kong territory. These reforms would grant residents the right to participate in elections for the city’s Chief Executive. Sounds all well and good, right? Well, there was a caveat. This caveat restricted voters in limiting their choice of potential leader. How? It only allowed them to choose from a list of pre-vetted candidates who were originally selected by a 1,200 member panel, most of which are supporters of Beijing. These proposals were unsurprisingly rejected by protesters, who again voiced out for a ‘genuine democracy’. A total of 792,808 voters took part in an unofficial referendum on the matter, with around 42% backing the public acting as a nominating committee with political parties naming candidates for the job. The Umbrella Revolution initially floated as an “Occupy Central with Love and Peace” disobedience initiative, which was coined by Benny Tai Yiu-Ting on September 28th. The aim was to organise ‘deliberation days’ for members of the public, providing a platform to discuss ways to spur reform. However, following the rigid framework announcements on August 31st, peaceful sit-in protests quickly transformed into raids of government headquarters. This resulted in the prosecution and jailing of several hundreds of students. Protests continued, calling for the release of the participants involved in the government headquarter breach. Police resorted to the use of tear gas and pepper spray to remove protesters from a busy major road, with participants proceeding to use their umbrella’s as shields. As such, the movements title was established. As you’ll know, protests have began to escalate again in recent months. What’s spurred their sudden re-emergence? The extradition bill In recent months, law-makers and citizens have been at conflict over the proposed amendments to Hong Kong’s extradition legislation. The country currently has bilateral extradition treaties with 20 countries, including the U.K., U.S. and Singapore. However, the alterations put forward would have allowed the extradition of suspected offenders to places by which no formal agreement exists. This includes the likes of China and Taiwan. The Beijing-backed Chief Executive, Carrie Lam, pointed to the case of a Hong Kong resident wanted in Taiwan for allegedly murdering his girlfriend in order to fast track this bill. Essentially, there existed no formal avenue for the resident to return to Taiwan to face trial. Mrs Lam justified her reasoning for the new amendments, supporting the ideology that no country wants to become a safe haven for offenders. The bill sparked chaos in Hong Kong, and riots have persisted ever since. Critics believed Hong Kong’s autonomy was being compromised. The new measures would have subjected residents to possible arbitrary detention or unfair trials in courts controlled by the communist party. Further, Hong Kong courts would have been left flat-footed in their ability to reject extradition requests. Director of the human rights group Amnesty International Hong Kong, MK Tam, said: “The courts will have very little power to reject any extradition requests.” In June, more serious conflicts began to arise. Police violence and brutality began to escalate on the 12th June, following the firing of “non-lethal projectiles” towards protesters. Come July 1st, protesters stormed into the legislative chamber itself, shattering glass doors and tearing down a metal wall that was part of the facade. Subsequently, the police had to intervene, using an “appropriate level” of force to remove the angered protesters. In the weeks following, Mrs Lam realised she was fighting a losing battle and formally announced the suspension of the bill, but fell short of fully withdrawing it. Following continued violence and dismay in Hong Kong, Carrie Lam officially withdrew the bill two and a half months later, on September 4th. So, the bill was suppressed and shelved. But why are riots continuing to remain in full force? The remaining protester demands Protesters are still unsettled. The demands of the rioters weren’t solely focused around the extradition bill. In fact, this was only one of five demands. The next three demands are all linked with the recent conflicts between the police and protesters. These are as follows: So, that leaves the final demand. Universal suffrage. This is now the ultimate goal, and has been for some time. Residents want their voting rights. They want to be able to elect their chief executive and law makers without interference from Beijing. However, the realistic nature of this demand diminishes by the day. This brings us to today. So, are the riots having adverse effects on Hong Kong’s economy? Unsurprisingly — the answer is yes. Economic impacts Many businesses in central Hong Kong have been forced to close, due to the manifestation of unsafe conditions. Executives from a select amount of Hong Kong’s most important companies have already raised alarms over the risks posed to future earnings. Foreign direct investment (FDI) reached all time highs in 2018, but investors may be looking to remove their capital, should tensions continually escalate. Ratings agencies also haven’t taken kindly to the troubled conditions being created. Fitch recently downgraded Hong Kong for the first time since 1995, amidst all the turmoil. This will have been primarily driven by reputational risk, as opposed to a reduction in credit potential. Moody’s also lowered their outlook for the territory in response to the negative sentiment. It’s clear Hong Kong’s small businesses are in need of support. Its status as a shopping hub has been slammed following drastic declines in Tourism. Bloomberg statistics reveal that visits from mainland China dropped 42% in the month of August. Data released in late October further added woes, showing a year-on-year decline in the value of retail sales by a staggering 23%. Large, luxury businesses are also feeling the heat. Many brands are beginning to re-examine their presence in the city. Moving on, it’s also apparent that some firms are feeling the bite of this economic dismay more than others. Two firms in particular include Cathay Pacific Airlines and the MTR Corporation. Addressing the former, Cathay Pacific Airlines are crippling under the tourism drought into Hong Kong. Passenger traffic has fallen by the most in a decade, adversely affecting the firms main revenue source. Statistically, passenger traffic was 11% lower in August in comparison to the previous year. Such falls haven’t been seen since 2009. Further, the airline faced heavy backlash from China due to its employees participating in the protests. China threatened to block the firm from its airspace if they failed to comply with the aviation authorities recent regulatory demands. Fortunately, recent news has reported the firms successful compliance, providing much needed relief for the airline. Now addressing the latter, the subway operator MTR Corp have faced some of the worst consequences in comparison to other developers. Stations have turned into battlefields, causing significant disruptions and destruction to the train facilities. The firm is also facing criticism from Chinese state media for running additional train services, which are said to be catering to the rioters. These are just two of the many causalities from the instability caused by the protests. The Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) has already stepped in to try contain the potentially imminent recession that Hong Kong faces. They have recently reduced the amount of capital that lenders have to maintain from 2.5 to 2 percent. This so-called counter-cyclical capital buffer reduction is aimed at easing the lending to small and medium sized enterprises, in the hope of softening the damages already caused. Hong Kong will be one to watch closely for investors in the coming months. Bloomberg produced a great report on the conflicts in Hong Kong, conversing with some of the most influential names involved in the situation. Have a watch if you’re interested in finding out more.

Medium.com,Society,Turkey under Erdogan: Caught between secular and Islamic identities,World,https://medium.com/@cswforbinfull/turkey-under-erdogan-caught-between-secular-and-islamic-identities-b93f1424c026?source=topic_page---------322------------------1," Although Turkey’s constitution defines the country as a secular state, it is caught between its secular and Islamic identities. The current government has publicly endorsed a move towards a Sunni Muslim identity for the country, conflating religious and national identities, by combining the religious nationalism propagated by the ruling Justice and Development Party (Adalet ve Kalkinma Partisi, or AKP) with the secular Nationalist Movement Party (Milliyetçi Hareket Partisi, or MHP)’s ideology of ‘ultra-nationalism,’ which is defined as “extreme nationalism that promotes the interests of one state or people above all others.” The promotion of religious ultra-nationalism in Turkey has contributed to a rise in discrimination, and in hate speech that incites violence against those who do not adhere to Sunni Islam. Such incitement is visible in a variety of areas ranging from education and employment, to religious practices and day-to-day administrative procedures. There has also been a surge in the expression of anti-Semitism and anti-Christian sentiments in pro-government media. Consequently, Turkish religious minorities are increasingly vulnerable to restrictive government legislation and growing social hostilities. The state has used a variety of means to propagate the view among wider society that to be Turkish is to be Sunni Muslim. The implicit suggestion is that religious minorities, or the non-religious, are not truly Turkish. Turkey’s Directorate of Religious Affairs, known as the Diyanet, is charged with exercising its duties “in accordance with secularism, removed from all political views and ideas;” however, this does not happen in practice. Since coming to power, the AKP has made significant changes to both the staff and the theological positions of the Diyanet to reflect a more decidedly Sunni Islamist position. One minority representative described the Diyanet to CSW as a “Sunni-Hanafi missionary organisation.” In a speech on 25 April 2015 defending the Diyanet and criticising calls for its closure from opposition parties, President Erdogan said, “The religion of this nation is clear…this nation will not let you shut down the Diyanet. We are going to protect the Diyanet and all other moral values of this nation.” When the AKP came to power in November 2002, Recep Tayyip Erdogan was not allowed to hold a government office, due to a 1998 conviction for inciting hatred for which he was sentenced to ten months imprisonment. Erdogan had recited an ultra-nationalistic Islamist poem at a public rally in support of the Welfare Party, an Islamist party banned in 1998. The poem said: “The mosques are our barracks, the domes our helmets, the minarets our bayonets and the faithful our soldiers…” He was released after four months. In 2018, Erdogan was re-elected as president with 53% of the vote. Many analysts believe that an alliance between the MHP and the AKP helped Erdogan to win. The MHP party slogan perfectly illustrates the relationship between ultra-nationalism and Islamism in Turkey: “Our bodies are Turkish, our souls Islamic. A body without a soul is a corpse.” Experts predict that this alliance has far-reaching consequences for Turkish politics. Burak Kadercan, Associate Professor of Strategy and Policy at the United States Naval War College, foresees it having a negative national impact on attempts at “solving Turkey’s longstanding problems relating to its ethnic Kurdish minority, with whom nationalists have always been unwilling to compromise.” He also predicts an international impact, both in Syria and in Turkey’s relations with the United States, which has lent support to Kurdish-dominated Syrian groups that control large swathes of territory near the Turkish border, and are viewed by the Turkish government extensions of the Kurdistan Workers Party (Partiya Karkerên Kurdistanê, or PKK), a militant far-left organisation. One of the most dangerous consequences is the creation of an environment in which national and religious extremism can breed. It provides an ideal tool for extremists, who can justify violence and intimidation against those who disagree with them in the name of ‘God’ or ‘the nation.’ When a hardline nationalist government declares itself religious, any legitimate criticism or opposition could automatically be labelled not only as ‘treacherous,’ but also as ‘blasphemous.’ Narratives of ultra-nationalism are divisive, and when combined with religious bigotry they become rather dangerous. This is best demonstrated in the case of Pastor Andrew Brunson, who spent more than two years in detention on fabricated espionage and terrorism charges. Pastor Brunson was arrested in October 2016 and accused of plotting to overthrow the government. The charges included supporting the outlawed Kurdistan Workers’ Party as well as the Gulen Movement, which Turkey accuses of orchestrating the coup attempt in 2016. On 12 October 2018, Pastor Brunson was released after four witnesses changed their testimonies unexpectedly, denying any knowledge of Pastor Brunson’s links to the PKK or Gulen Movement. According to Aykan Erdemir, a former member of the Turkish Parliament, one of the witnesses claimed they had read the allegations in the news; another said that he was misunderstood by the judge, and two claimed that they first heard of the allegations from one another. Mr Erdemir called the case “a travesty of justice,” arguing that Pastor Brunson was framed as part of a well-orchestrated plot involving false testimonies in order to be used as a bargaining chip as part of President Erdogan’s ‘ Hostage Diplomacy.’ Middle East Concern reported an increase in provocative and offensive articles in pro-government media following Pastor Brunson’s case, in which Christians were accused of a variety of malpractices, including working against the Turkish state and receiving funds from foreign countries. Accusations have been made against Turkish Christian converts and expatriate Christians resident in Turkey, with the clear intention of inciting broader societal hostility towards Christians. In some instances, false allegations have explicitly attempted to associate Christians with Andrew Brunson. A lawyer representing one group of Christians appealed to the public prosecutor to order the removal of offensive articles from online media, but no action was taken. Protestant churches have been particularly targeted by the press, perceived as anti-Turkish and pro-US. Many local newspapers have published hostile articles, leading to physical attacks on Christians and threats against churches on social media. In September 2018 Adnan Cavusoglu published an article attacking the website christianpersecution.com, claiming that it is part of a U.S. directed misinformation campaign against Turkey, and that criticisms of Turkey’s treatment of religious minorities are merely a pretext for the U.S. to impose sanctions. In order to fulfil the promise of democracy and stability made to the Turkish people after the 2015 elections, the ruling party must take concrete steps to uphold the stipulations of the secular constitution and to address the increasing social polarisation and erosion of democratic principles and fundamental freedoms. In particular, the authorities must make strenuous efforts to strengthen pluralism by countering and containing sectarian and ultra-nationalist narratives that are destroying the social fabric of the country. They should also ensure that cases involving freedom of religion or belief are addressed without prejudice in order to send a clear message that the targeting of religious minorities will no longer be tolerated.

Medium.com,Society,Invisible voters: electoral participation of internally displaced persons,World,https://medium.com/@ms.natalia.beketova/invisible-voters-electoral-participation-of-internally-displaced-persons-8f32fbf5bdfb?source=topic_page---------323------------------1," The story of an ordinary uprooted Ukrainian KYIV, UKRAINE. 8 a.m. — the capital is already awake and monotonous rows of cars set up a traffic jam. People emerge on streets lined with blooming chestnut trees. It seems like an average spring morning, except today is a final round of the Presidential Elections and Ukrainians rush to vote. This day, on April 21st, a citizen of Ukraine Kateryna Sokolova, just like the others, intends to go to a polling station. Yet she can do nothing but watch the election process from the sidelines: Kateryna has a status of Internally Displaced Person (IDP). This means she, unlike other citizens, is faced with a bunch of paperwork to change the temporary place of voting. “Before each election, I should go to the state register, give them my national ID and receive ‘a slip of paper’ that allows voting at your place of residence. I simply had no time to do it while working full-time”, says Kateryna who is an Assistant Professor at the Taras Shevchenko National University of Kyiv. Even the form she mentioned does not fully guarantee her ability to vote in the Parliamentary and local elections. Such issue is an example of discrimination and restriction оf voting rights of displaced persons. As a result of the armed conflict in the East of Ukraine and Crimea, there are 1.4 million internally displaced people, forced to change their places of residence. They share the same constraints as Kateryna does. IDPs are citizens who lost their homes and strive to cover basic needs. These people moved within state borders but haven’t changed their legal status. They are citizen of Ukraine and, therefore, should remain entitled to all the constitutional rights and guarantees, including the right to vote. They make up 4% of voters in Ukraine. Five years after the beginning of the conflict, Internally Displaced Persons are still not allowed to take part in the local elections. This is one reason, according to IOM, why displaced persons do not feel like part of the new communities and cannot fully integrate. In this way, IDPs are in a difficult situation and both, the state and the people themselves, are interested in integrating IDPs as quickly as possible. What is important in the process of the reintegration of this marginalized group is the elimination of the discrimination in their electoral participation. “Given the vulnerable situation of Internally Displaced Persons and residents of temporarily occupied territories, the state should adopt other approaches that may prevent discrimination”,stresses Tetyana Durnyeva, Executive Director at NGO “Civil Holding GROUP OF INFLUENCE”. The new approach depicted in a draft law № 6240. 27-year-old Kateryna, who was born in Luhansk, has been living in Kyiv since the summer of 2009, the year she enrolled at the university. She vividly remembers the end of July 2014 — everything was relatively well yesterday, and the next day “you hope your mom is alive and doing well, just hiding in the basement with no mobile connection”. It was impossible to call her family in Luhansk: “They [authorities] turned off the light. They turned off the water. Communication was blocked. You know, it is hard to imagine the government doing such action, if it plans to bring those regions [Donbas] back”. Since then Kateryna kept trying to contact her mother and take her to a safe place. On March 1st 2015 the mother arrived in Kyiv, taking 36 hours by bus via Russia. From that moment, her mom’s life, at the age of 52, began from scratch. “It’s easy to judge until it touches you. Tears, hysterics, disappointments, violations of rights, ‘you voted — so come back there’, ‘you wanted this’, queues, queues, queues”, tells Kateryna. “It’s easy to judge until it touches you. Tears, hysterics, disappointments, violations of rights…” They, as “invisible voters”, daily face difficulties regarding basic needs — housing, access to healthcare, residence registration, getting a job. They spent months looking for a job for her mother, were forced to get credit and sold all the gold jewelry simply to get by. A reply from the employers “You are too old” sounded like a death sentence. Without employment, the social security guard stated that her mother had no right to receive a monthly benefit in the amount of 420 UAH (approximately 15 Euro). “We held on. Our only ‘immovable property’ is rather mobile, — our cat Leopold. We took him with us. He’s a member of the family”, she half-heartedly jokes. Therefore, Kateryna did not have time to change the place of voting — she must constantly work to keep afloat. According to the Ministry of Social Policy, 14% of displaced persons changed the temporary voting address at the elections. Thus, many IDPs do not vote at all and their opinion is not considered while making decisions at the national and local levels."
Medium.com,Society,Kashmir has become a place obscured by mist and forgetfulness,World,https://medium.com/@Rashmee/kashmir-has-become-a-place-obscured-by-mist-and-forgetfulness-4f7725fb1c6a?source=topic_page---------324------------------1," In Nobel laureate Kazuo Ishiguro’s 2015 novel The Buried Giant, an elderly couple set off to look for their long-lost son, of whom they have only fleeting, faint memories. The story is set in sixth-century Britain. The Saxons have arrived, King Arthur is dead and an uneasy peace exists between the Britons and Saxons. The elderly parents’ search is complicated by the fact that they suffer from partial amnesia, something that afflicts everyone around them as well. Ishiguro writes: “For in this community the past was rarely discussed. I do not mean that it was taboo. I mean that it had somehow faded into a mist as dense as that which hung over the marshes. It simply did not occur to these villagers to think about the past — even the recent one.” It is not too fanciful to think of tomorrow’s Kashmir as a place similarly wreathed in mist and forgetfulness. It is mountainous, troubled and attempts are under way to smother its story, its sensibilities and its very sense of itself. On August 5, Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s government unilaterally revoked the special constitutional status and limited autonomy enjoyed by the Indian part of Kashmir. The region has since became a shadowy entity on the world stage — we know it still exists but not what’s happening there right now. We don’t even know what’s not happening there. There has been little news footage and commentary from Kashmir in the past two months and what exists isn’t contemporaneous. When an earthquake measuring 5.6 on the Richter scale rocked parts of Pakistan-administered Kashmir on September 24, the families and friends of those on the Indian side were unable even to make contact and find out if they were safe. It is still hard to find out what ordinary Kashmiris have to say while their politicians have simply vanished. Late last week, Kashmir briefly reappeared before the world, but only as a matter worthy of scrutiny. The issue was raised at the UN General Assembly (UNGA) by Pakistani Prime Minister Imran Khan. His Indian counterpart, however, didn’t mention the territory at all. China, Turkey and Malaysia also dwelt upon Kashmir. A protest was organised in New York and another in London. Other than that, Kashmir — the place and its people — remains obscured by a deep impenetrable fog. An officially sponsored mist has conquered Kashmir, subsuming its eight million people. At one point in Ishiguro’s story, the elderly father wonders: “ Had they always lived like this, just the two of them, at the periphery of the community?” It’s a question all Kashmiris might well be asking. In the eight weeks since the Indian government made its decision on Kashmir — changing its political status and imposing a near communications blackout on the valley — phone and internet connectivity has been drastically curtailed and a supposedly partial curfew remains in force. Senior Indian officials continue to say that everything is normal in Kashmir. On Sunday, India’s home minister Amit Shah rejected talk of restrictions on Kashmir. “Where are the restrictions?” he demanded. “It is only in your mind. There are no restrictions. Only misinformation about restrictions is being spread.” He added that “people are trying to create a hue and cry over lack of mobile connections for a few days. Lack of phone connection is not a human rights violation.” Mr Shah’s position is consistent with the way the Indian government has handled the Kashmir situation in the past couple of months. It claims it is pressing ahead with a clear agenda — the “dawn of development” — in a state that has missed out on India’s economic success. It has brooked no dissent and answered few questions about the propriety and ethics of its actions in the region. And it has exulted in the cheers of many Indians, who are elated by what they regard as a decisive move to end decades of mutiny in Kashmir. Internationally, it is fair to acknowledge that Kashmir has evoked only tepid interest. That was obvious at UNGA. In fact, Mr Modi’s ebullient pre-UNGA rally in Houston, Texas, alongside Donald Trump, was seen as the American administration’s affirmation of India’s hard line on Kashmir. The only limited caveats about Mr Modi’s approach to Kashmir came in a low-profile media briefing at the US state department. Last Saturday Alice Wells, the acting assistant secretary in the bureau of South and Central Asian Affairs, noted that “the United States is concerned by widespread detentions, including those of politicians and business leaders, and the restrictions on the residents of Jammu and Kashmir. We look forward to the Indian government’s resumption of political engagement with local leaders and the scheduling of the promised elections at the earliest opportunity. As [Mr Trump] emphasised, [Mr] Modi made a commitment that the recent changes to the status of Kashmir will improve the lives of the Kashmiri people, and we look to him to uphold this promise.” But that is boilerplate terminology. And it is worth noting that message was not delivered by Mr Trump or even his secretary of state, Mike Pompeo. What is astonishing is the extent to which Kashmir seems to face a fait accompli, at least so far. It is scarcely believable in this networked age that an entire region can be made to simply disappear from view. But in most parts of the world, there is little appetite to challenge India, an economic powerhouse and multicultural democracy. Audacity wins — until it doesn’t."
Medium.com,Society,"Norway, Brazil and AI for Water Management",World,https://medium.com/swlh/norway-brazil-and-ai-for-water-management-f0468ae79e9c?source=topic_page---------325------------------1," Norway can at times be a rather self-conceited country, I know as a Norwegian, as such we do not learn before we are slowly forced by peer-pressure or obvious encouragement. This is the current case with the transition from oil to more renewables and other industries, yet can perhaps be seen in other areas. Norwegians waste water resources, we are not aware of the issue and may not care enough before it is too late. This is why we should learn more from countries with water scarcity to improve our own systems and reduce our own consumption. In a previous article I wrote about how extensive the issue of water is in the global landscape. The world and its fresh water resources is drying up and many will be left without what we human needs most to survive. Water wars may commence, and the crisis is already hitting in a wide variety of areas across the world. Artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) techniques combined with a vivid domain understanding as well as long experience working sustainably with water can make a difference. We are up against a turning point and water is perhaps the most important area where we have to consider applications of AI to make a difference. Norwegians do all sorts of silly things like making the water run just to make it colder or hotter; water the lawn incessantly with a hose; or push the big button in a toilet even if they just made a small one (not a big one). Water is something Norwegians take so for granted that we almost do not seem to care. Every day Norwegians use on average 180 liters of water according to number from Statistics Norway from 2018. That is almost double the amount that the Danish people do (friendly rivals of Norway). They are almost down to 100 liter per day. It is clear that Norway could be more environmentally friendly, save power and electricity if we managed to improve. The environmental footprint of tap water may not be very well known. Norwegians do not often see the power cost, a high degree is carried by the government to clean the water, seen as a public good. As such there are several aspects to consider. It is not like Norwegian is not thinking about solutions. Artificial intelligence is being used to predict how much chemicals that should be used to clean up after your dirty business. This has been implemented in Trondheim with SINTEF. The project is only in an early phase, but the first results are promising. Frank Batey tells that AI can discover patterns from big amounts of data collected over several years. These patterns can be harder to see for humans. There are likely many other great examples. However we should not only be navel-gazing, or looking just locally. United Nations predicted a series of water crisis a long time ago, and it has begun hitting. There has been a need for a serious amount of innovation in the way water is being managed in Brazil. In Brazils’s Federal District, where the capital Brasília is located, Adasa, an engineering firm monitors the water situation through a sophisticated resource that allows for anticipated crisis in supply. They do this to improve conditions for managing water levels to avoid drought conflicts, Adasa has a new tool: the support of artificial intelligence in the Microsoft cloud. Through this feature, it is possible to monitor scenarios and anticipate possible water crises in the Federal District. Thus in preparing a predictive analysis of upcoming drought periods, Adasa uses sensors installed at different points to measure water levels in rivers and reservoirs, as well as rainfall rates, with measurements scheduled every 15 minutes. This information is transmitted via satellite to the Adasa SQL Server database, installed on the Microsoft Azure cloud. This data is then automatically processed and transferred to various panels of the Microsoft Power BI Analytics, Microsoft data analysis tool. Power BI enables scheduled analysis, such as comparing measurements collected in real time, based on data from a historical series of over 30 years of records. With updated report it allows the assessment of contexts, perception of trends and the projection of possible behavioral scenarios, for example, providing for the anticipation of periods of water restriction. This gives experts access to full and interactive reports on each reservoir and certain frequently updated rivers, including alerts, if data indicate any risk of conflict over water use. The installation of 16 sensors with satellite data transmission, coupled with the use of Power BI and cloud capabilities, today allow not only real-time data visualisation, but also predictive analytics that can support decision-making before. Even during the dry season. Before starting to use Power BI, this 30-year history of data was less widely used by the Adasa team because it was not an automatic process of comparing new measured data and using it as a basis for predicting scenarios. “Explains the head of Adasa’s information technology service, Geraldo Alves Barcellos. From the experience gained, another 30 automatic stations with satellite data transmission are being installed by Adasa. It is important with available data, so in addition to supporting water management and monitoring work, the information generated can be consulted by the general public through the Federal District’s Water Resources Information System (Sirh), available on the Adasa website. Norway has not felt the full brunt of the changes yet, however will start doing so. Both in terms of dryness and too much water, which has recently become a growing problem. Still in 2019 a child died due to contaminated water earlier; it is estimated that 30% of the pipes are leaking in Norway and we need to spend 220 billion more on water management infrastructure; and one third of the water will not reach its goal due to these bad pipes. According to research by RIF done in 2018 within Norway about 85% of the 4,3 million of the local population are supplied with water from 1.100 water management plants owned by the state. There are about 44,000km webs of water related infrastructure in Norway, spanning the length of equator. The average age of the municipal water net in Norway is 34 years. The highest registered average in a municipality is 60 years. Many municipalities has trouble with the quality of the new water net through leaks. Some water nets have 10% leakage while other have 60%, while the average is 32%. This is rather high compared to other European countries, some that are down to 8%. In 2018 Norway experienced an issue with water supplies. There was a drought in Norway that mean that people needed to take precautions. Norway had not been drier than this in more than 70 years. With a questionable water system and increasing draught in Norway as well perhaps Norway should stop joking about water and start acting. Consider this a slowly forcing through peer pressure and obvious encouragement. Please act now and ensure sustainable use of water in Norway, and begin collaborating with other countries on this issue vital to our survival. It is an issue both of equality and an issue that should concern all humans equally."

Medium.com,Society,Rojava’s Struggle Against the System,World,https://jadesaab.com/rojavas-struggle-against-the-system-c83ebd061a73?source=topic_page---------327------------------1," A top story in the news this week has been the withdrawal of US forces from Syria. The withdrawal is being presented by many as a ‘betrayal’ of the US towards their allies the Kurds who have been one of the most effective fighting forces against ISIS in both Syria and Iraq. The withdrawal has cleared the way for a Turkish invasion. Turkey seeks to establish a ‘buffer zone’ in the north of Syria claiming that this is necessary for the security of its border in a still unstable Syria. The truth, however, is that Turkey is looking to suppress and limit the influence of the Kurds who have been able to establish a de facto autonomous zone in the north of Syria called Rojava. For Turkey, a strong Rojava in Syria will embolden the Kurdish population — which has been seeking autonomous rule for decades — within Turkey. This invasion can be seen as nothing but an extension of Turkeys oppression of domestic Kurds. The invasion, which only started a few days ago has already had a devastating effect on a region that has already been devastated by ISIS. In the first place, it has revived ISIS operations. Second, it has already resulted in the death of hundreds of Kurdish fighters trying to hold back the Turkish invasion. Third, it has created an intensification of the refugee crisis as 160,000 people have reportedly fled their homes in northeast Syria. Most of the coverage on this has been to blame the US for the betrayal. Many have pointed out how this is not the first time the US has betrayed the Kurds, but is, in fact, the Eighth. This has prompted another Medium writer to quip that “Betraying the Kurds is Trump’s most ‘presidential’ move yet”. But there is something inherently absurd with being upset about the withdrawal of an invading army from sovereign territory. This may be a harsh point to make as the Kurds in Rojava see this as a betrayal as well. yet, even if the reality of the layer cake that is Syria at the moment makes the presence of the US in Syria a requirement for the survival of Rojava, there just seems something wrong with encouraging the presence of an imperialist force — no less a force that has caused this entire situation — to remain engaged. This is why some have pointed out the inevitability of this tragedy. Of course the US, as an imperialist force, has never based its policy on benevolence. As soon as Trump announced the withdrawal of troops from Syria his business ties in Turkey came back into the spotlight with many claiming it as a motivating force for giving the withdrawal orders. But Trump is not the only one who has no issue with climbing into bed with a genocidal dictator. In 2016, the EU signed a multibillion-dollar agreement with Turkey to settle refugees in the country in a bid to slow their flow into Europe, even though Turkey was being accused of abusing and exploiting Syrian refugees. Lost in a discourse dominated by foreign policy has been the agency and aspirations of the Kurds in Rojava. Beyond being a bulwark in the fight against ISIS, Rojava was also a radical experiment in “Libertarian Municipalism” based on the ideas of imprisoned Kurdish leader Abdullah Öcalan who was inspired by American Anarchist theorist Muray Bookchin. Libertarian Municipalism seeks to create self-governing communities based on principles of direct democracy that would come together across national borders. In this way, the establishment of Rojava as an autonomous zone is not part of a national liberation campaign, but a campaign for the abolishment of the concept of the nation-state altogether. These principles of direct democracy also account for the ethnic makeup of the population creating a balance of representation while also reinforcing the role of women as women hold 40 per cent of leadership positions at all level. It’s a sad fact that the agency of the Kurds in establishing such a radical mode of governance is being overshadowed by either typical anti-imperialist denunciations from the left instead of acts of solidarity (although whether or not the ‘global left’ can make any meaningful difference is debatable) or calls for increased interventionism from imperialist powers. Perhaps Rosa Luxemburg was right in saying that all movements of self-determination are doomed to become subsumed into the movements of larger and competing imperialist forces. This is hard to argue against since, under the immense pressure of invasion, Kurdish forces have made a deal with the Syrian government to allow, and work alongside, Syrian troops into the territory with the objective to stave off the Turkish advance. It is still unclear as to what this means to the democratic experiment of Rojava, but it is more than likely the start of the end. If anything, though, the experience of Rojava teaches us that the only way a radical revolutionary can be sustained is through solidarity from the region itself. That is, through the development of other radical movements in the region that may fare better outside of an international proxy war. Those are the only conditions under which a radical experiment such as Rojava could have survived without needing the support of a world power. There is another lesson to draw from all of this. The struggles of Rojava and their quest for autonomy can easily be located as an episode in the Syrian civil war — as a unique and distance event. But it's important to not dismiss the topic of self-determination, and its suppression, as one that only arises in ‘backwards’ parts of the world. Self-determination and its suppression is and always has been a hot topic in the developed ‘west’. It’s worth remembering that it was only in 2017 that an Independence referendum that took place in Catalonia was rejected by Spain and the EU and was met with harsh suppression from the Spanish government when police attacked peaceful demonstrators and jailed the political leaders of the independence movement who have just received 13-year jail sentences. Scotland has also sought to gain independence, and although its 2014 referendum results came back against independence, Scotland is now paying the price as its wishes to remain within the EU is being ignored by a larger power. Although not a case of independence, one can also look at Greece’s acquiescence to an EU diet of austerity measures which were passed by the government against a referendum that rejected them. Here too we see the general will of a people and their right to self-determination being subsumed to maintain a system that goes against their interests. All of this to say that the concept of self-determination remains a pertinent one in domestic politics as well as that of international relations. Yet, it continuously seems to be suppressed for the benefit of larger powers who seek to maintain their hegemony be it in the form of personal business interests, archaic notions of nationalism, or trade competitiveness in a globalized economy. We would all gain by taking a page out of the Rojava playbook to reconsider the role of radical direct democracy in our immediate lives and understand that our cause interests are more aligned with that of Kurds in Rojava than with any of the other institutions of power that rob us of our voices."

He lives in Ohio, USA F
or three decades, my generation of Kashmiris living in North America and Europe feared what would happen as we grew old. Would the dream of freedom for our homeland be buried with us as we passed on? But even as the Kashmir conflict has aged, I’m witnessing the birth of a new movement. In the early 1990s, we organized a number of pro-freedom meetings and rallies on Kashmir in the United States. The couple of hundred attendees were largely Kashmiri immigrant professionals, like myself. A handful of Pakistanis and Arab-Americans, with very few Indians, also came. Meanwhile, the U.K. and Belgium saw larger gatherings and protests. Most of those people hailed from Azad Kashmir. I remember one of our most important events in July 1991. We held the first International Kashmir Conference in Washington, D.C. Some 400 people, from dignitaries and activists to academics, attended two days of panels and discussions. They shuttled between the Crystal City Marriott in Arlington, Virginia, and Howard University’s campus in downtown D.C. Since then, many more conferences were held in New York, London, Birmingham, Brussels and Islamabad. It was invigorating. We were young and our children were in their teens and twenties. Yet the conflict persisted. Our kids grew up, and had children of their own. We fretted if our sacrifices would go to waste. We worried if future generations of Kashmiris would keep waking up at night with nightmares of Indian troops chasing them down ricketty roads, across rice paddies and cornfields, up steep hills and rugged mountains. Our own children here would be safe. But what about the millions we have left behind to suffer the torment? I would pray: Almighty God! What is and what will be their fate? If after decades of living here in the free world, we still wake up with dreadful dreams of terror and torment, what will happen to those we left behind to face more horrific army terror? Things seemed to only get worse. On Aug. 5, Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s government revoked Articles 370 and 35-A of the constitution, abolishing Kashmir’s special status. Since then, Kashmiris have endured a communications blackout, curfew, arrests and detentions. I could’ve lost hope. But I didn’t, after what I saw. On Sept. 27, during the UN General Assembly, 22,000 people — according the NYPD — protested the 72-year-old Indian occupation of Kashmir. Hundreds of our youth clad in their red shirts pierced the skies with screams of freedom in front of the UN headquarters. That day was reminiscent of the rallies and events we held in the ’90s. Yet this time, things are different. The numbers are much larger, the message is clearer, and the international community is more aware and supportive of the Kashmiri cause. And most notably, there’s a diversity of supporters along with the Kashmiri-American youth. Outside the UN, we had Pakistanis, Indians, Bangladeshis, Arabs, African-Americans and Caucasians, among others, rallying in solidarity for Kashmir. There were Muslims, Christians, Jews, Sikhs, and Hindus, and others who did not adhere to a religious tradition. Only metal police barriers could contain the swelling crowd. The scenes warmed my heart and consoled my spirit. Our senior leadership never gave up their dream of a free Kashmir — some day. But a sign of our faith in the future, from our innovative youth, lit up Times Square that same day. “Stand With Kashmir” flashed in red during a vigil, for all New Yorkers to see. Our experience has taught us that we must stick together like a lead wall. The dark night is long, the road is steep and the enemy is devious and determined. But after this darkness is over, the light of the morning will shine upon our beloved Kashmir."

By Nithin Coca As the protests in Hong Kong grew and intensified over the summer, observers on Twitter, Facebook and YouTube began to notice a trend: Chinese state-run media outlets, such as China Central Television (CCTV) and Xinhua News, were blanketing platforms with promoted tweets, boosted posts and advertising content containing false or fictitious accusations against protesters, who since June 5 have been calling for the withdrawal of a controversial anti-extradition law, universal suffrage, and more. It got so bad that on August 17, Maciej Cegłowski, a web developer, wrote a tweet thread highlighting the disparity between the messages on his Twitter feed and what he was seeing on the ground. His thread went viral, with journalists and protesters concurring that Twitter, Facebook, and YouTube were all filled with promoted content presenting a heavily distorted view of the protests. “[Chinese entities] have been deeply engaged in online debates since the Hong Kong protests started, making arguments against Western media narratives, showcasing violent behavior of radicals within the protest movement, or employing straight-up personal attacks [and] doxing against journalists,” said Mike Zi Yang, a senior analyst at the S. Rajaratnam School of International Studies in Singapore. Following Cegłowski’s tweets, something remarkable happened. The very next day, Twitter released a new policy, saying it would no longer accept advertising from state media outlets, following a 30-day grace period. Days later, YouTube announced it, too, would begin labeling state-funded media videos in a change of policy. In rapid order, Facebook announced that it had taken down a pro-China disinformation network, as did Twitter, the first instances of platforms directly tying disinformation to the Chinese state. “There’s some significance to Twitter and Facebook designating Chinese disinformation, because they are confirming it’s happening,” said Josh Kurlantzick, Fellow for Southeast Asia at the Council on Foreign Relations. “It’s important that the major social media platforms call it out, and they should continue to call it out.” These moves were welcomed by many, but they heralded greater challenges ahead. As Chinese state media influence grows around the world, what happened in Hong Kong may signal the beginning of a new era of great-power infowar, in which disinformation is no longer the realm of bots, troll armies and clunky propaganda, but appears in the form of slick saturation campaigns backed by well-funded state media outlets with millions in advertising spending. “Freedom of information does not mean the freedom of any organization to broadcast any kind of content,” said Cédric Alviani, East Asia Bureau Director at Reporters Without Borders. “The major problem in the global information space is that it is full of disinformation content — hate speech, propaganda, and fake news — is so much that it is increasingly hard for legitimize news to exist.”"
Medium.com,Society,Immigration in Germany: Where should we stand?,World,https://medium.com/@isabel.robleda/immigration-in-germany-where-should-we-stand-90db8dbb0840?source=topic_page---------331------------------1," For approximately four years, we are familiar with the anti-immigrant narrative of various political leaders. Because of the media, we have all been more in tune with that narrative of the current president of the United States who, since his campaign in 2015, took Latinos as a common enemy. However, this paper is not intended to focus on the effects of this narrative or on that particular persona in America, but in Europe, specifically in Germany, a country that has taken the European leadership on the issue of refugees and immigration. In 2015, Germany was the recipient of more than one million immigrants and asylum seekers who were received by the government led by Angela Merkel. This strong entry of immigrants into German territory was badly received by several social and political groups, many of them even took the opportunity to start spreading a protectionist wave surrounding the negative implications that these migrants could have on Germany’s status quo. After that year, the Chancellor and her government fell into strong criticism, in 2016 it was encouraged to reduce immigration to Germanic territory by more than 50%. Nearly 500,000 migrants entered the country. In 2017, foreigners’ permanence decreased again with 416,080 people remaining in the territory. In 2018, the immigrant wave continued its downward trend reaching approximately 400,000 people. This year, immigration continues to fall since by July, 96,644 asylum seekers was registered, six times less than in the same period during 2018. These numbers indicate the systematic downward trend of immigration in Germany since 2015, however, after this year the immigration issue had such a media and political effect against the government, that several opposition groups took the issue as their flag to attract skeptical voters that did not knew what to expect with such public policy. This movement has been so successful within the voters that today; the German government is at a point where the federal parliament (who decides the laws of the State) is divided in six. The strongest group is the same that is in power and is represented by the coalition between the CDU / CSU with 246 seats and the SPD with 153. On the other hand, is the opposition that is divided into the AfD with 92 seats, the FDP with 80 seats, The Left with 69, the Greens with 67 seats, and four non-registered. Democratically speaking, the division of political parties in parliament is extremely gratifying since it gives power and voice to all the opinions of the German people, however, it is important to focus our attention on the AfD, Alternative for Germany (for its acronym in German). Since in the 2017 elections, they became the third party with the highest representation in parliament. The party has been described as a nationalist, populist and euro-skeptic. It has also been linked with racist, islamophobic, anti-semitic, xenophobic groups, in opposition to gay marriage and in support of traditional female roles. In addition, the party aims to change the constitution of Germany to eliminate the right to asylum cases and seeks to deport all those whose applications to remain in Germany were rejected, regardless of whether the countries to which they are sent from put their life in danger. AfD was created in 2012 and since the 2013 elections it has been acquiring more and more political strength. After 2015, the party became really powerful both regionally and federally. In the 2016 regional elections, they became the third political force in regions such as Rhineland-Palatinate and Baden-Württemberg. Then, in the 2017 federal elections they became the third most important force in the country with 12.6% of the votes. Today, in 2019, they also represent the fourth force in the European parliament with 11% of the votes and are the second political force in the Brandenburg and Saxony regions. This ultra-right movement has not only spread in politics, also in society, in the streets. As of 2015, social xenophobe movements against immigration have been increasingly consistent and popular. As an example, we can remember the demonstrations that happened a year ago in the city of Chemnitz where neo-Nazi groups demanded the expulsion of foreigners from the country. This demonstration is related to the supposed rise in crime that has been perceived in German society since 2015. In Chemnitz, the group that manifested itself took as banner the news of the murder of a German citizen allegedly killed by two foreign citizens. More recently, in the summer of this year, there was a murder of an eight-year-old boy in the city of Frankfurt, a crime perpetrated by a citizen of Eritrea. This fact again triggered a series of questions about immigration in the media and in society. However, a week earlier there was a murder allegedly done by one of these extreme right groups against another citizen of Eritrea very close to Frankfurt. Although the events have no co-relationship, it is important to pay attention on how the two stories developed in the media since the first seemed to have had much greater coverage than the second. When viewing these strong media impact stories, it is important to focus on the fundamentals for the general analysis of this migratory phenomenon and its perception in society by questioning ourselves on what has happened to crime rates since the wave of immigration? The German federal police periodically make detailed reports on the crimes that occur in German territory and their relationship with immigrants and refugees. These reports have been used by ultra-right groups to justify their anti-immigrant policy by disguising certain data. For example it was spread that the crimes committed in 2015 rose by 79%, what’s not detailed is that this increase was during the months that preceded the great wave Immigration, therefore, we are unable to relate refugees to this rise. Groups such as the political party, AfD, put such little detail on the fact that those reports confirm decreasing of crime rates by 2%, nor the that the police data consider crimes such as the improper use of public transport (without payment) and crimes related to immigration status, not necessarily violent crimes such as murder or sexual violence. It is important to note that in these statistics, non-residents are also considered, this means that they tourists are also considered which means that there are a number of casualties related to them that have no relation with the immigration policies of the country. There are even certain reports that only consider whether there was an increase in the number of crimes related to immigrants committed in a certain region, regardless of whether it was from one immigrant to another, or if it was against the same expatriates (crimes that actually have increase 14% from 2014 to 2018). Despite the misuse of data by these groups, we cannot ignore certain gaps that exist in these reports. An example was when the media reported the sexual crimes allegedly committed by immigrant groups in the city of Cologne during the New Year holidays between 2015 and 2016. Those were not taken into account for the counting of the crimes violent acts committed in 2015 and they clearly would have increased the percentage of crimes committed by immigrants during that year. Although the reports are not yet entirely accurate and their analysis can be very complex, the important thing for us as society to analyze is that the co-relationship between immigration and crime is not yet verifiable. It is also absurd to assume that all people entering German territory are likely to be great citizens who comply fully with law, of course there will be cases that fall into crime and surely they should be judged according to the crime committed, but it is important to emphasize that it is not most immigrants as it has been alleged by groups of the extreme right. It is also important to remember that they are not changing the German status quo and that they do not seek to conspire among themselves to end the German culture. Otherwise, a huge number of refugees who came with the big wave, want to integrate into German society and have been a fundamental part of the economic growth of important companies in various regions of the country. It is suggested to read this article published by Al Jazeera that exemplifies the positive relationship between refugees and businessmen. It may be that although Germany is one of the safest countries, with low crime rates (actually, this year presented the lowest crime rates since 1992), society’s perception is infinitely more alarming and is closely related to immigration, especially since 2015. This fear is used as a political tactic by far-right groups to implement xenophobic strategies that not only limit the entry of immigrants and refugees into German territory, but also divides society. I think that much of the fear that the population feels, fear that several political leaders take advantage of to carry out campaigns based on false crime data, is because of the fear of losing their identity as Germans, an identity based on their language, their religion, their social customs. However, what if there is another melting pot carried out here where all the different cultures, religions and societies that are tangled can create a new German society? A culture that adopts customs and traditions of all the cultures so that it can continue to be one of the most cosmopolitan, safe and powerful countries in the world. The fear of losing the cultural identity of a country is quite understandable, however culture is based on movement and change. Culture is adaptability and progress. It can be hard to see it right now, when the change is taking place. But what would a city like Berlin be like without the Turkish and Vietnamese immigration from the middle of the last century? These multicultural mix has shaped much of the essence of the German capital. A good part of what forms rich cultures is the conjunction of different ways of thinking, of living, of believing. The richness of multiculturalism is an advantage for countries such as Germany, the United States, Great Britain, Canada, among others. The migration issue has been and always will be extremely complex. Many elements are combined: data, people, laws, human rights, perceptions. And those elements come by another gigantic variety of topics such as identity, religion, law, education, crime, among others. Therefore, we have the responsibility and the duty to constantly inform ourselves (through truthful and objective sources) about the events that occur around this issue and, above all, we have to remain within the gray shade of our opinions. Like in all complex issues, extreme opinions, black and white, are counterproductive to reach a social agreement and only manage to divide us more as a society without being able to resolve the issue in question. By staying in those shades of gray, we can appreciate all the parts of the problem and we can approach public policies that can be applied to reach a point where society as a whole can respect and preserve all human lives. As Article 1.1 of the German Constitution dictates: “Human dignity shall be inviolable. To respect and protect it shall be the duty of all state authority.” https://www.theatlantic.com/international/archive/2018/09/violent-protests-chemnitz-germany/569206/ https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-45328477 https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alternative_for_Germany https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-45419466 https://www.nytimes.com/2019/08/18/world/europe/germany-crime-migrants-anxiety.html https://www.infomigrants.net/en/post/18506/murder-of-young-boy-in-frankfurt-prompts-debate-on-immigrant-crime-statistics https://www.theatlantic.com/international/archive/2018/06/germany-migration-politics/563051/ http://www.german-times.com/the-intolerance-and-hate-shown-by-afd-representatives-in-the-bundestag-is-by-no-means-commonplace-in-germany/ https://www.thelocal.de/20181221/study-shows-the-tenuous-link-between-foreigners-refugees-and-criminality https://www.aljazeera.com/ajimpact/germany-welcomed-refugees-reaping-economic-benefits-190617194147334.html https://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2016/may/11/donald-trump/donald-trump-says-germany-now-riddled-crime-thanks/ https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2017/04/25/migrant-crime-germany-rises-50-per-cent-new-figures-show/ https://www.dw.com/en/germanys-crime-rate-fell-to-lowest-level-in-decades-in-2018/a-48162310 https://www.forbes.com/sites/freylindsay/2019/08/29/refugees-in-germany-did-not-bring-higher-risk-to-germans/#4714f1ac1101 https://www.btg-bestellservice.de/pdf/80206000.pdf https://www.dw.com/en/afd-what-you-need-to-know-about-germanys-far-right-party/a-37208199"
Medium.com,Society,How Trump Woefully Gets History Wrong,World,https://medium.com/discourse/how-trump-woefully-gets-history-wrong-dbb3a3af5aac?source=topic_page---------332------------------1," In
a press conference to clarify his decision to pull the U.S. forces out of the way of the Turkish troops before an operation in northern Syria last week, U.S. President Donald J. Trump said, “some Kurds are Turkey’s natural enemies and they fight each other for centuries.” The next day, Trump went even further. Kurds, the embattled U.S. president noted, “did not help the U.S. in Normandy” during the Second World War to fight against the U.S. enemies (read Nazi Germany). Trump’s not-so-subtle efforts to justify abandoning Kurds by invoking history ignited a torrent of criticism both from the U.S. ally in northern Syria and from historians who scrambled to fact-check the president’s claims from a historical perspective. Historically speaking, the American president got many things woefully wrong in his remarks. It is no longer a secret that Trump’s ties to the notion of truth are transactional, loose and slippery. But his remarks about the relationship between Turks and Kurds, between Turkey and its Kurdish citizens, reveal his embarrassing ignorance of history and his cursory attention to a matter that deeply concerns the U.S. policy in Syria. As many media outlets judiciously examined Trump’s mind-boggling Normandy remarks, I’ll dwell upon more on the side of Turkey and Kurds to see whether Turks and Kurds, as Trump claimed, fought one another for centuries. As if it were an order of nature, Trump depicted a picture of perpetual conflict between the two peoples of the Middle East. This could not be more wrong. The Kurdish conflict, as academics put it, is a modern phenomenon, a product of Turkey’s tormented nation-building process based on an exclusive and narrow understanding of ethnic identity — Turkishness. Kurds are not Turkey’s natural enemies and both people certainly not fight with each other for centuries. To begin with, it is adequate to say that Kurds were an essential part of the Ottoman Empire’s multi-ethnic social fabric and body politic. Sultan Selim the First incorporated Kurdish tribes to the imperial structure when he waged a war against the Safavid Iran in the second decade of the 16th century in a bitter contest for regional supremacy, which came to define the regional geopolitics for several centuries. The Ottoman ruling elites even preferred an alliance with Sunni Kurds instead of Shiite Turkomans who were aligned with Tehran, then the sponsor of regional Shiites, as it is today. The current conflict, which has become deadlocked after the Kurdistan Workers’ Party (PKK) took up arms in 1984 in a quest to carve up self-rule in Kurdish-majority areas of Turkey, harks back to the early decades of the Republic after the disintegration of the empire. The founding fathers of the Turkish Republic appealed to their Kurdish brothers’ help to remove occupation forces from Anatolia in their eventual bid to establish a new state out of the ruins of the empire. This point matters when considering the fact that Kurds might have well pursued a different path, given the temptation and seductive offers from the Western powers. This aspect found its most definitive expression in the Treaty of Sèvres that envisaged the dismemberment of the empire by dividing it into a number of statelets in Anatolia. Rejecting a state of Kurdistan in eastern Turkey envisioned in the treaty, Kurdish tribal leaders aligned with Ankara against the occupying French troops in southeastern Turkey. Their legendary guerilla warfare against the French forces earned special status to two eastern cities to praise the local residents’ valor and sacrifices. But, to their dismay and bitter disappointment, the new state acquired a new identity in an exclusive way, banning the expression of all other sub-identities from the political sphere. This led to a number of subsequent Kurdish rebellions, most of which were brutally suppressed. The last rebellion (or insurgency) by the PKK, however, is not. It is the longest one that still ensues with no clear end in sight. Trump’s (False) Remarks Matter To
claim that Turks and Kurds fight for centuries is to know nothing about history. Trump’s portrayal of a perennial war between Turkey and Kurds is certainly no less bizarre than his Normandy remarks. A subtext hidden in his presentation opens itself to a critical mind: “This is not our fight, it is none of our business. Let them fight each other, as they did for centuries.” This depiction, however misplaced and inaccurate, cannot be written off as mere nonsense when it comes from the leader of the most powerful country on earth, when it comes from a president whose country is one of the parties on the ground. Whatever Trump says, true or false, matters because certain deeds and actions follow his words, and affects the entire region. To give a perspective and context precedes this latest saga, it is worth remembering how Trump baffled the world when he first decided to withdraw the U.S. forces in the “immediate area” of the Turkish operation, which is now in full swing. When faced with an unprecedented backlash from the U.S. Congress, media and public, the president later felt compelled to warn Turkey to remain in certain boundaries or face harsh penalties. This attempt for a public relations management to palliate the jolted nerves of his party and the Congress indeed failed to assuage them. President Recep Tayyip Erdogan even dismissed Trump’s threatening tweets as something devoid of substance. Trump, the Turkish leader told his own media, seeks to sooth a seething Congress and tries to tread a delicate balancing act to ward off an internal backlash in the U.S. public. In a head-spinning pace, Trump again reversed himself, re-highlighting the importance of good ties with Turkey. At one point, the American president event praised Turkey for releasing Pastor Brunson after what he says his sanctions threats. The same threat, he warned, is still in place if Turkey ever extends the limits drawn by his administration in northern Syria. But the political and public pressure did not peter out as reports of atrocities and alleged war crimes committed by Ankara-allied rebels trickled out from the ground in northern Syria while the Turkish offensive still rumbles on. Trump had no longer the luxury to waffle on the matter. On Monday, he imposed certain sanctions on Turkey’s steel industry, doubling down tariffs on steel imports while suspending talks for a comprehensive free trade agreement between the two NATO allies. Yet, as some analysts told the New York Times, this latest move would do little to deter Turkey from expanding its endeavor in Syria. A vortex of geopolitical dynamics constantly tilts the playing field in Syria. This is all the more so after Kurds, abandoned by its major sponsor, the U.S., re-aligned with the Bashar al-Assad’s regime, the major foe of Washington. Now the Syrian army surges forward to the cities near the border with Turkey to thwart a takeover by the Turkish military and its proxy groups. Syria, a cauldron of overlapping regional interests and competing agendas of numerous actors, is now entering a new phase of a regional “Game of Thrones.” How the geopolitical contest would play out is anyone’s guess, with little prospect of accuracy over the next turn and twist of events. Trump may have his own reasons for putting America first in international politics. This is certainly understandable from the angle of domestic considerations and vexing political demands. But he can, at least, get history right. It would be a disservice and injustice to history by arbitrarily and inaccurately invoking it to justify the acts of the present."
Medium.com,Society,Why Trump’s Syrian Withdrawal is the Greatest Foreign Policy Mistake in US History — Political…,World,https://medium.com/@christopheredward.rhodes/why-trumps-syrian-withdrawal-is-the-greatest-foreign-policy-mistake-in-us-history-political-da5ecfcd8480?source=topic_page---------333------------------1," Donald Trump’s decision to suddenly and recklessly withdraw American troops from northern Syria in order to allow the authoritarian government of Recep Tayyip Erdoğan to send in the Turkish military to attack the Syrian Kurds is a betrayal of a brave and faithful US ally, unconscionable and incredibly damaging to American interests and credibility. But it’s more than that. The decision is the worst foreign policy decision of the Trump administration, one that further destabilizes a chaotic country and an unstable region while benefiting adversaries and outright enemies of the United States. But it’s more than that, too. I’ve studied world politics for nearly twenty years, and I’m convinced that this is the worst foreign policy decision in American history. I know this sounds like hyperbole. As bad as the Syrian decision was, we can immediately think of US actions or inactions that have had much higher death tolls or have been shown to create long-lasting repercussions: the Vietnam War, Bill Clinton’s choice to ignore the Rwandan genocide, and George W. Bush 2003 invasion of Iraq all come to mind. And yes, the results of these decisions were deadlier (even if the long-term impact in Syria remains to be seen), and thus stand as deep stains on the legacy of America. So do other examples with lower immediate death tolls: the 1961 Bay of Pigs or the Libyan intervention of 2011 were less immediately lethal but set in motion chains of events that became increasingly destabilizing and dangerous over time. Yet, analyzing these foreign policy disasters ultimately allows us to see why retreating from Syria and abandoning the Kurds was a unique mistake in US foreign policy history. Why do we remember policies like the past failures listed above? Each of these examples, and others like them, cannot pass some major test by which we tend to judge foreign policy. Several policies have failed to achieve their goals, and sometimes failed spectacularly. Many decisions may have been well-intentioned, but suffered from poor planning or improper execution based on bad information, weak resolve, or incorrect assumptions. Barack Obama rightly wanted to prevent Muammar Gaddafi from committing a massacre in Libya, but didn’t figure out what to do after taking out the dictator. Fighting the Soviet Union in Afghanistan during the 1980s was a useful strategy and may have hastened the collapse of the USSR, but it inadvertently armed and trained groups who would become the Taliban and al-Qaeda. The Bay of Pigs invasion against Cuba could have weakened the threat of communism in the western hemisphere; instead, it embarrassed the United States, pushed the Castro regime closer to the communist world, and was part of a chain of events leading to the Cuban Missile Crisis, the closest the world came to nuclear war. Others policies succeeded in accomplishing their goals, but at an unacceptable or immoral cost. During the Cold War, the US propped up many right-wing dictators while sponsoring coups that took out leftist leaders in countries such as Chile and the Democratic Republic of Congo. These policies resulted in suffering or death for millions of people in these countries, but they served the purpose of maintaining reliable Cold War allies. Similar policies have been employed since the Cold War, supporting dictators to maintain stability, restrict religious extremism, or guarantee access to oil or valuable markets. These policies come at a high cost, usually paid by people in other parts of the world, and they often breed long term resentment against the US, but they work for the immediate purposes for which they are intended. The line between these two tests — effectiveness and ethics — is not always clear, nor are the measurements of these two criteria. Did the Bush administration accomplish what it wanted to do in Iraq? If the goal was the neocon vision of remolding Iraq and the Middle East as bastions of democracy, then clearly they failed. If the goal was the more immediate motive of removing Saddam Hussein, a bad actor (and the man who once tried to assassinate W’s father), then it clearly worked, but at the cost of hundreds of thousands of Iraqi lives and thousands of Americans as well. Was unleashing the horror of nuclear bombs actually the least lethal way to end World War II, or just an expediency that did not take into account any consequences other than American lives? Really bad policies, like the many escalations of the Vietnam War, fail both the effectiveness and the ethics tests — the tactics used to hold onto South Vietnam, from My Lai to Agent Orange, were immoral and often criminal, and in the end they failed — Saigon still fell. But even these failing policies pass a third test: they had a purpose that served some interest of the United States. That purpose could be noble (protecting innocent lives from slaughter by the forces of Gaddafi in 2011), dubious (was the 2003 invasion of Iraq about weapons of mass destruction, Saddam Hussein, or oil? Looking at the policymakers in the Bush administration who influenced the decision, that answer probably varied from person to person), or cynical (Bill Clinton succeeded in preventing a single American life from being lost in Rwanda, and all it cost was half a million Rwandan lives instead). Yet these policies were all meant to do something to benefit the country; the Bay of Pigs invasion and the Vietnam War, though disastrous in hindsight, were intended to stop the spread of communism and thus the influence of our geopolitical rival; if they had succeeded, they could have conceivably made America safer or more secure in some way. Donald Trump’s Syria decision is the worst decision in US foreign policy history because it fails all three tests. It fails to make the US, or its soldiers, safer. It’s the height of naivety to think that the chaos set off by Turkey’s invasion, the resurgence of ISIS, and the boon given to the embattled Syrian regime will not create a situation that will draw the US back into military conflict in the Middle East or fighting terrorism against Americans and their interests. The “never ending wars” that Donald Trump has referenced in his Syria decision are not inevitabilities; they’re the outcomes of specific choices, choices like this one. The Syrian decision was also clearly immoral. For all the nonsense about the Kurds not helping us in World War II, they’ve surely helped us over the last several years. In the midst of situations in Iraq and Syria with no good solutions, America’s partnership with the Kurds in these two countries served as the best option available. Instead of American troops continuing to be in the midst of bloody wars and losing their lives (as they did in Iraq) or trying to feebly fight these wars from afar, the Kurds provided a brave, reliable, non-radical and loyal fighting force who, for reasons of their own (sharing a common foe in ISIS, and being able to establish semblances of the Kurdish state they’ve sought for decades) chose to ally with the US. The Kurds stuck with that alliance as they sacrificed thousands of their lives to fight the Islamic State and protect minorities such as the Yazidis and the Christians of Syria and Iraq. The Kurds, contrary to the way that Trump has tried to rewrite their efforts over the past week, even sacrificed their own interests in order to serve the interests of the US and its allies: they removed the fortifications they had built along the Syrian/Turkey border at the request of the US (which was trying to placate Turkey, which obviously did not work out) based on the promise that the US would protect the Kurds against the possibility of the Turkish army invading. The US made promises, and then broke them. This is not the first time that the US has abandoned allies: Vietnam again comes to mind. It’s not even the first time the US has abandoned the Kurds. George H.W. Bush encouraged them to rebel against Saddam Hussein, but declined to back them up when they did, and they were slaughtered by the Iraqi regime of the day. But those past betrayals don’t make this one any less reprehensible. But Trump’s decision stands in a category of its own because it was ineffective, immoral, and also completely without purpose. To anyone who wants to defend this move, I won’t even ask you how this makes the US or its allies safer, because it clearly doesn’t. I’ll ask you a more fundamental question: how could this decision have possibly served any legitimate interests whatsoever? Is there any scenario, any hypothetical in which suddenly withdrawing from northern Syria at the behest of Erdogan’s request to go in and attack the Kurds doesn’t result in exactly the disaster that occurred? Is there any way that it doesn’t harm our allies (the Kurds), our credibility as a strategic ally, and the lives of innocents caught in the crossfire: the Kurds themselves, the civilians of Syria more generally, and future victims of the Assad regime and ISIS? Is there any way this benefits anyone other than Bashir al-Assad and Vladimir Putin, not to mention ISIS, which is currently resurrecting after having been severely wounded and largely contained with the help of the Kurds? Every American president has had an identifiable outlook on foreign policy. For the first century or so this more or less consisted of expanding American territory and political hegemony in the Western hemisphere while otherwise following George Washington’s advice to avoid “foreign entanglements.” This changed with the dawn of the 20th Century — the Spanish-American War briefly left America with a fledgling colonial empire stretching as far as the Philippines — and WWI brought foreign policy to the forefront like never before. Different presidents responded in various ways. Some guided their actions based on grand theories of the world: Wilson’s liberal internationalism, Nixon and Kissinger’s Realpolitik. Others had less in the way of grand strategy but relied on certain tactics: George H.W. Bush and Barack Obama were, in different ways, multilateral pragmatists. Teddy Roosevelt spoke softly and carried a big stick; Ronald Reagan, confronting the Soviet Union, chose louder words and even bigger sticks. Worldviews could change according to time and events: after the downing of an American Black Hawk helicopter in Somalia in 1993 led to a firefight that left 19 Americans dead, Clinton refused to use American military might except from a safe distance, thus intervening in the former Yugoslavia by air but not in Rwanda, which may have required significant numbers of boots on the ground. His successor, George W. Bush, initially pledge to dial back even the Clinton era “nation building” until the events of 9/11 caused him to engage in just such projects on a massive larger scale in Afghanistan and Iraq. Even if there were few commonalities in the principles upon which past US presidents relied, there was at least a consistency that there was some guiding logic shaping their policies. This notion does not apply to the Trump administration, as evidenced by his Syria decision. This decision was not merely wrong (in both the strategic and moral senses of the word); it was also, at best, incomprehensible. There’s a reason that even Trump’s most ardent allies in Congress and most blindly devoted supporters among the voting population have questioned this decision. It was immediately, obviously doomed to make things worse for America and the world, and only benefit terrorists and dictators. Again, the decision was at best nonsensical, and at worst sinister. One need not see Donald Trump as a Manchurian candidate to understand why Vladimir Putin wanted him to win — Donald Trump caters to dictators. Why Trump does this is an open question, or at least a multiple-choice one: is it because he envies the power that authoritarians wield, respects the toxic masculinity and plutocratic tendencies that define strongmen and monarchs, or simply because he is susceptible to the type of flattery that dictators can offer because they are not constrained by the dignity and popular oversight that comes with democracy? But whatever combination of reasons there may be, Trump has consistently, almost gleefully used American power to do the bidding of authoritarian regimes like Egypt, Russia, Saudi Arabia and Turkey. He’s even praised the leadership of adversaries like China and North Korea, all while consistently spitting in the faces of American allies such as the non-Turkey members of NATO: confronted with the reality that ISIS fighters are escaping detention in the current Syrian chaos, he’s essentially said that this is Europe’s problem, not ours. This is not the language of an ally. It seems that the best case scenario going forward is one in which the situation in Syria and across the Middle East does not become radically worse: Syria remains the violent stalemate it’s been for years, Russia’s growing influence and ISIS’ resurgence are limited, and the Kurds mostly survive. But any improvement that happens in the Middle East from here on out will be in spite of President Trump’s withdrawal, not because of it, and many ways in which the region could have advanced have now been sabotaged. President Trump has been trying, ad hoc, to defend what appears to have been a hasty and appallingly poorly-thought out decision, and he’s thrown out many attempts at justification: that we’ve spent enough lives and money in the Middle East, that the Kurds have not been important allies, that the Middle East will always be at war, and so on. These various rationales are all paper-thin, filled with falsehoods, misrepresentations or false dichotomies. At last weekend’s Values Voters Summit, where President Trump tried out many of these justifications in front of a friendly crowd of Evangelical Christians, he eventually revealed what I believe were his true thoughts about the decision to withdraw: “ let’s see what happens.” This is not a policy statement; it’s a callous disregard for consequences and a stunning abdication of responsibility. Even American isolationism after WWI, over the pleas of President Woodrow Wilson, could be explained by weariness from a war that cost over 100,000 American lives (out of a US population one-third the size it is today) and the existence of a world that, although more globalized than it ever had been in the past, was not nearly as interconnected as it is today. In 1918, the idea that America could withdraw to its massive home territory, safely between two oceans, seemed feasible and even consistent with most of the country’s history. In 2019, this type of isolationist thinking is pure fantasy. And it’s not even a fantasy that Donald Trump believes; remember, this Syrian withdrawal comes mere weeks after announcing that America will be sending more troops to Saudi Arabia, a decision that both places American soldiers in the middle of an ongoing conflict between the two biggest powers in the region, Saudi Arabia and Iran, and also echoes the policy that Osama bin Laden used as justification for his jihad against America culminating in September 11, 2001. There is no plan here, no consideration, no morality and no strategy. To call the US withdrawal from northern Syria a blunder underplays the human suffering already happening, and that to follow. This is a disaster, and a completely avoidable one at that. Various presidents of both parties have made bad decisions throughout the history of this country concerning America’s role in the world. This one was the worst so far. Dr. Christopher Rhodes is a lecturer in Social Sciences at Boston University."
Medium.com,Society,John Bolton Is No Hero in the Trump-Ukraine Scandal,World,https://gen.medium.com/john-bolton-is-no-hero-in-the-trump-ukraine-scandal-2565cac8e76f?source=topic_page---------334------------------1," ith every new witness that testifies as part of the impeachment inquiry, we’re learning more about alleged abuses of power and potential criminal activity by the Trump administration. This week we learned at least one senior Trump official wasn’t on board with the scheme to get Ukraine to interfere in the U.S. election: John Bolton, the former national security advisor. Bolton went so far as to describe Rudy Giuliani as a “hand grenade” who’s going to “blow everybody up” with possibly illegal escapades in Ukraine, according to the reported testimony of former Bolton aide Fiona Hill. Hill told Bolton about the rogue effort to extort Ukraine involving Giuliani, ambassador to the European Union Gordon Sondland, and acting White House chief of staff Mick Mulvaney. Bolton allegedly responded by saying, “I am not part of whatever drug deal Sondland and Mulvaney are cooking up,” and told her to take her concerns to a White House lawyer. So Bolton was furious, but national security advisors are supposed to do more than express their feelings. He may be getting some kudos for refusing to play dirty with Giuliani and his henchmen, but as a national security advisor, Bolton could and should have done more. He was the person staff depended on to protect national security and to make sure that the National Security Council (NSC) itself was not aiding, abetting, or covering up illegal or unethical activity. Bolton was sending Hill to speak with someone that was part of the cover-up. I served at the White House under two national security advisors. They didn’t just have an open-door policy with their staff; they had an open, honest, and ongoing conversation with NSC lawyers to make sure that everything we did was in line with the law. If staff came forward with personal concerns or workplace problems, we counted on the advisors to help address them, not brush them off or commiserate. If Bolton didn’t do anything to address his staff’s or his own feelings about President Donald Trump and his corrupt clique’s activities, let alone report them, he was part of the problem. For starters, the lawyer Bolton sent Hill to is reportedly the same lawyer who directed NSC staff to inappropriately hide readouts of Trump’s call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky — and reportedly other officials — on a codeword-protected server. The lawyer, John Eisenberg, was likely part of the abuse of power and was far from an unbiased, safe outlet for voicing concerns and getting them addressed. Bolton was sending Hill to speak with someone that was part of the cover-up. More importantly, Bolton’s antipathy toward Giuliani’s activities is one thing, but he had a duty to do more than complain about it. Bolton’s staff—and national security—depended on him taking steps to neutralize the “hand grenade.” If Bolton was concerned about Guiliani’s behavior, he had a responsibility to alert law enforcement. It’s not like he needed to call 911: As national security advisor, he had a direct line to the White House counsel, the FBI director, and the attorney general. FBI Director Christopher Wray even testified that the FBI would want to know if a foreign government contacted a public official about interfering in a U.S. election. Bolton reportedly had knowledge that Giuliani and senior U.S. government officials were soliciting foreign campaign interference. Not only that, Bolton knew that Trump solicited interference in his call with Zelensky — he signed off on the memo setting up the call even though he wasn’t fully on board with it. As far as we know, Bolton didn’t call the FBI after hearing what Trump told Zelensky, nor did he take action when he heard about Giuliani’s extracurricular activities with Sondland and Volker — he just said he didn’t want to be a part of it. By failing to take any action, Bolton was protecting himself and maybe his job security, but he wasn’t protecting us. Bolton — like Mulvaney and Pompeo — was supposed to be who watched out for and actively addressed concerning behavior that undermined U.S. national security. Instead, he expressed his feelings, but as far as we know, he didn’t act on them. Anyone who thinks Bolton is going to sacrifice himself to help oust Trump or save the country hasn’t been paying close enough attention to what he didn’t do when he was in a position of power."

Medium.com,Society,Trump’s Defenses Against the Impeachment Inquiry Are Suddenly Crumbling,World,https://gen.medium.com/trumps-defenses-against-the-impeachment-inquiry-are-suddenly-crumbling-d38abe48e2d8?source=topic_page---------338------------------1," he cage match between Donald Trump and Democrats in Congress is getting bloodier by the day — and as public opinion shifts in their favor, it’s starting to look more like Democrats might actually have a shot at finally landing some blows. For months, the administration has simply refused to cooperate with congressional inquiries, and Congress has been adding to the list of subpoenaed documents and high-profile players by the day. Things got particularly testy last week when Rep. Rashida Tlaib told reporters that House Democrats were discussing whether they could detain people who refused to cooperate with Congressional subpoenas related to Trump’s call with Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelensky. The president was unsurprisingly irate over the suggestion, calling the Michigan congresswoman a “despicable human being” on Twitter. Yet something appears to have changed recently. Yes, members of the president’s closest circles are refusing to comply with congressional subpoenas, such as Vice President Pence, three cabinet secretaries, and Trump’s personal attorney, Rudy Giuliani — but others have not. They have come forward at some risk to their professional careers, but so far their integrity has not been questioned. Within the last week Congress has heard closed-door testimony from a slew of current and former officials wrapped up in the Ukraine scandal: the former U.S. Ambassador to Ukraine Marie Yovanovitch, and former White House Russia advisor, Fiona Hill. Both of these professionals are career federal servants and described by their peers as non-partisans. In other words, they were close enough to the president to observe what was happening, but not so close as to be part of his sycophantic circle of confidants. Also, after some negotiation and uncertainty, ambassador to the European Union and key figure in the scandal, Gordon Sondland, is scheduled to testify before Congress on Thursday. In addition to the still-masked federal whistleblower, these high-profile actors have defied the president and his claims on executive privilege. They have come forward at some risk to their professional careers, but so far their integrity has not been questioned, nor has the veracity of the information they have provided. Remarkably, these individuals are making a difference in the balance of power between two behemoth branches of government. Meanwhile, public opinion is rapidly changing, and that has real effects. While impeachment has the markers of a legal process, it is primarily a political one. In other words, the weight of public opinion can control the relative amount of power Congress and the Executive branch have. This is because the Constitution is largely silent on how to handle conflicts between the branches, like the one we’re seeing now. We might reasonably consider this to be a constitutional crisis, but because the president and Congress are both elected officials, it means power will shift toward the branch with the most public support. Recent polling shows that, for the first time, more Americans support impeachment than oppose it. According to poll averages, support for impeachment is growing, even among Republicans. Between September 19 and October 9, Democrats increased their support for impeaching the president by 11 points (from 71% to 82%), while independent support grew by 10 points (from 33% to 43%). Mostly notably, support for impeachment among Republicans grew over this time period by 4 points (from 9% to 13%). In terms of understanding how these polls affect the balance of power between Congress and the president, it may be more important to look at the Trump’s overall approval rating. So far, they have ticked marginally downward, but at 41% average approval, he’s not even at the lowest approval marker of his presidency. As long as Trump maintains public support, he’s not likely to back down. But if we see his overall approval numbers take a turn for the worse — say, a drop below 30% — we should expect to see more subpoena compliance, and likely we’ll see impeachment (in the House), and potentially removal from office (in the Senate). We should especially expect to see a change in posture if Republicans turn against the president. The likelihood of Trump’s removal from office is inversely proportional to his approval numbers — meaning as Americans begin to turn on him, it’s more likely he’ll leave office or be removed (an admittedly difficult scenario to imagine). While the president’s approval ratings move glacially, Democrats have quickly rallied around support for impeachment. Recent reporting shows that all but seven of 235 House Democrats support the impeachment inquiry. Unity among the majority party in the House puts the chamber in a much stronger position than it was just a few weeks ago. The president and his closest allies will continue to defy congressional subpoenas, but the tides are turning. The defectors we’ve seen so far — Hill, Yovanovitch, Sondland, and two anonymous whistleblowers — represent chinks in the Trump administration’s armor in its battle against Congress. The House may continue to discuss more aggressive enforcement of subpoenas, but if whistleblowers keep coming out of the Trump administration woodwork, and public opinion continues to move in Congress’s direction — not the president’s — it probably won’t matter that Congress doesn’t actually have a mechanism to enforce their subpoenas that doesn’t involve using the other two branches of government or an actual jail to incarcerate violators. The public will be the enforcer."
Medium.com,Society,Trump’s Ignorance Endangers Innocent Lives,World,https://extranewsfeed.com/trumps-ignorance-endangers-innocent-lives-38d58e9b6c86?source=topic_page---------339------------------1," Trump’s action on Syria is his worst foreign policy blunder to date Trump’s foreign policy decisions have long lacked a consistent driving philosophy, and as a result, have been riddled with contradictions.The decision to withdraw from the Iran Nuclear deal, for example, would seem to indicate that Trump cares little about nuclear disarmament. But his frequent if unproductive talks with North Korea show otherwise. Allies must contribute equally to shared goals, he says in attempt to justify distancing ourselves from our partners in the EU. But just a few weeks ago, we almost went to war with Iran over our commitment to Saudi Arabia (of all places). It’s not exactly unexpected that a President known for unwillingness to learn struggles on the international stage. His own former Secretary of State, Rex Tillerson, has noted that Trump “is pretty undisciplined, doesn’t like to read, doesn’t read briefing reports, doesn’t like to get into the details of a lot of things, but rather just kind of says: ‘This is what I believe.’” Alarming as that may be, domestically, our institutions limit the amount of damage that Trump can do on his own. When Mr. Trump feuds with Federal Reserve over changes to the interest rates, the independence of our central bank prevents him from affecting negative change. When he attempts to repeal the Affordable Care Act, effectively removing millions of people from their health insurance, Congress’ legislative authority acts as a check on such a radical proposal. But global politics are different. Unlike the systems that govern individual countries, there are no common authorities with the power to check reckless heads of state or enforce multilateral agreements. Nobody, not even the UN, can compel a state to act a particular way purely by virtue of its existence. Political scientists call this “anarchy.” In an anarchic system, a president is free to act as he pleases without severe consequences from external agents. Consequently, those whose actions on the international stage lack a foundational, philosophical underpinning can subject the world to unexpected yet severe damage. Trump’s recent action on Syria is an excellent example of this principle at work. Trump’s decision to withdraw some 100 troops from Syria was completely unexpected and immediately repudiated by US lawmakers. Republicans and Democrats alike strongly condemned the action and implored Trump to reverse course. Mitch McConell, a consistent defender of even Trump’s most extreme policies, had this to say: Abandoning this fight now and withdrawing U.S. forces from Syria would re-create the very conditions that we have worked hard to destroy and invite the resurgence of ISIS. And such a withdrawal would also create a broader power vacuum in Syria that will be exploited by Iran and Russia, a catastrophic outcome for the United States’ strategic interests. Lindsey Graham similarly sparked surprise among political junkies by openly disagreeing with Trump, calling the decision “impulsive” and further condemning it as “shortsighted and irresponsible.” Calamity ensued. Once Trump announced his decision, Turkey immediately engaged in an offensive operation to remove the Kurdish people from the region. The Kurds, desperate for assistance and aware that the US would not lend its support, struck a deal with Bashar al-Assad of Syria, allowing Assad to deploy troops along the border and protect the Kurds from the Turkish offensive. Our withdrawal from Syria has evidently created chaos in the region and will invariably result in innocent deaths. These are avoidable casualties as well, since the Turkish offensive arguably would not have happened without Trump’s erratic and unpredictable action. Despite condemnation from both the UN and NATO, Erdogan shows no sign of backing down from his military operation. And Trump has given no indication that he will back down on his decision either, opting instead to sanction Turkey (a move which will do nothing to prevent the inevitable slaughter of the Kurds). Even today, political experts are mystified by Trump’s seemingly random directive on Syria. On twitter, he retroactively tried to justify the withdrawal by claiming the United States must cease “endless wars” and that it is in our best interest to put “America first.” But again, Trump shows not even a hint of consistency with his message here. “America first” has been used selectively by the Trump administration to justify its questionable policy practices. That America would benefit from ending unnecessary wars is true almost by definition, but not one Trump official made this observation when tensions with Iran were building. Similarly, our nonsensical trade war with China has hurt the American people by placing the incidence of the tax on our consumers. Yet Trump has all but ignored the obvious and instead has tried to tape over these problems by subsidizing those most affected by the tariffs rather than ending the trade war altogether. Not to sound repetitive, but none of this is really surprising once one realizes that Trump has no consistent policy preferences. We saw a glimpse of this in one of the debates, when he extolled his lack of foreign policy ideas, pretending his non-plan was a strategic way to hide our tactics from ISIS. Far from just being an embarrassment to the millions of people who have an in-depth knowledge of public policy, his ignorance on these matters is actively dangerous. As is evident in his recent decision on Syria, Trump is an unpredictable figure who acts not according to any set of reasonable principles but instead on pure whim. And in this case, people will die because of his erraticism. There is no other way to put it: the blood of the Kurds is on Donald Trump’s hands."
Medium.com,Society,Mexican Women Journalists Are Suffering a National Mental Health Crisis,World,https://zora.medium.com/mexican-women-journalists-are-suffering-a-national-mental-health-crisis-1d2290f80f1?source=topic_page---------340------------------1," the summer of 2017, Melva Frutos, Inés García, and Miriam Ramírez attended a holistic security workshop for female journalists in a rustic hacienda along the outskirts of Oaxaca City in southern Mexico. Surrounded by picturesque gardens and century-old trees, they shared their reporting experiences as if they’d known each other before and expressed diverse “sensations” they’ve been experiencing for the past years. “Symptoms” was not a word they used. Rather anxiety, mistrust, hypervigilance, isolation, insomnia, depression, and emotional detachment were new additions to their lives to which they simply had to conform. But it wasn’t until that weekend in July that they learned whatever was happening to them individually was also happening to other colleagues. Mexico is one of the most dangerous countries for journalists due to the current climate of violence and the government’s failure to address impunity in attacks on journalists. Despite his pledge to protect the press, President Andrés Manuel López Obrador has also been using rhetoric to attack it, which is often reproduced by state and local officials. The emotional and psychological impact of covering and living in these complex realities, nevertheless, is often left out of the conversation. There has been a growing recognition, mostly in the Anglo-Saxon world, of the occupational hazards for journalists covering traumatic events and the impact on their well-being. Although most journalists exhibit resilience, a significant minority are at risk for mental health conditions, like post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), developed within three months or in the years following a frightening or distressing event, and secondary traumatic stress (STS), also known as vicarious trauma, caused by indirect exposure either when working with victims or covering traumatic events. PTSD and STS, however, are terms more commonly used among foreign correspondents and rarely appropriated by Mexican journalists. “Since the term was created for war combatants, and here we haven’t been in an open war, at the international level post-traumatic stress was not taken into account,” explains Juan Carlos Segarra, an emergency psychologist working with journalists across Latin America. “However, the stress that arises in reporters is much more complex than in war because in war you know what you’re going to face. You know the images, the smells, everything you’re going to see at that moment. In Mexico, you can go to a simple interview and end up kidnapped or in a shooting or beaten or raped.”"
Medium.com,Society,"Usually When We Get Hired To Do A Job, The Person Who Pays Us Is Our Boss…",World,https://medium.com/@ericjscholl/usually-when-we-get-hired-to-do-a-job-the-person-who-pays-us-is-our-boss-11420291670e?source=topic_page---------341------------------1," The Saudis are paying the bill! Whoo-hoo! Wait a sec. Doesn’t that make them Trump’s boss? Not just nominally? And what happens if the U.S. refuses to do the Saudis’ bidding at some point? Do they borrow another page out of the Trump playbook and stiff the U.S. for what they owe? Or does the U.S. military suck it up and act as a purely mercenary force with Trump as Commander-in-Chief? There are just so many reasons this arrangement that Trump’s so proud of, is a crappy idea. We understand why Trump likes it: it’s part of his new world order. Though at the same time, it’s incredibly hypocritical. Because at the same time as Trump is committing 1,800 U.S. soldiers to Saudi Arabia (whoever is paying for it), he’s also pulling the few U.S. troops left, out of Syria. BTW, he’s sending almost double the number of troops to Saudi Arabia that he’s pulling out of Syria. And the reasons he’s using to justify that action, is pretty much exactly the opposite of how he’s justifying being in Saudi Arabia. Trump Tweets “Endless Wars!”, but what we’ve seen in the past few days demonstrates the small U.S. presence remaining in Syria was actually preventing a war, since as soon as the U.S. left, Turkey launched a major offensive, which was no way not planned. Trump’s published a note, threatening Turkey with very, very bad economic things; pretending to be shocked and surprised. He shouldn’t be. As the New York Times aptly puts it: “Having essentially greenlighted the Turkish incursion a week ago, then threatening ruin to Turkey’s economy, on Monday Mr. Trump announced sanctions on Turkey, raising tariffs on steel and suspending negotiations on a $100 billion trade deal with Ankara.” We still think Turkey’s going to get its U.S. made F-35 fighter jets, even though technically those deliveries are suspended right now. Just a hunch on our part, but we think supported by the fact that Trump makes no mention of those jets in his threatening note. Meanwhile, putting a larger number of U.S. troops in Saudi Arabia increases the chances they’ll be involved in armed conflict there, because Iran’s been making a habit of taunting and doing damage to its adversaries in the region, principal among them being Saudi Arabia. And it’s been effective. Effective enough to get Trump to send troops over. (Also, when Trump says someone agreed to do something, often it means just some kind of nebulous promise. So we’re hoping he holds up a check at some point signed by the Crown Prince, and what the President’s talking about isn’t just some Saudi pledge or something to at some point buy more U.S. made arms.) And anyway, if Trump is using as an excuse that Syria is “7,000 miles away!”, and the U.S. needs to singularly focus on “our Southern Border which abuts and is part of the United States of America”, you know who else is 7,000 miles away? Saudi Arabia. If “Anyone who wants to assist Syria in protecting the Kurds is good with me, whether it is Russia, China, or Napoleon Bonaparte”, why isn’t the same true with protecting Saudi Arabia from Iran? Because they’ve got the cash to pay? Because they sit on a huge amount of oil and it’s real important to Trump to make sure Americans don’t pay too much for gas? What happens if Saudi Arabia wants to do something the U.S. doesn’t agree with? Or the U.S. military wants to do something the Saudis don’t like? (There’s a lot that could potentially fall into these categories: involving Yemen, involving Israel, involving Russia, involving Saudi Arabia internally). We totally get that Trump wants NATO member countries to pay proportionally to their GDP to keep that organization operating. Having Saudi Arabia pay for the U.S. to act as bodyguards against Iran is a totally different thing. Especially when the President’s arguing at the same time that it was completely and utterly wrong for the U.S. to help the Kurds guard against annihilation by Turkey."
Medium.com,Society,China’s Rocky History with Video Games,World,https://medium.com/@jpkilcrease/chinas-rocky-history-with-video-games-4f26cdbe22d8?source=topic_page---------342------------------1," On October 8th, after winning a Hearthstone Grandmasters match, professional player Chung Ng Wai (known as “Blitzchung”) put on a gas mask similar to that of the Hong Kong protestors and proclaimed “Liberate Hong Kong, revolution of our age!” Immediately, the cameras cut to commercial. The following day, Blizzard, the company behind the popular card game, stripped Blitzchung of his winnings, dismissed him from the Grandmasters tournament, and gave him a 12-month ban from competitive Hearthstone. The VODs containing his statement were removed from Twitch, and both of the casters conducting the interview were fired; neither were given a clear reason for their termination. Now Blizzard has since diminished some of these decisions, but it’s still clear from this and many other recent examples that China has a massive influence over Western video game publishers. As the extent of this influence becomes more and more apparent, it raises a number of questions. How did China, a country known for its aversion to any kind of outside influence, with a historic track record fighting against the medium of gaming, become such a vital market for modern video game companies? And what does this mean for the future of gaming as a whole? China has had a largely negative relationship with video games throughout much of its history. In the late 80s, while in-home video game consoles were taking Japan and the US by storm, China had positioned itself firmly against this growing market. Between insanely high tariffs (as high as 130%) and a thriving black market, many companies struggled to gain an economic foothold in the Chinese entertainment market. There was also a lot of social resistance to gaming, as many were concerned about the impact it would have on youth and their education. Still, the popularity of gaming grew, and in 2000, China’s communist government took action against it. They passed a bill largely restricting the import of consoles into the Chinese market. “The manufacturing and selling of any digital gaming devices, plus their parts and accessories, to domestic areas is to be stopped immediately. No companies or individuals can partake in the manufacturing and selling of digital gaming devices and their parts and accessories headed to domestic areas . . . . With the exception of processing trade, the import of digital gaming devices and their parts and accessories through other forms of trade is strictly limited.” It also created guidelines for the content that was allowed in video games, allowing the government to ban or heavily censor games that were brought into the country. Somewhat recent examples of banned games include Battlefield 4, and they’ve censored a number of popular titles like World of Warcraft and Dota 2. Despite this, companies still attempted to find ways to circumvent these regulations. Perhaps most notable was Nintendo’s collaboration with Chinese-American company Wei Yen to create the iQue Player, essentially an N64 knock-off specifically created to skirt Chinese law. Even given their best efforts, none of the major console manufacturers were able to find much economic success in the Chinese market. Still, gaming grew in popularity among Chinese youth. PC gaming was largely unaffected by the console ban, and this resulted in an explosion in the popularity of internet gaming cafes, the number of them reaching 146,000 by 2015. Video games continued to become more prevalent, and along with them came a fear of youth addiction. Resulting, at least in part, from the infamous one-child policy, China saw growth in gaming addiction problems, and the government attempted to curb this by introducing laws designed to limit the playtime of gamers under the age of 18. In July of 2007, the Chinese government began requiring its citizens to use their government ID numbers for online games and created rules that forced game developers to half all in-game credits after 3 hours of uninterrupted playtime and to completely wipe all in-game credits earned after a 5+ hour session. Even after the law went into effect, a number of games failed to have the anti-addiction software incorporated, and many young gamers were able to circumvent the software by using an older family member’s ID number. Despite the many economic, social, and legal barriers, video games continued to garner more and more attention in China, and with the growing economic impact of the global video game market, it was only a matter of time before China took a second look at their views on gaming. In July of 2015, China finally lifted its “ban” on video game consoles, explicitly allowing manufacturers like Sony and Microsoft to sell their systems in the country. Additionally, thanks to an influx of powerful smartphones, China continued to generate immense revenue for the mobile gaming market. Even still, regulations have continued to slow things down. In 2018, the Chinese government halted the game approval process, disallowing new games to be distributed within the country while the departments responsible reorganized. The freeze lasted nine months, and by the time they resumed, roughly 5,000 games were lined up, waiting to be approved or rejected. On top of this, China’s Ministry of Education released recommendations for further regulations regarding the playtime of minors, as well as a call to restrict how many online games are approved. With as many roadblocks as there are for video game companies to enter the Chinese market, it’s still so substantial that it can’t be ignored. Analysts project that the revenue from Chinese gamers will hit $36.5 billion by the end of the year. And that brings us to today, where the relationship between China and western video game publishers has become absolutely vital to the latter’s business. China has also acquired a vested interest in the games market. Chinese-owned Tencent, one of the largest entertainment companies in the world, outright owns Riot Games (League of Legends) and owns at least a part of Epic Games, Bluehole, Ubisoft, Activision-Blizzard, and many other western publishers. They also have the exclusive rights to publish most or all of their partner’s games in China, giving them immense leverage over a number of these companies. If you follow sports, you may have also heard their name in conjunction with the suspension of NBA broadcasts after a pro-Hong Kong tweet from a Houston Rockets executive. This, coupled with the Hearthstone ban, has resulted in enormous backlash from western audiences, who find China’s apparent influence over US-based media companies deeply concerning. Since this backlash, Blizzard has reduced its punishment, and Tencent has resumed streaming NBA games (though it’s still unclear if it will stream games from all NBA teams). It appears both US and Chinese companies are hoping that the controversy will blow over in the coming months, and while only time will tell, it wouldn’t come as a shock to see this firestorm fizzle into the new year without much remembrance. Then again, maybe this will spark greater scrutiny of publishers in the future, as well as increased awareness regarding Hong Kong’s fight for democracy. We’ll just have to wait and see."
Medium.com,Society,Journalist Ito Shiori Sues Alleged Rapist for 11 Million Yen — Unseen Japan,World,https://medium.com/@unseenjapan/journalist-ito-shiori-sues-alleged-rapist-for-11-million-yen-unseen-japan-5dd1619814ac?source=topic_page---------343------------------1," No name is more associated with Japan’s #MeToo movement than journalist and filmmaker Ito Shiori (伊藤詩織). After her public accusation of rape against high-ranking TBS journalist Yamaguchi Noriyuki ( 山口敬之 )in 2015, Ito has gone on to defy Japan’s legal handling of sexual assault. International news outlets claim her as the woman who first broke Japan’s silence on rape. Ito’s battle for personal justice is far from over. She officially filed a lawsuit on October 7 with the Tokyo Central Court seeking 11 million yen ($98,000 USD) in damages. Both Ito and Yamaguchi were present at the filing. Ito’s father also attended the filing to support his daughter. The court will deliberate and hand out a ruling on December 18. A group was established earlier this year to help Ito put together her lawsuit. The group is called “Open the Black Box” after Ito’s 2017 book “Black Box” (ブラックボックス). After filing the lawsuit, Ito spoke to a gathering of supporters outside the House of Councilors: 「結果はどうなるかわかりませんが、この歩みを少しでもみなさんに見ていただいて、これからの法改正や、どんな支援が必要なのかというところにたどり着く鍵になってほしい」 “I don’t know yet what the result will be, but I’d like everyone to see this small progress as the key towards realizing what support is needed for future legislation.” After she went public with her sexual assault, Ito made it her mission to support victims of sexual assault and challenge Japan’s perspective on rape. As a result, Ito is a beacon of hope for justice and change. Last month in Tokyo, Ito, along with #KuToo founder Ishikawa Yumi, participated in a monthly “Flower Demo” protesting the mishandling of sexual crimes. Roughly 200 supporters attended and listened to speeches by both Ishikawa and Ito. Ito made her speech dressed in the very outfit she wore on the night of her assault — black pants, a black shirt, and a pale white cardigan. Ito shared her thoughts on consent and ended with the words, “It’s not consent, no matter what you wear.” Japan has a morbid track record handling sexual assault cases. The outrage and disgust when idol Yamaguchi Mato faced pressure from her company to apologize for her own assault highlight the kind of treatment sexual assault victims face. The dismissal of a series of high-profile sexual assault cases earlier this year prompted people to call Japan a “rape paradise” (強姦天国). Ito’s treatment by the media is not out of the norm, unfortunately. Yet Ito continues to hope and work. On October 7, a supporter asked Ito how to support victims of sexual violence. Ito responded, 「…性暴力の被害を受けた方々に対して世間があたたかい温度にできるように、ポジティブな言葉だったり、『あなただけじゃない』というメッセージをどんどん発信していただけたら、と思います」 “I hope that victims of sexual violence will receive words of encouragement and messages like “You’re not the only one” so that the world can understand them.” Alyssa Pearl Fusek is a freelance writer and aspiring JP-En translator currently living in Northern California.

Medium.com,Society,"When it comes to coups, timing is a curious pattern.",World,https://medium.com/the-die-is-forecast/when-it-comes-to-coups-timing-is-a-curious-pattern-3429f417f431?source=topic_page---------345------------------1," This post is a guest contribution by OEF/University of Denver post-doctoral fellow William Akoto. William’s work covers the intersection between foreign investment, trade and aid on international relations and coups in the developing world. On June 8 2003, a group of army officers in Mauritania staged a coup attempt to depose incumbent president Maaouya Ould Sid Ahmed Taya. The debate surrounding the timing of coups and their success or failure raises an interesting question — is there ever really a good time for a coup? After a 36 hour gun battle, 15 people were dead and the rebellion was over. One hundred and twenty-nine officers suspected of involvement in the coup were swiftly rounded up and put on trial months later on charges of high treason, assassination and sabotage. More recently, the Turkish government arrested 223 serving military officers across the country in its continuing efforts to round up persons suspected of involvement in the failed July 2016 coup. In the three years since the failed coup, more than 77,000 people have been jailed pending trial and over 150,000 military personnel and civil servants have been suspended from their jobs or sacked for their suspected support or involvement in the coup attempt. D
ebate about why coups fail still rages on but there is some suggestion that coups may fail because they are poorly timed. In the case of the Turkish coup attempt, perhaps the conspirators should have aborted the coup once word leaked to state intelligence agencies. Perhaps they should have delayed it until they had sufficient broad support within the military and among the domestic political elite. The debate surrounding the timing of coups and their success or failure raises an interesting question — is there ever really a good time for a coup? Assuming coup conspirators have broad support within the military and civil society and manage to keep the plot sufficiently hidden from state security agencies, is the coup guaranteed to succeed or does the specific timing of the coup matter? The academic literature provides little guidance on this issue, but historical coup data provides interesting clues. Coup data from 1950 to present, compiled by Political Scientists Jonathan Powell and Clayton Thyne, suggest that July is the second most popular month for coups, tied with April and October (March and November are joint first place). The failed 2016 Turkish coup attempt was in July. Picking July for their coup attempt might not have been a bad choice — 55% of all coups attempted in July succeed, the third highest success rate for any month. For the Mauritanian coup conspirators, June was a terrible month for a coup. Only 42% of all June coups succeed, the second lowest success rate (behind December) for any month of the year. November or August, with success rates of 57% and 56% respectively, may have been better choices based on a reading of historical patterns. But what about the specific day a coup takes place? The magic appears to happen on the 24th of the month. A whopping 86% of all coups attempted on this date succeed. The Turkish conspirators chose the 15th of the month for their coup and the data further suggests this might have been bad timing. Historically, coups staged on the 15th of the month have a relatively high failure rate of 48%. It also certainly didn’t help that the 15th of July was a Friday. According to the historical coup data, 49% of all Friday coups fail. In the Mauritanian case, June 8 was a Sunday — even worse than Friday for a coup attempt. Fifty-six percent of all Sunday coups fail, the highest of any day. In general, coup conspirators appear to actively avoid staging coups on weekends. The weekend is for sports, meeting up with friends or catching up on some yard work. As a result, adding a coup to the weekend to-do-list may be a stretch too far for most putschists. Conspirators also appear to prefer Thursday coups. However the data suggests Wednesdays actually offer the better chance for success — 55% of all Wednesday coups succeed (although Thursday is not too far behind at 54%). In reality, coup attempts are highly complex and the structural conditions permitting coup plotters to go forward involve a multitude of factors. But historical patterns in timing regarding success and failure remain curious. We may never know why a particular coup happens on any specific day but future coup plotters may want to think carefully about when to schedule D-day. A Wednesday coup on the 24th of November might be a good bet. The next November 24th that falls on a Wednesday is in 2021 and one may want to keep an eye on such an auspicious date."
Medium.com,Society,Report Finds Human Rights Abuses Linked to Most Renewable Energy Companies,World,https://medium.com/citizen-truth/report-finds-human-rights-abuses-linked-to-most-renewable-energy-companies-a68fac5a0b44?source=topic_page---------346------------------1," A corporate watchdog found last month that most of the top global companies extracting minerals for renewable energy infrastructure have been accused of human rights abuses in their mines. As the Guardian’s Kate Hodal reported: “Analysis published by the Business & Human Rights Resource Centre (BHRRC), an international corporate watchdog, revealed that 87% of the 23 largest companies mining cobalt, copper, lithium, manganese, nickel and zinc — the six minerals essential to the renewable energy industry — have faced allegations of abuse including land rights infringements, corruption, violence or death over the past 10 years. As the global economy switches to low-carbon technologies to combat global heating, demand for minerals could rise by as much as 900% by 2050, according to World Bank estimates.” Critics argue that the burgeoning renewable energy sector must not forfeit its moral upper hand over the fossil fuel industry by engaging in brutal capitalist extraction. “As the renewable energy sector finds its feet, it is crucial that it introduces rigorous human rights protections throughout its supply chains,” BHRRC senior researcher Eniko Horvath told the Guardian. “This is essential in order to prevent abuse, retain the social license to operate, and avoid costly delays due to local opposition.” BHRRC’s deputy director Marti Flacks told the Guardian that the lack of oversight in countries where minerals are mined allow companies to get away with abuses, and that the industry should take human rights into its own hands as the world transitions to clean energy. “The renewable energy sector is growing really fast and it has a chance to change the standards and practices of the industry,” said Flacks. “This is a unique chance to send the sector a message to say: ‘You have to do your due diligence, you have to have a human rights policy and you have to be engaging in multi-stakeholder initiatives, doing site visits, and most importantly talking to communities and NGOs to get accurate reporting of what’s going on.’” The Democratic Republic of Congo, where more than 70% of the world’s cobalt is mined, received the highest amount of recorded abuses, with copper mines in Zambia closely following. Reports found that tens of thousands of cobalt miners endure dangerous working conditions and toxic pollution. Many of these miners are believed to be children. The DRC has a long history of Western exploitation, from the horrors enacted by the Belgians under King Leopold in the 19th century to the CIA-backed murder of the country’s first democratically-elected leader, Patrice Lumumba, in 1961. Lumumba’s execution was also tied to conflict minerals, as the United States used uranium from Congolese mines to develop the first atomic bombs in Hiroshima and Nagosaki, and feared Lumumba’s “determination to achieve genuine independence and to have full control over Congo’s resources,” as explained by African history expert Dr. Georges Nzongola-Ntalaja. As investigative journalist Nick Turse recently wrote, the Congo’s century-old wounds linger in what remains “one of the most persistent bloodlettings on this planet, which is likely to continue taking a terrible toll in the years to come as the world turns a blind eye to it all.” The BHRRC has created a tool to help interested parties track allegations of abuse in the renewable energy sector, as activists hope to push the industry to break from the centuries-long oppression that has characterized Western extraction in the Global South.

Medium.com,Society,U.S. forces (and policy) in Syria head south,World,https://medium.com/@hcobban/u-s-forces-and-policy-in-syria-head-south-abfe10b6a65c?source=topic_page---------347------------------1," Washington, DC — It took less than a week after President Trump announced the summary withdrawal of the tripwire U.S. force deployed in northeast Syria alongside the Kurdish-dominated “Syrian Democratic Forces” (SDF), before the SDF concluded a new alliance with the Syrian government. What happened between, of course, was the large-scale incursion of Turkish forces into the SDF-held part of Syria. The Wall Street Journal reports today that Sinam Mohamad, the foreign representative for the SDF’s political arm, said that the SDF force, which Washington has spent hundreds of millions of dollars to train, arm, and support, could now “become part of the Syrian army.” There has been much handwringing here in the United States, both about Pres. Trump’s “betrayal” of the Kurds and about the fact that he seems ready, more broadly, to abandon the regime change project in Syria which for more than eight years has been a favored cause of the powerful “humanitarian interventionist” bloc in Washington. Yes, the Syrian Kurds have been badly misused by Washington (as the Iraqi Kurds were in 1975 and 1991.) But in 2014, when the catastrophe of the ISIS caliphate erupted into northeast Syria and northwest Iraq, those Kurds chose to partner with the United States rather than with their own national government — which was also very highly motivated to fight ISIS. There was always a degree of mutual/self-deception by both sides in that Kurdish-American alliance. The Americans were extremely happy to use the Kurds not only to counter ISIS but also to counter the Damascus government. (Once ISIS had been defeated, U.S. spokespeople justified the continued presence of U.S. forces in Syria by saying they hoped their presence would “strengthen the hands of the Kurds/SDF in any future negotiation with Damascus.” In reality, that was always code for “continuing to curb the power of Damascus as much as possible.”) And in order to continue their cozy alliance with the Kurds, the American military seemed happy to completely overlook the very evident fact that their main allies, the Kurdish YPG, were actually, all along, just a Syrian-Kurdish branch of the Turkish-Kurdish “PKK” organization, which has been on the U.S. terrorism list for many years and which has mounted intermittent armed insurgencies against the Turkish government for several decades — including one that re-erupted in 2015. So of course, the Ankara government was upset with the U.S.-YPG alliance. That is not to excuse their behavior in Syria over the past week. But it does help explain it. As best I can understand Ankara’s current war plan, it would be to establish a continuous cordon sanitaire within northeastern Syria, that would prevent the YPG from being able easily to communicate with, and send arms and men into, the majority-Kurd parts of southeast Turkey. And the Turkish plan also seems to involve settling within the cordon sanitaire some of the three million or so Syrian refugees that Turkey has been hosting (with rapidly mounting reluctance) since almost the start of the civil conflict in Syria. So from Ankara’s perspective, this plan could help kill a number of birds with one stone: As I noted here, back in July, northern Syria has for a while now been a hornet’s nest in which major geopolitical shifts have been enacted. For Russia, of course, the increasingly deep split between the two NATO allies, Turkey and the United States, is a notable achievement. Turkey long played a distinctive role in NATO, as the easternmost NATO power and (until the 1990s) the only one with frontage onto the Black Sea. Over the coming days and weeks, as the U.S. forces hurry out of most of Syria — though will they remain in Tanf? — there will almost certainly be a race between the Turks and their allies, on one hand, and the SDF and their powerful new allies the Syrian Arab Army on the other, to seize/retain control of as much of the formerly SDF-held terrain as possible. Already, the SAA has sent some troops and reinforcements into Qamishli and Hasakeh. What role will Russia’s diplomats and the Russian air and ground forces in Syria play in all this? We could perhaps look over to Idlib, in northwest Syria, where the genocidal takfiris of the Al-Qaeda-linked Hayat Tahrir al-Sham (HTS) have received broad backing from Turkey, which also borders their enclave. There, the Turks and Russians have played an uneasy game of military coordination to avoid direct, open conflict between them — despite Moscow remaining strongly on the record as supporting the full territorial integrity of Syria. Will we see something similar happening in the northeast? There is also, of course, the alarming “wild card” of possible — and already reported — mass breakouts of many of the ISIS fighters and supporters who were previously detained by the SDF. One could argue that all the state actors in the region and many non-state actors as well, including the SDF, have a strong interest in preventing any ISIS resurgence. However, we need to remember that Turkey bears the prime responsibility for the massive infiltration into all parts of northern Syria of ISIS fighters and Al-Qaeda/HTS fighters from all around the world. And Turkey, the United States, Saudi Arabia, and the UAE all bear joint responsibility for the vast infusions of arms and money that the HTS-affiliated groups received throughout many years. From the U.S. side, there were numerous serious deceptions involved in that relationship. The Syrian regime-change groups receiving U.S. arms and money over the past 8.5 years were all described to the American public as wonderful, idealistic “democrats” — except that most of the weapons and funding send by the united States ended up in the hands of the genocidal HTS. And the principal non-takfiri regime-change militia that was backed by Washington and its EU allies was the “Free Syrian Army”… which these days is the backbone of the “Syrian” force that Ankara is injecting into northeastern Syria. By all accounts, those fighters, too, are very far from Jeffersonian democrats. So this, at this point, is what has become of the always illegal (under international law) and always badly misguided U.S. attempt to bring about regime change in Syria through violent means. Syria’s war-devastated country and people are slightly better off today than their even more tragic counterparts in Libya. (At least the Syrians have a national government and some hope of rebuilding their country.) But the moral balance-sheet of the civil war that Washington has stoked in Syria for the past 8.5 years is truly a morass. It is long past time now that the U.S. government and people give up on the dangerous illusion that they (we) have any right to determine the futures of other countries. In Syria, as in Libya and elsewhere, we can see what “humanitarian interventionism” (aka imperialism with a ‘humanitarian’ face) has led to. Time, I think, to return to the 350-year-old truths of the Treaty of Westphalia."
Medium.com,Society,Once Upon A Time in the World: Why Turkey and the US Can’t Get Along,World,https://medium.com/@jeffhba/once-upon-a-time-in-the-world-why-turkey-and-the-us-cant-get-along-353734980a3f?source=topic_page---------348------------------1," History is the version of past events that people have decided to agree upon — Napoleon I remember when those crazy looking ISIS goons started showing up in the papers. Fresh fears of terror delivered straight to America’s doorsteps. Chicago-raised Journalist James Foley, kneeling in that orange jumpsuit, could have been anybody’s friend or neighbor. ISIS quickly became a household name in America. It began dripping off the tongues of Americans with our characteristic twangs, like we were talking about gee-tars, or I-raq, or Coca Cola. The branding of ISIS was as effective as it was misleading. Also known as “The Islamic State” — as if it embodied the most perfect expression of political Islam the world had ever seen — the ragtag gang of killers and pillagers tried their best to give the West nightmares. And they did. According to the Pew Research Center’s Spring 2015 Global Attitudes Survey, conducted less than a year after Foley was executed, all North American and Western European countries surveyed listed ISIS at their top concern. Even South Korea and Japan did. So you’d expect that a country like Turkey, situated near ISIS territory, would be even more worried. Right? Actually, they weren’t. The same Pew report showed that while 73 percent of Turks had an unfavorable view of ISIS, only 33 percent considered it a top threat — less than half the percentage of Americans who did. ISIS hadn’t attacked Turkey yet. Climate change was deemed the top global threat among a plurality of Turks, clocking in at 35 percent. US diplomats and politicians continue to hold a grudge against Turkey for not joining in the fight against ISIS. In 2014, Turkey watched on idly as ISIS slaughtered Kurds near its border. Yet since then ISIS has also attacked Turkey more than once, killing many more people there than it ever did in America. Geographically speaking, telling Turkey it wasn’t concerned enough about ISIS was perhaps as weird as if Turkey told America it wasn’t concerned enough about Mexican drug cartels. Washington’s decision to support Kurdish fighters in Syria won no sympathy from Ankara, either. They were seen by many Turks as linked to a 40-year-long domestic terrorist insurgency, and the US was thought to be fighting terrorists with terrorists. Unfavorable views of the US jumped from 73 percent that year to 79 percent in 2017, the highest in a decade. That year Pew also found that 72 percent of Turks considered US power and influence the top threat in the world, higher than in any of the other 40 countries they surveyed. Now, President Trump is being blasted for withdrawing support from Kurdish forces in Syria. Critics say we’re betraying an ally who helped us fight ISIS. That’s true. But what’s also true is that America betrayed its longtime NATO ally, Turkey, by supporting Kurdish fighters along its border. All of this is happening because once upon a time in the world, ISIS scared America much more than it scared Turkey. The Turkish-American alliance can’t be fixed until the two countries agree on what threatens them. (And no, Turkish President Erdogan’s communication style and diplomatic tactics are not doing Turkey any favors.)"

Medium.com,Society,India’s International Isolation on Kashmir,World,https://medium.com/@aqpk/indias-international-isolation-on-kashmir-eee8f4cc2e59?source=topic_page---------350------------------1," India’s Hitler is Isolated in Kashmir
India today is globally isolated in Kashmir. Not a single country today endorses India’s annexation of Jammu and Kashmir. The United Nations system and the global media consider Kashmiri territories as disputed under international law. Indian leaders and diplomats face harsh questions in every international forum on New Delhi’s one-sided escalation of tensions in a region where the international focus is on ending wars and bringing peace, as is being done in Afghanistan. India’s reckless decision opens a new opportunity for the international community to resolve the oldest pending dispute on UN Security Council agenda — and it is possible. Instead of playing a constructive role for stability, there is reasonable doubt that India is trying to disrupt Afghan peace process by distracting Pakistan and the United States, and likely even disrupting a key component of President Trump’s 2020 midterm election campaign: a successful withdrawal from Afghanistan. Indian policies are disruptive, favoring an unstable Afghanistan to keep Pakistan in turmoil, and refusing market access to American and European products, in unfair trade practices. On Kashmir, India has ensured the failure of every single effort to resolve the conflict bilaterally. If a book is written on Kashmir negotiations, it will mostly be about how Indian leaders and diplomats played every trick in the book to delay, disrupt, and obstruct a final peaceful settlement of the conflict. In 72 years, instead of inching closer to a solution, India did everything it could to expand disputes, issues, and hatred in order to make conflict resolution in Kashmir impossible with each passing day. This Indian obsession has led to the unleashing of Nazi-style violent fascist ideology called Hindutva, in which women, minorities, and foreigners are assaulted and where stick-wielding, frothing, and swearing mobs are free to lynch anyone at will, record videos of the violent attacks and upload to social media and celebrate it as the Indian state watches. As the world ends its half a century of silence on Kashmir, and as Kashmiri suffering finds a global voice, it is now time to force a peaceful solution in Kashmir through mediated, multilateral diplomacy that includes a UN-supervised referendum at some point, and also hold India accountable to the ideals of liberal democracy and open society to which it claims ownership as the world’s largest democracy by size. India-made Disaster in Kashmir
India’s credentials as a responsible member of the international community face a serious challenge in 2019. New Delhi, long seen as a possible anchor for stability in Asia, plunged the region and the world in a territorial and religious dispute under the shadow of a nuclear war. India did this by taking a blunt unilateral action in Kashmir on August 5, revoking the autonomous rule in a sensitive region, and inviting Indian citizens — a billion of them — to throng Kashmir to buy land and turn 12 million Kashmiris into a minority. And since India is predominantly Hindu while Kashmir is predominantly Muslim, this is a recipe for a Bosnia-style genocide that would drag in nuclear-armed neighbors Pakistan and China. The crisis is compounded by a telephone and internet blackout, a curfew, and nearly a million Indian soldiers patrolling the streets of Kashmir. The curfew has led to shortages in food and medicine. The crisis is so sudden that it caught regional and big powers by surprise. They were busy in talks with Iran, trade wars and deals, and the situation in Hong Kong and Lebanon. Pakistan and the United States were busy in an Afghan peace deal, marking a shift in the relations of the Cold War allies. The surprise Indian escalation in Kashmir means Islamabad might get distracted in Afghanistan as well as Washington, and President Trump’s 2020 reelection bid might also be impacted negatively if tensions escalate further. Pakistan, the decades-old flagbearer of Kashmiris’ right to self-determination, has made it clear that it will not allow India to annex Kashmiri territory and push Kashmiris out as refugees. The Indian action has drawn unprecedented global reaction. This is likely the first time that Indian leaders find themselves at the receiving end of a global backlash, a situation they did not experience at any time since India became a country out of British colonies in 1947. Why India Did This
This is a stunning fall from grace for a country that was expected to play a role commensurate with its size, and where liberal values were supposed to foster a tolerant, constructive view of the neighborhood and the world. Instead, India is undergoing the birth pangs of a violent, segregationist, fascist ideology based on a twisted version of Hinduism, otherwise a powerful religion, that targets Christianity, Islam, and India’s own underprivileged class of untouchables, the Dalits. Behold the latest version of India: the world’s largest democracy is embroiled in the world’s largest military curfew and communication blackout, with no phones, internet, and outdoor movement for more than eight million residents in Kashmir. This international dispute, simmering since 1947, is the world’s oldest pending conflict at the UN Security Council, preceding even the Palestinian-Israeli conflict, which hogs more headlines but is probably not as urgent as Kashmir at this stage, both politically and in terms of the humanitarian crisis. For all its international stature, India is unable to maturely resolve a territorial dispute with a smaller neighbor. Kashmir issue has not been resolved mainly because Indian leaders will not sit down with Pakistan and work around an impartial UN-supervised referendum where Kashmiris can decide their future. Up until now India had hoped to stall Kashmir peace talks and ride out the conflict. As smaller parties, Pakistan and Kashmiris cannot force India to come to the negotiating table without possibly instigating a war, which nobody wants, especially Pakistan. New Delhi uses this stalemate to its benefit to perpetuate the conflict instead of resolving it. But the specter of a nuclear war around Kashmir, and the inability of Indian leaders to resolve the conflict with Pakistan forced the international community last month, on August 16, to intervene. The UN Security Council held its first formal meeting on Kashmir in more than 50 years. This stunning setback for Indian diplomacy should have been met in New Delhi with introspection and a review of India’s policies in Kashmir. Instead, India protested international community’s “interference” in the conflict, in a move reminiscent of Milosevic after Bosnian genocide and Saddam after Kurd massacres. More worryingly, the term ‘The Final Solution’ is increasingly being used by Indian government officials, politicians, and journalists1, often coupled with denunciation for Kashmiris who have been protesting Indian military occupation for decades. India’s global position on Kashmir is so tenuous that the Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights released UN’s first-ever report on Kashmir in June 2018, detailing disturbing patterns of Indian abuses that have normally been associated with dictatorships and not a democracy. For example, the UN report refers to alleged sites of mass graves, and to a case of overnight mass gang-rape by Indian soldiers of women of all ages in two Kashmiri villages in 1991. The report described Kashmir as “one of the most militarized zones in the world,” quoting a figure between 500,000–700,000 Indian soldiers. This number has jumped in July and August 2019. Some Kashmiri sources give an estimate of up to 900,000 Indian soldiers cramming the besieged State of Jammu & Kashmir. August 5: India’s Land Grab, A Highway Robbery in Kashmir
Just to understand the scale of what has happened, imagine that an army in a democracy lays siege to a neighboring unarmed territory, locks down more than eight million people, cuts off internet, telephones, and imposes a strict curfew, while its own legislators sit in the capital to pass a law legitimizing the land grab. And then the prime minister of the aggressor country confidently announces that the besieged neighboring people have welcomed the siege, welcomed the communication blackout, welcomed the lockdown, and the land grab. This, in a nutshell, is what India has done in Kashmir on August 5, 2019.
The initial celebrations in India have now given way to brooding over the barrage of international criticism and bad press. Unwittingly, Prime Minister Modi has infused a new life into Kashmir conflict and turned the global media spotlight on India. Unfortunately for India, this coverage has now expanded beyond Kashmir to include the rise of Indian religious extremism, the Hindutva ideology of Mr. Modi and his BJP party, which researchers liken to the Nazi ideology. The Kashmir crisis has led to fresh questions on the meteoric rise in mob-lynches across India targeting a range of victims, including anyone who eats beef. Today, Indian cyberspace is full of hand-made cellphone videos showing Hindutva mobs lynching minority Indian men2, mostly Muslims, for refusing to recite Hindu religious lines, or for suspicion of consuming beef. No Laughing Matter: The Indian Dream of “Marrying White-Skinned Kashmiri Women”
The fear in Kashmir today is that the Government of India will push thousands of poor Indian citizens and families to move into Kashmir to buy properties and take up Kashmiri jobs which until now have been reserved for Kashmiris. Religious extremists in Mr. Modi’s party have gone to the extent of encouraging Indian men to move to Kashmir “to marry white-skinned Kashmiri women.” 3 More than eight million people are currently under siege in Kashmir by the Indian army, with probably the largest enforced curfew and communication blockade in the world in recent memory. This is the worst time in the 72-year history of Kashmir conflict. Recently, a son waited for his mother to emerge after a Hajj flight at Srinagar airport, only to be told she passed away and was buried in Saudi Arabia. The family could not be informed because of the communication blackout imposed by India.4 “At the end of October, Jammu and Kashmir will cease to be a state of India,” says Sumantra Bose, who uses this dramatic line at start of an article for BBC, an analytical piece that makes for an amazing read. Bose is a Professor of International and Comparative Politics at the London School of Economics (LSE). His distinguished piece is titled, ‘Has India pushed Kashmir to a point of no return?’ Bose compares Modi’s move in Kashmir to Milosevic’s cancellation of Kosovo’s autonomy in 1989, which later led to civil war and genocide: “What the BJP government has done is akin to what Serbia’s Milosevic regime did in 1989 by unilaterally revoking Kosovo’s autonomy and imposing a police state on Kosovo’s Albanian majority. But the BJP government’s approach to Kashmir goes beyond what Milosevic intended for the Kosovo Albanians: subjugation,” Bose writes. Imran Khan, the Prime Minister of Pakistan, has gone a step further. He has warned the world that Modi and his Hindutva ideology is like Nazi ideology and that appeasement could lead to war and genocide in Kashmir and South Asia. Mr. Khan garnered global headlines by comparing the Indian Prime minister to Hitler. Khan went on to write a compelling article in The New York Times, making the case for international intervention in Kashmir.5 President Trump’s Historic Step on Kashmir
U.S. President Donald Trump’s offer to mediate Kashmir conflict between Pakistan and India marked a turning point. For starters, no American President has come out so strongly in favor of resolving Kashmir dispute. The premise is simple: the failure of parties to take basic steps toward de-escalation and conflict resolution means international intervention is inevitable. The offer was an important step in establishing that an international approach is now required to end this long-running conflict. Jack Rosen, President of American Jewish Congress, has called for an active American role in this regard. “Those negotiations — given the scale and gravity of the Kashmir issue — must be mediated and multilateral. Indeed, until President Trump’s offer to mediate, the dispute has festered as a bilateral standoff,” he wrote.6 The arguments for an American intervention to settle this seven-decade-long conflict are strong. Writes Rosen, “We have forged trading and security alliances with both India and Pakistan over the decades. Each country has a large diaspora in the United States. While nuanced diplomacy has ensured that the United States has not faced a zero-sum game between the two, it is time the United States use its moral and strategic leverage to get both sides to the table to address the issue of Kashmir once and for all. There are humanitarian, legal and security interests in such intervention.” On August 26, on the sidelines of the G-7 summit meeting in France, Prime Minister Modi met President Trump and made a strong public pitch against such an intervention and argued that India can talk to Pakistan and contain the conflict. Ironically, even here, the Indian premier failed to offer any concrete roadmap as to how he will do this. Pakistan says the time for talking to India in a bilateral setting is over and that years of such attempts have yielded no results. India wants to buy time, not resolve the problem. But Mr. Modi faced questions from Mr. Trump and other world leaders at G-7 regarding Kashmir tensions. It is interesting that none of the P-5 members entertained India’s requests to cancel a formal Security Council meeting on Kashmir on August 16, which went ahead despite Indian objections. This was “a big deal,” according to Richard Roth, a longtime UN-watcher. Council members met for 90 minutes, without India and Pakistan attending. Some members felt that a statement at this point would favor Pakistan and could escalate tensions. Others felt that the two countries should try to resolve it bilaterally first. There was no agreement on a Council statement to the press, “the lowest-level of Council action,” said Roth. “Still, just dusting off the diplomatic cobwebs was by international standards a big deal,” he wrote for CNN. It is clear India is still counting on the goodwill of major powers to keep Kashmir off the international agenda. And the powers appear willing to give India time to set its house in order and prove that it can diffuse the situation. But what is also clear is that the world is running out of patience when it comes to Kashmir conflict and the growing political and religious extremism in India. And then there are the theories that India is using Kashmir for larger objectives, linked to Afghanistan and Trump’s 2020 midterms. There are signs that India’s sudden escalation of tensions in Kashmir is linked “to the economic slowdown that India is currently facing […] it provides a much-needed diversion for the government,” according to a BBC report.7 There is also some link to Afghanistan. Creating a distraction for Pakistan just when Islamabad is on the cusp of a major peace push in Afghanistan jointly with Washington seems to serve Indian interests. Unstable Afghanistan keeps Pakistan in turmoil, which suits many Indian leaders. Also, there are signs that India may not want to see President Trump emerge from the midterm election stronger. Missing the Afghan peace bus is one way of ensuring this. Another is the growing evidence that the Indian lobby in Washington is joining hands with Trump’s opponents, including with likeminded foreign lobbies linked to JCPOA. The Solution
The solution is simple: India must take a strategic decision to resolve Kashmir conflict and end the zero-sum game with Pakistan. India can reverse or freeze its decision to end Kashmir’s autonomy, accept President Trump’s mediation offer, involve the UN Security Council, Pakistan and the Kashmiris, and pave the way to a referendum. If Islamabad does not respond positively to these steps, then India can hold its neighbor responsible. But it is not possible to endlessly delay dialogue and conflict resolution on various pretexts. Kashmir needs a “mediated, multilateral” solution, in the words of Jack Rosen. India is at a crossroads in its modern history. It faces unprecedented and unexpected global isolation on Kashmir. Not a single member state of the United Nations, and no major international news organization recognizes India’s annexation of the disputed region. International academia and politicians are drawing comparisons between Indian Prime Minister Modi and Milosevic, the mastermind of genocide in Bosnia; and Hitler, who led the Jewish extermination, the Holocaust. India has a chance to make things right. And it should start in Kashmir. The author is a researcher, television host, and writer. 1. Ganapathy, K.B. (2019, August 9).

Medium.com,Society,One of Brazil’s Biggest YouTubers Took on the Country’s President. Now He’s in Fear for His Life.,World,https://ffwd.medium.com/one-of-brazils-biggest-youtubers-took-on-the-country-s-president-now-he-s-in-fear-for-his-life-d72326a25b63?source=topic_page---------352------------------1," In
September Felipe Neto’s mother was forced to flee Brazil after her son, one of the country’s most famous YouTubers, received countless threats from unnamed masses. It’s a sad but normal occurrence for many digital creators, but the threats Neto’s mother received were different: they were stoked by supporters of far-right president Jair Bolsonaro and the evangelical fundamentalist mayor of Rio de Janeiro, Marcello Crivella. The YouTuber, one of the biggest in the world with 34 million subscribers, didn’t avoid the mob’s ire, either. He’s been forced to cancel events including a pro-education meeting in Rio de Janeiro, after receiving threats that made him fear for his life and of his relatives. “In a way, we were expecting that could happen,” Neto says in a rare interview with FFWD. “This is the reflection of a society without education, without study, that ends up falling to a side of hatred, oppression and violence to try to impose what it considers right.” Neto’s crime? Talking about politics on his YouTube channel — which is normally devoted to humour and entertainment. But as well as talking politics, he also decided to take real action against censorship and bigotry by doing more than just yelling in front of a camera. Neto used his massive platform to speak out against homophobia and the censorship attempt imposed by Rio de Janeiro mayor Crivella, who tried to prevent the marketing of an X-Men comic book with a LGBT-friendly theme during the city’s Bienal do Livro, an annual book festival. Crivella was so appalled by the notion that the LGBT-friendly comic book, which featured two characters sharing a gay kiss, was on sale that he ordered every copy of Avengers: The Children’s Crusade in the city be taken off sale, saying in a video posted on Twitter that it contained “sexual content for minors” and his censorship was a way to “protect the minors of our city”. Among those who revolted was Felipe Neto, who owns Brazil’s third-most subscribed channel and the seventh-most viewed platform on Brazilian YouTube. “I decided to act because censorship and oppression must be fought with all our might,” he says. “To remain silent while a government tries to implement a theocracy and impose values is to be conniving.” Neto didn’t just post a video about the controversy: he used his YouTube income to buy 14,000 books, the entire stock of LGBT-themed books at the Book Biennale, and distribute them free of charge to those present as a way to challenge censorship. He was never an activist, and in a recent interview to Brazilian newspaper O Estado de São Paulo he said that his YouTube channel “is a channel for entertainment and [having] fun. I am, before anything else, a content creator. Within this content, I reach all ages and all kinds of audiences, without distinction. I’m not the left-wing presenter, I’m not a political YouTuber.” But he has dedicated himself to talk more and more about politics in his channel and specially on his Twitter profile after the election of the far-right president, Jair Bolsonaro in October 2018, and says he will use his YouTube channel whenever he feels necessary. Neto tells FFWD that “not only YouTube, but all kinds of platforms or social media” are important for political activism. “No wonder the extreme right has teamed up with Steve Bannon and Cambridge Analytica to manipulate information, propagate fake-news and map voters’ behavior online,” he says. “Today, nothing is stronger than the digital, and our 2018 elections [in Brazil] proved that,” mentioning the important role of the internet, social media and particularly WhatsApp had in electing Jair Bolsonaro. According to a study by Google, these content producers are already more famous and influential than journalists in Brazil, reaching audiences that traditional media do not reach and shaping opinion not only on consumption, but also on politics. It’s not just in Brazil that this is the case: in Germany in May, a YouTuber called Rezo, who has a voice that reaches a million subscribers, spoke out against German chancellor Angela Merkel’s partnership with the country’s Social Democratic Party. The near-hour-long video attacking Merkel has surpassed 16 million views. Five million people watched it in less than a week after it was uploaded, and political commentators in Germany were shocked that YouTubers could harness political power. Rezo expressed many young people’s dissatisfaction with traditional politics and, in an interview with the German website Bento, said that his objective was to “make sure that more people discuss the issues raised”. (Rezo did not respond to requests to speak for this story.) And with Donald Trump live streaming his campaign events on Twitch, U.K. far-right politician Nigel Farage beginning to ramp up his YouTube presence and Brazilian president Jair Bolsonaro also using Facebook and YouTube to livestream weekly, the ability to sway political opinion using digital video is becoming more commonplace. Recognizing the power of vloggers, Bolsonaro deployed a network of YouTubers during the 2018 election to spread his message (as well as bloggers and other far-right activists on other social networks). Five of the 10 most successful YouTube channels during the election were from the far-right and aligned with Bolsonaro, according to The Intercept Brasil. Bolsonaro and Rio de Janeiro mayor Crivella are, as might be expected, allies. According to research carried out by Pablo Ortellado, professor at the University of São Paulo, Brazilian political discourse has split into three large communities — one on the left, two on the right — one directly linked to supporters of Bolsonaro. The two rightist bubbles outweigh the left-leaning bubble in views and subscribers, directing online political debate in Brazil. In Brazil, left-wing and far-right YouTubers engage in an open “guerrilla” war, with keyboard warriors exchanging accusations that often cross into the offline world. And that’s what makes Neto’s actions — and Bolsonaro’s reaction — so important. “I can’t speak for others, but I know that I must keep fighting, studying and listening every day more and more. I will keep trying to do my part,” says Neto. “The only thing I think is that I need to continue fighting for education and information, so that one day this hatred starts to diminish.” *Special thanks to João Batista Jr. and Nathalia Damasceno"

Medium.com,Society,The global economic playing field,World,https://medium.com/discourse/the-global-economic-playing-field-24ceb9b24aa3?source=topic_page---------355------------------1," Why China is winning and why it will continue to win In the third debate for the democratic nomination for President of the United States, there was one notable point in which democratic candidates actually agreed with the president. Most democratic candidates (9 of the 10) agreed that Trump’s tariff on China will remain, or at least will not immediately be lifted if the government changes in 2020. As the data on the left shows, Americans have increasingly come to view China as ‘unfavourable’. Its not just the public, one in five companies, many of whom donate to political campaigns, say that China has stolen their intellectual property within the last year. This has made it politically advantageous for candidates to endorse or rather not renounce the idea of tariffs as a way to counter China’s actions with respect to intellectual property and global surveillance. So what now? Trump (by extension the republicans) and the Democrats agree on China — specifically that it is a threat to American and global geo-politics. Why then is the title of the article, “The global economic playing field: Why China is winning and why it will continue to win”. Democracy has increasingly become a popularity contest, where the most ‘likeable’ or in the case of the 2016 election the least non-likeable candidate wins. This brings with it a set of issue but for the purpose of this article, lets focus on one — temporary downturns. Bad news is seldom accepted in a democracy. To win, a candidate always has to present themselves as having a solution that causes no side effects. Most solutions are presented as a be all end all proposition where no unintended consequences are discussed. Increase there is even a lack of respect by both political candidates and voters to the opposing side. This has increased the incentives for candidates to lie or more importantly omit the truth in order to win. The political pundits and news media have exacerbate this problem. By covering politics more like sport and reality TV drama they have, over time, forced issues to be boiled down into simple catch phrases. This has simplified politics, which should be about ideas and policy, into a publicity campaign that mobilizes a base of supports and rallies them around buzz words and chants. In this environment it is tough to sway constituents to endure hardship in order to gain economic advantage in the future. Trump is certainly not an effective or trusted communicator to continue to enjoy the low 40% approval rating he has while voters start loose jobs. The government could artificially keep the economy a float by providing subsidies and pressuring the fed to cut interest rates. However, this is simply not sustainable. The Democrats who support the tariff as a tool to pressure China on intellectual property and global security must realize this. China does not face the ‘hurdle’ of public opinion as the US does. China does not even have the problem of future political uncertainty, Xi Jining is effectively the leader of China for the foreseeable future. Hence China can play this negotiation by a different set of rules. This allows China to simply run the clock out on the current US president’s term. If the next US president continues to put pressure on China, it can either provide a small concession or retaliate with more tariffs and other geopolitical pressures. With no jeopardy to political power, China can afford to make moves the US simply can not. One way to counter China effectively is to have a united group of nations take a stand against the unfair Chinese economic practices. This has two advantages. First, a united group of nations provides a strong political and economic check against china. Secondly, it forces china to respond as it cannot simply ‘wait out’ a change in government. The trump administration has so far failed to convince the European Union to support the US decisions regarding tariffs or on Huawei. Since Huawei is already a part of the 4G network in the EU, the block has preferred to continue its relationship with Huawei, which can offer cheap 5G. However England, France and Germany have taken some steps in order to tighten security against data misuse. The next democratic nominee must offer a strategy to counter China that trump cannot, a united west against China. By effectively avoiding the twitter politics and spontaneous outbursts of Trump, a more judicious and poised leader can create a geopolitical framework that can finally challenge china’s unfair economic practices. However, communication to the public is key. The candidates have to take a stand and provide the public with the right information and economic security to ensure that there continues to be an economic balance where all nations play by the same rule book. Avoiding or sugar coating the issue or reaching a shallow deal will result in more divide and animosity within communities which continue to loose jobs and economic power to China. This creates an opportunity for a person to use the chaos of political discourse to win power under false pretenses. More than ever it is the responsibility of citizens to hold their leader to a standard that brings out the best candidates not individuals that simply use catch phrases or buzz words to attract voters attentions. “Every nation gets the government it deserves.” — Joseph de Maistre The author would like to credit Omar Marai (another student at the University of waterloo) with editing this article."

Rather than using diplomacy in foreign affairs, Trump has sought to facilitate military aggression against foreign countries. Trump has handed out a categorical snub to the Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces in north-east Syria. Allowing Turkey to impose a safe zone on Kurdish-held land could potentially spark a battle for land-grabs between the Turks, Kurdish forces and ISIS in a war that shows no signs of easing. For conservative Republicans, a hawkish foreign policy has typically been on the electoral manifesto with the aim of introducing freedom and democracy to countries that have yet to do so. On the progressive left of the political spectrum, an anti-war movement has gained traction in the US since the 2003 Iraq war took place under the Bush administration. Surprisingly, Trump ran on a traditional leftist policy regarding foreign intervention and pledged to withdraw troops wherever necessary. But Trump’s foreign policy has done anything but alleviate conflict. The SDF, fighting for a democratised Syria, have been supplied arms and ammunition by the American government in a transactional relationship that has benefitted both sides. The SDF are fierce opponents of a centralised and dictatorial Assad regime. The Kurdish-led forces have fought alongside western troops to bring harmony to Syria and to abolish an autocratic system that persecutes their rights to freedom of speech and religion. Most isolationists, aside from Trump, understand it is their imperative to protect marginalised communities in war. It would be extremely hypocritical of an isolationist White House to abandon their allies when their troops entered the Middle East with a military offensive plan. What is further muddled about Trump’s foreign policy initiative, or lack of, is that his isolationist rhetoric coincides with his threats of war with Iran and North Korea. The harsh sanctions imposed by the US on the Iranian economy and the thwarting of the Nuclear Deal alongside Iran’s financial and military backing of the Syrian government means Trump and Iran will never be the best of acquaintances. The SDF have always been at risk of longstanding conflict with Iran due to their opposing prospects for Syria’s future. Trump has given the Iranian military a golden ticket by leaving the Kurds to fend for themselves. Whilst the Middle East braces for a potentially dangerous war, Trump continues to publish erratic and self-aggrandising tweets that have inflamed already simmering tensions. His threat to “obliterate the economy of Turkey” if they do not comply with their safe zone route is a prime example of his pure incompetence in negotiating with and appeasing a fractious region. The U.S have long disputed over how to deal with and help the Middle East prosper when revolt and uprisings seem relentless. With Republican’s threatening a full-scale war in one breath and withdrawing troops in the other, significant damage appears to have been done to their reputations and perhaps the Middle Easts’ future"
Medium.com,Society,Words Matter — Particularly About The Rule of Law,World,https://medium.com/discourse/words-matter-particularly-about-the-rule-of-law-e8813c7e3c27?source=topic_page---------358------------------1," The words of leaders and politicians are immensely significant. When they speak, they legitimise what they endorse, and delegitimise what they attack. When Trump tells 4 Congresswomen of colour, 3 of whom American-born, to “go back” to the “crime-infested places” from which they came, it legitimises overtly racist attitudes. Equally, it delegitimises the law when the government flirts with breaking it. In breaking the law, or even talking about breaking the law, you don’t just delegitimise that particular law — you erode the legitimacy of the principle of the rule of law. In essence, because the government disregards the laws it wants to, people feel emboldened to disregard the laws they want to. And that’s what has been happening in the UK over the past few weeks. The Benn Act, an Act of Parliament designed to require the government to delay our departure from the EU rather than crash out without a deal, has been undermined by the government in a series of leaked memos, parliamentary attacks, and media criticisms. From the simple, childish term the government uses for the law — the “Surrender Act” — to the open admissions from ministers that the government will aim to find a way around the law, the government has eroded its legitimacy systematically, all in a likely futile attempt to achieve a narrow political aim. The government’s position is essentially this: we’ll stick to the law, but not the spirit of the law — i.e. we’ll ask for an extension of Article 50, but we’ll do everything we can to make sure the EU doesn’t grant us it. At the most extreme, ministers have been briefing on the possibility of ignoring the law entirely and hoping that Brexit day arrives quicker than a new PM in Downing Street. Just talking about breaking the law matters hugely, and it forms part of a wider trend of democratic backsliding globally — Trump, Boris, Putin, Erdogan, Orban, et al. The strongmen theory of politics is back in full force, and they’re destroying democracies across the globe. If the government actually follows through and ignores the Benn Act, there’s a big problem. Already, the government has found itself in a tough position with regard to the legality of the Extinction Rebellion protests. XR use methods which are illegal under UK law, but the government has little legitimacy when giving statements urging against the action. A spokesperson was asked whether, if the protestors stuck to the letter of the law but not the spirit of it, they would be prosecuted. Naturally, this was laughed off, but it was an awkward moment, a small one, that shone a small ray of light onto the creeping frontiers of democratic breakdown. The lesson is this — words matter, and when the government uses the wrong combination of them, it can have disastrous consequences. When the government even speaks about breaking the law, the rule of law begins to fall apart."
Medium.com,Society,The Special Relationship: Circa 2019,World,https://medium.com/peter-osnos-platform/the-special-relationship-circa-2019-241704805181?source=topic_page---------359------------------1," On Feb. 16, 1944, Winston Churchill said it was his “deepest conviction that unless Britain and the United States are joined in a special relationship, another destructive war will come to pass.” “England and America are two countries separated by the same language!” Attributed to George Bernard Shaw (and others) Returning to London for the first time since 2017, the relations between the United Kingdom and the United States are again, a matter of considerable interest. If Prime Minister Boris Johnson finally succeeds in getting the country out of the European Union, the need for closer economic ties with the U.S. will become even more important — along with cultural and political relations since the divorce with Europe has become increasingly acrimonious. There are striking parallels in the moods of these two nations. The British have Johnson and Brexit. The Americans have Donald Trump and impeachment. Prince Harry and Meaghan Markle, the Duchess of Sussex, generate enough gossip for the prince to sue the tabloid newspapers demanding that they leave his wife alone. In Washington, paparazzi camp outside of Jared Kushner and Ivanka Trump’s Kalorama home. A modern couple? Or more trouble than they are worth. At the local multi-screen theater near where we were staying, five of the six films were American, including Jennifer Lopez-produced “Hustlers” and Renée Zellweger vehicle “Judy”. The sixth was “Downton Abbey,” the number one film in the United States the week it opened. Julian Fellowes, creator of “Downton Abbey,” is now working on his next series about the grand families of Newport Rhode Island in the Gilded Age. My first visit to London was in the 1950s as a teenager. I have lived there for two-year stretches in what was called “Swinging London” in the l960s and Margaret Thatcher’s Britain in the 1980s. My Polish refugee parents gave me a middle name of Winston. I am therefore not a stranger to the rhythms of England’s capital and always find time there fascinating and entertaining. I go there to enjoy many old friends, familiar iconic buildings and parks, great theater and Britain’s ironic sense of humor, a personal favorite. I once published a book about Monty Python and cohorts titled: “A Great Silly Grin.” Today, traditional British fashion and style are still available, but the dominant vibe on London streets is the relaxed clothes and gear that have become the standard in first world cities. Iphones and earbuds are omnipresent. Whereas London’s population in the 1960s was overwhelmingly white, the city is said to be 40 percent composed of what are known there and in New York as “people of color.” In New York, the majority of students in the most selective public schools have Asian backgrounds. A University of London professor, an expert on education, told me in state schools those with Asian backgrounds were considered to be the best students. Another parallel: In the U.S. we had Donald Trump and payoffs to Stormy Daniels, the pornographic actress and stripper. Currently in the U.K. there is a scandal brewing about Boris Johnson and his friend, Jennifer Arcuri — a former model, amateur pole dancer and technology expert. When he was Mayor of London, Johnson visited her many afternoons, she said, to discuss Shakespeare. Johnson’s appeal to women inside, outside and around marriage is now accepted. The wrinkle is that Arcuri received grants and official favors throughout Johnson’s tenure in office. But just as Trump has enthralled and appalled different sectors of the American public, Johnson and Brexit are obsessive issues at least until that matter is resolved. A common aphorism about the situations in the two countries is that “the Trump era has to end. Brexit is forever.” The stakes are very high. Many of our friends have been in British journalism and public life for decades. Among them there is a cross-section of opinion from adamant Brexit to fierce Remain, but all agree that whatever happens, major damage has been done in the struggle over the past three years. There are those who believe that Brexit will be disruptive to the country for the foreseeable future and then things will settle down. “There will always be an England,” even if the sun has long ago set on the British Empire. Whether Scotland will vote to secede, and Northern Ireland will eventually unite with Ireland is a whole other topic, though for the moment less fraught. At the other end of the spectrum are those who believe that Brexit will mean that the United Kingdom will be a bunch of islands off the coast of Europe of lesser interest to both the European Union and the United States of America, let alone Canada, where Queen Elizabeth is still the Sovereign. I have one friend — an “old Etonian,” an alumnus of the same private school that Boris Johnson went to — who says that Labor leader Jeremy Corbyn is a progressive radical underestimated and misunderstood by moderates in Labor and the country and reviled by the Conservatives. Another friend who was in Tony Blair’s cabinet said she is so disgusted with both Corbyn and the current Conservative party that she wonders whether her career in politics was wasted given how the parties have turned out. Perhaps the definitive opinion came from Martin Wolf, the most senior columnist at the Financial Times who wrote last week: “The Conservative Party has become an English nationalist party. Meanwhile, the hard left has seized Labor. The curse of extremist politics has only just begun.” Another striking feature of London this fall is how many issues are those inundating American discussion and social media — the power of the “me too,” movement, gender identity and unisex toilets, immigration, continuing racism and, overall, political correctness. Britain’s traditional version of the 1 percent known as the “posh” are vilified aside from those in the glamour class of entertainers and influencers who are celebrated in all forms of media, the British version of the Kardashians. I did see one observation which might cause a stir in America. Hugo Rifkind, the television critic of the London Times writing about “RuPaul’s Drag Race” said: “Drag is not transgenderism,” he wrote, “with the fake tits and hair, the sexualized names (Cheryl Hole, Vinegar Strokes) the insane battle paint and quips about ageing and being a slut, it feels less like a tribute to femininity than a satirical assault on it. I mean drag is basically blackface, isn’t it? Parodying the other, while taking the piss.” How will the political, social and cultural dynamic in the U.K. evolve? This is the same question that confounds the U.S. as the presidential election season gains momentum and daily revelations emerge, changing norms of what is considered acceptable behavior now or in the past. The assumption was that Britain would endure the Brexit crisis as it has so many challenges over the centuries. But there is no written constitution in the U.K. Governance is based on precedent and customs. For the moment that tradition is under acute strain as Johnson tried to get his Brexit deal without the consent of Parliament. And Trump and his White House are refusing the cooperate with the House impeachment inquiry as though Congress was not a co-equal branch of government. After a week in London, I think it is fair to conclude that no one can really say there or “across the pond,” as the U.S. is described, how the next year and beyond will unfold. There definitely is still a “Special Relationship” but not the one Churchill or Franklin Delano Roosevelt, bedrock counterparts in World War II, could have imagined."
Medium.com,Society,The Importance of Family Reunification for Refugees,World,https://medium.com/@refugeepathways/the-importance-of-family-reunification-for-refugees-c729397980e6?source=topic_page---------360------------------1," During the upheaval of an emergency, family members can become separated from their loved ones, resulting in devastating consequences on peoples’ wellbeing the ability to rebuild their lives. Therefore, family reunification acts as a valuable pathway to resettlement, allowing separated families to reunite. Reunifying families is of paramount importance, leading to stronger integration into the host community, and surpassing the long-term needs of those seeking protection. The right to family unity is protected under international law, as the Article 16(3) of the 1948 Universal Declaration of Human Rights (UDHR), addresses the concept of family as “the natural and fundamental group unit of society, and is entitled to protection by States.” However, there is no internationally agreed upon definition of a family, which allows the concept of what constitutes a family to vary from country to country. Due to the ambiguity in international law with regards to the meaning of family, Syrian refugees (and refugees or migrants of other nationalities) often find family reunification programs that provide a narrow definition of what is considered family. In many countries, family reunification policies hold that family includes only unmarried children under the age of 18 and a spouse. These rigid requirements often lead to families breaking-up out of a feeling of necessity in order for some to achieve protection. It is known that families act as a pillar of support throughout the integration process of newly arrived refugees into their community. The role of the family unit is often the most effective emotional and socio-economic support network during a time where refugees and migrants are navigating through a new culture and social framework. Family members are often the line of assistance newly arrived refugees can rely on to learn how to grow accustomed to a new environment, including informal cultural orientation, language support, learning transportation systems, and other issues related to adjustment. The impact of family unity on refugee integration, as well as the necessity of preserving familial ties, has contributed to the broadening of family reunification policies in several countries. For example, the EU Family Reunification Directive allows member states of the EU to go beyond minimum protections of the nuclear family unit, as well as provide additional opportunities for refugees to request admission for the reunification of family members within three months of granting their protection status without financial limitations which other immigrants face. Additional family reunification programs have also been created to specifically support refugees in their search for pathways to protection. For example, the International Organization for Migration (IOM) assists Syrians through the Family Assistance Program (FAP). A requirement for family reunification is that the family submit a visa application to a competent mission abroad with the help of IOM’s FAP Program. Find out more about Germany’s Family Assistance Program on Refugee Pathways. The protection of the family unit is a fundamental human right, yet fleeing war and violence often entails the separation of families for periods of time. While countries have the right to determine the conditions of entry for family members in their territories, it is of importance that family unity and its potential benefits for both refugees and their host communities be a factor considered in refugee and migration policy. Policies such as the EU Family Reunification Directive and programs similar to Germany’s Family Assistance Program must be more widely used as roadmaps towards more accepting, inclusive family reunification pathways.

An anecdotal result while the news was riveted on the 3,500 women, who for the first time have been able to go to the stadium by buying their tickets themselves. Since 1979, following the Islamic Revolution, women have been banned from attending any male sporting events even though it is not written in the law. Football, basketball or even volleyball, the rule is the same for all sports. And do not imagine that it can be waived for a mother or sister of a player. Maryam Shojaei, sister of national team captain Masoud Shojaei, an activist and member of the OpenStadiums movement, has never been able to attend a game of his brother in his native country. At the 2018 World Cup in Russia, just before the game between Iran and Spain, she was blocked by security guards for two hours for wanting to get into the stadium a banner that said: “Let Iranian women enter their stadium”. On Thursday, she was not one of the 3500 women who attended the match considering her coming too dangerous after several campaigns against the government and the Iranian Football Federation to legitimize the presence of women in the stadiums. By November 2018, around 100 handpicked women had been allowed to attend the friendly match between Iran and Bolivia, an initiative that Gianni Infantino had declared “disappointing”. That same month, Maryam Shojaei met with FIFA Secretary General, Fatma Samoura, to hand over a petition with 240,000 signatures. Since March 2018, she has sent eight letters to FIFA to pressure and ask to threaten the Iranian federation of sanctions if they continue to not allow women in the stadiums. It was also on that date that 35 women were arrested for attempting to attend the match between Persepolis and Esteqlal, match attended by the FIFA President. It must be noted that despite this ban, Iranian women are not discouraged to try to attend matches. Their passion is stronger than a moral law so they disguise themselves with wigs and false beards to access the stadium. This had been a victorious tip in this match before being stopped. One of these women later told a moderate media reporter that this was her third time using this technique, changing her makeup and wig at each game. Asked if she was afraid of being detained, she replied, “Why should I be afraid? We do not commit any crime by going to stadiums. The law did not define the presence of women in stadiums as a crime. Of course, they detained some women who had to promise in writing not to return.”. An act that is not a crime but last month, it cost the life of Sahar Khodayari, nicknamed “Blue Girl”. The 29-year-old girl immolated herself and succumbed to her injuries after learning that she was risking up to six months in prison following her arrest last March while trying to attend a game of her favourite team, Esteghlal. Her death was a big stir and human rights bodies such as Amnesty International and Human Rights Watch seized the case to pressure FIFA but also put pressure on Iran by mobilizing the international community. It must be said that this ban more broadly reflects the place and role of women in Iranian society than just a simple stadium ban. Not included in the Constitution, it’s the religious who put the pressure to maintain this prohibition by indicating that the dress of a player is too “erotic” and that the insults and potential inappropriate behaviours of men in the stadium are dangerous for the women. “When a woman goes to the stadium and sees half-naked men dressed in sportswear, the sin is committed”, this is how Mohammad Jafar Montazeri, the Iranian Attorney-General, justifies the ban on women going to a stadium. In 2018, following the friendly match between Iran and Bolivia and the few numbers of women who had been allowed to attend the match, he warned of the recidivism of such an action saying: “We will take care of anyone responsible to authorize at any price the presence of women in the stadiums”. On Monday, some fifty religious demonstrated in front of the Iranian parliament, chanting slogans against the lifting of the ban. However the Iranian President, Hassan Rohani, does not seem closed to a lifting of the ban, as mentioned by Masoumeh Ebtekar, Iran’s Vice-President for Family and Women’s Affairs: “I think we are going forward, (…) that the government has made serious efforts in this direction and we now hope to see a match in which women will be sitting in the stadium.”. 3,500 women in a stadium in Iran, a historic event and yet not egalitarian. Of the 78,000 seats at the Azadi Stadium, they accounted for less than 5% of the capacity and had been limited while only 2,500 tickets had found takers to the male audience the day before the match. It also took a few minutes for the 850 first places to be sold out, pushing the authorities to add more tickets. The women’s park has been full one hour before the match while outside, women had come to the stadium, hoping to buy their ticket on the spot. An act always discriminating for Maryam Shojaei who denounced that “if they propose different quotas of tickets, different gates to go in to and different sections to sit in, they are treating women differently from men.”. A situation that is, in fact, contrary to FIFA’s statutes mentioning that “any discrimination of a country, an individual or a group of people for reasons of skin colour, (…) sex, (…) or for any other reason is expressly prohibited, under penalty of suspension or exclusion”. Of course, yes, a match is good but the real question is: what will happen next? Did the Iranian federation only make an exception because of the political pressure of FIFA following the media coverage of the death of Sahar Khodayari last month? Is this only a publicity stunt for the government while for the moment no ad perpetuating things has been announced for opening stands for all football matches, international but also the championships, in all stages without discriminatory restrictions? When will it be possible to have mixed stands so that women can come to the stadium with their children? Will Iran works on the accessibility of stadiums, including toilets, and be really committed to welcoming women in good conditions as announced by Hossein-Ali Amir last month? Or will they continue to use this as an excuse to stay in the current climate? Many questions that remain unanswered while human rights defenders are already sceptical because YES, ultimately it’s not just about football. Allowing women to enter the stadiums is the first door to ask for more freedom and that, the Iranian thinking heads disagree. Saying “yes” to a woman is unthinkable and the authorities preferred that foreign countries and FIFA to do not interfere. The Iranian society is a society that excludes women from public spaces, who stop them if their veil is badly put or if they are dressed in a “provocative” way, whose especially religious powers refuse the change and intellectualization of women. It is also the flagrant example of the power of football. If FIFA really threatened convincingly to enforce its statutes and thus suspend or exclude the Iranian federation, would that be enough to make political power react or the religion is stronger than anything? Is football the body that can dominate social and societal laws by playing a fundamental role in the place of women? While waiting to know the answers, the players of the Iranian national team went to honour the 3,500 women present to encourage them in this match of the preliminaries to the 2022 World Cup applauding them at the end of the match to show their support and solidarity to lift their stadium ban."
Medium.com,Society,"The rulings in Catalonia could save Spain, or destroy it",World,https://medium.com/@josephcrossleyemail/the-rulings-in-catalonia-could-save-spain-or-destroy-it-c76e9c07a447?source=topic_page---------362------------------1," Earlier today, Spain’s highest court either doomed or saved its country. Oriol Junqueras, the former Vice-President of Catalonia, and one of the most prominent champions of Catalan independence, has been sentenced to 13 years in prison. According to the BBC, prosecutors “sought up to 25 years.” Charged along with him were eleven other pro-Catalan independence leaders, eight of them receiving prison sentences closer to nine years, and three escaping with no prison time whatsoever. We won’t understand the significance of this verdict for decades. Any historic event seems obvious in retrospect, but as you watch it unfold you can rarely see where it’s going. What we know is this result won’t fully satisfy anybody. The prison sentences are too short for hard-line opponents of Catalan independence. While those who support the integrity of Spain will be happy to see charges of “sedition and the misuse of public funds” brought against the Catalan leaders, the fact that, for nine of them, the charge of “rebellion” was dropped will seem like too much of a concession made to placate Catalan voters ahead of a General Election in which the ruling Socialist Worker’s Party is seeking a greater personal mandate. That said, the sentences are massively too long to appease those who were hoping the Spanish Supreme Court would give a less aggressive ruling. Feelings of hopelessness and depression will be felt particularly by the families of the independence leaders. The son of Jordi Sanchez, a prominent Catalan politician who has been jailed since earlier this year, says he worries his father “will never get out of prison.” All this makes it hard to say what will happen next. Catalonia isn’t the only region of Spain where some are vying for greater autonomy or even independence. Almost every region in the country has an active separatist movement, though their relative strengths vary wildly. People from the Basque country, northwest of Catalonia, has gone to great lengths to assert their independence, especially during periods of intense pressure like the Spanish Civil War and the Francoist dictatorship that followed. Everything might work out okay for the Spanish government. This Supreme Court ruling sets a severe precedent for budding separatistas (separatists) elsewhere. Chances are, those seeking to distance their regions from the central state will follow the path many moderate Basque nationalists have taken, doing what historian Paul Preston calls “working within the state” — making deals with the Spanish government for more autonomy, whilst promising not to push the matter any further. Certainly, there won’t be another independence referendum soon. And so long as the threat of nationalist terrorism (a very real issue throughout Spanish history) continues to not rear its head, the Catalan independence movement might well die down. Struck of all its major leaders, the test facing the movement ahead, to re-organise itself from the ground up and continue to argue for its goals, two years after the original vote, will either make or break the cause entirely. If the Catalan independence side survives this, it will prove itself ready to survive almost anything. If it doesn’t, then it’s over. Sounds good, on the Spanish side. But, as with all politics, it’s a whole lot more complicated than that. For one thing, the post-referendum 2017 elections held for Catalonia’s regional parliament, the Generalitat, returned a pro-independence government that is still in power today. At the April 2019 Spanish General Election (not to be confused with the new elections scheduled for November 2019), the pro-independence Republican Left of Catalonia-Sovereigntists (ERC-S) group won six more seats in the national parliament. If we break the vote down a bit more, we can see that only a plurality (roughly 45%) of Catalan voters supported pro-independence parties in these elections. This does mean there’s a majority for remaining with Spain, but where votes for independence are split across three parties (the left-wing ERC-S, the liberal JuntsxCat, and the far-left CUP), all of which are on the left, the votes against independence are divided between four parties, ranging from the far-left Podemos, the centre-left Socialist Worker’s Party, the centre-right Ciudadanos, and the right-wing People’s Party. When it comes down to independence versus remaining part of Spain, ideological differences may fracture the remain side more those supporting independence. It’s worth noting also that all the pro-independence parties are currently working together to form a majority government in the Generalitat. The severity of the Supreme Court ruling will most likely seem to be a mistake. Either being too harsh, or too forgiving. Whatever happens next, the judges will be included in the blame. It’s hard not to accept some of the Catalan leaders’ points. Whether or not the 2017 referendum was, as President of the Catalan language and culture organisation Òmnium Cultural, Jordi Cuixart, argues, “an exercise of collective dignity,” it was a non-violent expression of the people’s will, and if the Spanish government had simply let is pass without sending in armed police to suppress voting, the result would have probably swayed against independence. On the other hand, in a country that is still a young democracy, with memories of nationalist terror groups terrifying people in years past, the concerns of the Spanish government can, to some degree, be understood. However, they have undoubtedly made a great many mistakes since the referendum, and have treated Catalans in an overly militaristic way not unreminiscent of the Francoist era. This ruling might save Spain. It might destroy it. We can’t fast-forward through time, so we’ll just have to wait and see."

Medium.com,Society,"If the Lib Dems learn the lessons of the past, they could be in with a real chance in the next…",World,https://medium.com/nomansland/if-the-lib-dems-learn-the-lessons-of-the-past-they-could-be-in-with-a-real-chance-in-the-next-7d5712eb453e?source=topic_page---------364------------------1," Originally published in August in Independent Voices. The local and European parliamentary elections this May provided a striking turn around, looking back. For the Lib Dems they meant after years of polling consistently below 10 per cent, a sudden burst in support saw them take a slew of council and EU parliament seats and poll as high as 24 per cent in June. Being the “party of Remain” suddenly became a major vote winner. The question now is how far can this take them. To top of the polls? Back to 60 seats? Holding the balance of power? Surely all of the 48 per cent who backed Remain the 2016 referendum are in play? To answer these questions, it helps to go back to the beginning of the Lib Dems Europe strategy. That does not mean to the day the EU referendum was lost or even when the campaign started. A similar strategy was tried, at least in part, in 2014, when I was deputy head of policy at Lib Dem headquarters. That was in the lead-up to the 2014 European parliamentary elections when Nick Clegg challenged Nigel Farage to a debate on the EU. That debate was reported as a major victory for Farage in the next day’s headlines. Many probably wondered why Nick and our team took it on. The logic was actually very simple. If you looked at opinion surveys on attitudes to Europe at the time about 15 to 20 per cent of people felt “strongly” in favour of staying in the EU. (A similar number felt strongly about a liberal immigration system). If you are polling at around 8 per cent (as we were at the time) and you take a strong stance on an issue that 15 to 20 per cent care deeply about, you stand to gain their votes. Or at least you are fishing in that pool of voters. At the time, that didn’t have a great impact — in 2014 Europe was not high up on the public’s agenda. The NHS and the economy drove the subsequent 2015 general election campaign. Although immigration was also high up in voters’ minds. This takes us back to the question of how far being the party of Remain can take the Lib Dems. What is interesting is that the Lib Dem vote share has ranged between 16 and 24 per cent since May. A similar range to those who strongly supported the EU in 2014. What finally seems to have changed this May, only a month or so after Brexit was supposed to have happened, is that Europe became an issue that determined the votes of strongly pro-Europeans. Perhaps combined with a final loss of faith in Labour’s Remain credentials. That also may contain a message for how far this strategy can take the Lib Dems. It seems that passionate pro-Europeans are willing to cast their vote for the party of Remain, but not the whole 48 per cent. So it might then be that the Lib Dem Europe strategy has almost exhausted the support it can get. As the “Brexitshambles” continues that may change, but the fact that it hasn’t yet suggests that if the Lib Dems are going to reach and exceed the 20 per cent celling at a general election they will need a broader message. What that should be is a harder question, and of course anything close to 20 per cent support would be a huge success in a snap general election this year. Nonetheless, it is something that should — and no doubt will — be on Jo Swinson and her team’s mind as they look to the future. Steve O’Neil was deputy head of policy for the Liberal Democrats between 2013–15 PS Paula Surrige joined our recent NoMansLand podcast. She had a different take, explaining why Conservative remainers may finally be starting to switch their vote."
Medium.com,Society,"You Need to Know, Mental Health “Awareness” is not Good Enough",World,https://medium.com/@captainraz/you-need-to-know-mental-health-awareness-is-not-good-enough-c1dc7177ca19?source=topic_page---------365------------------1," October 10th was World Mental Health Day. Which means for the last week everyone and their dog has spouted unhelpful platitudes and advice on how to cope with mental illness. Even our royals got in on the act recently. It’s always the same advice. Go for a walk. Try meditation. Take some time for you. Just talk to someone. It’s all bullshit. And I’m sick of people making out that everything will be fine if I just reach out for help. The reality of mental health care in the UK is that even if you do reach out for help, you’ll be waiting a long time for any of that help to actually arrive. Oh, your GP might stick you on anti-depressants, but any other help comes with a waiting list that is honestly despicable. And that’s assuming that your GP a) doesn’t have a weeks long waiting list of their own and b) is one of the good doctors that actually takes mental health seriously. When I was actively suicidal and self-harming I referred myself for therapy. I told them exactly why I was contacting them and what sort of state I was in. The wait for the initial email assessment was over six weeks. When I was actively suicidal. When I got referred to the local mental health team for further diagnosis and treatment, it took six months for my appointment letter to arrive. The appointment itself? Set for almost a year after my referral. I got lucky and was seen after a mere eight months because I have a flexible enough schedule to take advantage of cancellations. Either way, those wait times are far, far too long for someone who is actively struggling not to kill themselves. I can’t speak to other mental health experiences, but I can’t imagine that waiting for a year to get help for hallucinations, psychosis, schizophrenia etc is particularly fun either. And if you manage to get through the abominable wait times? The NHS has a habit of throwing you into Cognitive Behavioural Therapy and expecting that will fix everything. Except CBT doesn’t work for everyone. It doesn’t work for every condition. But if you try pointing that out you risk being labelled an uncooperative patient and getting cut off from any further help. If you can’t survive the waiting times and do something that warrants a visit from the emergency services you’ll probably end up in a psychiatric ward. I’ve never had the pleasure myself, but from talking to people who have I gather it's an absolute crap shoot whether your stay will actually be helpful or whether it’ll make the problem worse. And you have no way of knowing before you get there. What I’m trying to say here is that mental health “awareness” isn’t enough. Telling someone to reach out for help isn’t enough. Setting aside the fact that at my worst point I couldn’t reach out for anything because I didn’t feel like I deserved help, the reality is that mental health provision in the UK has been actively defunded, downsized and shut down over the last thirty years. Now there’s nothing to reach out for. Charities like Mind and the Samaritans do their best to pick up the slack, but they are fundamentally not equipped to deal with the kind of care many mental health patients need. And they shouldn’t have to fill the void left where adequate mental health care should be. So no, mental health awareness isn’t enough. Cute platitudes on Facebook about “how you can always talk to me” aren’t enough. Rich people with private health care launching an app that tells you to take a walk when you’re sad isn’t enough. Lighting Downing Street up in green isn’t enough. What we need is to tackle the systemic causes of many mental health issues. Things like poverty, precarious employment and an uncertain political and environmental future. What we need is proper mental health care provision. Doctors who take mental illness seriously, and ways of reporting those that don’t. Funding for a full range of therapies, not just one-size-fits-no-one-properly CBT. Inpatient care that is reliable and helpful across the board. Appointments that don’t take a year or more to get to. What we need is your action. Write to your MPs, tell them you expect them to represent everyone in their constituency, including people living with mental illness. Stand beside us when we take to the streets to demand better care. Curate your language to eliminate words that hurt us, that propagate harmful and negative stereotypes about mental illnesses. And above all else, if we do reach out to you, listen. Listen to us when we tell you what we need. Don’t just fob us off with mindfulness or tell us to “think positive.” Believe us when we tell you the help that is available isn’t good enough. Listen to us, then help us act."

Medium.com,Society,I Am Getting Tired of the Chinese Government,World,https://medium.com/datadriveninvestor/i-am-getting-tired-of-the-chinese-government-f584e325cc38?source=topic_page---------367------------------1," China isn’t the only government I have a problem with. C
hina has once again, behaved in a ridiculous fashion through its recent attacks on the NBA. To me, ‘thin-skin’ is one of the most unattractive qualities a person can have. People that are easily offended by others often focus so much attention on the behavior of others that they forget to pay attention to their own bad behavior. One such person is Trump. With Trump, his ‘thin-skin’ stems from the desire to silence the critics of his stupid policies. The government of the People’s Republic of China has ‘thin skin’ for the same reasons that Trump has ‘thin skin.’ For this story, I will refer to the ‘People’s Republic’ as China and the ‘Republic of China’ as Taiwan. There are some that may say that China’s behavior is a ‘cultural issue’ and we should seek to understand China. Bull! Let’s look at some of the heinous acts committed by the Chinese government over the past several decades. The regime in China has been in power for seventy years. During this time, China has been in military conflicts with the following neighbors: the Soviet Union, Korea, Taiwan, Vietnam, Tibet, Myanmar, and India. See this article from Wikipedia for more on China’s military campaigns against its neighbors. In the 1950s-1960s, China’s ‘Great Leap Forward’ resulted in 30,000,000 to 60,000,000 deaths of the Chinese people. The Cultural Revolution of 1966–1976 resulted in millions more dead. In 1989, the Chinese government slaughtered thousands of peaceful pro-democracy demonstrators in Tiananmen Square. The Tiananmen Square incident is why we should fear for the safety of the pro-democracy demonstrators in Hong Kong. These aren’t ‘cultural issues.’ These are moral issues that America should not tolerate. These are issues from the past. The question is, what is China doing now? The Chinese government has changed very little over the past seventy years. China has allowed economic reforms that have boosted their economy. However, China has done little regarding the human rights of its citizens. Right now, China is persecuting millions of Uighur Muslims. These people are being detained and forced into ‘reeducation camps’ (prisons). See China’s Repression of Uighurs in Xinjiang from the Council on Foreign Relations. China is imposing a Social Credit System on its citizens. This ‘Social Credit System’ is an extremely frightening move into a technology-driven totalitarian state. China’s ‘Social Credit System’ is potentially so dystopian that it makes George Orwell’s 1984 look like a ‘libertarian paradise.’ China is flexing its muscles against its neighbors, primarily Vietnam and the Philippines, in the South China Sea. See this report from the Council on Foreign Relations regarding China’s territorial aggression in the South China Sea. China is continuing to threaten Taiwan because the Chinese government considers Taiwan part of China. At best, this is a very shaky claim since China only ruled Taiwan from 1683 until 1895. China does not seem to care that the citizens of Taiwan do not want to be a part of China. See Is China Planning to Take Taiwan by Force in 2020? from the South China Morning Post for more on China’s plans regarding Taiwan. Note that the South China Morning Post is owned by Alibaba. Alibaba was founded by Jack Ma. Jack Ma is a member of the Chinese Communist Party. The Chinese government doesn’t care about labor rights. This is surprising for a Communist country. I am sure that Karl Marx would be stunned if he read my story, Income Inequality in America Compared to Other Nations. I have included a link to that story at the end of this story. An excerpt from that story is included below. See this article from the New York Times for the average pay of the people who assemble Apple’s products in China. At $400.00 per month, it is impossible for American plants to compete on a cost-of-labor basis. These assembly plants for Apple are owned by Foxconn. Shenzhen is the location of one of these Foxconn plants. Numbeo.com states that the monthly cost of living in Shenzhen is $515.39 excluding housing costs. Foxconn provides dormitories for its employee, therefore, housing costs aren’t a problem. Still, Foxconn was paying its employees $115.00 less than the cost of living. It is like the employees are paying Foxconn to work there! For the cost of living data for Shenzhen, see this link from numbeo.com. Life at Foxconn is no picnic for its employees. This company had to install nets below the dormitories to catch people attempting suicide. The working conditions are terrible. See this article from The Guardian. Of course, America needs to get its own labor rights policy in order before pushing such a policy on other nations."
Medium.com,Society,5 Reasons Why VC’s Are Investing Now in LATAM Tech,World,https://medium.com/@WilsonKyi/5-reasons-why-vcs-are-investing-now-in-latam-tech-b83690dc517c?source=topic_page---------368------------------1," Original article on Linkedin Hola a todos! Having worked in Mexico for the past year, visited Brazil, Peru, Chile, Argentina, and worked with Mexicans, Colombians, and Brazilians, I’ve witnessed the tech growth in LATAM. Between research and firsthand experience on the ground, I believe there are 5 key forces driving the recent growth and years to come. Demographics are fundamental to its growth. There are currently 658M people in LATAM, of which 454M (69%) have access to the internet, which has grown 2411% from 2000 to 2019, adopting technology much faster than before (Internet World Stats). With access to internet, learning to code could be done more quickly and remotely, without formal changes to the education system. This story has been told before, but why now? As a proxy for standard of living, GDP for LATAM has been on a run for the past 70 years. While recently it had hit a speed bump in the past 5 years, IMF projects that there will be more than 2x the GDP growth. With a higher standard of living, middle class Latin Americans will be able to make “daily upgrades,” which is not necessarily massive purchases (house and car), but actually affordable, premium consumables that are either at the margin whether to purchase, better quality, or more convenient. Examples are being able to spend more on apparel, convenient transportation, or order food delivery. Since the middle class is making these “daily upgrades,” and the middle class itself is made of those who are able to earn income through traditional or technology jobs. Below we see that Mexico’s age group is pyramid, where the massive base of about 50% is from the age of 0–30, and in the next decade, children will enter the workforce, many of whom will earn enough to become part of the growing middle class. So if the working class is growing, then we have a compounding effect of these “daily upgrades.” 2. Increase in supply to meet demand enabled by technology platforms In order to meet the increase in demand, technology platforms have capitalized on these opportunities by providing a scalable way to make e-commerce (Mercado Libre $27B), ridesharing (Uber $51B, DiDi), and food delivery (Rappi) more accessible every individual through their mobile app. In order to deliver their services, they’ve built the appropriate supply chains, logistics, and payment infrastructure to support the scale. Since fraud due to cash payment is a serious issue for LATAM, these platforms have not only made services more convenient, but also safer, thus educating and instilling confidence in consumers. Below is Rappi’s exponential growth in the past two years that reflects an increase in consumer demand and supply, driven by venture capital. 3. Increase in existing regional and global venture capital As many of the above tech companies have reached a level of maturity where their talent have left to start businesses that will continue to further build infrastructure or services on top of existing ones, these founders begin to seek out venture capital to build scalable companies. Hence, existing VC’s like Monashees (Brazil) and Kaszek (Argentina) have been able to double down, while outside VC’s like GGV Capital (in Yellow), General Atlantic (in Clip), Sequoia (in Rappi), and DST Global (in NuBank) have been proactively entering LATAM. Even global accelerator’s have accepted more Latin American founders than before. Y-Combinator accepted Grin (S18), while MassChallenge, Techstars, and Startupbootcamp also made LATAM investments. Despite its recent controversies, Softbank allocated $5B to invest in LATAM led by Marcelo Claure to focus on fintech, e-commerce, healthcare, and mobility. This is effectively an announcement to founders that they should pursue these massively impactful areas, and indirectly to early and growth stage funds around the world that there are massive investable opportunities. Softbank immediately poured $1B into Rappi to scale across LATAM, while growing their share and services in existing markets, hoping it will be a hybrid of Alibaba and Meituan of the region. 4. Chinese companies have expanded aggressively into LATAM LATAM has similar demographics and tech adoption as Southeast Asia, where Chinese tech companies have already found success (Grab, Gojek, Tokopedia), and have identified LATAM as the current growth region. In late 2017, DiDi bought 99app for $1B the largest tech acquisition to establish its presence in Brazil, the largest LATAM market. In late 2018, Tencent further invested $180M in Nubank, valuing it at $4B. Now, as the largest messaging and payments network, Tencent is able to guide Nubank in giving access to many of the unbanked. Traditionally, Tencent makes small bets to partner and grow its network, and sometimes acquires. With $27B in cash, acquisition is certainly an option for its payment network at the right price. Also in late 2018, Tencent’s other half Ant Financial (Alipay) committed $100M to Brazil-based online payments platform StoneCo, and Mexico-based OpenPay to connect local merchants with the growing Chinese population that prefer to use Alipay. This year, Tik Tok (parent ByteDance $75B) and other similar apps have also made key hires and expanded into Brazil and Mexico. 5. Key countries Brazil, Mexico, Colombia, and Chile are leading the way Though LATAM has a population of 658M, investors have prioritized the largest markets — Brazil (210M) and Mexico (130M), where 76% of LATAM venture capital have been invested. Large rounds have already been invested in Brazil in mobility logistics (iFood, Loggi, CargoX), fintech (Creditas, Nubank) and in Mexico in fintech (Clip, Konfio, Credijusto, Bitso). However, healthcare has been an under-invested opportunity area, where Softbank’s thesis has not been fulfilled. In the next 3–5 years, there will be more founders outside of Brazil and Mexico capitalizing on their large market, like Cornershop founded in Chile and expanded to Mexico. Strategically located between Brazil and Mexico with relatively smaller 50M population, Colombia has already made a name for itself with Rappi, and will continue to do so in the coming years due to the wave of founders post-Rappi and its demographics. Israel has been known to create global companies due to its restrictively small population 8.7M; though Colombia is much larger and dense enough to test consumer marketplaces, its market is still too small to create unicorns on its own, so it’s forced to think more broadly for LATAM, hence Rappi expanding to Brazil and Mexico. As early employees are leaving Rappi with their international expansion experience, they’ll be equipped with the vision and ability to build teams and raise capital. Lastly, though Chile is only 18M population, it’s GDP per capita is 2.5x Colombia’s, meaning consumer products can be charged higher. Walking around Santiago feels like I’m back in Los Angeles with well-paved streets, highways, and office buildings. Also, there is the “Groupon mafia,” after Groupon acquired a bunch of copycats including Chile-based ClanDescuento, whose founders started Cornershop. Also, Chile is proud of its accelerator Start-Up Chile, who’s supported by Groupon’s Founder Andrew Mason. Finally, its government has given out high incentives for startups as much as $40k equity-free seed capital, 1 year visa, and other extra benefits to make it easier to do business. With these resources and talent, Chile has the potential to produce a few more Cornershop’s. Final thoughts Many have said LATAM is a “hot market,” displaying many of the characteristics of Southeast Asia 2–3 years ago, and China 4–5 years ago, where super apps, payments, and logistics are already built at scale. The key challenge will be for entrepreneurs to create not only single country companies, but at least LATAM scale, and maybe even global scale. LATAM scale will always have localizing challenges of language between Brazil and Spanish-speaking countries and organizational leadership. But I’m optimistic, because at the end of the day, LATAM countries have more similarities than differences when it comes to lifestyle, family, music, and consumer spending. However, those similarities also include challenges like logistics infrastructure, cash payments, and corruption that are true opportunities but also speed bumps that can slow down the growth. With that said, LATAM tech will further establish itself on the map, as there will be more regional unicorns built in the next 5–7 years, attracting both global talent and capital. Since my experience and especially language in LATAM has its limits, please let me know if you have any ideas or thoughts from inside or outside of LATAM. Gracias y Saludos, Wilson P.S. India tech is often an overlooked region for its growth in the next few years, while Africa tech is not too far off in the distance."
Medium.com,Society,The Rescue Mission to Save Civilization From the Big Melt,World,https://gen.medium.com/the-rescue-mission-to-save-civilization-from-the-big-melt-ea1ce2043b7e?source=topic_page---------369------------------1," is like looking at something from another planet. The mystery tools are both about five inches long, bleached a pale gray with age and the effects of the weather. They were found just over a month ago, lying on icy ground high in the mountains of Norway. For roughly a thousand years they lay trapped in layers of ice. But now they have melted out. “We have no idea what they are,” says Julian Robert Post-Melbye, a member of the archaeological team that found the objects and an archaeologist at the University of Oslo’s Museum of Cultural History. Did they once help fix horse-riding equipment in place? Maybe they were used to shape a specific substance or material. “We just call them ‘wrenches’” Post-Melbye says, “because they look, you know, like wrenches.” I have come here, to the mountain village of Fossbergom in central Norway, to see these and other objects recently dislodged from the ice. Fossbergom is located in Lom, a municipality with fewer than 2,500 residents, surrounded by three huge national parks crammed with mountains, valleys, and ice. The ice, however, is melting at a quickening rate, and over the past two decades archaeologists have found that more artifacts are appearing — so many they can hardly keep up. These objects are the fruits of a field known as “glacial archeology” or “ice patch archaeology.” As the world has warmed, melting ice in mountain regions of Norway, Mongolia, and other sub-Arctic nations, as well as Alaska, the Alps, the Rocky Mountains, and the Canadian Yukon, has yielded a growing bounty of exceptionally well-preserved items left behind by Viking hunters, ancient warriors, and long-forgotten travelers — scattered fragments that reveal the technological prowess of departed civilizations. The ice is melting at a quickening rate, and over the past two decades archaeologists have found that more artifacts are appearing — so many they can hardly keep up. The artifacts that the archaeologists show me in Lom are the very latest finds, recovered in recent days. On one table there is an arrow shaft with string and some feathers; the fletching is still intact and it is about 1,500 years old. There are arrowheads too — one is carved beautifully from what is almost certainly antler bone. A separate arrow shaft dates back to the Stone Age, perhaps shot at a target, probably a reindeer, some 4,000 years ago. The arrow lay on the mountainside and was covered in snow, where it stayed, untouched and locked in ice — until now."

Medium.com,Society,Landing in Riyadh: Geopolitics work in Putin’s favour,World,https://medium.com/the-turbulent-world-of-middle-east-soccer/landing-in-riyadh-geopolitics-work-in-putins-favour-818dc90066dd?source=topic_page---------371------------------1," By James M. Dorsey A podcast version of this story is available on Soundcloud, Itunes, Spotify, Stitcher, TuneIn, Spreaker, Pocket Casts, Tumblr, Patreon, Podbean and Castbox. When Russian President Vladimir Putin lands in Riyadh this week for the second time in 12 years, his call for endorsement of his proposal to replace the US defense umbrella in the Gulf with a multilateral security architecture is likely to rank high on his agenda. So is Mr. Putin’s push for Saudi Arabia to finalize the acquisition of Russia’s S-400 anti-missile defense system in the wake of the failure of US weaponry to intercept drones and missiles that last month struck key Saudi oil installations. “We are ready to help Saudi Arabia protect their people. They need to make clever decisions…by deciding to buy the most advanced S-400 air-defence systems. These kinds of systems are capable of defending any kind of infrastructure in Saudi Arabia from any kind of attack,” Mr. Putin said immediately after the attacks. Mr Putin’s push for a multilateral security approach is helped by changing realities in the Gulf as a result of President Donald J. Trump’s repeated recent demonstrations of his unreliability as an ally. Doubts about Mr. Trump have been fuelled by his reluctance to respond more forcefully to perceived Iranian provocations, including the downing of a US drone in June and the September attacks on the Saudi facilities as well as his distancing himself from Israeli prime minister Binyamin Netanyahu following last month’s elections, and most recently, the president’s leaving the Kurds to their own devices as they confront a Turkish invasion in Syria. Framed in transactional terms in which Saudi Arabia pays for a service, Mr. Trump’s decision this week to send up to 3,000 troops and additional air defences to the kingdom is likely to do little to enhance confidence in his reliability. By comparison, Mr. Putin, with the backing of Chinese president Xi Jinping, seems a much more reliable partner even if Riyadh differs with Moscow and Beijing on key issues, including Iran, Syria and Turkey. “While Russia is a reliable ally, the US is not. Many in the Middle East may not approve of Moscow supporting Bashar al-Assad’s regime, but they respect Vladimir Putin for sticking by Russia’s beleaguered ally in Syria,” said Middle East scholar and commentator Mark N. Katz. In a twist of irony, Mr. Trump’s unreliability coupled with an Iran’s strategy of gradual escalation in response to the president’s imposition of harsh economic sanctions in a bid to force the Islamic republic to the negotiating table appear to have moderated what was perceived as a largely disastrous assertive and robust go-it alone Saudi foreign and defense policy posture in recent years. While everyone would benefit from a dialling down of tensions between Saudi Arabia and Iran, Mr. Trump’s overall performance as the guarantor of security in the Gulf could in the longer term pave the way for a more multilateral approach to the region’s security architecture. In the latest sign of Saudi willingness to step back from the brink, Saudi Arabia is holding back channel talks for the first time in two years with Iranian-backed Houthi rebels in Yemen. The talks began after both sides declared partial ceasefires in the more than four year-long Yemeni war. The talks potentially open the door to a broader Russian-sponsored deal in the context of some understanding about non-aggression between the kingdom and Iran, in which Saudi Arabia would re-establish diplomatic relations with Syria in exchange for the Islamic republic dropping its support for the Houthis. Restoring diplomatic relations and reversing the Arab League’s suspension of Syrian membership because of the civil war would constitute a victory for Mr. Al-Assad’s main backers, Russia and Iran. It would grant greater legitimacy to a leader viewed by significant segments of the international community as a pariah. A Saudi-Iranian swap of Syria for Yemen could also facilitate Saudi financial contributions to the reconstruction of war-ravaged Syria. Saudi Arabia was conspicuously absent at last month’s Rebuild Syria Expo in Damascus. Mr. Putin is likely to further leverage his enhanced credibility as well as Saudi-Russian cooperation in curtailing oil production to boost prices to persuade Saudi Arabia to follow through on promises to invest in Russia. Saudi Arabia had agreed to take a stake in Russia’s Novatek Arctic-2 liquefied natural gas complex, acquire Sibur, Russia’s largest petrochemical facility, and invest an additional US$6 billion in future projects. Russian Energy Minister Alexander Novak predicted that “about 30 agreements and contracts will be signed during President Putin’s visit to Saudi Arabia. We are working on it. These are investment projects, and the sum in question is billions of dollars.” In anticipation of Mr. Putin’s visit, Russia’s sovereign wealth fund, the Russian Direct Investment Fund (RDIF), said it was opening its first overseas office in Riyadh. RDIF and the kingdom’s counterpart, the Public Investment Fund (PIF), are believed to be looking at some US$2.5 billion in investment in technology, medicine, infrastructure, transport and industrial production. The Russian fund is also discussing with Aramco, the Saudi state-owned oil company, US$3 billion in investments in oil services and oil and gas conversion projects. Saudi interest in economic cooperation with Russia goes beyond economics. Ensuring that world powers have an increasing stake in the kingdom’s security is one pillar of a more multilateral regional approach Said Russian Middle East expert Alexey Khlebnikov: “Clearly, the recent attacks on Saudi Arabia’s oil facilities have changed many security calculations throughout the region.” Dr. James M.

Medium.com,Society,Humanitarian conditions worsening in Iran’s prisons,World,https://medium.com/@Masoud_Dalvand/humanitarian-conditions-worsening-in-irans-prisons-4a4f89782455?source=topic_page---------372------------------1," Iran, October 12, 2019 -Reports coming from inside Iran pertain to mounting pressure against Iranian prisoners and worsening humanitarian and human rights conditions inside Iran’s prisons. In recent months, the regime has resorted to various measures to cause fear in society and dissuade people from joining protests that are ongoing in different parts of Iran. These measures coincide with the appointment of Ebrahim Raisi as the regime’s chief of judiciary. Raisi was one of the key figures in the 1988 massacre of 30,000 political prisoners, most of them members and supporters of the prominent Iranian opposition movement the People’s Mojahedin Organization of Iran ( PMOI/MEK). The regime has effectively turned its prisons into centers for the torture and annihilation of prisoners. One of the facilities where the conditions for prisoners have worsened is Karaj Central Prison. Every hall in the prison has the capacity for 200 people. But prison authorities have effectively packed 700 people in each hall. Due to lack of space and beds in cells, many of the prisoners are forced to sleep on the ground and on cardboards. Prisoners with mental illness and contagious diseases such as hepatitis have been abandoned with no medical care, and they’re mixed with other prisoners, causing the spread of dangerous diseases among the population of the facility. The Karaj Central Prison also has very poor sanitary conditions. Prisoners are faced with water shortages on a regular basis. Every day, from 2 pm to 6 pm, the facility’s water is cut off. According to reports, when prisoners protested the situation, the prison’s chief said, “You’re lucky that we haven’t cut off electricity.” Prisoners are also required to pay for soap and other hygiene products. This puts further pressure, who have no means to earn money and must rely on their families to pay for their expenses. Food rations in Karaj Central Prison have diminished to a quarter of what they used to be. Even the bread has become smaller than before and the prisoners are always hungry. The prison has a local store, but it sells its goods at several times the real price. Prisoners must get money from their families to buy food from the store. But many of the prisoners who were faced with economic pressure before coming to prison don’t have the means to buy anything from the store. The prison authorities consider any protest that involves two or more people as a riot and suppress it brutally. If the prisoners persist in their protests to the poor conditions in the Karaj Central Prison, they face grim consequences that are set up to look like an “accident” in the clinic, a “suicide,” or a fight with other prisoners. The prison chief and wardens have agents among prisoners, whom they use to suppress prisoners who do not abide by their brutal rules. These so-called agents violently assault any prisoner their bosses instruct them to. They use knives and sharp objects to attack and kill prisoners. Prison authorities are also directly involved in the distribution of narcotics among prisoners. One of the new measures authorities of Karaj Central Prison have implemented is the remote sentencing of prisoners. Instead of taking prisoners to court, prison authorities perform trials through video conferencing software. This way, prisoners have no access to their lawyers. The situation in other Iranian prisons isn’t any better. Recently, the prisoners of Urmia Central Prison protested to the canceling of meetings. The chief of the facility said that starting from Saturday, daily meetings for political prisoners will be canceled and replaced with weekly meetings. This regime authority claimed that the measure is meant to prevent the entrance of narcotics into Urmia Central Prison. Political prisoners protested to this measure and threatened to go on strike. Fearing the situation spinning out of control, prison authorities backed down from their decisions and resumed meetings for prisoners."
Medium.com,Society,Mass Protests Across Ecuador as New IMF Austerity Measures Take Effect,World,https://medium.com/citizen-truth/mass-protests-across-ecuador-as-new-imf-austerity-measures-take-effect-bf721be43224?source=topic_page---------373------------------1," An International Monetary Fund (IMF)-backed austerity program that cut a decades-long fuel subsidy and came into effect on Thursday has sparked nationwide protests in oil-rich Ecuador, leaving hundreds arrested and wounded. During a nationwide strike on Wednesday, October 9, workers’ unions joined indigenous people and students packing the main streets of the country’s capital, Quito. As a result, Ecuadorean President Lenin Moreno was forced to relocate his office to the coastal city of Guayaquil, the country’s second-largest city. Protesters were angry following the president’s decision to sign an agreement with the global lender to receive a $4.2 billion loan last February. As part of the loan deal, Ecuador must adopt IMF austerity measures including cutting a long-established fuel subsidy. Ecuador’s Economic Minister Richard Martinez claimed the cuts are expected to save the state budget up to $ 2.27 billion per year but will mean an increase in fuel prices for Ecuadorian citizens. Moreno also hopes the IMF economic package would reduce the country’s debt from over $3 billion to $1 billion by 2020. The Moreno administration also announced it would privatize state-owned telecommunication company CNT and other companies as well as announce massive layoffs from state enterprises. Other measures include reduced day-offs for government workers, lower compensation for outsourced workers and the removal of the four-decade-long fuel subsidy. Moreno blamed his predecessor, the leftist politician Rafael Correa (now living in exile in Belgium), for causing the crisis. Unlike Correa, who opposed the U.S intervention in Latin America politics, Moreno has taken steps to normalize ties with Washington since he took office in 2017. Some see Moreno’s decision to evict whistleblower and WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange from the Ecuadorean embassy building in London as part of Ecuador’s efforts to the normalize ties with Washington. Ecuador is one of the members of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC), thanks to its 4 billion barrel of oil reserves. The country produced 500,000 barrels per day in August 2019. However, Ecuador announced in early October that its fiscal troubles will force the country to leave OPEC in 2020, presumably in a bid to increase crude production and raise more revenue. Ecuador once left the organization in 1992 over disputes with OPEC quotas and rejoined in 2007. The debt crisis has forced the government to eliminate the fuel subsidy resulting in price hikes of up to 123%, triggering the nationwide strike and driving Moreno to declare a state of emergency on October 3rd. According to Reuters, Ecuador previously asked for OPEC’s permission to produce oil exceeding its quota. However, it was never announced how or even whether OPEC responded to the request. The recent protests also suspended oil operations at three oil blocks (an estimated loss of 165,000 barrels per day or a third of Ecuador’s daily production), as the state oil company Petroamazonas stated. Several experts argue that IMF adjustment programs, referred to as Structural Adjustment Programs (SAPs), which promote privatization and subsidy cuts as a condition of receiving loans, have failed to solve recipients’ financial crises and instead left countries worse off. As Citizen Truth previously wrote, the IMF has historically been wielded as extensions of U.S. power and, along with the World Bank, are often tools to push U.S. geopolitical goals. In fact, a leaked U.S. military guidebook outlines as much in a section titled “Financial Instrument of U.S. National Power and Unconventional Warfare.” “Some of the best weapons do not shoot,” says the guidebook in reference to how the U.S. relies on financial institutions such as the IMF and the World Bank to act as “unconventional” weapons. In a report commissioned by the Halifax Initiative entitled Impoverishing a Continent: The World Bank and the IMF in Africa, Asad Ismi details how Structural Adjustment Programs (SAPs) imposed on African nations as a condition of receiving World Bank and IMF loans lead to worsening conditions in Africa. The SAPs forced African economies to reduce tariffs, cut public spending (including subsidies for food and healthcare), raise interest rates (reducing access to credit), privatize state enterprises and generally open countries doors to Western investors. The foreign investment was supposed to help reduce poverty but instead, the SAPs expanded poverty and inequality as those with means got richer and others were left behind. “It is more than ironic that the West is complaining about Africa’s debt to China. Since the 1960s Western nations, the IMF, World Bank, Paris Club, etc., have ‘looted’ Africa of hundreds of billions of dollars in bloated debt payments and through the manipulation of currencies and terms of trade,” wrote Lawrence Freeman, an African economic and political analyst, in an article on the Final Call. Most recently, the IMF was widely criticized for its handling of Greece’s financial crisis. The IMF did admit some mistakes in handling Greece’s bailout in 2010. In an internal report, the IMF said it was too optimistic about the country’s growth assumptions. “The Fund approved an exceptionally large loan to Greece under an stand-by agreement in May 2010 despite having considerable misgivings about Greece’s debt sustainability. The decision required the Fund to depart from its established rules on exceptional access. However, Greece came late to the Fund and the time available to negotiate the programme was short… “Market confidence was not restored, the banking system lost 30% of its deposits, and the economy encountered a much deeper than expected recession with exceptionally high unemployment,” the internal report said. Ecuador’s neighbor Argentina also has a bitter relationship with the IMF and blames IMF austerity measures for the country’s financial crisis in 2001 that pushed millions of middle-class Argentines in poverty. As a result of the IMF’s failures, the international lender’s image has suffered drastically, yet financially troubled countries are still at times forced to turn to IMF loans for a bailout. Ecuador’s recovery may not be guaranteed, but what is guaranteed is that the IMF will face heightened scrutiny as Ecuador turns to the IMF and new austerity measures are put into place.

Medium.com,Society,Does Brexit Represent The Will of The People?,World,https://medium.com/p/83a8b3fbc2ce?source=topic_page---------375------------------1," On 23 June 2016, the British people headed to the polls to vote on a simple question, whether to remain or leave the European Union (EU). The outcome was expected to be that the status quo would remain in place. The British people would vote to remain in the EU. Indeed, a poll conducted on the day of the vote by YouGov polled 52% for remain and 48% for leave. However, despite these polls, the vote did not turn out as expected. The YouGov poll got the percentages correct, but the wrong way around. The result turned out to be 52% for leave and 48% to remain. Although the referendum was not legally binding, the ruling Conservative Party stated beforehand they would honour the result. The process to leave was started on 29 March 2017 when Article 50 of the Lisbon Treaty was activated, giving the UK two years to conclude negotiations with the EU and leave. However, here we are three years after the result and still no closer to knowing what will happen. Indeed, the premise of a ‘simple’ vote has come to be a fallacy. There are many different ways you can leave the EU and this has hindered the process. Throughout the three years, a constant phrase has been uttered by politicians and pundits alike in regards to Brexit. Brexit is the will of the people. This phrase has been repeated over and over again, but what does it mean? Does the referendum result truly represent the will of the people? Or is it just a misleading phrase used to sow discord with the public? These are the questions I have been pondering over the past few years and ones that I will try to answer."

Medium.com,Society,California’s Blackout Is Africa’s Everyday Reality,World,https://onezero.medium.com/californias-blackout-is-africa-s-everyday-reality-a09d8bad23e8?source=topic_page---------378------------------1," ower outages across California affecting some 2.5 million people have been creating chaos in the state. Traffic lights are down, refrigerators are off, schools are closed, including the University of California, Berkeley’s campus. Water utilities may be shut off too, impacting agriculture and access to clean drinking water. Public health is at risk as people reliant on ventilators and other medical devices scramble for backups, while hospitals may even have to temporarily close. Outraged Californians are panic-buying generators, batteries, gas, and bottled water. This is what happens when the power system — on which nearly all aspects of modern life and a modern economy rely — goes down. Yet California’s traumatic week of erratic energy is the daily norm for billions of people around the world. While California’s shut-off might last five days or more, in Nigeria, home to 200 million, people experience power outages an average of 32 times per month. Unreliable energy is an everyday occurrence. The typical American uses 13,000 kilowatt-hours (kWh) of electricity per year versus just 150 kWh in Nigeria and less than 100 kWh in Ethiopia. Even worse, policymakers, entrepreneurs, and philanthropists most often try to attack this global problem by exporting California’s approaches: Mitigate by reducing energy consumption and adapt by transitioning to small distributed generation. Unfortunately, these are the exact opposite of what Africa needs. Californians are trying to reduce the emissions that cause climate change through such measures as renewable energy mandates and efficiency targets. But Californians know that, while mitigation might blunt the worst-case scenarios, the effects of climate change are already happening. That’s why the state’s residents have an increasing urgency to adapt to the new reality, not just mitigate it. Fortunately, California is starting in a good place. When it gets too hot, most residents can crank up the air conditioning, buy water, and replace spoiled food. We’re rich enough as a country to invest billions — the Green New Deal proposes to spend trillions — to build safer buildings, seawalls, and other critical infrastructure. And California’s deadly wildfires and other calamities are accelerating calls to invest in better energy storage and shift to distributed energy generation. But unlike Africa and much of the rest of the world, California can afford to transition to rooftop solar and other innovations of adaptation. As the world’s fifth-largest economy, it has both the resources and (far more importantly) an entire high-energy ecosystem that makes these approaches possible. Residential homes in the Bay Area, fed up with the lumbering local utility, may opt to go off-grid, but the big technology firms — Apple, Facebook, Google, Tesla — all have high-energy connections that kept humming even through the recent outages. This is no coincidence. Smartphones are a good example of how small-is-beautiful energy can be misleading. Everyone can charge a phone on a tiny system, even on a single solar lamp. But smartphones only function if all the invisible high-energy infrastructure behind it stays up and running. In fact, charging the battery accounts for less than 1% of the power needed for a smartphone. The other 99% is needed to manufacture the phone and run the cell towers and data centers. Having a fully-charged smartphone without all this hidden infrastructure makes it useless. The same is true for a modern economy; everyone can take their homes off-grid for basic appliances, but the economy will still depend on a stable, large-scale energy system for industry, commerce, agriculture, and transportation. But what about those 200 million Nigerians? And everyone else on the African continent, which will be home to one-third of humanity by the end of this century? Few Africans have the wealth and resources to adapt like those living in California. The average Nigerian earns only about $5 per day, so they don’t have the safety net that most Americans can fall back on. And Nigeria’s economy, the continent’s biggest, isn’t growing fast enough to create jobs and lift incomes. While Africa is likely to suffer most from the effects of climate change, it is indisputably the region of the world that bears by far the least responsibility for those effects. What’s the leading barrier to economic expansion in Nigeria and most African countries? Lack of affordable and reliable power. The typical American uses 13,000 kilowatt-hours (kWh) of electricity per year versus just 150 kWh in Nigeria and less than 100 kWh in Ethiopia. The energy inequality gaps are so vast that Californians consume more electricity playing video games than the entire country of Kenya. The Golden State’s hot tubs and swimming pools use more power than all of Senegal. In practical terms, this means most Africans don’t have access to the same benefits of lighting, heat and cooling, computers and data centers, and all the other machines needed to earn income and grow an economy. If the energy inequality chasm between California and African countries isn’t bad enough, many people make the mistake of transposing a Western climate strategy to Africa. Here’s why that’s wrong: California’s climate mitigation strategy is in large part built around pushing for energy efficiency and decarbonizing the power sector. Many advocates have mindlessly applied this same strategy to Africa, such as calls to ban financing for fossil fuels and arguing for renewables-only restrictions on power projects. I’ve been told more than once by leaders in philanthropy that “because of climate, we can’t afford for every African to live our lifestyles.” But while Africa is likely to suffer most from the effects of climate change, it is indisputably the region of the world that bears by far the least responsibility for those effects. Today, the average American emits 33 times as much carbon dioxide as the average Nigerian. And African economies are also already using mostly low-carbon sources of power. Kenya’s electricity mix, for example, is dominated by zero-emission geothermal, while the country recently built the continent’s largest wind farm. Beyond the ethical considerations (and the hypocrisy), insisting on renewables-only for Africa can’t possibly work as a climate mitigation strategy because of simple arithmetic. Preventing a handful of gas-fired power plants in Nigeria or Ghana or Mozambique won’t have any measurable effect on global emissions when the United States has more than 3,000 power plants running on fossil fuels. Blocking big power plants in Africa will, however, have a very real damaging effect on humans living in those countries. That’s why transferring California’s climate mitigation strategy of energy austerity to Africa can’t help — but it will cause measurable harm to hundreds of millions. But it gets even worse. While Californians have a wealthy high-energy system to fall back on for adaptation, Africans don’t. If Nigerians and Mozambicans are supposed to respond to extreme weather, drought, and rising temperatures, they’re going to need concrete and steel for resilient infrastructure, pumped irrigation for agriculture, desalination for clean water, cold storage, and a whole lot of air conditioning. Here’s the kicker: All these technologies of adaptation are energy intensive. So climate change means African countries are going to need far more energy, not less. In California, blackouts are an inconvenience. In Africa, blackouts are a way of life. The uproar over recent power shutdowns provides a good reminder of why all nations need reliable high-energy systems. If we’re all to respond to the dual challenges of promoting human prosperity for all while building climate resilience, energy is a core part of the solution."
Medium.com,Society,New Nobel Laureate Is A Genocide Apologist,World,https://medium.com/citizen-truth/new-nobel-laureate-is-a-genocide-apologist-6699515faea5?source=topic_page---------379------------------1," The Nobel Committee’s decision to name Austrian author Peter Handke as one of the two winners of the Nobel Prize in literature on Thursday ignited widespread outrage, with critics pointing to his support for the Serbs during the 1990s Yugoslav Wars and defense of their genocide against Muslims in Bosnia as a horrible position to validate in era of ascendant illiberalism, nationalism, and historical falsification. “This is the single most offensive possible decision,” Petrit Selimi, the former foreign minister of Kosovo, wrote on Twitter. “What’s next? Assad for Peace Prize?” Handke has written sympathetically about the Serbian role in the war for years, arguing the media unfairly placed the majority of the blame for the wars’ atrocities on the Serbs. Most notably, Handke attended the funeral of Serbian nationalist leader Slobodan Milosevic, who died while awaiting trial for war crimes and genocide at the Hague. Handke gave a eulogy at the funeral, saying he was “close to Yugoslavia, close to Serbia, close to Slobodan Milosevic.” Historians, journalists, intellectuals, and war survivors widely contradict Handke’s narrative of the Yugoslav wars. The former state of Yugoslavia was formed after World War II and composed of Serbs, Croats, Bosnian Muslims, Albanians, and Slovenes, which split apart as genocide and ethnic cleansing returned to Europe in the 1990s. Slobodan Milosevic, known as “the butcher of the Balkans” tapped into the resentment of his people to preside over multiple wars that killed over 250,000 people. Historian Orlando Figes described Handke as a “notorious apologist for the murderous regime of Slobodan Milosevic.” Writer David Reiff, who reported from the Bosnian war zone, reviewed Handke’s essays on the war, writing, “The truth is that he doesn’t know what he’s talking about. … He came to Serbia knowing nothing about its complicated politics and, to judge by the book, left knowing no more.” Others complimented Handke’s artistry, but castigated his defense of the Serbian genocide. “He is a fine writer, who combines great insight with shocking ethical blindness,” author Hari Kunzru told the Guardian. Kunzru also said that he believed Handke likely would have won the prize earlier, “had he not decided to act as a propagandist for the genocidal Milošević regime.” Kunzru added: “More than ever we need public intellectuals who are able to make a robust defense of human rights in the face of the indifference and cynicism of our political leaders. Handke is not such a person.” Famous Slovenian philosopher Slavoj Žižek similarly condemned the decision: “In 2014, Handke called for the Nobel to be abolished, saying it was a ‘false canonisation’ of literature. The fact that he got it now proves that he was right. This is Sweden today: an apologist of war crimes gets a Nobel prize while the country fully participated in the character assassination of the true hero of our times, Julian Assange. Our reaction should be: not the literature Nobel prize for Handke but the Nobel peace prize for Assange.” Some critics argue the decision shows that the prestigious intellectual prize has forfeited any remaining legitimacy. The Swedish Academy postponed its awards last year after a widely publicized sex scandal, saying it would take time to reflect on its purpose. Handke’s laureateship left critics disappointed that the Academy’s decision-making process remains deeply flawed. Journalist Peter Maass, who reported from Bosnia during the war, was dumbfounded by the Nobel Committee’s decision to elevate “a writer who embodies the prime intellectual diseases of our era.” “There are lots of award-winning writers who have dumb ideas about politics and politicians, and who write bad books from time to time,” wrote Maass for the Intercept. “That’s not disqualifying for a Nobel prize or a three-martini lunch with their editor. But that’s not what we’re talking about here.” “We’re talking about denying a genocide — turning history on its head, making perpetrators into heroes and victims into villains. And this particular history, of Christians killing Muslims for the supposed sake of defending their culture, is an important one to get right at a time of heightened discrimination of Muslims and other minorities in America and Western Europe.” “The aesthetes on the Nobel Committee have made a selection that will destroy their prize, as it should,” wrote Maass.

Medium.com,Society,We Are At Level 5 In Tokyo Right Now,World,https://medium.com/@ericjscholl/we-are-at-level-5-in-tokyo-right-now-e4eb13d10ac6?source=topic_page---------381------------------1," Update: the building is now swaying. We don’t know if it’s an earthquake or extreme gust of wind. Update: it was an earthquake! On top of everything else! Wow! Update: it’s a bright, sunny Sunday morning now. We are O.K. There are reports of widespread flood damage and some deaths. There are also questions about whether anything bad happened at the still-vulnerable nuclear power plant in Fukushima. That area was impacted hard. “Irregular readings” are the words being used to describe the situation at the plant. We have not heard any further reports, and TV is back to regular programming. Tokyo Electric Power is posting what it says are live images of the plant this morning. Because of widespread skepticism of the utility, TBS (Tokyo Broadcasting) has a fixed camera pointed at the plant non-stop. They look similar, with no discernible external damage at least. Though of course, most of what’s of concern you wouldn’t be able to see anyway. We are seeing spectacular videos of people being airlifted from roofs of their homes in areas where levees broke, as well as construction crews already working to patch those levees. Hundreds of thousands of people are without power and/or drinkable water. Trains in Tokyo by-and-large are still not running, and stores are still not open, but we expect that things will be relatively normal in that regard by this afternoon. Those of you who follow us, know we are in Japan right now. Right in time for Typhoon Hagibis, which looks like it might be a once-in-a-lifetime storm, and has been making a beeline for Tokyo for the last couple of days, and hasn’t changed course. Typhoons and hurricanes are exactly the same thing, just typhoons originate in the Northwest Pacific, hurricanes in the Northwest Atlantic. We are writing at about 6:00 P.M. Japan time, and the typhoon has not yet made landfall, so the worst is expected to come, perhaps between 7:00–11:00 P.M. tonight. In addition to flooding, there is severe concern about mudslides. There are not too many power outages yet, and few reports of loss of life, (though the JMA says it’s likely disasters have already occurred, just that we haven’t heard of yet). We’d expect both those things to change as the wind picks up, which hasn’t been a factor yet (at least not for us here.) Here’s a link to a continuously updating page from JMA in English, in case you lose touch with us (due to a power outage, or whatever). Translating millimeters to inches: the forecast 600 millimeters is equivalent to 24 inches, so somewhat less than fell during Hurricane Harvey two years ago in and around Houston, but in that range. The Mt. Fuji area town of Hakone is nearing 1000 millimeters of rain which would be close to 40 inches. We are at a mid-priced hotel in the business and entertainment area of Tokyo know as Shinjuku. (City Hall is located here, as is a notorious red-light district). Our hotel does not have meeting or banquet rooms, so we’re being told to stay in our rooms. The Meteorological Agency is telling people to go to high floors. We are on the 11th floor, and there’s really not much else we can do anyway. So we’re trying to stay busy and stay calm. We did stock up on both perishable and non-perishable food last night, enough to last through the weekend and maybe a day or two more. We were surprised, however, at how calm people seemed to be and how much was available in terms of supplies (of course, we weren’t buying stuff to board up windows or fix objects that could fly away). Stores and restaurants were quiet, but operating normally. We bought 3 giants jugs of water early in the day and carried them around all day. That was the only item widely unavailable at convenience stores by last night. Even now, we still see a taxi or two plying the streets. We don’t know why… If Japan survives this typhoon without it turning in to a complete disaster, it’ll be for a couple of reasons: At the same time, there are many old houses in Japan, which will not withstand high winds. And water releases from dams, which may have to occur because they’re reaching capacity, could accelerate flooding. Quite possibly resulting in a double-whammy for residents trying to find their way to shelter now that night has fallen. Local and national news did not go to wall-to-wall coverage until late afternoon today. (Most of the graphics included here are from our former employer, NHK.) Most of the early coverage was in regard to what train lines were shut down. Pretty much all are now, in addition to all area airports, and all big stores. At this hour, the skyline is kind of interesting. Most buildings in our immediate area are offices or hotels. In most of the offices, not one light is on. Which is unusual for a Saturday afternoon, when many people typically work. However, the hotels are a different story: every single room is lit up, and our hotel at least is fully sold out, and we think it’s fair to speculate those others are too. Part of that is because Japan is hosting the Rugby World Cup right now. We were supposed to go to a match tonight between France and England in Yokohama. That’s of course been cancelled. Savings us the dilemma of who to root for, since we don’t like either of them! The Japan National Tourist Organization is making a big show of providing lots of non-Japanese language information available for the large number of overseas guests here for the World Cup. But really, it’s a joke: Much better info. provided directly by NHK, JMA or dumping local news reports into Google Translate. We’ll check in with you on the other side…"

Medium.com,Society,Women Wage Peace,World,https://medium.com/@UNPeacekeeping/women-wage-peace-1ab5bfbef14c?source=topic_page---------385------------------1," By Ambassador Melanne Verveer Unleashing women’s power to influence and transform peace processes is critical to sustaining peace and security. Women have valuable experiences and expertise, yet there are still significant barriers to their inclusion in peace processes. That’s why UN Peacekeeping missions around the world engage women to prevent and mitigate conflicts and increase their representation in local and national peace processes. At an event on the margins of the 74th session of the UN General Assembly, I heard powerful testimonies of women from Mali and the Central African Republic (CAR), who played impactful roles in local and national peace processes. As the Head of UN Peacekeeping, Under-Secretary-General Jean-Pierre Lacroix, noted, working with local women “is one of the unseen and unsung achievements of peacekeeping.” Mali: “We will not remain victims” In Mali, peace negotiations in 2012 and 2015 largely excluded women. But the reality on the ground was particularly dire for this half of the population. There were widespread crimes against women during the conflict, including sexual violence. “Women were being raped every day — in the bush and in the bus. Villages were being burned. Let us live in peace!” said Mama Koité Doumbia, of the Women Leaders Platform in Mali. Women like Mama Koité mobilized to ensure that their voices were heard. They began to knock on the doors of the Government and the UN Peacekeeping mission in Mali, MINUSMA, asking to be involved. Many women had been displaced, experienced violence, or were without food, and their perspectives needed to be considered. They told the international community, “we will not remain victims.” They persistently demanded a seat at the table. “We got plane tickets from UN Women, we entered the room, we found extra chairs and took our seat at the table. It was hard, but we did it,” Mama Koité Doumbia said. Ultimately, at the most recent negotiations in 2015, women did participate, including one woman representing an armed group and representatives from civil society. Their participation in the Mali peace process led to the inclusion of gender provisions in Mali’s peace agreement and played an overall dispositive role in the force of the agreement. When women participate directly in peace processes, agreements are typically more inclusive and long-lasting. In fact, studies show that when women and civil society groups are included in negotiations, resulting peace agreements are 35% more likely to last at least 15 years. As hard as it is to reach an agreement, it is as difficult to implement. One critical element of implementation is raising awareness about the agreement and building trust between communities. Once again, women take the lead, trying to build bridges across divides. In Gao, Mali, 76 women’s associations from diverse ethnic groups gather to promote peace and social cohesion, an initiative supported by MINUSMA and UN Women. “Women can contribute to changing mentalities and behaviours,” said Mama Koité. Central African Republic and South Sudan We’ve seen impressive leadership and participation of women in the Central African Republic (CAR) and in South Sudan. Four women negotiators were part of the African Union-led peace process in CAR this spring, one of them an ex-combatant who also signed the final agreement. Meaningful engagement of women ex-combatants enhances the political legitimacy of peace processes. With support from the peacekeeping mission MINUSCA, women, including an ex-combatant, were engaged in the CAR peace negotiations for the first time, integrating key priorities for women into the final agreement. The UN Peacekeeping mission in South Sudan, UNMISS, and UN Women worked with the seven women who became signatories to South Sudan’s Revitalized Peace Agreement in September 2018. Overall, 28 women were involved in the peace negotiations. Since the signing of the agreement, women have been successfully engaging in community level reconciliation work and political advocacy, raising awareness of the peace agreement and pressing leaders for inclusive change. I’m convinced the agreement won’t succeed without their critical work. Much work remains The year 2020 marks the 20th anniversary of the adoption of UN Security Council resolution 1325 on Women, Peace and Security (UNSCR1325). And while we have examples of increased participation of women in peace processes as active agents of peace, it is troubling to know that there are still significant barriers to their inclusion. Twenty years later, women still make up only 2% of mediators and 8% of participants in peace processes — even though there is no shortage of high caliber women. And 20 years later, peace processes continue to be undermined because of the lack of women’s participation. Culture and norms remain a barrier, as does a lack of resources. Women have the capacity to lead, and evidence clearly shows that they have made a difference. We must continue to support them to make peace happen and ensure it will be sustained. I will continue to do my part. I call on governments to embrace their responsibility to step up to the plate to ensure that women like Mama Koité Doumbia in Mali and the women of CAR and South Sudan can continue to play an effective role in bringing sustainable peace to their countries and communities. Ambassador Melanne Verveer is the Executive Director of the Georgetown Institute for Women, Peace and Security and Special Representative on Gender Issues for the OSCE Chairmanship."
Medium.com,Society,"The $67 Billion UN Pension Fund: The Good, the Bad and the Ugly",World,https://medium.com/@PassBlue2016/the-67-billion-un-pension-fund-the-good-the-bad-and-the-ugly-847bd19836f0?source=topic_page---------386------------------1," by Lorraine Rickard-Martin. This article originally appeared in PassBlue. Since 2014, when staff members of the United Nations Pension Fund blew the whistle on serious mismanagement in its secretariat, a change in leadership has been made on both sides — assets and liabilities — of the $67.4 billion fund. Yet the turmoil persists. Stabilizing the fund’s management and investment decisions has been mandated by General Assembly governance reforms that culminated in a 2018 resolution, A/RES/73/274, amid a continuing dysfunctional culture clouding the fund’s operations. Rejection of independent audits and other checks and balances The comprehensive governance audit ( A/73/341), June 2018) that the Assembly requested lays out numerous conflicts of interest between the pension board and the fund’s management. The audit faced a chilly reception. Last year at the board’s annual meeting in Rome, it rejected most of the findings and referred the UN oversight auditors to the Independent Audit Advisory Committee, alleging a “flawed and unprofessional” process. Last month, the audit advisory committee affirmed in a letter dated Sept. 5 to the board’s chairman, Ambassador Philip Richard Owade (of Kenya), that it found no evidence that professional auditing practice and standards had not been followed. Whistleblowers not welcomed Board members’ resentment against the board’s UN participant representatives, who represent 85,000 active UN staff members and include the whistleblowers who raised awareness about problems in the fund’s secretariat under the ex-chief executive, Sergio Arvizù, drives board dynamics. Additional tensions come from smaller UN specialized agencies on the board who fear reforms, particularly those in which they could lose their voting weights if adjustments are made to the board’s composition, based on relative numbers of members and size of contributions. When the board tried to block the whistleblowers from taking their seats as elected members of the body, the UN Appeals Tribunal found in their favor and pronounced the board’s actions “unlawful” and “egregious.” Undaunted, the board pursued amendments to fund rules and regulations to limit the scope of issues that were referred to the Appeals Tribunal and to prevent fund staff members from running for election to the board. Slow-walking General Assembly reforms The UN participant representatives said they were subjected to intimidation, physical threats and suspension in one case at the annual board meeting in Nairobi in July. The board’s communiqué about the meeting, dated July 26, 2019, and posted on the fund’s website, is long on process, such as the need for attendees’ “loyalty, discretion and conscience” and confidentiality, but short on substance. There’s little expectation of meaningful substance in the board’s upcoming report on General the Assembly’s directives or requests. Investments: a plus The representative of the UN secretary-general for investments, Sudhir Rajkumar of India, reported that after record-low revenues were registered in December 2018, the market value for the fund had rebounded by last June from $60.4 billion to $67.4 billion. The fund is also exceeding its long-term real rate of return of 3.5 percent by a healthy margin. On the fund’s environmental and social policy, on which Rajkumar promised a comprehensive report, the fund has divested from tobacco, arms and coal stocks but concerns remain about its investment in oil companies. Concerns also linger over whether Rajkumar’s policy shifts from equities to alternative investments and an increased emphasis on geographic diversification will reduce some inflation risks while increasing others. There are accusations that Rajkumar tends to micromanage and has a low tolerance for dissent, including on investment decisions, and that career staff members fear being displaced by waves of new recruits. Asked about these problems, Rajkumar responded that change in management often results in such reactions, and that instead of micromanaging, he had strengthened the investment decision-making process. In addition, he had indicated to everyone that he would welcome a UN oversight investigation of all complaints that have been filed, so the truth could come out. While he understood that a few staff members might feel vulnerable because of low investment performance numbers, no career staff member had been displaced, nor was there any intention to do so. The fund’s secretariat When Janice Dunn Lee (of the United States), a former nuclear negotiator and deputy director general at the UN’s International Atomic Energy Agency, who has been acting chief executive of the fund’s secretariat since January, visited the fund’s Geneva office last week, staff members reportedly wore black. It prompted her to say she felt “disrespected.” Geneva staff members apparently wore black to express their dismay that Lee has proposed, and the board has reportedly accepted, to move two senior jobs from Geneva to New York, purportedly to enhance coordination between the two offices. The president of the Geneva retiree association wrote to Lee on July 5, noting that the Geneva office serves beneficiaries in Europe, the Middle East and Africa (62 percent of all beneficiaries) and that the move will leave large numbers of beneficiaries underserved. Years of fluctuating reports about the status of processing new and old benefit cases continues, with compliance against the 15-day benchmark for processing new cases ranging from 80 percent (according to Lee at a meeting of New York UN retirees last June) to 93.1 percent, as listed in a fund booklet titled “UNJSPF 70 Years 2019,” published last month. But an internal dashboard last week posted a compliance rate of 57 percent. Regarding old cases, Lee announced in Nairobi at the annual board meeting, according to its communiqué, that “there is no backlog of entitlement cases.” The audit (page 65) notes that of 15,000 pending cases that were not reported as backlog, the fund said it was not responsible for cases until all documentation was received, so those cases are not included in the count. And what can be made of the $45 million of forfeitures of benefits, according to the fund’s 2018 financial statements; or 4000 cases slated for forfeiture, according to the UN participant representatives’ report? Tone at the top The audit recommends that the “Board should take effective measures to ensure that the secretariat of the fund sets the appropriate tone at the top with regard to integrity and ethical values.” It is unclear who will ensure that the board adheres to these values, given these recent examples of rule-bending: * The former chief executive’s disability agreement was processed, against fund rules, through the staff pension committee of the International Atomic Energy Agency, where he never worked. That way, the agreement bypassed the UN staff pension committee and was facilitated by the head of the UN Office of Human Resources, a board member. * The UN Ethics Office substantiated, and the UN Administration accepted, that Arvizù, the ex-chief executive, retaliated against three fund staff members, yet the human resources office took no action. * The human resources office, in collaboration with the board, advertised a job vacancy for a Pension Benefits Administrator/CEO in May, although the General Assembly decided to replace the single chief executive post by creating two separate ones: a Pension Benefits Administrator and Secretary to the Board, no later than January 2020. What fund members want First and foremost, the fund’s members want the General Assembly to end the board’s slow-walking of reforms and to enforce compliance. To ensure equitable board representation, including direct election of retiree representatives for the sake of transparency and representative democracy. To ensure a professional and transparent board that respects the fund’s rules and regulations, without onerous confidentiality requirements; respects the UN Code of Conduct “To Prevent Harassment, including Sexual Harassment, at UN System Events”; and ends attempts to intimidate and muzzle the UN participant representatives. To ensure sound investment management in accordance with the fund’s longstanding policy of balancing safety and profitability and the highest environmental and social standards. To have more attention paid to the people, including widows and orphans, behind the statistics of pending benefit cases and tens of millions of forfeitures; and reverse the decision to gut the Geneva office, leaving almost two-thirds of beneficiaries underserved. To have the hardworking staff members of the fund be treated fairly and with respect for due process and end harassment of the fund staff representative. To have Secretary-General António Guterres ensure that the incoming fund secretariat head, Rosemarie McClean, formerly with the Ontario [Canada] Teachers Pension Plan, who is due to arrive in January, has high-caliber senior staff members to work with. To urge Guterres and his representatives on the board, who are already taking a constructive approach, to positively transform the fund’s grievance-based management culture. That is how the General Assembly reforms, so critical to the fund’s sustainability, can be achieved."
Medium.com,Society,"UN Bankruptcy Looms, Funding Set to Run Out in Weeks",World,https://medium.com/citizen-truth/un-bankruptcy-looms-funding-set-to-run-out-in-weeks-ec64803b2c34?source=topic_page---------387------------------1," The United Nations is facing a severe budget deficit of $230 million due to delayed payments from member countries. The organization’s Secretary-General Antonio Guterres warned on Monday that the world body would run out of money by the end of October 2019. “Member states have paid only 70% of the total amount needed for our regular budget operations in 2019,” Guterres wrote in a letter on October 7 to the U.N.’s 37,000 employees and obtained by AFP news. “This translates into a cash shortage of USD $230 million at the end of September. We run the risk of depleting our backup liquidity reserves by the end of the month.” The U.N. will have to postpone some of its scheduled conferences and meetings and reduce some service programs to survive the budget crisis, Guterres added. The budget problem has also forced the secretary-general to restrict official travels to only essential activities. According to an unidentified U.N. official, Guterres has asked member countries to up their contributions since early 2019, but they refused to do so. Guterres stressed that the U.N. financial health responsibility lay in its members. The U.N. operational budget for the 2018–2019 period is approaching $5.4 billion. The financial woes of the U.N. do not come as a surprise. Last year, Guterres sent a warning letter to the U.N’s 193 member countries to pay their dues on time, adding that the institution “never faced such a difficult cash flow situation this early in the calendar year.” “An organization such as ours should not have to suffer repeated brushes with bankruptcy. But surely, the greater pain is felt by those we serve when we cannot, for want of modest funds, answer their call for help,” Guterres said in a letter to the member states. U.N. funding is split into two categories: mandatory (or assessed dues) and voluntary funds. All of the U.N.’s 193 members must pay a percentage of both the U.N. operating and peacekeeping budget. The organization uses a complicated formula to determine a percentage paid by each member. The U.S is so far the largest donor to the U.N. (which President Donald Trump opposes as “unfair”). In 2016 Washington contributed $10 billion of the U.N.’s $50 billion budget making the U.S.’ contribution larger than the sum of funds provided by the next three nations combined (Britain, Japan and Germany), Brookings data showed. In 2018 the U.S. paid 22% the U.N.’s general budget and 28% of the U.N.’s peacekeeping budget. Members also can make voluntary payments. Some U.N. organizations such as the World Food Program and the United Nations Children’s Funds rely on voluntary contributions. Non-governmental organizations can contribute voluntarily. The Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, owned by tech mogul Bill Gates, is the second-largest donor to the World Health Organization (WHO). Under U.N. rules, a country with a debt equal or exceeding its payment for the previous two years will lose its voting rights in the United Nations General Assembly, unless it proves that its inability to pay is beyond its control. Libya, as an example, has lost its voting rights, but despite being in arrears, Somalia, Guinea Bissau, Comoros and Sao Tome and Principe still retain their voting rights. Ahead of the last year’s U.N. General Assembly, U.S. President Trump announced the U.S. would slash all financial support for the U.N. Relief and Works Agency, the U.N. body that supports Palestinian refugees, calling the agency “irreedeemably flawed.” Trump had also previously cut U.S. funding to other U.N. bodies such as UNESCO and the U.N. Population Fund. The White House also previously proposed funding cuts to UNICEF, a U.N. body providing support for vulnerable children worldwide, as UN Dispatch reported last March. In early January signs of a U.N. bankruptcy came as United Nations chief Antonio Guterres warned that U.N. member states owed $2 billion in U.N. peacekeeping funds, with the U.S. responsible for one-third of the missing funds. Cutting funds to the U.N. and various international bodies has been a trend under the Trump administration which has repeatedly sought to withdraw itself from international commitments and pursue a more isolationist foreign policy. Trump’s first proposed budget as U.S. president called for slashing $1 billion in U.N. peacekeeping funds prompting warnings that such a drastic funding loss would severely impact the U.N.’s programs and mission. “The figures presented would simply make it impossible for the U.N. to continue all of its essential work advancing peace, development, human rights and humanitarian assistance,” Stephane Dujarric, spokesman for Secretary-General Antonio Guterres, said in response to Trump’s 2017 funding cut proposal. Now, two years later, a U.N. bankruptcy looms as the agency may be out of money before the end of October. Read the original article and sign up for our newsletter at https://citizentruth.org"
Medium.com,Society,United Arab Emirates Withdraws Forces from Yemen Port City of Aden,World,https://medium.com/citizen-truth/united-arab-emirates-withdraws-forces-from-yemen-port-city-of-aden-95f57913c62e?source=topic_page---------388------------------1," Yemeni officials, speaking anonymously to Bloomberg, announced they observed the withdrawal of United Arab Emirates’ troops, along with some Sudanese forces, in the Yemeni port of Aden and the Al-Anad military airbase in Lahj province. Yet, a spokesman for Sudan’s Foreign Ministry denied his government ordered any withdrawal of the Sudanese soldiers. According to Bloomberg, the troop withdrawal comes following recently held talks in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia between the Saudi-backed government of Yemen, headed by President Abdrabbuh Mansur Hadi, and the separatist Southern Transitional Council (STC) of Yemen, which the United Arab Emirates (UAE) backs. The talks reportedly reached an agreement over the return to Aden of both Hadi’s government and the Yemeni parliament. The agreement also stipulated the formation of a new administration for Yemen to include members of the separatist Transitional Council. Separatist fighters will integrate into the Yemeni security forces, according to the agreement in Saudi Arabia. In August of this year, fierce battles between local allies of Saudi Arabia and UAE and separatists erupted in Aden and led to the separatist takeover of Aden and other parts of Abyan and Lahj province. Although Sudan’s foreign ministry denied Sudanese troops have withdrawn from Aden, the Foreign Minister of Sudan, Anwar Gargash, said Oct. 6 that his country “appreciates and fully supports” the Jeddah talks. The Saudi efforts are working to restore unity among Yemenis against the Houthi rebels. Saudi-sponsored talks for Yemeni rivals come as the Houthi armed group, which is believed to have backing from the Shiite Iran Islamic State, has recently intensified aerial attacks, involving explosives-laden drones and missiles against Saudi Arabia. Most recently Houthis claimed responsibility for the large-scale attack on the Saudi oil refining company, Aramco. The internationally recognized Yemeni government of Hadi declared Aden as its capital in 2015, following the Houthi rebels’ takeover of the Yemeni capital, Sanaa, in 2014. However, following the takeover of Aden by the STC, last month, Hadi announced a new interim capital in the city of Ataq. According to the Middle East Monitor, in spite of the UAE’s withdrawal from parts of Aden, some reports suggested that UAE-backed mercenary forces, known as the “Giant Brigades”, have been re-positioning from Yemeni coastal areas toward Aden. A Begin and Sadat Center for Strategic Studies (BESA) paper released in August of this year by Dr. James M. Dorsey, a senior fellow at the S. Rajaratnam School of International Studies at Singapore’s Nanyang Technological University, argued that the UAE’s pullout of troops from Aden underscored the gap in the middle east between the UAE and Saudi Arabia. Dorsay also claimed the UAE troop withdrawal suggested the UAE was preparing for the possibility of a military confrontation between Iran and the U.S. with the UAE, and Saudi Arabia, as battlegrounds. The difference between the two militarily allied countries in Yemen, according to Dorsay, lies in the UAE’s position not to blame Iran — Saudi Arabia’s regional foe — for a series of frequent Houthi rebel attacks on Saudi Arabia and the UAE’s contrasting image. Both the UAE and Saudi Arabia have been condemned for attacks on civilian targets throughout the Yemen War, but Dorsay argues the UAE is more “keen” to preserve its image as a model and preferred country for Arab youth. The UAE troop withdrawal will, thus, leave Saudi Arabia more open to condemnation for its humanitarian atrocities in Yemen. However, according to Dorsay, Saudi Arabia and the UAE maintain an alliance as being important to preserve their status quo as autocratic regimes in the face of almost one decade of regional popular protests and civil wars. Fighting in Yemen began five years ago when Houthi rebels took control of large parts of the country, including the capital Sanaa in late 2014. Mass protests and the Houthi rebel group forced the internationally recognized government of President Abdrabbuh Mansur Hadi from power in 2015. Hadi is now reportedly in exile in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia. The civil war has its roots in the 2011 Arab Spring that led to a 2011 Yemen uprising that eventually forced the end of the 32-year-long regime of Yemen’s late president, Ali Abdullah Saleh. The uprising grew into a military conflict in 2014 and thousands, perhaps hundreds of thousands, of people have died or been displaced.

Medium.com,Society,Ethiopia May Have Just Made A Powerful Enemy In The United States,World,https://medium.com/@ericjscholl/ethiopia-may-have-just-made-a-powerful-enemy-in-the-united-states-d33d9007635a?source=topic_page---------389------------------1," And, as we’ve said before, Trump really really wants a Nobel Prize. Abiy Ahmed got it for holding out his hand to Eritrea’s President, or more specifically, as the Nobel Committee puts it: “For his efforts to achieve peace and international cooperation, and in particular for his decisive initiative to resolve the border conflict with neighbouring Eritrea.” Trump thinks he should get it for holding out his hand to North Korean leader Kim Jong-un, a relationship that seems to be centered around a regular exchange of “beautiful letters”, and which so far has climaxed with Trump taking a step into North Korea. (Even though talks with Kim Jong-un have gone nowhere, and North Korea has begun testing missiles again, though only shortish range missiles, which Trump seems to think are O.K.) He also thought he had his Nobel nearly in the bag when he invited a bunch of Taliban leaders from Afghanistan over to Camp David, but then the terrorists started acting like terrorists, and he rescinded the invitation, but not until he bragged about it on Twitter. Ethiopia and Eritrea signed a peace agreement last year after addressing a border dispute that lasted for decades. In order to do so, Abiy agreed to give control of a contested border city to Eritrea, so Trump would probably call him “weak” for that alone. Plus Eritrea wasn’t fighting alongside the U.S. during World War II at the beaches of Normandy, which seems to be a strike against anybody these days in Trump’s book. In case you missed it, Trump partly justified abandoning Kurdish allies in Northern Syria by arguing they did not fight alongside the U.S. at Normandy. (An argument he cribbed from a far-Right wing commentator.) Of course, Germany didn’t help the U.S. during the Normandy landing either. Eritrea actually did have an interesting World War II history: starting out as an Italian colony, it was eventually taken over by the British, who kept it a colony. Then the U.S. was instrumental in making it semi-merged with Ethiopa, which is where a lot of the disputes between the two countries were born. Eritrea became fully independent in 1993. But back to Ethiopia’s President Abiy. We looked into his history a bit and he seems to be the real deal. First of all, he is the child of a Muslim father and Christian mother. There are a lot of mixed religion families in parts of the mid-East, and it’s a shame more leaders don’t share this type of background. (Although part of the reason many people become politicians, we think, is that they want to prove their lifestyle and the ideas that come with it is superior, and then work to impose it on everyone. And very often those lifestyle choices and ideas involve religion.) Still, many African countries have huge populations of both Muslims and Christians, so promoting politicians who come from this type of background would seem to make some kind of sense. Abiy, upon coming into office, freed tons of political prisoners lifted a state of emergency, and unblocked hundreds of websites and TV channels. He also — noted the Nobel Committee — expanded the role of women in government. He is also, as the Nobel Committee notes, a fresh and emerging new kind of leader in Africa. And he’s got to be extremely charismatic to pull of the type of high-wire balancing act we’re talking about here. Of pushing ahead without offending too many too much. Even so, he’s already survived a major attempt on his life. Trump, if he’s got wind of this yet, has got to be fuming. We’re still waiting on his Tweets on the subject. Maybe it’s just he got caught off guard by the fact that this years Nobel Peace Prize Winner wasn’t Greta Thunberg, the young environmental advocate (whom Trump loves to trash), who was the odds-on favorite. Perhaps Trump had some Tweets “locked and loaded” for that eventuality and now he’s caught off guard by the Nobel Committee’s curve ball. But rest assured, those Tweets will come. Trump won’t be able to resist, and his base responds mightily to any strong injustice that comes the Presidents way. And this would certainly fit the bill, in their eyes. Though the Nobel, likely, will continue to prove elusive."
Medium.com,Society,Crown Sydney Casino in Barangaroo: The Cultural and Economic impact.,World,https://medium.com/@ornilla_shamon/crown-sydney-casino-in-barangaroo-the-cultural-and-economic-impact-86626b2c8bb7?source=topic_page---------390------------------1," I would like to recognise and acknowledge the Gadigal people of the Eora nation. The First People and Traditional Custodians of the land upon which the Barangaroo area is built upon. I offer and pay respects to the Elders both past and present. B
arangaroo is an inner city suburb of Sydney, New South Wales. It is situated on the western side of Sydney’s Central District. It is a place known for their beautiful parklands, enticing harbour views and innovative designs. Barangaroo was the home for the Indigenous Gardigal people. Dr Andrea Connor from Western Sydney University conveys how home is much more meaningful than just a “physical spare”. It’s something that society invests “meaning, memory, cultural value and social significance”. The name of Barangaroo is extremely meaningful as it was named after an Indigenous Cammeraygal woman. Her husband was Bennelong, a Wangal man, influential and very well known. Barangaroo lived around the North Harbour and Manly. NSW Infrastructure describe her to be “independent” and “strong”. She also dealt with the early settlers through her own ways. Associate Professor of History and Philosophy at UNSW suggests that “Barangaroo’s power came from her role as a hunter and provider”. Therefore, this land has historical and cultural importance, as it was once the home for the ‘First Peoples’. However, the memory of Barangaroo as a fertile, natural and cultural landscape is fading. The land was paramount to Aboriginal life as it provided the community with a sense of meaning. Barangaroo was important for both fishing and hunting, which is considered central to Aboriginal culture and personal/communal needs. Currently, the place of Barangaroo has now transformed into something else. It has become a rich financial district. As Chris Johnson conveys, it has become “a global centre of financial trading and in moving the city into the next generation of its built form”. At the root of this topic is the Crown Sydney Casino being constructed in Barangaroo, which is estimated to cost $2.2 billion and is expected to open in 2021. The real question here is whether the memory of Barangaroo regarding its rich Indigenous heritage is being properly commemorated? And whether economic benefits and private interests should be favoured over the public interests? According to Professor Walter Benjamin, “memory is the scene of the past as well as the medium of what has been experienced the way the earthen realm is the medium in which dead cities lie buried”. The area of Barangaroo illuminates historical memory, due its rich indigenous heritage. The Indigenous history is a fundamental element that provides the city with character and liveliness. It is a memory that is ongoing. Thus, many residents and public icons argue that a Crown Sydney in Barangaroo is a clash of values and beliefs since in no form, does it acknowledge any historical or cultural context. The Lord Mayor Clover Moore states, “It’s outrageous that the precious public land along the foreshore of the global city has been sacrificed so private interests can profit from selling apartments to millionaires. Both NSW Government and Opposition supported the proposal to build this tower, cannibalising our planned parkland and continuous harbour foreshore. This remains an outrageous betrayal of the community’s trust, an abuse of power that places private profit ahead of the public interest.” On another occasion, The Lord Mayor Clover Moore also recently stated in May, “Profit and private interests are clearly being put ahead of public good. Barangaroo is public land owned by us all, but the Liberal/National Government is bending over backwards to install a casino, multi-million dollar apartments and parking that will only benefit developers”. In 2018, BLAK BOX was premiered at Barangaroo Reserve in Sydney. The program allowed individuals to experience “The First Peoples concept of Deep Listening in a surrounded, art and listening space”. It conveys the oral histories of Barangaroo before 1788. Curator of BLAK BOX, Daniel Browning recently told Western Sydney University (School of Communications) that, “Barangaroo has become a beautiful theme park that has just been planted on the western foreshore of Sydney harbour”. He also sates, “it has become a pleasure ground for the rich”. Moreover, Mr Browning conveys that “even with all of the rehabilitation and revegetation of the site, it still has become a made creation. It is difficult to pretend that the site has not been scarred or damaged or just invented”. In a sense, Barangaroo has lost its natural character. Mr Browning states how one of his first guests who attended the BLAK BOX program conveyed that, “Barangaroo itself was a wound, it was empty and hollow. It is a hollow space underneath the cutaway”. Moreover, Mr Browning also discusses how many Aboriginal people will not visit Barangaroo as it is considered to be a curse. Another question to ask is how the name of Barangaroo is living on? Dr Heidi Norman from the University of Technology answers this thoroughly. She states, “the naming of that site opens up a whole new conversation about women, Aboriginal women. So often women are left out of these early colonial stories because the colonisers, they assumed a kind of patriarchal society. On one occasion the Europeans, thinking that they could offer gifts, they hauled in something like 4,000 Australian salmon and gave that as a gift to the Eora men. Barangaroo was really angry about that. She was wanting to maintain and reinforce the position of women in their clan group as powerful providers for their mob”. In addition, as inferred by the mayor, the construction of Crown Casino is favouring private interests in order to gain economic benefits. Dr Ann Holmes states, “Australia will look to maintain and build upon the trading partnership it has had with China in recent years”. Subsequently, Australia’s partnership with China will also be pivotal in promoting tourism in Australia, since studies shows it has been declining. The Allen Consulting Group have conducted a Crown Sydney Proposal: An Economic Benefit Assessment which has been prepared by Crown Melbourne. This report highlights that “annual tourism balance of trade has been in deficit for 7 years and now stands at a record low of over $7.2 billion”. The Allen Consulting Group has also noted that China has “the fastest growth with regard to expenditure on international tourism, multiplying expenditure four times”. Additionally, it will also aid in helping combat Australia’s lack of hotel accommodation in Sydney. Moreover, “the Tourism Association of Australia found Sydney needs 150 to 550 new hotel rooms every year or 5,000 rooms by 2020 to meet the demands of the tourism sector”. Furthermore, other pivotal economic benefits include a boost in business investment of over $200 million and the creation of an additional 1400 jobs per year. This report also articulates that once Crown Casino is open in Sydney, the gross state product is estimated to increase by $300-$440 million per year. This includes, “the spending of visitors to the complex, especially overseas visitors, and the consequent flow-on effects to other industries in the state”. Although, it is creating a boost in business, the Crown Casino in Barangaroo is receiving criticism for its height. The Sydney Observatory has stated their concern that views of the city will be obscured by the building. According to the National Trust Submission, “True landmarks … achieve this status through their excellence in design … Height per se is not the yardstick”. The Crown will be the tallest tower in Sydney, which is specified by Crown to be 275 metres. Architect Philip Thalis, recently told the Guardian that, “Barangaroo is a demonstration of everything that is wrong in contemporary Australian city-making”. Tourist John Simon from the United States of America states how the massive cost of this building could have been spent elsewhere. “Hospitals, schools, parks… this is where the money should have been spent. Or they should invest into solving important issues such as combating homelessness”. Infrastructure NSW was contacted numerous times, regarding the community’s interests. Questions were asked regarding their powers or roles within this development and what they can do to ensure that the community will have developments that support them. Their spokesperson responded stating, “On July 1st 2019, the Barangaroo Delivery Authority was abolished with its functions transferring to Infrastructure NSW. Infrastructure NSW is now the NSW Government agency responsible for the development of Barangaroo and management of its public spaces. Upon completion, more than half of Barangaroo will be dedicated public space. This will include a continuous Sydney Harbour promenade, expansive parklands, plazas and coves”. Infrastructure NSW was also questioned regarding how Barangaroo’s Indigenous heritage is being commemorated. There spokesperson responded stating, “Barangaroo has a rich and diverse history. Today, Aboriginal contemporary culture is celebrated at Barangaroo through artworks, events and commemorations. In addition, visitors to Barangaroo can connect with Aboriginal culture and the site’s rich cultural history through educational tours through the Reserve. Work on the development of Barangaroo is continuing. Key projects underway include remediation of the old Millers Point Gasworks, completion of the southern precinct, development of Central Barangaroo, upgrade of Hickson Road and a new Metro station”. As stated by NSW Infrastructure, there is currently Aboriginal Cultural Tours presented by environmental educator, Clarence Slockee. These tours allows individuals to experience cultural ambience through learning Australia’s heritage. The duration is 90 minutes, allowing individuals to witness 75,000 different native Australian trees and shrubs. The ticket costs $36.30 for adults and $16.50 for children. Click here to purchase tickets or learn more about educational tours. Further, it is also important to discuss the potential for crime in NSW as a result of Crown Sydney Casino in Barangaroo. The Victoria Gaming Regulatory Body and Crown Casino has had constant unfavourable media representation due to constant scandals involving money laundering, Chinese organised crime, fast tracked visas for Chinese gamblers, sex trafficking, and crime syndicates. Nick McKenzie, Grace Tobin and Nick Toscano recently highlighted in an Age article stating,“police and security agencies are now asking questions about the movement in and out of Australia of Chinese high rollers with links to the Chinese Communist Party or organised crime syndicates”. There has also been leaked documents which proves that Crown has conducted business with Tom Zhou. He is described by The Age as, “an international fugitive, alleged crime boss and the subject of an Interpol red notice, according to multiple security officials with knowledge of the matter”. Further, Bill Birtles conveys in his ABC article that nineteen Crown workers, three Australians included, have pleaded guilty to gambling crimes. Further, other than Crown Sydney’s impact culturally and economically, it is essential to consider important concepts such as collective memory and palimpsest. Professor and author Karen Till in her book ‘The New Berlin: Memory, Politics and Place, highlights, “places of memory are created by individuals and social groups to give a shape to felt absences, fears, and desires that haunt contemporary society. Traditionally national places of memory were created and understood as glorifying the pasts of a people”. According to Bridie Jabour, “Rock engravings have been found in the area which date back 6,000 years and the wider area was occupied for at least 14,000 years before European colonisation”. Therefore, this place of memory glorifies the past of the Gardigal people. Moreover, Motti Neiger defines collective memory as “relations between the individual and the community to which she belongs and enables the community to bestow meaning upon its existence”. Barangaroo’s contemporary culture is acknowledged in the community through their artworks, educational tours and events. Therefore, continuing the relationships between Barangaroo and today’s community. Thus, showing and presenting meaning, and the existence of culture in today’s society. Further, another important concept to consider is palimpsest. According to Dr Connor “the term palimpsest expresses the idea that places have multiple pasts”. For example, layers of histories, cultural mapping and heritage sites. Barangaroo has various layers of histories, culture and heritage. However, now Barangaroo is forming a different layer, it will now be contemporary and dynamic. NSW Premier Gladys Berejiklian has recently stated that opening Crown in Barangaroo is “consistent with the governments vision for the future”. Su-Lin Tan conveys that with Australia’s growing population, more developments and opportunities are needed for Pyrmont in the future."
Medium.com,Society,China and U.S. - Optimism For A Trade Deal?,World,https://medium.com/goods-services/china-and-u-s-optimism-for-a-trade-deal-80f88d0a9650?source=topic_page---------391------------------1," U.S. President Donald Trump expressed optimism on Friday over high-level trade talks with China, which entered its second day of talks, while Beijing said it was open to a “partial” deal that would avoid planned tariff increases on Chinese imports next week, reports Reuters. Negotiators, including US Treasury Secretary Steven Manoucheng and Chinese Deputy Prime Minister Liu Hu, resumed talks in Washington Thursday, with Hu expected to meet Trump today at the White House at 9:45 pm Bulgarian time. “Good things happen at a trade meeting with China. Warmer feelings than in the recent past, more like those days. Today I will meet with the Deputy Prime Minister. Everyone would like to see something significant happen! “Trump wrote on Twitter earlier today. At the same time, Mnuchin told reporters that the talks were going well. A Chinese state-run newspaper said on Friday that a “partial” trade deal would benefit China and the U.S. and that Washington should accept the proposal, reflecting Beijing’s goal to cool the dispute before new tariff increases come into force. So far, both sides have imposed hundreds of billions of dollars in customs duties, and Trump has threatened to raise U.S. taxes from 25 percent to 30 percent imposed on Chinese goods by $ 250 billion. On Thursday, Liu Hu said China is ready to reach an agreement with the US on issues of interest to both sides to prevent further escalation of the trade war. Trump, who said Thursday that talks with the Chinese had not gone well, previously insisted he would not be satisfied with the partial deal. The negotiations also had a positive effect on the US stock indices Shares of the New York Stock Exchange were trading at a significant price increase on Friday, with the S&P 500 index up about 1.5%. The Chinese securities regulator disclosed earlier today a firm timetable for lifting foreign ownership restrictions in companies since January 1, 2020. Increasing external access to the sector is one of the major US demands. Beijing also said it would open up its financial sector further, subject to conditions and at its own pace. Chinese officials also suggest increasing annual purchases of US agricultural products, the Financial Times reported on Wednesday, citing unidentified sources. The U.S. Department of Agriculture confirmed on Thursday net sales of 142.17 thousand tonnes of American pork in China during the week ending October 3, the largest weekly sale for the largest pork market in the world. Economists hope the two sides reach an agreement on currencies as well, as Washington suspects Beijing of manipulating the yuan for impairment."
Medium.com,Society,Censorship comes to e-sports as Blizzard disqualifies Hong Kong supporter,World,https://medium.com/@katefustich/censorship-comes-to-e-sports-as-blizzard-disqualifies-hong-kong-supporter-30951818da6c?source=topic_page---------392------------------1," W
hile protests of historic proportions rage on in Hong Kong, I sit on my couch and play Overwatch. As tragic as this is to admit, I’ve played Overwatch nearly every day of my life for the last two years. It’s a supremely fun game, with compelling characters, immersive battle mechanics, and just enough infuriating setbacks to make you say “okay, I’ll play for ten more minutes and then I’m done — for real this time.” And while one might think it would take loss of limb to keep me from the game that motivated me to write fanfiction for the first time in ten years (whatever you do, do not search AO3 for “Moira”), earlier this week, Overwatch’s parent company, Blizzard, did just that. The controversy began at the Asia-Pacific Hearthstone Grandmasters tournament. Hong Kong native and Hearthstone pro Chung Ng Wai (otherwise known as “Blitzchung”) was stripped of his title and his winnings rescinded. His crime? Calling to “Liberate Hong Kong, revolution of our time,” during the tournament’s live broadcast. According to Blizzard Chung’s actions were in clear violation of tournament rules. I looked up the rule in question, expecting to find some sort of reference to “political speech.” Instead, the 2019 Hearthstone Grandmasters Official Competition Rules section 6.1 prohibits any action that “brings you into public disrepute, offends a portion or group of the public, or otherwise damages Blizzard image.” In expressing support for Hong Kong and its people, Chung was allegedly sullying the good name of Blizzard — by rejecting the Chinese government censorship that increasingly controls the video game industry. Blizzard’s actions against Chung may have spawned a larger online movement calling for gamers to “#BoycottBlizzard” (my Xbox controller is currently gathering dust as I write this), but the culture that led to the incident is certainly nothing new. PlayUnknown’s Battlegrounds (PUBG) is one of the most popular titles in existence today. Late last year, the game’s creators, South Korean company Bluehole, made it impossible for anyone to use the word “Taiwan” in the game’s text chat. Earlier this week, Riot Games seemingly censored use of the phrase “Hong Kong” during a live broadcast of a League of Legends international tournament. Though they attempted to clarify and say that interpretation is mistaken, the well-documented evidence is damning. Game manufacturers from around the world are continuing to cave to the pressure of Chinese government censorship requirements in order to cater to one of the biggest gaming markets in the world. This pressure is so severe and so consistent, it’s beginning to spill over into other forms of entertainment: after Houston Rockets General Manager Daryl Morey tweeted “Fight for freedom, stand with Hong Kong.” The now-deleted post resulted in the NBA losing 11 partnership deals with Chinese companies. Somehow, the fallacy persists that these types of professional competitions — be they sports or video games — are somehow “apolitical” and that participants are to remain perfectly neutral entities, vapid and existing for our amusement only. In the case of Colin Kapernick, who effectively blacklisted himself from the NFL after kneeling during the national anthem and speaking out on inequality in the United States, the backbone of the backlash against him was clearly racist to its core. It doesn’t require much imagination to see why a league comprised of millionaire team owners (95% of whom are white) would take issue with their players (68% of whom are Black) asserting their political consciousnesses. The logic justifying the censorship of support for Hong Kong in the world of e-sports isn’t much different, but the latest case with Blizzard and Chung points to just how much of a political platform e-sports has become, and how the West has remained largely ignorant of this fact. Blizzard’s attempt to silence Chung and others is another step taken on this dangerous path."

Medium.com,Society,US Tech Giants Are Small Fish In the Chinese Market,World,https://medium.com/pcmag-access/us-tech-giants-are-small-fish-in-the-chinese-market-aa3928708453?source=topic_page---------395------------------1," American tech companies such as Amazon, Facebook, and Google have small fractions of market share in China compared with state-backed Chinese e-commerce and social media giants. By Rob Marvin This week has been a stark reminder of the power the Chinese economy wields over American companies, from Apple and Google to the NBA. US corporations’ access to the Chinese market comes at a cost, as companies are forced time and again to cede control or forego free speech on issues such as the Hong Kong pro-democracy protests, in order to appease the Chinese government. Particularly concerning US tech companies, their bottom lines and profit margins need China a lot more than China needs them. According to data aggregated by Statista, American tech giants’ market share in China pales in comparison to state-backed Chinese firms. Google enjoys a more than 88 percent market share in the US, but in China, the search juggernaut sits at 3.2 percent, whereas Chinese tech conglomerate Baidu has a 76.7 percent market share. Doomed projects such as Dragonfly, Google’s attempt to build a censored search engine for China, stem from the desire to gain a stronger foothold in the biggest consumer tech market in the world. Facebook, which has been blocked on and off by the Chinese government for the past decade, also built a censorship tool for the Chinese government. While Facebook is still officially banned in China (though not in Hong Kong and Macau), Statista estimates it still has around 2.9 million Chinese users. But WeChat, China’s ubiquitous social-media messaging app, has over 1.1 billion users. Sometimes, US companies simply cut their losses. Uber finally gave up its costly battle with Chinese ride-hailing competitor Didi Chuxing in 2016 with a merger, and Amazon-which has a 0.5 percent market share in China compared with the dominance of Alibaba’s Tmall, AliExpress, and others-decided to shut down its Chinese marketplace earlier this year. It’s prohibitively difficult, expensive, and volatile for outside companies to compete with Chinese corporations on their own turf. Even for the few that do manage to carve out market share, is it worth the effort?"
Medium.com,Society,War Trumps Politics: Turkey’s Judicial Reform Package Becomes a Footnote Amid Offensive in Syria,World,https://medium.com/discourse/war-trumps-politics-turkeys-judicial-reform-package-becomes-a-footnote-amid-offensive-in-syria-4d11389e27d1?source=topic_page---------396------------------1," As the whole Turkey marches on a war footing, the political debate has entirely been consumed by the military operation in northern Syria, trumping all other topics of vital importance. One important victim of this state of war is a long-anticipated judicial reform whose trimmed version is now getting a hearing in Turkey’s Parliament. But all attention is elsewhere, in northern Syria, where the Turkish troops make steady advances against SDF in a quest to crush the Kurdish militia’s sway across the southern side of the Turkish-Syrian border. As war trumpets fill the air, all other voices of reason and common sense lose their traction and compass. While the all-consuming aspect of the war keeps attention away from the debates in the legislative body, some opposition lawmakers tried their best to make a compelling case for restoring rights for people who lost their jobs during the emergency rule. Omer Faruk Gergerlioglu, a lawmaker from pro-Kurdish People’s Democracy Party (HDP), offered a long list of rights abuses committed by the government against its own citizens since the first declaration of the state of emergency in 2016. Futile though the attempt may seem, he nevertheless sought to channel the gravity of attention to the legislative bill to redress KHK people’s dismal state. In his capacity, he projected the focus to the heart of the matter — to cancel all decrees and to restore dismissed workers back to their positions. For months, Turkey anticipated a judicial reform to address the deficiencies and shortcomings in the legal system as well as the demands of purge victims. This is all the more important given that there is little prospect for a satisfying legal remedy in the domestic realm in the aftermath of a coup attempt in 2016, a watershed moment that eventually upended Turkey’s century-old governing system with its era-defining repercussions. No less than 150,000 public workers were dismissed on dubious grounds. The subsequent emergency rule that completed the government’s handling of the post-coup chaos created more problems than it ever really solved. It is the emergency rule practices — decrees — that constitute the bulk of the rights violations and systemic abuses on the legal front. It is this aspect that formed the starting point for the latest judicial reform, if it ever could be called one, to correct misdeeds of the post-coup era. To be honest, expectations were already modest given the signs of the narrowness of the package, to say nothing of the emerging political tug of war between diverse factions within the ruling Justice and Development Party (AKP). Proponents and discontents of the reform bill jostled over its content. For months, arguments oscillated back and forth between the idea of full amnesty to all KHK people (a term used to describe sacked public workers) and partial restoration of rights. The semantic connotations of a general amnesty were never without controversy for purge victims and for those who were imprisoned en masse in the post-coup crackdown. On discursive level, the amnesty, not incoherently, implies the pardoning of crimes perpetrated by the convicted people. Here a lingering dispute of great importance lies. Needless to say, the whole line of defense for many purge victims is anchored on the unflinching claim of their innocence. Any admission of amnesty for the sake of short sentences or early release from prison also risks an indirect acknowledgment of the government’s charges of criminal wrongdoing. This poses a moral dilemma for many people as they are torn between the prospect of a longer sentence, however unjust it may be, and the possibility of some relief even if it comes at the expense of their whole argument. Mindful of this sinister double-play by the authorities, some purge victims categorically reject the term of amnesty and say they do not need to be forgiven, because they already did not commit any crime and they were only in prison because of political persecution by the government. But if this kind of thinking exists, (so far as we extrapolate from debates on social media, it does), it is certainly not the dominant approach. This is all the more so as the majority of the victims prefer betterment in their lives rather than being locked in an everlasting debate in the wording of the new reform package. “We don’t expect an amnesty to KHK people. Let’s see whether we would forgive them [the government] for constitutional violations, for repression, for lawlessness and the genocide,” Gergerlioglu spoke with conviction, in allusion to the ongoing debate among the KHK community. His stance was crystal clear, reflecting the first approach. The KHK people, he contended, are not criminals in search of government’s magnanimous pardoning for their alleged crimes. It is who condemned the innocent people of different political persuasion to abject poverty and social isolation are the criminal ones, according to him. Parliament and presidential palace have already been preoccupied with the ongoing military incursion to Syria amid a torrent of international criticism condemning Turkey’s targeting of Syrian Kurds. The swelling nationalism is on vivid display as speaking against the operation has soon become unanimous with treason, risking immediate prosecutorial action. Gergerlioglu, for his part, described the government’s efforts to muzzle any critical voice as practices of a police state. The HDP, the pro-Kurdish party which is home to liberal and leftist figures, was the only party voted against a motion in Parliament where the majority of lawmakers provided a legal framework to enable the government to send Turkish troops to a foreign country. But while the entire country locked in on their TV screens to stay tune with the latest military endeavor in northeastern Syria, there is another, and certainly no less significant, development that takes place in Turkey. After months of haggling, the judicial reform package finally hit the floor of Parliament for a broader discussion in the General Assembly. It was first accepted in the parliamentary judicial committee last week. In this shape, however, the bill is far from convincing. The government has so far shown no appetite for endorsing any comprehensive legislative plan for purge victims, unless it is of its own devising. Yet, when it comes forward to present a draft bill to address the issue, it looks anything but a reform package. To give just one example, it is suffice to say that even if a citizen has no criminal record and gets a complete ok from a court, his/her chance of getting a passport still becomes dependent on the whims and will of the Interior Ministry, which, with this new bill, acquires the final say over allowing someone to visit abroad. If you are a good citizen and you have no court decision against you, it is still not enough for your travel freedom. The executive branch usurps the authority of the judicial branch to decide in favor of or against a citizen regarding the matter of overseas travel. For brevity’s sake, an exhaustive review of the entire package (see Amnesty International’s sober analysis) is eschewed here. But to emphasize the gist of the argument, it is imperative to say that this new reform package is neither new nor reformist. Its spirit and outlook is nothing more than a window dressing, devoid of substance and corrective justice."
Medium.com,Society,"China’s Money Is Valued More Than Human Rights, and That’s a Problem",World,https://medium.com/@timeandmoney/chinas-money-is-valued-more-than-human-rights-and-that-s-a-problem-d9305577b029?source=topic_page---------397------------------1," Multiple spineless American corporations recently caved in to Chinese demands regarding the Hong Kong protests. The NBA, whether it wants to admit it or not, reprimanded one of their GMs for supporting the Honk Kong protests. Blizzard, the video game developer responsible for World of Warcraft, Overwatch, and Hearthstone, suspended a professional Hearthstone player for speaking out in support of the protests. Apple, after this article was written, banned an app used by protestors in Hong Kong to track police and locate safe zones. Apple said in a statement that the app violated their own guidelines. Apparently it’s okay for Americans to use the navigation and police tracking app Waze to avoid speeding tickets, but it isn’t okay for Hong Kong protestors to use an app designed to keep them away from police brutality. I’m sure this has nothing to do with the billions of dollars Apple has on the line in the rapidly expanding Chinese smartphone market. ESPN wanted in on the action as well, and issued a memo to employees forbidding any discussion about the Hong Kong protests. This might seem reasonable on the surface since they are a sports network, but the president of ESPN had this to say about sports and politics last year: There is the intersection between sports and politics. When Tiger is talking about the president, when the anthem story, every time that there is an intersection, ESPN is the place of record. Of course, when you tune into ESPN, we should be, we need to be covering those stories, if there is a connection to sports. - ESPN president Jimmy Pitaro Protests in Hong Kong have clearly intersected with the NBA, but it seems like ESPN’s own Chinese connections are getting in the way of coverage. China has a long history of oppression, and the communist country has come under even more scrutiny recently. Groups of Muslims in China are being placed in “re-education camps,” where they are going to learn Chinese and vocational skills, say Chinese officials. In reality, they’re being raped, brainwashed, and having their organs harvested. In addition to persecuting citizens for their religious beliefs, China is accused of discrimination against minorities, excessive use of the death penalty, torture, government censorship, and mistreating those with disabilities. This is not a complete list of all of China’s human rights violations, but merely a taste of what goes on in China. Protests in Hong Kong were initially sparked by a bill that would have allowed extradition of criminal suspects to China. The extradition bill has been scrapped (for now, at least), but protestors are still fighting for an investigation into police brutality, amnesty for protestors, the right to elect leaders, and for the government to stop referring to the protests as riots. When the Houston Rockets GM recently tweeted support for the Hong Kong protests, he accidentally revealed a side of American corporations we don’t usually get to see. The NBA went into damage control mode immediately after the tweet was sent, and the tweet has since been deleted. As it turns out, the progressive sports league that encourages athletes to speak out about racial issues suddenly isn’t so progressive any more. The NBA stood with Lebron when he criticized President Trump, and even moved the All-Star Game out of North Carolina due to the polarizing bathroom bill. So why are they afraid to take a much less controversial stance for human rights in China? Apple, like the NBA, is perceived as a “progressive” corporation. Apple is a big supporter of LGBT rights, and has taken stances on the environment, immigration rights, and diversity. When protestors in Hong Kong (many of whom are Apple customers) are getting brutalized by police while fighting for democracy, though, Apple is afraid to take a stand. I don’t mean to stereotype, but conservative Americans generally prefer football or baseball over basketball, and most basketball fans are pretty liberal. The NBA standing up for liberal values isn’t brave, it’s on-brand. They knew they weren’t going to lose any viewers or alienate their fanbase. Standing up for human rights in China could cost them a lot of money, though; basketball is huge in China, and they aren’t huge fans of freedom or democracy. Supporting basic human rights sounds really good in theory, but that tantalizing Chinese market is just dangling out there with their growing middle class and love for basketball. Like the NBA, Apple isn’t being brave by standing up for LGBT rights or the environment. They are doing what’s best for the balance sheet. Too often we applaud corporations for making business decisions that just so happen to be morally correct; the NBA, Apple, or any other corporation doesn’t care about human rights in China unless it affects their bottom line. And as it just so happens, standing up for human rights in China will affect their bottom line, and corporations have taken a strong stance: they are against human rights. Prominent Democrats and Republicans, such as Ted Cruz and Beto O’Rourke, are uniting against a common enemy: the NBA (and China). Our beloved American corporations may have all sold their souls to China, but at least we can take solace in the fact that politicians from across the aisle are coming together. I would like to think our politicians are standing up to China because of the egregious human rights violations, but in reality they’re probably just jealous of all the money the NBA is getting from China. Expect China-bashing to continue for now, perhaps until China can figure out how to manipulate our elections and buy more of our politicians. Decades ago, before we were all connected by the world wide web, issues like this wouldn’t exist. News travels from one side of the globe to the other in seconds. More than ever before, we have a global economy. American corporations want to expand to every country they can, and make as much money as they possibly can, because why wouldn’t they? Before the rise of globalization, American corporations stood for American values. For better or worse, the soul of America has been intertwined with American corporations, and vice versa. Companies knew in order to make money, they needed values that reflected the average American. As the country has changed and grown, so have our corporations. Many companies now have diversity and inclusion initiatives, and they aren’t afraid to stand up for racial justice or LGBT issues. As corporations expand to China, they’re picking up some of their values, too. The NBA doesn’t really care how oppressed the people are as long as they watch basketball games. Apple doesn’t care how many innocent people are murdered and have their organs harvested by the government as long as there are plenty of people left to buy iPhones. Corporations are fitting in very well in China; they’re already censoring speech and looking the other way. We as Americans get to watch it all unfold. We get to watch Nike pretend to care about racial issues, and Apple act like they care about the environment. Then we watch them put on a mask (or take off the mask), and tell China they don’t believe in human rights or freedom of speech, and that harvesting organs isn’t really that big of a deal. In fact, Apple has been lacking innovation for several years now; breaking into the organ harvesting industry could be just what they need. Corporations may only care about money, but there is something everyone can do about it. All of us have some amount of money (presumably). If we only give that money to companies who care about human rights, we can shape their behavior and actions. The United States is still the richest country in the world, so we have a lot of power. We can show corporations that they can’t have their cake and eat it too; they need to either choose freedom of speech and human rights, or government censorship, oppression, and torture."
Medium.com,Society,"Mutual deterrence: Good for the Middle East, bad for the nuclear weapons industry?",World,https://medium.com/@hcobban/mutual-deterrence-good-for-the-middle-east-bad-for-the-nuclear-weapons-industry-ef176b59f3?source=topic_page---------398------------------1," Over the past three-plus months it has become increasingly clear that, despite the bombast that Pres. Donald Trump has hurled against the Islamic Republic of Iran (along with a full deck of extremely harmful sanctions and some cyber attacks), neither he nor his closest regional allies in the anti-Iran coalition have been willing to escalate to any military attack against Iran that could escalate to all-out war. Might the Middle East now be seeing the emergence of a situation of mutual deterrence that could bring it some much-needed stability — and that could also put the long-vaunted “value” of nuclear weapons into deep question? Let’s do a quick recap. On June 20, Iranian forces shot down a large U.S. Reaper Hawk drone that had almost certainly ventured into Iranian airspace. The military reaction from the United States, Saudi Arabia, Israel, and the United Arab Emirates? As I noted here a few weeks later: goose egg. Then on September 14, either Iranian allies or Iran itself launched a large-scale, stunningly intricate attack against Saudi Arabia’s oil complex at Abqaiq. More goose egg. Along the way, in late August, Israel killed two fighters affiliated with Iran’s Lebanese ally, Hizbullah, in Syria and sent explosive drones against two Hizbullah-related targets inside Lebanon. The Hizbullah chief warned publicly that the organization would retaliate against Israel. Israel’s response? Its military leaders organized a very public withdrawal of their forces from a strip along the country’s northern border with Lebanon. Then, after Hizbullah indeed launched a quick missile strike against an Israeli military vehicle fleeing deeper into Israel, the Israelis’ only response was to shoot a few pieces of ordnance, seemingly at random, into uninhabited parts of southern Lebanon. In an analysis of the incident and its background that I published September 5, I noted that, “the situation of reciprocal (if highly asymmetrical) deterrence that has existed between Israel and Hizbullah since … 2006 remains in place.” Now, in the aftermath of the Abqaiq attacks, it is clearer than ever that a situation of mutual (if asymmetrical) deterrence exists not just between Israel and Hizbullah over the Lebanon-Israel border, but also more broadly in the region between Israel and Hizbullah’s backers in Iran. In Israel, nuclear scientist Uzi Even recently assessed the capabilities the Iranians or their allies revealed during the Abqaiq attack: The Iranian technology is reliable and advanced, and the Iranians are capable of producing and operating simultaneously a large number of drones and cruise missiles. He argued that, Either the Saudi defense system failed or communication between the Iranian missiles was hidden and hard to discover. Either way, the attack was successful and effective… The Iranians, or their proxies, showed that they can hit specific targets with great precision and from a distance of hundreds of kilometers. We have to accept the fact that we are now vulnerable to such a strike. Yes, we can also carry out such strikes and perhaps inflict great damage on them, but so what? Does rational deterrence always work in the Middle East? He also argued that, above all… operation of [Israel’s] Dimona nuclear reactor should be halted. It has now been shown to be vulnerable, and the harm it could cause would likely exceed its benefits. For the staunchly pro-war and pro-Israel New York Times columnist Thomas Friedman, the main takeaway from Even’s analysis was that: Israel has been signaling two things to Hezbollah and Iran. One is that in response to any missile attacks, Israel will carpet bomb neighborhoods in Lebanon where Hezbollah’s families live and where it manufactures the missiles, and turn them into rubble, as it did on a small scale in 2006. And it will make the Lebanese economy collateral damage. And the other is that Israel will attack Tehran directly, either with precision long-range missiles from Israel or submarine-launched missiles from the Persian Gulf, with this message: “Every time Tel Aviv is hit by your proxies, we will hit Tehran. You will not sit out this war. And you will not out-crazy us.” Notably, neither of these “signals” seemed to be ones that Friedman disagreed with, or had any problem with. But his analysis of the crucial war that Hizbullah and Israel fought in 2006 also seemed badly askew: the bombing that Israel carried out that year of the “neighborhoods in Lebanon where Hizbullah’s families live” — and indeed, of numerous key elements of the country’s vital national infrastructure — was extremely far from “small-scale.” It was truly monumental. Yet Hizbullah not only survived it, it survived it with its standing in Lebanon’s political system significantly enhanced and with the Israeli ground units that had attempted a broad invasion of the country racing back as fast as they could to Israel with their tails between their legs. Hizbullah’s performance in 2006 reaffirmed to all objective observers that a situation of reciprocal (if asymmetrical) deterrence existed between it and Israel — and it achieved that by having only relatively “dumb” weapons at its command. Friedman was right to warn that with the much smarter surveillance and guidance systems now presumably at its command, Hizbullah’s ability to project targeted threats against vital Israeli infrastructure is almost certainly much, much higher. Friedman’s conclusion was that the demonstrations that Iran and its allies (whether in Lebanon, Yemen, or elsewhere) have given in the past few months of the high level of their targeting and command-and-control capabilities have made the Middle East a considerably more dangerous place: [T]he Middle East may look calm right now, but that’s an illusion. Everyone is recalculating: The Iranians are emboldened, the Arabs are frightened and Israel and Iran are one miscalculation away from a war of precision missiles that neither can afford. I question this conclusion, which seems unthinkingly Israelocentric. After all, for 40 years of the US-Soviet Cold War, the situation of reciprocal deterrence and “Mutually Assured Destruction” (MAD) between the world’s two largest, nuclear-armed superpowers gave a measure of strategic calm to a world still reeling from the two globe-girdling wars of the first half of the 20th century. (True, there were lots of nations in the Global South that suffered in that era.) But why would we think that in the Middle East of the second quintile of the 21st century, a situation of Mutual Intraregional Deterrence (MID) would be any more destabilizing than the Cold War’s MAD was at the global level? Indeed, the actual situation of being deterred that Israel, Saudi Arabia, the United States, and the UAE have all evinced in recent months — at the hands of the non-nuclear-weapons state Iran and its allies in the region — is the most intriguing aspect of the current situation. Bearing in mind that two of those powers, Israel and the United States are both well-endowed nuclear powers, what does this tell us about the utility of nuclear weapons in today’s world? A subject for another day…"
Medium.com,Society,Notes from an Election: Gotabaya and Gota-Baya,World,https://medium.com/@udithadevapriya/notes-from-an-election-gotabaya-and-gota-baya-e81891ef8df0?source=topic_page---------399------------------1," “When a future historian writes the political history of the most obtuse and inept government in post-independence Sri Lanka, he or she will doubtless identify the zenith of idiocy having been the Constitutional prevention of Mahinda Rajapaksa running for President in 2019, thereby opening the door for the fulfilment of the worst fear of the neoliberal democrats, namely a Gotabhaya candidacy pointing to a Gotabaya presidency.” The problem with Gotabaya Rajapaksa is that he is not Mahinda Rajapaksa. That, at any rate, is what I gather from Dr Dayan Jayatilleka’s critique of him. To say the one is not the other is to say nothing at all. But the devil is in the detail, and I think we ought to give Dr Dayan the benefit of the doubt. In any case, it’s futile now to deny the debate, because the cat’s out of the bag: one of our foremost intellectuals, and probably our foremost political commentator, philosopher, and theorist, has placed before us an interesting critique of one of the two frontrunners. To support the critique, much use has been made of certain dichotomies, all of which cover one of the two (not the one being excoriated, obviously) with glory. There’s little, in fact nothing at all, inconsistent in Dr Dayan’s pieces. The oppositional space after 2015, cut off from the presence it ought to have been allowed in parliament, had two options to take. One was the path favoured by stalwarts like Vasudeva Nanayakkara, Dinesh Gunawardena, Kumar Welgama, and Wimal Weerawansa, centred on Mahinda Rajapaksa’s charisma and charm. The Nugegoda rally, at which Dr Dayan delivered Mahinda’s speech, was the first step. If there was no Gotabaya addressing the crowd, it’s because he was the personality those who preferred the second option wanted. That second option congealed into its own front, its own conclave of technocrats, professionals, and capitalists. Viyath Maga and Eliya, which took off in 2017, not only sealed in Gotabaya, but also sealed out and pre-empted the first option. Only once before, as Dr Dayan observes, was the SLFP able to win over the bourgeoisie from the UNP, and that was when Chandrika was on (and up) her way to the presidency. I’ll get to the relevance of that comparison in a later essay, but the point is that it happened before and it has happened again: “the heavy hitters,” he observed about the 2018 Viyath Maga Seminar, “weren’t lurking on the flanks, hedging their bets.” To be sure, they were not: Colombo’s powerful, invisible capitalist class was there, at Shangri-La, listening to Gotabaya, to Nalaka Godahewa, and planning on their next move: they had given up on Ranil Wickremesinghe and the UNP. And here’s the clincher: they had defected to Mahinda and Gotabaya, but they wouldn’t have made that leap without Gotabaya. Project Gotabaya, in that respect, has all the vices of technocratic authoritarianism without the compensating virtues. It’s neo-liberalism plus neo-fascism and minus soft populism. Or so Dr Dayan implies. It’s no secret that sections of the Podujana Peramuna which favoured the first option did not favour Project Gotabaya as much as the Viyath Maga and Eliya crew did. There is a problem there: the first option was and is largely favoured by those seen as spent, old, and ageing politicians. If that sounds like an insult, rest assured that though it probably is, I’m not the one hurling it. 2015 displaced the establishment in favour of a fringe opposition, but it did so while displacing the establishment WITHIN that fringe opposition. Those who take to the JO thus look beyond the “moderates” into the eyes of Gorgon, and though they haven’t been turned into stone, they continue to be seduced by the gospel of authoritarianism the Viyath Maga Eliya set put out. The “moderates” have not been displaced as much as they’ve been replaced: both Welgama’s obstinacy and Vasudeva’s hesitancy indicate it. No doubt personal grievances have a say there, but these have been subsumed by the bigger picture. Thus ends Dr Dayan’s classification of these two ideological strands and denunciation of the more authoritarian of them. Before I lay down my critique of the critique, I should observe at the outset that the prospect of Gotabaya Rajapaksa’s presidency neither interests nor daunts me. Indeed, as of now, it’s hard to say that he’s the frontrunner (i.e. that he’s ahead of Sajith), though this shouldn’t worry anyone. In any case, of all candidates he’s hands down the most authoritarian. If Sajith can equal the record of his father (more on that a little later), he has the potential to be as authoritarian, but we have not seen Sajith’s authoritarianism (even if it is there, in his arrogant displays to the media — bewildering, given how certain media outlets are explicitly propping him up — and in his very odd third person self-referencing) while we have seen, only too clearly, Gotabaya’s. But that’s another story. I do not think Dr Dayan is being inconsistent, because he’s been making the same point about Gotabaya for as long as I can remember, certainly from the time of Mahinda’s presidency. In Long War Cold Peace he calls Gotabaya the “Security Tsar”, identifying him with a security complex that began with Oliver Goonetilake and continued with J. R. Jayewardene, Felix Bandaranaike, Lalith Athulathmudali, Ranjan Wijeratne, and Anuruddha Ratwatte. There was a time when he praised the man (“Gota has demonstrated his developmental vision and capacities beyond any reasonable doubt”), but that was before his foray into the Viyath Maga and Eliya. And yet, this, the strongest defence of his critique that I can mount — that it’s not inconsistent — also happens to be the weakest point in it. Ideological consistency salvages his argument, but it does not validate it. There are two reasons why it does not. The first. With or without Viyath Maga Eliya (VME), Gotabaya is Gotabaya. Dr Dayan sees a break, or a breach, between the two: he presents to us a pre- and post-VME Gotabaya. It is tempting to cave into this dichotomy, but such demarcations don’t work out in reality, and are certainly not convincing. Dr Dayan’s assessment of Gotabaya “precedes” VME; if that pre-VME assessment of the man is anything to go by, there is not a breach but rather a line of continuity, ideological or otherwise, between the one and the other. If he was a security tsar at the time of his brother’s presidency, and if he was neo-fascist and a centre of gravity for Colombo’s tycoons, he remains so with or without VME. Ergo: VME has captured Gotabaya just as much as Gotabaya has captured VME. This chicken-egg dilemma cuts into the analysis, because VME doesn’t represent a break from Gotabaya. The one didn’t come before or after the other; the one IS the other. The second. One can’t account for his blunt assessment of Gotabaya and VME without taking Sajith Premadasa into consideration. Sajith is Sajith, with or without his opponent or that opponent’s ideological outfit, but he represents the perfect counterpoint, for Dr Dayan at least, through whom we can square Gotabaya with the kind of militaristic, authoritarian, and neo-fascist oppositional space he peals warning bells about. But if neo-fascism is what peals the bell, Sajith isn’t the person to toll it. I say that for two reasons: one, he represents the extreme populist faction of the UNP, led by people no less savoury or unsavoury than the Reid Avenue Regency it opposes; two, he promises to take us back to his father’s era, which, for all the rosy nostalgia it evokes today, was as bloody as it was rosy. It’s interesting that Dr Dayan, in Long War Cold Peace, can, with the same sharp, analytic rigour with which he dissects the industrial-military complex in Gotabaya’s conception of the State, brush aside atrocities committed by the government headed by the father of the man he champions, by reducing an entire decade’s worth of bombings and bodies burning in tyres and floating on rivers to “the eight years from the July 1980 general strike and the smashing of the trade union movement through the sacking of 60,000 workers, up to the first round of provincial council elections and the decompression of 1988.” What happened after those eight years, we are not told, nor are we made to feel we should be; by this I am not grilling Dr Dayan, of course. I can write more, and I should, but I won’t. Let me instead sum up everything in one go, then. Gotabaya is Gotabaya with or without VME. Sajith is Sajith with or without Gotabaya and VME. Dr Dayan, in distinguishing the one from the other, has overlooked this fact. Despite overlooking it, he makes his views consistent, even a little sound. But not too sound. And as for relative merits between Sajith and Gota, well, let me quote Sarath de Alwis: “All of king’s horses and all of king’s men will not make me cast my second preference for his [Mangala’s] candidate.” For in politics, as in love, relative merits are never an absolute must.

Medium.com,Society,NBA Forced to Choose Between Its Values And Its Chinese Business Interests,World,https://medium.com/citizen-truth/nba-forced-to-choose-between-its-values-and-its-chinese-business-interests-776bf7f1f127?source=topic_page---------401------------------1," The NBA is facing criticism for apologizing to China for a tweet made by Houston Rockets’ general manager Daryl Morey that expressed support for the ongoing pro-democracy Hong Kong protests against the authoritarian Chinese government. In response to Morey’s tweet, a reposted image that read “Fight for Freedom. Stand for Hong Kong,” the Chinese government, the Chinese Basketball Association (CBA) and several Chinese businesses immediately cut ties with the Rockets. The issue is testing the NBA’s reputation as the most progressive major American sports league against its massive commercial interests in China, perhaps the NBA’s biggest market for international growth. Almost 500 million people in China watched the NBA on Chinese company Tencent Holdings last year, which Axios compares to their “League Pass.” The media company, which has a “a five-year streaming deal worth $1.5 billion,” with the NBA, “said they wouldn’t be airing Rockets games” anymore, as per NPR. Critics quickly pointed out differences in the NBA’s official English and Mandarin statements on the controversy. A statement by NBA spokesperson Mike Bass said the league was aware Morey’s comments “have deeply offended many of our friends and fans in China, which is regrettable.” Standard PhD candidate Yiqin Fu said the Mandarin translation has a more apologetic tone, with the NBA writing that they are “extremely disappointed in Morey’s inappropriate statement. No doubt he’s severely hurt the feelings of CN fans.” Morey also quickly deleted his post and apologized on Sunday, tweeting that he was “merely voicing one thought, based on one interpretation, of one complicated event.” The NBA’s attempts to placate China while simultaneously defending its commitment to free speech is a strategy that “is working quite miserably,” wrote the Atlantic’s Jemele Hill. On Wednesday NBA commissioner Adam Silver took a stronger stance, saying, “The long-held values of the NBA are to support freedom of expression. … And in this case, Daryl Morey, as general manager of the Houston Rockets, enjoys that right as one of our employees.” Silver also discussed Yao Ming, a former Houston Rockets player and Hall of Famer who is a major figure in his home country and the head of the government-directed Chinese Basketball Association, which suspended its relationship with the Rockets after Morey’s tweet. Ming’s role as a Chinese superstar in the league contributed to basketball’s huge popularity in China. “Our office has communicated directly with Yao Ming and he is extremely upset,” said Silver. “I’m not sure he quite accepts how we are operating our business right now. And again, I accept that we have a difference of opinion. … He is extremely hot at the moment and I understand it.” Critics argue the NBA’s mostly tepid response is characteristic of corporate America’s attitude towards China’s humanitarian abuses. While the NBA served as a counterexample to the NFL in widely supporting Colin Kaepernick’s protests against police brutality, it has capitulated on Chinese oppression, just as many other US corporations speak of social issues at home but refuse to comment on the Uighur concentration camps or Hong Kong protests. “When it has to do with market access in China and profits … they will bend over backwards to apologize,” Bonnie Glaser, an expert on China at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, told Axios’ Erica Pandey. “It’s an authoritarian government, and the Communist Party is in control,” Glaser told Axios. “They are able to have impact on what their citizens do, and they can mobilize their citizens to hold boycotts if they want do that.” As Pandey notes, this isn’t the first time China has told an American company what to do. Marriott, for example, capitulated to China after the communist party blocked its website for listing Hong Kong, Taiwan, Tibet and Macau as separate countries. “We don’t support separatist groups that subvert the sovereignty and territorial integrity of China,” the hotel company said in an apology. The Gap, major airlines like American, United and Delta, and major Hollywood productions have also submitted to Chinese demands on its “territorial integrity.” Read the original article and sign up for our newsletter at https://citizentruth.org"
Medium.com,Society,Turkish Military Attack in Syria Sparks Widespread Condemnation,World,https://medium.com/citizen-truth/turkish-military-attack-in-syria-sparks-widespread-condemnation-4f1919b911d3?source=topic_page---------402------------------1," News that the Turkish army, using aircraft and artillery, launched a massive military operation into northeastern Syria on Wednesday sparked stern responses and widespread alarm around the globe. French European Affairs Minister Amélie de Montchalin said that members of the European Union, including France, Germany and Britain, strongly condemned the Turkish operation on Syrian territories. “The three countries are finalizing a joint statement that would clearly state our strong condemnation of the Turkish operation,” Montchalin told the Foreign Affairs Committee. Additionally, the Netherlands was reported to have summoned the Turkish ambassador over Turkey’s military incursion into the Arab neighboring country. Meanwhile, the President of the European Commission, Jean-Claude Juncker, urged Turkey to “cease its military operation.” However, a separate joint statement from all of the European Union’s 28 member states has yet to be issued because of a lack of agreement on the statement. Reuters reported that Hungary blocked the statement. On Thursday, upon a request submitted by European member states of the United Nations Security Council (UNSC), including France, Britain, Germany and Poland, the UNSC will hold a closed-door meeting to discuss Turkey’s assault in northeastern Syria. As Turkish threats against Kurdish forces in northeastern Syria culminated in Turkey’s offensive on Wednesday, numerous U.S. politicians including prominent Republicans condemned Trump’s decision to withdraw U.S. forces in northeast Syria. On a phone call with Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan over the weekend, US President Trump said US forces would effectively withdraw from northeastern Syria and not come to the aid of its Kurdish allies in the case of a Turkish offensive in the region. The move by Trump angered members of his own Republican Party and drew accusations that the US was abandoning its allies. Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.), House Minority leader Kevin McCarthy (R-Calif.) and GOP House Conference Chair Liz Cheney (R-Wyo.) all denounced the Turkish assault on the Kurds in northeastern Syria and the U.S. for abandoning its allies in the region. “Pray for our Kurdish allies who have been shamelessly abandoned by the Trump Administration. This move ensures the reemergence of ISIS. Will lead effort in Congress to make Erdogan pay a heavy price. I urge President Trump to change course while there is still time by going back to the safe zone concept that was working,” said Lindsey. Lindsey also vowed to lead Congressional action to make it clear to Erdogan that there is a heavy price for his recent military move. McCarthy, for his part, said the Turkish operation would aid a renewal of ISIS and enable both ISIS, al Qaida and Iran to gain a foothold across the region. The House Conference Chair Liz Cheney called the news from northeastern Syria “sickening” and wondered why the U.S. administration is leaving its Kurdish partners to be slaughtered and ISIS enabled to return to the region. In the Arab world, the Egyptian Foreign Ministry issued a statement on Wednesday condemning in the strongest terms what the ministry described as a “stark assault” on Syrian territorial sovereignty and integrity. The statement also called for an urgent meeting of the League of Arab States to discuss recent regional developments. The ministry’s communique called on the international community, as well, to live up with what the statement termed “responsibility towards regional and international peace and security.” Read the original article and sign up for our newsletter at https://citizentruth.org"
Medium.com,Society,Turkey Launches Attack Into Northeastern Syria,World,https://medium.com/citizen-truth/turkey-launches-attack-into-northeastern-syria-e78e4ee0c702?source=topic_page---------403------------------1," The Turkish army, using aircraft and artillery, launched a massive military operation into northeastern Syria on Wednesday afternoon. In recent weeks, Turkey has hinted at the necessity of the move in order to eliminate threats by armed Kurdish opposition elements in the region. Turkish President, Recep Tayyip Erdoğan, tweeted on Wednesday that a long-planned Turkish military offensive in northeast Syria has begun. “The Turkish Armed Forces, together with the Syrian National Army, just carried out #OperationPeaceSpring against PKK/YPG Daesh (ISIS) terrorists in northern Syria. Our mission is to prevent the creation of a terror corridor across our southern border, and to bring peace to the area,” Erdoğan tweeted. According to CNN, as the Turkish military campaign began, sounds of bombardments were heard loudly across northeastern Syria including in Derick, which is home to the Buzra dam. The dam provides hundreds of thousands of civilians with water. Syrian Democratic Forces’ (SDF) sources, reported by CNN, said that that other areas like Sikarkah, in eastern Qamishli, were struck by the bombardments, caused by airstrikes and artillery fire. The SDF is a military alliance in the Syrian War primarily led by the Kurdish militia commonly known as the People’s Protections Units or the YPG. The SDF sources suggested that at least two civilians were killed and two others were injured, in airstrikes that targeted Misharrafa village, west of the Ras al-Ain area, in northeastern Syria. They also noted that many thousands of civilians were seen fleeing their residential homes, as widespread panic ripped through the region. Meanwhile, the International Rescue Committee (IRC) and International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) have voiced deep concern for the lives of people in northeastern Syria, especially those who live in refugee camps and detention centers or in small villages and towns. Both organizations estimated the number of those at-risk people at 100,000, who live mainly in refugee camps in Hasakah, Raqqa and Deir Ezzor areas. ICRC’s director for the Near and Middle East, Fabrizio Carboni, was quoted as saying in Geneva that humanitarian help should be ensured for refugees. Over the weekend, during a phone conversation between US President Donald Trump and his Turkish counterpart, Recep Tayyip Erdoğan, Trump handed over the mantle of the battle against Islamic State fighters in northeastern Syria to Turkey. In recent years, the US has been allied with Kurdish forces in the region in a joint effort to fight Islamic State (ISIS) forces: Fahrettin Altun, Erdoğan’s communications director, revealed in a commentary he wrote for the Washington Post published on Tuesday that President Trump agreed to transfer the battle’s leadership to Turkey during the weekend phone call between Trump and Erdoğan. “The Turkish military, together with the Free Syrian Army, will cross the Turkish-Syrian territories”, he was quoted by the Guardian as commenting. In his commentary, he also described an imminent military action in northeastern Syria as a counter against terrorism, calling the Kurdish forces thugs “who should not resist the Turkish seizure of the region.” The Turkish official, however, questioned whether the Kurdish fighters, known as the YPG, will accept the campaign’s leadership change. Commenting on a tweet, he said “YPG militants have two options; they can either defect or will have to stop them from disrupting our counter-ISIS efforts.” In response to the Turkish government’s claims, Kurdish long-time leader and head of the Democratic Kurdish Party (YPG), Masoud Barzani, said in a tweet, addressing President Donald Trump: “Dear President Trump, please know that the people of Kurdistan have always pursued their just rights. The Peshmerga have defeated ISIS and are an effective part of the coalition against terror. The blood of the Kurds is far more valuable than money and weapons. Thank you” The weekend phone call between Trump and Erdogan suggests the US would not come to the aid of Kurdish fighters, in the case of Turkey waging a military campaign against ISIS in northeastern Syria. Late on Tuesday night, the US-backed SDF announced that Turkish forces had already attacked areas adjacent to the northeastern borders. A statement by the SDF read “there were no causalities among our forces and we did not react to such an unprovoked attack.” According to the UK-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, the attack occurred in the Sere Kaniye border area, an area from which US troops withdrew on Monday. The US Department of Defense, also known as the Pentagon, declared on Tuesday that redeployment of US’ forces in the area was a necessary step, in order to avert US troops any harm in a crossfire. Jonathan Hoffman, a key spokesman with the Pentagon, was quoted as saying, “We have moved the US forces in northern Syria out of the path of potential Turkish invasion to ensure the forces’ safety. We have made no changes to our forces’ presence in Syria , at the time.” In an article he co-wrote for the Defense One military news site, Joseph Votel, who headed the US’ Central Command until March of this year and played a major role in establishing the US’ partnership with the Kurds, Votel argued that Washington’s decision to apparently abandon the Kurds could not have come at a worse time. “This policy abandonment threatens to undo five years’ worth of fighting against Isis and will severely damage American credibility and reliability in any future fights where we need strong allies,” wrote Votel: In the meantime, the military commander of the American-backed militias in Syria, Mazlum Kobani, said in a statement that his forces would not hesitate to attack back at any Turkish troops and military operations in the north of the country. Speaking to the New York Times, Kobani was quoted as saying, “We have been at war for seven years, so we can continue the war for seven more years.” Over the past several years of Syria’s civil war, US troops have been backing and training the Syrian Democratic Forces to help eliminate the Islamic State’s terrorist fighters, known as ISIS. Turkey considers the SDF as part of a long-time Kurdish opposition movement that Turkey says threatens the sovereignty of the country. The SDF was able to retain control over parts of northern Syria, with the help of the US. A few months ago, Turkey and the US agreed on erecting a 20-mile buffer zone in northeastern Syria. Syria rejected the plan and regarded it as an attack on Syrian sovereignty. Turkey has absorbed millions of Syrian refugees as a result of the war. The New York Times also quoted Turkish President Erdogan as saying that the operation might happen before the news could be printed. Erdogan’s comment came as Turkish troops were reportedly moved to the Syrian border, apparently in preparation of the Turkish military operation. In reaction to news about a Turkish military action in northern Syria, the European Union issued a warning against attacking the Syrian territories. A verbal statement, reported by Reuters on Monday, voiced the EU’s concern especially given the US’ abrupt decision to withdraw its troops from the region. “The EU has from the very beginning said that any sustainable situation will not be reached by military means,” a spokeswoman told a news briefing. Syrian President Bashar al-Assad had previously already rejected any Turkish military presence or action in northeastern Syria. In June of this year, Syrian Foreign Minister Walid Muallem said that his country considers Turkey’s military presence in parts of northern Syria illegal. Muallem then demanded neighboring Turkey withdraw its troops from the Syrian territories, while asserting that Syria is not interested in a military showdown with Turkey. Since 2011, the Arab Republic of Syria, home to nearly 19 million residents, has endured a civil war sparked by mass protests demanding social and economic reforms. Since then, hundreds of thousands have been killed and injured, while millions more have been displaced. In recent years, Russia became a key ally for the Syrian government, intervening in the war and helping Syria defeat the armed opposition groups.

Medium.com,Society,Hundreds Arrested as Momentum Builds Around Latest Extinction Rebellion Protest,World,https://medium.com/citizen-truth/hundreds-arrested-as-momentum-builds-around-latest-extinction-rebellion-protest-e8ce9857a576?source=topic_page---------404------------------1," In 48 hours, the London metropolitan police arrested more than 500 protesters advocating for climate reform through protests and the occupation of central city landmarks. The Extinction Rebellion, abbreviated XR, congregated and centralized around Trafalgar Square by the end of Tuesday, the second day of protests which are planned to spam a two week period. The XR is a climate activist organization with non-violent, disruptive tactics. They’ve occupied spaces in London twice in the past year, with the last large-scale protests occurring in April. Through civil disobedience, the activists hope to bring attention to ecological threats posed by a changing climate. Simultaneous demonstrations are occurring in Sydney and Berlin, in addition to London, where protests were present in markets, streets, bridges and squares throughout the central city. Despite the volume of arrests, interactions between police and protesters have been calm. This was especially true in Trafalgar Square, where police are directing all activists to sleep in tents, rather than in the streets near Westminster and the Home Office. At 5 p.m. on Tuesday, the city police and Transit for London had created a traffic diversion that detoured all cars away from Trafalgar Square and the West End, terminating bus routes short of their destinations and frustrating many commuters. The remaining pedestrian and bike traffic could pass through traffic blocks created by parked cars, tents, and groups of people obstructing the roundabout at the center of the square. Activists and observers of a broad age range were in company of costumed street artists and buskers, and banners adorned the base of Nelson’s column encouraging urgency in response to ecological loss for climate reasons. Arrests made in at Trafalgar Square on Monday night happened without the use of force, according to one woman who’d been arrested after around six hours of occupation. Flo, who chose to withhold her surname while her case remains under investigation, said that the officers did not remove her from her position locked onto a trailer that blockaded the street. However, when she stood up to go, they took her into custody on charges of willful obstruction of the highways. She was released after several hours in the jail and returned on Tuesday afternoon to distribute pamphlets on the Extinction Rebellion cause to passersby. Some XR activists glued themselves to the Department for Transport building, and others, who occupied the popular Smithfield market, prevented sales from butcher stands and replaced the meat with produce. But many — like Flo — have simply sat down in the street and refused to move. Read the original article and sign up for our newsletter at https://citizentruth.org"
Medium.com,Society,"In Rebuke to Rise of Far-Right, Portugal’s Socialist Party Wins Big",World,https://medium.com/citizen-truth/in-rebuke-to-rise-of-far-right-portugals-socialist-party-wins-big-dfa25350c6f5?source=topic_page---------405------------------1," Portugal’s Socialist Party won the most votes in Sunday’s general election, granting prime minister António Costa another four years to lead a left-wing coalition after managing to balance economic growth, deficit reduction, and the reversal of austerity measures in his previous term despite doubts that his leftist government would overspend. “The Socialist Party has clearly won this election and strengthened its position. Stability is essential for Portugal’s international credibility and for attracting investors,” said Costa. “We will strive to find solutions that ensure this stability for the entire legislature.” The center-left Socialists won 106 seats in the 230 seat assembly, gaining from the 86 seats they held in the last parliament but falling short of an absolute majority. The center-right Social Democrats took only 77 seats, their worst result since 1983, still being broadly associated with austerity cutbacks and a recession that occurred when they were in power. Costa will seek to continue working with the far-left parties he formed an informal alliance with in his last term, where they worked together on raising the minimum wage and improving social services. “We showed that you can improve public finances and improve living conditions for the public at the same time,” João Galamba, Costa’s secretary of state for energy, told the Atlantic’s Vincent Bevins. “And we showed the Portuguese people that being in the European Union doesn’t only have to mean cuts.” In a time of nationalist and anti-immigrant ascendance in Europe, the far-right won only a single seat in Portugal’s election, providing hope to left-of-center factions across the continent after years of struggle amidst the refugee crisis and European debt crisis. “Portuguese society again chooses stability, equality and social justice,” said Pedro Sánchez, the Spanish prime minister. “With the victory of the Socialist party, they are betting on a project of the left, progressives and modernizers. Let’s continue working together for a fairer Europe.” Sánchez, whose Socialist party has failed to form a stable coalition akin to Portugal’s, has spoken of his desire to replicate Portugal’s model by forming an alliance with Spain’s leftist Podemos party. While Sánchez is facing an uncertain general election next month, the center-left has seen modest gains in Sweden, Denmark, and Finland in recent years, and Italy’s center-left Democrat party returned to power last month after a blunder by far-right populist leader Matteo Salvini. Political analysts attribute the success of Portugal’s left to its strong ties with working-class groups, which have shifted towards right-wing populism in other countries, as well as the memory of the right-wing dictatorship that lasted until 1974. Others note that Portugal has received a smaller amount of refugees than other European countries more vulnerable to right-wing populism. The Guardian’s Jon Henley notes that polls showed the Portuguese Socialists could have won a majority, but their support was hurt by multiples scandals including “the former Socialist defence minister, José Azeredo Lopes, being charged with abuse of power and denial of justice over his role in the alleged cover-up of a 2017 arms theft.” Voter turn out was a record low with a 45.5% abstention rate. Still, Costa and his government’s finance minister have been praised domestically and in Brussels for providing a successful alternative to the austerity-focused approach that defined the European Union’s response to the continent’s debt problems. “European unity is more needed now than ever,” European Council President Donald Tusk said in a congratulation to Costa, “and I trust that your government will continue playing a constructive role in the most relevant themes such as the climate emergency, trade conflicts, our multi-year budget, migration, the completion of the Economic and Monetary Union as well as Brexit.” Read the original article and sign up for our newsletter at https://citizentruth.org"
Medium.com,Society,The Geopolitics of Cyberspace in the G7 Summit,World,https://medium.com/@cyberpeacealliance/the-geopolitics-of-cyberspace-in-the-g7-summit-cd81feb2605d?source=topic_page---------406------------------1," The Group of Seven (G7) meeting in Paris highlighted some remarkable developments on geopolitics and economics of cyberspace. Usually, the group meets annually on summit sites to discuss economic policies. But this year, the meeting highlighted discussion on cybersecurity concerns. It was done considering the economic impact that cybersecurity has on the global political
economy and financial sector. The meeting also resulted in some strategic decisions on cybersecurity coordination and cooperation to protect the cyberspace. A strategy was formulated to preserve the political and financial systems from cyber attack. There were particular concerns about the role of China and Russia in the cyberspace and reaffirmation to uphold the liberal and democratic values of G7 in cyberspace. “So one of the discussions is what we need to do as an effective deterrent strategy to make the price of trying to interfere with our democratic processes too high. At the moment, we do not have that deterrent strategy.” — Mr. Jeremy Hunt, UK foreign secretary at the G7 meeting Polarisation of Cyberspace
To bring into perspective, the G7 countries namely, the US, Japan, Germany, France, UK, Italy, and Canada, reaffirmed their fundamental role to facilitate the free flow of information for promoting the global economy and development in cyberspace. Also, the importance of respecting and promoting privacy, data protection, and a commitment to a multi-stakeholder approach adhered. Besides this, there was a proposal for a framework for sanctions and public exposure of offenders of cyberattack, as a probable solution to the state-sponsored cyberattack. This meeting marked a visual of polarisation of state behavior in cyberspace. The G7 was looking to ally imposition of penalties, sanctions, and restrictions for a state-driven cyberattack. A reference to the NotPetya intrusion, allegedly a Russian sponsored attack, was made by the United States. It is essential to highlight that after 1997, the G7 became G8 for nearly two decades with the inclusion of Russia, but the country was ejected from the group after it invaded and annexed Crimea from Ukraine in 2014. Ever since then, the geopolitics at the summit has depicted an anti-Russia sentiment. Also, Japan had expressed concerns about Chinese activities in cyberspace to influence
elections, trade-war, and to promote Beijing geographical claim. Cyber-securing the Financial Markets “The security of the industry as a whole is a shared responsibility, and we are providing the right tools and processes to enable protection. As an industry cooperative, we are committed to playing an essential role in reinforcing and safeguarding the security of the broader ecosystem. “ ~Gottfried Leibbrandt, SWIFT CEO There was a plenary discussion on “Cybersecurity: Coordinating Effort to Protect the Financial Sector in the Global Economy,” where the cybersecurity concerns in the financial systems were discussed. In the global, interconnected and technology-driven financial system, the weakest links
can be easily discovered. Therefore, there was a proposal for formulating ‘cyber-guidance’ and securing the endpoint payment systems. Besides the recommendation of ethical standards and all-inclusive jurisdiction, there was a call for cooperation and coordination in Information Sharing. The proposal to ally information sharing was especially highlighted considering that cyber-criminals, hacktivists, nation-state are also mastering the art of international cooperation in cyber, and the only way to counter them is by forming an alliance. Alliance formulation would also reduce the effort or technical skills required to attack a target. There was also some concern highlighted on the data localization policy and lack of cybersecurity awareness in developing countries. A fear that the developing countries are the weakest link in the chain was made, thereby, identifying a more collective action. There was an announcement to set up a “Cyber Norm Initiative” to share best practices and would encourage other nation to join. It was also decided that there will be a jointly simulate of a significant cross-border cybersecurity attack on the financial sector. It was also highlighted that Institutions such as the European Central Bank and the Bank of England have already conducted such tests, but the proposed exercise will be the first across the border at the G-7 level. Conclusion
As the world becomes a more multipolar system, with power shifting away from the established players to relative newcomers, it will have important consequences for the efficacy of existing international institutions. The G7 because it lacks a charter or secretariat and has no formal rules of membership, was always more of an informal club of developed democracies than a robust and cohesive organization. Therefore, the alliance in cyberspace must be strengthened with an inclusive joint agreement. The Western nations also discussed the public shaming of Russia and other internet attackers for malpractice. But is this the right approach to deal with the problem? We must not forget that the Second World War as a result of the sanctions and shaming imposed on Germany. A better study needs to be done, and there must be an International Agreement on Cyberspace Regulation. There is a special focus on cyber threat that would undermine the European elections and the possible interference in the country’s national sovereignty. The polarisation of the democracy and state behavior in cyberspace was evident from the discussions, MoUs, and agreements given in the G-7 summit. Also, the result of the joint simulation is yet to be made public. However, there remains a doubt on the difference between a simulation and real attack."

Medium.com,Society,Is Namibia’s austerity plan working?,World,https://medium.com/@Jade_Lennon/is-namibias-austerity-plan-working-916298e66dc1?source=topic_page---------408------------------1," A
fter three successive years of unabated economic decline and despite deep spending cuts to the public sector to reduce government expenditure, Namibia’s debt burden shows no sign of easing up. The latest economic report of the Institute of Public Policy Research (IPPR) shows that after ten quarters of economic contraction, state revenue is falling while public debt and the interest payments thereon are rising. Namibia’s public debt rose from N$35.9 billion in 2014/15 to N$96.3 billion in the present financial year. Public debt relative to the country’s GDP nearly doubled from 25.5% to 48.9%, although public spending fell over the same period from 41.6% of GDP to around 33.8%. The interest on debt repayments meanwhile tripled from N$2.1 billion to N$6.4 billion (11% of GDP) over the same period. While spending declined relative to GDP, the country’s gross domestic product has been contracting steadily for nigh on three years. Despite tightfisted fiscal policy and austerity measures, which have cut the already sparsely funded public sector to the bone, government revenue nevertheless continued to shrink from 35.4% of GDP in 2014/15 down to 29.7% in the current year. The IPPR said: “With the global economy weakening, lacklustre performance in Namibia’s principal neighbours, South Africa and Angola, non-mining private investment lacking and public finances in a parlous state, it is hard to see which elements of aggregate demand are going to pull Namibia’s economy out of its current depressed state.” The IPPR in part blamed government’s weakened financial position on the exigencies of state-owned enterprises. Though it did not prescribe what is to be done, it said: “The current Cabinet has dithered over poorly performing public enterprises, arguing that the Public Enterprises Governance Act needed to be put in place before action could be taken. The Act is now in place and key public enterprises and SOEs are reaching the point where continued bailouts can no longer be contemplated, if for no other reason than lack of finance.” The report cites the Namibia Statistics Agency (NSA)’s preliminary national accounts for Q2 2019, which showed that the economy contracted by a further 2.6%. “The contraction in Q1 was revised from 2.0% to 2.9%. Namibia’s economy has not experienced consecutive contractions of such magnitude before.” “Quarterly growth crashed in Q2 2016 and has not recovered since. The latest estimates show GDP contracted by 2.6% in Q2 2019 while the contraction experienced in the first quarter of the year was revised from -2.0% to -2.9%.” By contrast, despite “a contraction of 3.1% in the first quarter, South African GDP grew by an annual rate of 3.1% quarter-on-quarter in Q2 2019.” The Bank of Namibia also adjusted its economic growth forecast in 2019 downwards to an expected decline of 1.7%, “from the marginally positive growth of 0.3% [projected] earlier in the year.” On a more hopeful note, the IPPR cited an IMF growth forecast for Namibia of 1.6% next year “after an expected contraction of 0.2% this year.” On the money markets, indications are that the banks are reluctant to lend in the current climate. “Credit growth to domestic businesses fell steadily from a peak in 2015 to a trough towards the end of 2017 but has since recovered, reaching 11.2% in May 2019. At the same time credit growth to households, including residential mortgages, has fallen steadily to 7.8% and 6.9% at the end of May 2019,” the IPPR report noted. “In August, the Bank of Namibia’s Monetary Policy Committee cut the repo rate from 6.75% to 6.50% following signs of weaker than expected growth and the South African Reserve Bank’s actions in July. This is the first change since August 2017.” Namibian consumers have not been spared the burden of rapid and chronic price rises, which “started to rise steadily from 3.6% at the beginning of 2018 to peak at 5.6% in November, since which point it has subsided reaching 3.7% in August 2019.” The closure of the famous Warehouse Theatre this week is symptomatic of the fact that consumers are hard-pressed for disposable cash and are having to economise. Many businesses in turn are struggling to pay their bills and are resorting to laying off workers or shutting up shop. Rising unemployment is one of the manifestations of the deepening economic crisis, which some have argued should properly be regarded as an “economic depression” and not a mere quarterly recession. The labour statistics marshaled by the IPPR show that employment in the private sector fell from a high of 245,437 in 2014 to 214,693 in 2018. The number of people working in private households also fell by almost half from 136,417 in 2016 to 70,036 in 2018. Over the two-year period from 2016 on the total number of people in (non-government) employment declined from 486,273 to around 401,970. Thus by all indications, it would appear that the prescribed medicine of austerity and deep budget cuts is having a disastrous effect on the health of the national economy, much of which is dependent on state spending. The austerity measures seem to be gaining the nod of approval of investors, because despite these worrisome socio-economic trends, IPPR on Wednesday also cited the latest World Economic Forum report, which said Namibia had climbed several places in terms of business competitiveness. “The World Economic Forum’s Global Competitiveness Report 2019 has just been released. Namibia has climbed 6 places to 94th. “The country’s score has improved by 1.8 points to 54.5,” it said. But for the tens of thousands of people who lost their jobs over the past three years and the many bright-eyed youth who see little prospect of finding work, for the many who cannot afford decent shelter or adequate food, that consolation from the World Economic Forum may not be quite enough.

Medium.com,Society,Australia’s Toughest Question: How Close Is Too Close to China?,World,https://medium.com/@jamietarabay/australias-toughest-question-how-close-is-too-close-to-china-935d7a52acd9?source=topic_page---------409------------------1," A furor involving the country’s first Chinese-born member of Parliament highlights the country’s struggle over where to draw the line on links to Beijing. Gladys Liu making her first speech in the House of Representatives in Canberra, Australia, in July. Credit: Lukas Coch/EPA, via Shutterstock SYDNEY, Australia — It was an extraordinary question for a member of Australia’s Parliament to be asked on live television: Are you a spokeswoman for the Chinese Communist Party? “The simple answer,” the lawmaker, Gladys Liu, responded, “is no.” But little else was simple about the interview that Ms. Liu — Australia’s first Chinese-born member of Parliament — gave last week to respond to reports of her not-long-ago membership in groups linked to the Communist Party. Her fumbled answers, and the outcry that followed, have exposed the country’s struggle to integrate a growing community of immigrants from China who have tended to be overlooked by the political system except as a source of cash. Two forces are now colliding: Australia’s ethnic Chinese community is increasing in size and power just as the country is becoming more skeptical of its economic dependence on China and raising alarms about Chinese influence in Australian institutions. Countries around the world are grappling with how to handle China’s sweeping ambitions, but the challenges are especially pronounced in Australia. “The Gladys Liu controversy is a warning that Australia, like many nations, needs more maturity in its China debate,” said Rory Medcalf, the head of the National Security College at the Australian National University. “The real fault lies in the long complacency of Australia’s political class,” he said, adding that as the country’s “major political parties saw nothing wrong with treating Chinese communities as cash cows,” the Chinese Communist Party’s “pervasive intelligence and interference apparatus saw Australia as a place of great opportunity.” The tensions are particularly acute in Australia, where there are more than one million people of Chinese descent. Chinese have been coming to Australia for two centuries, but significant numbers of ethnic Chinese migrants began arriving after the end of the White Australia Policy in the early 1970s. While most were once migrants from Hong Kong and Taiwan, the number of immigrants from mainland China has been soaring for more than a decade. In a reflection of the sheer heft and reach of China, many Chinese-Australians straddle two worlds, with financial success sometimes dependent on ties to the mainland. Given this reality, and the nationalist pressure Beijing exerts on what it calls “overseas Chinese,” a question is increasingly being imposed on the country’s Chinese immigrants: Can you prove your loyalty to this country? Or, put another way: How close to China is too close? That was the backdrop to the interview that Ms. Liu, who rose in politics on the strength of her fund-raising and networking in the Chinese community, gave on Sky News to Andrew Bolt, a conservative commentator. It was seen almost universally as disastrous. Ms. Liu said she could not recall her long membership in local Chinese organizations connected to the Communist Party’s foreign influence efforts. She had difficulty articulating a position on Chinese ambitions in the South China Sea, or even on the pro-democracy protests in Hong Kong, where she was born. Critics said she appeared to weigh her words so as not to offend Beijing. Her political opponents called on her to declare her allegiance to Australia, where she has lived since the 1980s, and asked intelligence agencies to look closer at any links she might have to the Chinese government. The leader of her conservative party, Prime Minister Scott Morrison, branded these demands racist — a claim echoed by the Chinese government. Public opinion is also divided. Some Australians worry that the country is casting suspicion on an entire ethnic group and demonizing a first-term lawmaker whose association with Chinese organizations may have had less to do with ideology than with the potential for wealth and power. Others believe that Ms. Liu’s case raises legitimate worries over sovereignty and national security. Many experts say these are the kinds of questions Australia has spent far too long avoiding as China’s hunger for natural resources and university degrees helped fuel a generation of uninterrupted Australian economic growth. “It’s only in the last two years that Australia has spoken about the downside of China’s rise. The last 15 years we spoke only of the upside,” said John Lee, a onetime adviser to the former foreign minister Julie Bishop, who is now at the United States Studies Center in Sydney. Last year, Australia passed laws against foreign interference that require anyone lobbying on behalf of another country to enroll in a national register. Two years ago, Sam Dastyari, a politician in the left-leaning Labor Party, quit the Senate amid allegations that a Chinese billionaire paid his legal bills, and that he pushed his party to change its position on the disputed waters of the South China Sea to match China’s posture. The Australian federal government has also taken some steps to distance itself from Beijing, like declining to sign on to China’s Belt and Road infrastructure initiative, turning away Chinese bids to build national electricity or gas pipeline grids, and banning Chinese tech giants from installing 5G wireless networks. But after years of vocal China boosterism, Australia’s leaders have said little to the public about why they have taken these steps. They have instead issued vague statements, for instance accusing “sophisticated state actors” of carrying out intrusions like the cyberattack on Parliament this year. On Monday, Reuters reported that the country’s intelligence agencies had concluded that China was behind that attack, but that government officials had recommended keeping the finding secret to avoid hurting trade ties. The government’s ambivalence and lack of transparency has discouraged open public debate, experts say, leading to oversimplified arguments and conspiratorial rumors. “I think the intelligence agencies should release more information about what they know, because unless they do that, it’s up to the imagination of the population what the Chinese do and don’t do,” Mr. Lee said. “Having been in government, I know what the Chinese do, but I think it should be released so the public can be critical and not overreact.” But until that happens, Mr. Lee said, the debate about China will continue to falter, and the impact on Chinese-Australians, especially those with political aspirations, will only grow. “It could go the way we fear, which is Chinese-Australians feel that everything they do is under suspicion, purely because they hang around Chinese groups or are part of Chinese organizations,” he said. Clive Hamilton, whose book on Chinese Communist Party interference in Australia was published after three other publishers pulled out over fears of angering Beijing, said that work over decades by the party to infiltrate Chinese organizations in Australia had now “poisoned the well” for future politicians of Chinese origin. “Almost all Chinese organizations and Chinese media are now dominated by people sympathetic to the Chinese Communist Party,” he said. “That means that the candidates of Chinese ethnicity who are put forward in the political process and work their way up through the system are likely to be those trusted by Beijing.” Damien Cave contributed reporting.

Medium.com,Society,"Turkey Has Been Raiding, Looting Northern Syria for Months",World,https://medium.com/@marybaker/turkey-has-been-raiding-looting-northern-syria-for-months-4f221e4f413d?source=topic_page---------410------------------1," A June 2018 report from the United Nations Human Rights High Commissioner details abuse of civilians in northern Syria by Turkish-backed militia. After a failed coup attempt in Turkey in 2016, President Recep Erdogan has been taking over Syrian border towns by backing rogue militias. Turkey’s justification for this aggression is a desire to “secure” the Turkish-Syrian border against “terrorists”. US President Donald Trump is a Turkish sympathizer, for reasons that befuddle even his closest advisors. In May 2017, he complained when Congress moved to block sales of F-35 fighter jets to Turkey, and was conspicuously silent about coming sanctions on Turkey. Trump’s recent unilateral decision to pull American troops out of Syria is highly unpopular, even among his fiercest defenders. His decision leaves Kurdish allies exposed, and Syrian citizens defenseless. Even with a US presence, some areas along the north and west borders have already been pillaged and burned, homes seized, families displaced, hospitals closed and water supplies tainted. In fact, Trump is not bringing home the roughly 1,000 troops stationed in Syria, he is withdrawing only 50–100 troops stationed specifically in northern Syria, where Erdogan has already seized control of Syrian towns and farming communities. Trump makes empty, public-facing threats that Turkey had better not invade Syria, while ignoring that an invasion has already happened and has been happening under his watch, with his silent approval. Erdogan justifies his actions by claiming to be securing Turkey’s Syrian border. But in reality, civilians have been caught in a vicious triangle of abuse from Turkish-backed militia, ISIL groups, and even Kurdish militia who deem any individual not sufficiently supportive. The United Nations report lists murder, torture, kidnapping, gender-based violence, destruction of property, and destruction of places of religious or cultural significance among the crimes against Syrian citizens. Of the three groups prone to violence, Turkey has been the most egregious offender. In addition to brutalizing locals, roving militia loot and burn the surrounding countryside. Turkey has installed its own local governance in some regions, sometimes by directly installing Turkish council members, sometimes by threat and bribery. The end result of Turkish “governance” however, has been corruption and neglect. The UN reports that civilians suffer from lack of access to basic humanitarian services, displacement, and armed violence. Farms and fields are burned, agricultural products stolen and taken into Turkey. In addition to suffering theft and destruction from Syrian militia allied to Turkey, farmers are now being forced to turn over 15–30% of their produce as an “agricultural tax”, and farmers must pay armed militia members in order to have access to their fields. Hospitals have been attacked and medical staff beaten. There are increasing reports of disease resulting from a lack of access to clean water, particularly in Afrin, one of the hardest-hit rural areas. Very few NGO’s are allowed into the northern regions controlled by Turkey, and all of them must be registered in Turkey. The few that are allowed to operate are unable to meet the humanitarian needs of the population. People needing advanced medical care are sent to hospitals in the south, but armed Turkish guards at checkpoints extort huge amounts of money from the patients. More than 300,000 people have been displaced, their homes and farms looted or seized. Militia members take whatever they want. Warehouses and stores have been looted and emptied. The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights reported that one elderly woman was severely beaten and dragged from her home, simply because soldiers wanted her home and belongings. In March 2018, the Turkish government surrounded and seized the Syrian city of Afrin during an ongoing cross-border offensive President Erdogan calls Operation Olive Branch. Afrin is a town and agricultural region in northwest Syria, near the border of Turkey. Its economy is based almost entirely on the production of olives and related products such as oil and soap. Afrin is responsible for 30% of Syria’s olive production. Olive trees cover 65% of agricultural land in Afrin, with the rest devoted to fruit orchards. Erdogan’s tongue-in-cheek operative name clearly does not refer to an olive branch of peace — it refers to his intent to seize Syria’s agricultural products and the income they produce. Since Erdogan’s 2018 incursion, over 12,000 olive trees have been destroyed and over 50,000 tons of olive oil seized by armed Turkish militia. Olive oil production facilities were looted and burned, olive presses were dismantled and stolen. Turkey also seized control of nearly 75% of the existing olive groves, and now farmers must pay bribes to the armed groups to gain access to the olive groves. What little product is left after theft, damage, extortion and taxes, farmers are forced to sell to Turkish middlemen for half the usual price. According to The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, the equipment and produce collected from local groves are then sold to finance the Turkish-backed militias fighting against the interests of the primarily Kurdish farmers themselves. Meanwhile, the production of Turkish olive oil producers has inexplicably tripled, and Turkish producers are wooing larger European and international markets. It appears that the stolen olive oil is being “rebranded” — bottled, labeled, and sold as being Turkish in origin. Although Turkey currently claims responsibility for the governance of Afrin, including the welfare of its citizens, Turkish ministers have made it clear that they tacitly approve of the destruction and theft. “As a government, we don’t want the PKK [Kurdistan Workers Party] to make money” from the olives, Minister of Agriculture Bekir Pakdemirli replied when pressed about the stolen oil by Nurettin Macin, a deputy of the pro-Kurdish Peoples’ Democratic Party. “We want the revenue from Afrin to come to us.” The US State Department and Department of Defense had been working on plans for a buffer zone on the border between Turkey and Syria, but under President Trump and Jared “Peace in the Middle East” Kushner, the plan was never implemented. Trump never sent additional troops or took any action to create a safe zone for Syrian citizens. Instead, complete withdrawal of a US military presence, however slight and ineffective, has given Erdogan a green light to shove his military across the border and bomb Kurdish civilians. Trump agreed to Erdogan’s direct request to remove the troops during a phone call on Sunday. Erdogan pitched Trump on the idea of letting Turkey establish its own “safe zone” for Syrians — a ridiculous claim considering the violence and abuse perpetrated by Erdogan’s own militias. Turkey’s incursion into Syria did not start this week, and it did not start with Trump’s recent announcement. Erdogan has been raping the Syrian countryside for years, with Trump’s blind-eye support. All that remains now is for Erdogan to actually drive Turkish tanks over the border and plant a flag. The invasion of Syria is not about to happen. It is over."
Medium.com,Society,Everything you need to know about China’s controversial Xinjiang Muslim Camps,World,https://medium.com/@themillennialsource/everything-you-need-to-know-about-chinas-controversial-xinjiang-muslim-camps-234d7de14c0e?source=topic_page---------411------------------1," Xinjiang, China’s westernmost region, revised its laws in October 2018 to legitimize the use of “vocation training centers” for Muslim citizens. The stated purpose of these centers is to “educate and transform” individuals identified as potential terrorists. Officials claim that the new laws will help prevent Islamic extremism. Since the centers were officially sanctioned, accounts from former “trainees” have surfaced in the international press, alleging harsh treatment inside the camps. The reports have sparked global criticism of China’s treatment of minority ethnic groups. Depending on one’s point of view, the Chinese People’s Liberation Army either liberated or invaded Xinjiang province in 1949, with the help of the Soviet Union. In 1955, China established the Xinjiang Uighur (also spelled Uyghur) Autonomous Region. After China fell out with the Soviet Union in the 1960s, the Chinese government actively relocated Han Chinese — the nation’s largest ethnic group — to Chinese-Soviet border provinces like Xinjiang. One purpose of the relocations was to confront potential military threats from the Soviets. According to a 2011 study published in the Journal of Eurasian Geography and Economics, the population of Han Chinese has grown dramatically in Xinjiang, from 6.7% in 1949 to 40% in 2008. Scholars report that this is the largest demographic shift in a major region in the history of the People’s Republic of China. Nevertheless, the majority of the population of Xinjiang Autonomous Region is still Uighur, a Turkic ethnic group. (Turkic ethnic groups are predominant in most of the “–stan” nations of central Asia.) Islam is the primary religion in the region. By contrast, the Communist People’s Republic government supports state atheism. Despite being the most ethnically diverse region in China, Xinjiang is highly segregated. A 2003 report noted that Han Chinese primarily populate the industrialized urban areas in the North, while other ethnic groups are scattered across the rural South. The segregation in the region is economic as well as geographic. Like many areas in central Asia, Xinjiang has sizable oil reserves. As Beijing invested in the development of petroleum production in Xinjiang, the industry came to be run almost entirely by Han Chinese. One oil exploration project hired only 253 employees from China’s ethnic minorities, among about 4,000 technical workers. Socio-economic progress in Xinjiang thus became tied to assimilation into Han Chinese culture, fueling resentment among many Uighurs. In 1996, Beijing launched the “Strike Hard Campaign” in Xinjiang. According to then-Xinjiang Communist Party Secretary Wang Lequan, the goal of the campaign was “to hit at enemy forces, purify society and educate the masses.” In 1997, thousands of Uighurs gathered in peaceful protest to demand religious freedom, equality and political autonomy. Amnesty Internationalreports that resulting conflicts between Uighurs and police lasted two weeks, with dozens killed, thousands arrested, and hundreds executed. Chinese state media refers to the protests as the “Yining incident”, in which the police worked to crack down on “violent terrorist crimes”. In 2009, riots broke out in Ürümqi, the capital of Xinjiang. The New York Times reported that at least 3 Han Chinese and 1 police officer were killed, with 20 others injured. An eyewitness reported that dozens of Uighur men were led into police stations with their hands behind their backs. In 2014, China’s National Anti-Terrorism Leading Group launched a nationwide campaign, with Xinjiang as the main battleground. Since then, numerous reports have emerged of policies that repress speech and religious freedom in Xinjiang, including the banning of Muslim baby namesand a prohibition on fasting during Ramadan among civil servants. As part of the anti-terrorism campaign, China’s Xinjiang Uighur Autonomous Regional Government sanctioned the operation of vocational “re-education camps” to “counter extremism and terrorism”. However, many of those who have experienced life in the camps say that vocational training is not their primary purpose. According to the state-owned tabloid Global Times, the training centers aim to “educate and rehabilitate people guilty of minor crimes or being influenced by extremism.” Former “trainees” who have been released from the camps say that they were detained for reasons such as having the messaging application Whatsapp on their phones, studying abroad in Egypt, or visiting neighboring Kazakhstan. Those who are sent to the camps are not granted access to a lawyer and receive no trial for their alleged crimes. In a 2018 interview, Xinjiang governor Shohrat Zakir said that these training centers merely teach “the country’s [China’s] common language, legal knowledge, vocational skills, along with de-extremism education.” The Chinese government claims that trainees enjoy a range of sports and recreation activities in the camps, and are allowed frequent visits to their families. This portrayal of life in the camp conflicts with reports from former “students”, who say that they were cut off from their families, suffered abuse, and endured forced labor and political brainwashing. Mihrigul Tursun, a Uighur woman, detailed the abuse she endured inside a Xinjiang vocation training center in a 2018 AP report. Tursun was arrested three times from 2015 through 2017. She recalls that during one of her detentions at a camp, she endured three months in a suffocating cell with 60 other women. The overcrowding forced the women to take turns sleeping, and the toilet was monitored by security cameras. She also claims that she was tortured with electrical shocks and forced to take unknown medications. By her count, nine women from her cell died during her three months there. The Washington Post has detailed a similar account from Kayrat Samarkand, a 30-year-old Muslim man who was detained for making a trip to Kazakstan. Samarkand reports that he was held in a dormitory with 14 other men. There, he was forced to spend long hours studying communist ideology, singing propaganda songs and participating in military-style training. According to Samarkand, if the detainees could not accurately recite communist ideology or correctly sing “red” songs, they were not allowed to eat, sleep or sit. He adds that he and his fellow detainees were forced to eat pork and drink alcohol as punishment for resisting their “training”. (Traditional Islamic beliefs prohibit the consumption of pork or alcoholic beverages.) There is no official record of the number of people being detained in the re-education centers. In a white paper released in March 2019, the Chinese government claimed that recent anti-terrorism efforts have included arresting 12,995 terrorists, breaking up 1,588 violent gangs and punishing 30,645 people for “illegal religious activities”. These figures would suggest a population of around 50,000 in the Xinjiang camps, but international critics believe the number to be much higher. Gary McDougal, a member of the UN Committee on the Elimination of Racial Discrimination, told Reuters that his committee believes that about 2 million Uighurs and other Muslim minorities have been held in these “political camps for indoctrination”. He further asserts that most of those detained are still in the camps, with no scheduled release date. While it is clear from the stories told by former detainees that people do get released from the re-education centers, it is not at all clear how frequently, and under what circumstances, these releases occur. Since March 2019, the Global Times has published several videos and articles portraying good conditions inside the centers and the happy lives of detainees. The Chinese government also offers tightly controlled and heavily monitored tours of the centers, during which foreign diplomats and journalists are allowed to see portions of the centers and speak to selected “students”. One report from the BBC asserted that satellite images of the centers show that Chinese officials removed watchtowers and added sports fields to the facilities right before the official tours occurred. This ramped-up propaganda effort has not eased the concerns of other countries and international humanitarian organizations. In July 2019, 22 countries, including Australia, Canada, France, Germany, Japan and the United Kingdom, issued a joint statement condemning “large-scale places of detention, as well as widespread surveillance and restrictions, particularly targeting Uighurs and other minorities in Xinjiang.” Despite rising international pressure, China has not backed away from its commitment to continue the program, claiming that the training centers have saved people from extremism. For the estimated 1.5 million people still confined to the camps, the end is nowhere in sight."
Medium.com,Society,The Coming Genocide in Northern Syria,World,https://medium.com/@nadinbrzezinski/the-coming-genocide-in-northern-syria-cfab5ac36a11?source=topic_page---------412------------------1," Turkey initiated operations. This is how the invasion of northern Syria was announced. It was, like all operations of this type, antiseptic. Nor are American troops doing much, except maybe observing and pulling back. This came after a call between the president and Turkey’s leader President Recep Tayyip Erdogan. The Turkish view is that this is transferring the fight on the Islamic State to Turkey. They will also create a buffer between themselves and Syrian Kurds. Their argument is that these people are terrorists and a threat to the Turkish state. This is a long term argument that started with the emergence of the modern Turkish state after World War One and the end of the Ottoman empire. We abandoned our allies, who did most of the bleeding and fighting in the fight with ISIS. This is a strategic gift to not just Turkey, but also Syria, Iran, and Russia. And the Kurds, rightly so, feel betrayed. But why? Turkey has never recognized the Kurds as anything else but a terrorist group. Their ancestral nation-state was not recognized during the Versailles conference, after World War One. Kurdistan was dissolved between Turkey, Iraq, Syria and some of Iran. Not only that, but Turkey has engaged in genocide in the past. During World War One they drove hundreds of thousands of Armenians from their homes. The low estimates place the death toll at 700,000 and the high number at 1.5 million. It was the first genocide of the twentieth century. To this day the Turkish government refuses to admit their role in this. They get beyond angry if this is mentioned, as this history is not to be repeated in polite company. The Turkish government considers this an attack on the nation. Incidentally, denial is the last step in genocides. Why after World War Two we had a trial and Germany’s actions after the Holocaust are rare. Genocide is what could happen in Northern Syria, and why people are fleeing from the border region. They are running away from the Turkish advance, that for the moment is mostly artillery and air attacks. And they are running towards Syrian and Russian forces. Al-Monitor reports this: “We haven’t been informed on the American pullout,” Peskov said. “But you know, there were different statements about withdrawals from other parts of the world that have never materialized. We are observing the situation carefully.” He also denied that Vladimir Putin and Recep Tayyip Erdogan had discussed Ankara’s plans to carry out a military operation in northeastern Syria. Yet he did say that the “Russian and Turkish militaries and intelligence agencies maintain close contact.” I am on purpose citing an Arab English paper since the Arab street will also matter here. However, the denial must be taken with a grain of salt. There are many reasons for that, including accidental contact between military forces. So what will the Kurds do when they come in contact with these same forces? It’s not like they have been friendly to the Syrian state, though mostly they have fought ISIS for the rest of us. The United States government betrayed them. It does not matter that this was a very transactional president (who has two towers in Istambul), or not. The fact is that the United States abandoned them. What will Turkey do? At the very least they will conduct a campaign of ethnic cleansing, getting a corridor free of Kurds by their border. However, this is what the Guardian is quoting Erdogan as saying: Turkey’s government says militants linked to the outlawed Kurdistan Workers’ party (PKK) have placed explosive devices, dug trenches and set up barricades in these areas. Turkey has vowed to press ahead with the operations until the region is clear of rebels. On Monday, Turkish president Recep Tayyip Erdoğan said the operations would continue and vowed that the “terrorist organisation” along with its supporters “will be buried in the trenches they have dug”. This is code for genocide. Their supporters include women and children, incidentally. Oh, and yes, some of the women are extremely capable soldiers as well, and quite hardened. This is what Trump has enabled, but he does not care. He says he is pulling out of wars, and claiming we should have never been in the Middle East. Perhaps that argument would have had some validity in 1919. However, it does not now. A hundred years ago we made a decision to get involved in the world. Versailles is one of the reasons for this mess. If the West had respected local people's desire for national lands, Kurdistan would have come to be, at the expense of Iraq, Iran, Turkey, and Syria. As is, those borders were drawn along lines Western powers believed benefited them, without taking into account local ethnic divisions. We know Trump does not know the history. So you would think the attacks of September 11 would be a nice reminder as to what can happen. However, there are those towers in Istanbul. Turkey wants to finish the Kurdish problem both within and outside its borders. A Kurdish state would take land away. Also, they have a desire to rebuild the Ottoman Empire, just as Vladimir Putin intends to rebuild the Russian empire. Turkey is not our friend, and Erdogan is an enemy of any democracy that still remains in Turkey. He is a totalitarian leader, another reason Trump admires him. But our sudden retreat, which Trump signaled he wanted to do months ago, will lead to genocide. This makes us participants in the coming disaster. It is also a long term gift to Putin (and the day it was announced, it was Putin’s birthday). It goes a long way in destroying long term alliances, and the cache of the United States as an ally. Further, it will divide NATO, a long term goal of the Russian state. It also overturns the American policy of the last seventy years. One has to wonder what interests the president is serving? As ISIS fighters rebuild, the organization will be back. And yes, they will strike back at the West in general and the United States in particular. The problem is that like everything else, Americans will quickly forget why. Trump has put at great risk the national security of the United States. However, this may finally be the line of departure for his Republicans allies. One has to wonder if this will be added to the Articles of Impeachment. in my view it should."
Medium.com,Society,Abalone divers celebrate 50 years of buried treasure,World,https://medium.com/@TheLeadSA/abalone-divers-celebrate-50-years-of-buried-treasure-92d1039bb183?source=topic_page---------413------------------1," For half a century, an intrepid group of South Australian divers have braved shark-infested waters to supply the banquet tables of Hong Kong and China with green lip abalone. Being a high-value Chinese status symbol has meant wild abalone stocks have dwindled across the world but a conservative quota system and progressive sustainability practices have allowed the Australian industry to remain afloat. Australia is the largest wild caught abalone exporter and produces almost all of the world’s green lip abalone, one of the largest and most sought after species. Green lip is prized in Hong Kong and China for its consistent creamy white colourings, texture and flavour and is regarded by many as the best sustainably caught wild abalone in the world. “It’s one of those seafoods that has escaped the western palate but it’s been revered as a delicacy and the food of emperors for centuries in Asian cultures,” says Jonas Woolford, the President of the Abalone Industry Association of South Australia, which first formed in 1969. The bulk of Australia’s green lip is sourced from South Australian waters in an area so notorious for Great White Sharks that it was used to shoot footage for Steven Spielberg’s 1970s movie Jaws. As the association prepares to celebrate its 50th anniversary with a book and a series of events in November we take a deeper look at this proud and pristine fishery. Australia’s commercial abalone fishery began on the east coast in the late 1950s and gradually moved south around the coast and to Tasmania as demand from Asia grew. South Australia’s first export shipment of tinned abalone to Hong Kong by the South Australian Fisherman’s Co-Operative Limited (SAFCOL) occurred in mid 1964, five years before the Abalone Industry Association of South Australia was formed. Jonas Woolford and his brother Tobin are second-generation divers and run Eyrewoolf Abalone at Streaky Bay on the state’s West Coast. In his role as South Australia association president, Jonas is responsible for piecing together the book, which aims to capture the stories and the characters of the South Australian industry ahead of the 50 thanniversary celebrations in November. “In the late 1950s they were mainly diving as a weekend job out of Sydney and then they started to push down that eastern coast to Mallacoota (in Victoria), which became the frontier gold rush town of abalone,” Woolford says. “But once that started to become depleted only a few years later, a number of the divers started to work around the coastline and push further west.” More than 100 abalone diving permits were issued in South Australia up until the late 1960s, mainly to part-timers and hobbyists before the Department of Fisheries brought in a rule that only full-time abalone divers could have a licence. South Australian permits were reduced to 30 in 1971 and later extended to 35. There are now 34 licences split across three zones in South Australia: Western (22), Central (6) and Southern (6). An electrician from the South East of South Australia, Cliff Edmunds, began diving for abalone in his spare time in the 1960s and moved to Streaky Bay on the state’s West Coast in the mid 1970s to become a full-time abalone fisherman. He opened a processing plant in the small fishing town in the 1980s and began exporting abalone to Hong Kong in the 1990s. Cliff is now long-retired but his sons Damon and Dion, pictured below, have expanded the business to three licences and process the catch of another six divers, including the Woolfords, to be one of the major players in the wild caught green lip abalone industry. Damon says the Streaky Bay Marine Products factory has moved away from other lines such as whiting and shark to expand its abalone processing capabilities and product range over time, which includes their own 2Brothers branded cans. He says being able to control the supply chain from the ocean floor to the customer has been an important part of the business. “Dion and I concentrated more on the abalone and we got other divers to sell to us,” Damon says. “Because we’ve got the synergies of our own boats, our own factory for processing and doing our own exporting, the more we’ve got going through our factory the better.” The season runs year-round from January 1 to December 31 in the Western and Central zones and from October 1 to September 30 in the Southern region. Quotas were first introduced in South Australia in 1985 and the 2019 abalone quota in SA is just over 640 tonnes, which is similar to Victoria and about half of what is caught in Tasmania. Small amounts of wild abalone are also caught in Western Australia and New South Wales. However, most abalone caught outside of South Australia is black lip abalone. South Australia produces about 70 per cent of Australia’s 488 tonnes of wild caught green lip abalone, with many of the largest and most sought after specimens coming from the Western Zone. Quotas have been reduced by about 30 per cent over the past 15 years to protect the long-term viability of the fishery. This has led fishermen and marketers to seek more direct-to-customer sales, as well as the introduction of ultra premium live exports. Western Abalone, based in the famous Eyre Peninsula fishing town of Port Lincoln, is a co-operative of 14 licences and the largest processor and marketer of abalone in South Australia. General Manager Kane Williams says the quota reductions in the Western Zone are unique because they are voluntarily agreed upon by the industry and not mandated by government. “Most of the licences in this Western Zone are family-held so there’s strong family lines and a long-term view over on this side of the state where people are prepared to take short-term pain for ideally longer-term gain,” he says. “There’s no issue with catching quota — 95 per cent of the quota was caught by the end of June this year but we’re trying to be as agile as we can in making sure we’re making decisions that reflect what we see.” Western Abalone has its own brand, Golden Line, for its canned black lip abalone and has also started shipping live abalone to Hong Kong, China and Sydney. “The supply chain for live starts right from the diver so there is extra effort and stress involved right the way through to the market so there needs to be a premium associated with that,” Williams says. “We’re growing it every year — I don’t see that we’ll ever be 100 per cent live but we’ll keep growing it until we find the equilibrium between that and the other products.” The majority of South Australian green lip abalone is cleaned and blast frozen before being exported. Black lip abalone out of South Australia is generally canned or cooked in vacuum-sealed plastic pouches. Jonas Woolford says the reduced quotas have highlighted to many fishermen the importance of value adding by being involved in the supply chain as long as possible. “There was that realisation when we saw what was going on with dairy farmers and milk and supermarkets that when you don’t have control of the supply chain you just get traded off,” he says. “There’s been a huge investment made into not only purchasing the licences but that long-term involvement with the industry. When you own the processing factories and when you live in the communities, it’s the international dollars that flows back into these coastal towns that often props up a lot of other businesses too.” About 90 per cent of South Australian abalone is exported, with Hong Kong the biggest market. However, the China Australia Free Trade Agreement (CHAFTA), which reduced to tariffs to zero from this year, has led to an increase in direct exports to Guangzhou, Shenzhen, Beijing and Shanghai. Adelaide-based seafood marketing and trading company Blue Sky Fisheries specialises in abalone and markets product for a number of South Australian fishermen including the Edmunds brothers. General Manager David Pickles says while Hong Kong and China drive the bulk of sales, New York, Singapore, Malaysia and even Sydney are also valuable markets. “Wherever there are affluent Chinese populations around the world then there’s a market for abalone,” he says. “But Hong Kong people have a big tradition of eating wild green lip abalone whereas in China it’s more of an emerging market.” Blue Sky sells a lot of its canned black lip products direct to the food service industry, such as restaurant chains and wedding banquet companies, while the frozen green lip abalone usually is sold in retail shops to be eaten at home by wealthy Chinese on special occasions. “In this industry, it’s really about having security of supply so it’s really important that when we go to see them they know that we deliver what we say we can, which means a lot to them especially when they are planning out weddings for the next 12 months,” Pickles says. “With the green lip we sell direct to retail chains as well as to importers in Hong Kong and some direct to wholesalers in China and New York. “If you’re a housewife in Hong and it’s Chinese New Year and you want to find the best abalone you can to celebrate with your family you’ll buy a large green lip from Australia, preferably from South Australia. “We prefer to go down the chain as far as we can but we realise there needs to be a balance because people always think that demand is insatiable for abalone and never stops but it’s not true — it’s cyclical.” Abalone are sold in US dollars overseas and regularly fetch more than USD$100 per kg, which means the relatively low value of the Australian dollar in the past few years has helped Australian abalone fishermen maximise returns on global markets. “It’s a luxury commodity and there are times when, for whatever reason, demand drops away for both the frozen and the cans but the last three years both species have been selling really well and we’re having to quota our customers because we don’t want them to go away but we need to keep them happy,” Pickles says. Led by China, global farmed abalone production has increased seven-fold since 2005 to about 150,000 tonnes a year with Australia currently farming about 1500 tonnes annually. Farmed abalone is mainly green lip and now represents 95 per cent of the total market. But the farmed product does not grow nearly as large as its wild caught cousins and has done little to dampen strong demand for Australian wild caught abalone. Woolford says while many fishermen feared the rise of abalone farming would drown out the wild fishery, it has actually led to wild abalone becoming even more valued. “Only going back 10–15 years ago, Australia was the dominant player with nearly 50 per cent market share, now we are down to 3.5 per cent,” he says. “But those Chinese who are exceptionally wealthy want to differentiate themselves and they don’t want to be associated with a farmed product. “They will do whatever they can to buy what’s harder to get hold of and that just happens to be the wild caught Australian abalone that’s coming from really clean blue waters and processed safely. They also trust Australian produce so that’s something we have to maintain and promote.” Damon Edmunds was among those who feared abalone farming could severely impact his business. “It hasn’t been as big a threat to us as we thought — it’s still in the market so it’s a competitor but it hasn’t been as scary as we first feared,” he says. “You’ve got all these young Chinese customers who are now getting exposure to (farmed) abalone and as they are getting wealthier and need more status they might move up to wild caught Australian abalone.” Three South Australian abalone divers and two deck hands have died over the 50 years as a result of boat capsizes and shark attacks. The bends, also known as decompression sickness, was a problem for many divers, especially in the early days but did not result in any direct deaths. Terry Manuel was killed by a shark near Streaky Bay in 1974, prompting a number of abalone divers from Port Lincoln including Jim ‘Tiki’ Ellis, Vin Murphy, Darcy Eldridge, Norm Craig and Trevor Garnaut — to develop an abalone diving cage. The first self propelled shark-proof cage was conceived and built by Jim Ellis. Woolford says the shark cages used today have hardly changed since they were first designed in the 1970s. “They nailed it pretty much first go and we’re still using it basically exactly as it was first built,” he says. “Trying to make it as safe as possible is something that we are definitely focused on. “It’s about fishing smarter not fishing harder and many people feel that all the fun has gone out of the industry now because it is so regulated — it’s definitely not the frontier exciting industry that is used to be when it was like a gold rush.” Neptune Island is about 55km from Port Lincoln and is a known hot spot for Great White Sharks. So much so that Steven Spielberg sent a production team there in the 1970s to shoot live footage for his blockbuster movie Jaws. Woolford says he thinks the rise of shark cage diving adventure tourism industry in the area has led to Great Whites becoming accustomed to approaching divers in cages. “Sharks are an ever-present danger more than ever now. “We went through a period where there were still quite a few free swimmers but now everyone’s using cages and we’re having more interactions than ever.” Abalone can be found clinging to shallow reefs within metres of shore and at depths of up to 50m. They are also caught near offshore islands and reefs 50km out to sea. Wild abalone in South Australia take about six-eight years to reach legal size, depending on a number of variables such as water temperature, food availability and reef direction. While the vast size of the Southern Ocean fishery means divers sometimes drive long distances to remote boat ramps to launch their vessels, this also spreads the minimal environmental impact over a huge area. Demand is cyclical in line with annual celebrations such as Chinese New Year, however South Australian Western Zone abalone fishermen have agreed to decouple supply to spread their catch more evenly across the year and further into the winter months when the abalone tend to be larger. This has a double benefit because not only are the bigger green lip abalone more prized but because the quotas are measured by weight it means that the bigger the abalone then the fewer are taken per licence to fill a quota. Kane Williams says the sustainability of the industry has underpinned almost every decision the fishery has made, particularly in the past 20 years. He says abalone diving is a boutique harvesting industry with very little environmental impact. “We have no bi-catch, we’re hand collected, we measure and choose every fish individually before it’s sent up to the boat — we don’t even drop an anchor — so in terms of impact we would be among the most benign fisheries in the world,” Williams says. “Everybody’s making decisions with an eye to the future. We all want to make the fishery last and to ensure we are doing the right thing by the resource and that’s driven in a big part by the licence-holders.” Jonas Woolford won a Nuffield Scholarship in 2017, which allowed him to travel to a number of the world’s abalone fisheries including New Zealand, Japan, USA, Mexico and South Africa. “There is no doubt Australia has the best wild abalone management practices in the world,” he says. “That was one of the assumptions that I wanted to test and when you look at our stocks and how they are performing we are being cautious and struggling a little bit but we still have quite a productive fishery. “There’s a lot of ocean and that’s one of the brilliant things about it. “I’ve been diving for over 20 years and every day is different — you can still go exploring and find places that have probably never been dived before despite over 50 years of industry.” Inquiries and pre orders to be made by contacting abyarnssa@gmail.com The book Ab Yarns; 50 Years of Blowing Bubbles will be launched in Port Lincoln on November 15 from 3pm at Beer Garden Brewing with a celebration reunion dinner to follow at the Port Lincoln Yacht Club."
Medium.com,Society,The British State’s Clampdown on Peaceful Protest,World,https://medium.com/black-isle-journalism/the-british-states-clampdown-on-peaceful-protest-640bc6d045fc?source=topic_page---------414------------------1," Extinction Rebellion describes itself as; “an international movement that uses non-violent civil disobedience in an attempt to halt mass extinction and minimise the risk of social collapse.” In other words, they will carry out acts in public that will bring disruption to others, but at no time will engage in violence. Civil Disobedience has a long history of being used to protest against some of the greatest injustices we have faced. Gandhi called it satyagraha, when he fought against British Colonial Rule in India. The US Civil Rights Movement used it in the 1950s and 60s when they fought for equal rights black people. More recently, it has been used in Georgia to end Soviet era government and it is a commonly used by those protesting against Nuclear Weapons. It is hard to believe that the well known Extinction Rebellion was only founded in 2018. Since then, it has spread across the world with one common goal; Forcing Government To Act Now on Climate Change. On October 31st 2018, the group made it’s “Declaration of Rebellion”. Amongst their demands are; The groups first big action was “Rebellion Day” in central London. They chose to block the five main bridge over the River Thames in Central London. As can be imagined, this caused widespread disruption, but it put the group on the map. Dozens of activists were arrested by the Metropolitan Police, but great care was taken when doing so. It is important to note that ER tells its activits that they must no be abusive towards the Police as they accept that they have a job to do. What they will do however, is make it difficult. Common tactics used include; gluing themselves to buildings or the pavement or going limp; this has seen up to six police officers having to carry protesters away. Very quickly international groups began to appear in countries including; The Netherlands, Australia and New Zealand. It is now truly a world wide movement. Throughout 2019 there has been numerous actions across the world. O n Monday 15th April, Extinction Rebellion started their biggest and most daring action to date. For the next 11 days, protesters blocked major roads, bridges and junctions across London. Waterloo Bridge became filled with trees and plants, and even a small halfpipe fort skateboarders appeared. By just the fourth day, the Metropolitan Police had arrested 428 people. Oxford Circus became a rallying point for the group after they placed a small pink yacht in the middle of Oxford Circus. It took ten days until April 25th for the Police to partially clear Oxford Circus and remove the pink boat. Amongst other actions, they blocked the entrance to oil and gas giant Shell’s HQ in London and glued themselves to the top of a Docklands Light Railway (DLR) train at Canary Wharf. By this time, the police had drafted in specialist officers from across the country to deal with a type of protest they had never really envisaged. Those critical or Extinction Rebellion’s actions said the Police were being to soft on protesters. During the eleven days, 1,.130 people were arrested in connection with the various actions in London. At all times the Police had treated protesters and the media with relative respect. There was no major use of force or denial of press freedom on reporting the protests. Throughout the summer action continued to take place across the UK in cities like Glasgow, Birmingham and Belfast. Following the April “uprising”, the Metropolitan Police had begun to call for new powers to tackle people engaging in civil disobedience. Most of the protesters arrested had been done so under Public Order offences, which the Met did not see as a deterrant. When it was announced that the group was to fly drones inside the Heathrow exclusion zone, the police began to take a more preventative approach. This saw them swoop on five members of the group in September in an attempt to stop the plan from going ahead. The group clearly stated that all drones would be at head height and not actually near any aircraft. However, the Police were taking no chances, which is understandable given the risks involved. Laurence Taylor, deputy assistant commissioner, said: “We believe these arrests to be a proportionate response to preventing criminal activity that could significantly impact on a major piece of national infrastructure. “We remain fully prepared for the planned protest tomorrow, and will work quickly to identify criminal activity and arrest anyone committing offences.” This was one of the first time Police in the UK had used preemptive arrests against Extinction Rebellion, but not the last. However, Dr Gail Bradbrook, a co-founder or Extinction Rebellion, said: “As we continue to breech ecological tipping points I believe we will look back on these times and wonder why more people weren’t willing to take actions to peacefully close down climate wrecking infrastructure. “ That takes us to the present day. The International Rebellion has started, and it has seen mass action across the globe. Protesters have been arrested in Sydney, Australia for blocking roads, New York has seen transport infrastructure shut down, and in London, bridges, government buildings and an airport have all been targeted. Before the “rebellion had even got started the Metropolitan Police carried out a raid on a site used by ER to store equipment for the upcoming action. Seven activists were arrested on suspicion of conspiracy to cause a public nuisance and an eighth on suspicion of obstructing police, all of whom have now been released under investigation. Police reportedly also confiscated a wide range of camping-related equipment, food and small solar panels. Two more activists, a man and woman, were also arrested on suspicion of conspiracy to cause a public nuisance the following day. What shocked some people was the way in which the raid was carried out. The group state that they liaise with the Police and senior Met officers have stated that the group are non-violent. Some commentators questioned whether the use of a battering ram to gain entry was really necessary. Many thought that it was a PR move to give the impression they’re getting tough. Either way, it raised questions about the right to protest if preemptive action was being taken to remove items like wheelchairs, lamps and food. A Human Rights charity went further. Barrister, Jack Beadsworth of Human Rights News, Views and Info stated that the Met Police’s action “set a dangerous precedent. Beadsworth went onto say; “The pre-emptive arrests in this case go beyond what is strictly necessary to prevent disorder, and fail to balance the individual’s vital democratic right to protest through free association and free expression. This is due to the use of a conspiracy based offence being highly problematic, as is the use of public nuisance.” He further argued that these arrests breached the right to protest as protected by the Convention of Human Rights within Article 10 (freedom of expression) and Article 11 (freedom of association). The International Rebellion began in London with a show of action by the group designed to create attention, and that it did. It all kicked off when an old Fire Engine pulled up in-front of the Treasury Building in Whitehall, London. Members of the group then proceeded to attempted and use the fire appliance’s powerful hose to spray the building with a red substance claimed to be; beetroot mixed with water. However, as can be seen below, the group lost control of the hose sending it flailing around out of control. Bt the time it was finished the front area of the building was indeed well and truly covered. As is always the case with environmental protests, critics attacked the group for their use of a diesel fire engine calling them hypocrites. Others, including serving firefighters attacked their group for their use of fire fighting equipment without training, adding that someone could have been seriously hurt. Regardless, the stunt got much attention and prepared everyone for the beginning of the protests the next day. As the protests began, it became clear that Police were going to take a very different approach. Instead of allowing the protesters to get established, they would remove anything in sight as it was being placed. This saw a game of cat and mouse with Police removing items like tents and bicycles to the side of the road, only for ER activists to put them back in place. Westminster Bridge was taken over by the group on day 1, but the Metropolitan Police did not hang around. The arrests began almost immediately and rather than the careful approach, they were seen dragging people off to police vehicles. Journalist’s were stopped from getting close and turned away by Police, sometimes under threat of arrest. For what, people are unsure. What was blatantly obvious that the Police would not be taking the gentle approach this time around. This was confirmed when Prime Minster Boris Johnson told Police to use “the full force of the law” on Extinction Rebellion protesters. Johnson later went on to mock the protesters by saying they were “nose-ringed… uncooperative crusties” who are “littering” the road with “heaving hemp-smelling bivouacs.” Today, October 10th, the group started their planned three day sit of London City Airport. Their plan was similar to the actions taken by protesters in Hong Kong when they brought the busy international airport to a halt. The Met Police wee however well prepared. Protesters were unable to gain entry to the terminal itself after security was put in place forcing a boarding pass to be shown before even getting into the terminal. Those who did get in, got dragged out and pinned down. One Bronze Commander was caught telling his officers to use; “Use pain and compliance” on a protester as can be seen below; This was seen as a significant escalation from previous arrests. Undeterred, the group did have alternate plans at the airport. A large group of people gathered in the Docklands Light Railway (DLR) railway station and sat down blocking passengers from getting through. Passengers had to use an alternative entrance to get into the terminal. What happened this afternoon at this protest has left some questioning the states interference in press freedom. Freelance Journalist Livvy Doherty, who mostly covers events for CNN, filmed a Met Police Officer telling her that she had to leave. This despite her identifying as a journalist. Doherty also reported that some journalists were “threatened with arrest” if they didn’t leave. It is correct that the station is technically private property, and that anyone can be asked to leave. However, it is unheard of for the media be told to leave from a protest for this reason. With the threat of arrest, it seems even more heavy handed. Reporters and journalists often report from inside train stations and airports, is it only acceptable if they say nice things? Given the high level of public interest, some argue that this outweighs the property owners request, especially given that it is a Train Station used by the Public on a daily basis. I contacted Docklands Light Railway (DLR) for comment but received no comment by the time of publication. These protests have brought up several issues of concern. Firstly, the Police’s ability to make preemptive arrests before peaceful protests and secondly, the press’ freedom to report on events the government find embarrassing or annoying. The right to Peaceful protest is something liberal societies are founded on. Now we have the state wanting to tighten the rules on protests, only go where they say and arrest you for having some camping gear. On the other side. journalists are being threatened with arrest for covering important protests, or in some cases, denied access to the protests at all. This mirrors the Police denying some accredited journalists entry to Party Conferences because they attended such protests. It is a worrying state want to tighten control of peaceful protests about legitimate concerns such as climate change."
Medium.com,Society,The NBA Fan Silenced for Protesting China Speaks Out,World,https://gen.medium.com/the-nba-fan-silenced-for-protesting-china-speaks-out-9c54f41e95b8?source=topic_page---------415------------------1," The NBA’s China controversy has made protestors out of its fans. A tweet from Houston Rockets General Manager Daryl Morey expressing his support for pro-democracy protests in Hong Kong prompted sharp condemnation from Chinese authorities and an apology from the NBA for Morey’s “regrettable” language. (Not long after the NBA weighed in, Morey’s original tweet was deleted.) The backlash to the league’s refusal to side with Morey was swift. Even when league commissioner Adam Silver said Tuesday the NBA would not censor its employees, he still refused to condemn China for its crackdown in Hong Kong. In response, fans have taken the protest into their own hands. One such fan, Jon Schweppe took aim at Beijing from inside the Washington Wizards arena on Wednesday night. He and a group of friends unfurled a “Free Hong Kong” sign, which was confiscated by security guards. Schweppe filmed the counter and posted it to Twitter, where it quickly went viral fueling more outrage that the NBA is coddling China’s government over free speech. Schweppe talked to GEN about what happened."

With just those seven words, Morey sparked an ideological debate, a crossfire between nations, and the beginning of what may be the NBA’s biggest crisis since Donald Sterling’s comments were leaked in 2014. While many figures in sports have spoken out on political issues before, they mostly did so on issues in the United States, where freedom of speech is guaranteed. Certainly, Morey is different than past sports figures because he spoke out on Chinese politics. China’s government is so controlling that their mainland population couldn’t read Morey’s now-deleted tweet if they wanted to. Within a few hours, the governor of the team, Tillman Fertitta, put out a response saying Morey did not speak for the organization, and that the Rockets were a non-political organization. The NBA added to Fertitta’s stance by putting out a statement. In it, it claimed they regretted the outcry that ensued in China after Morey’s tweet, and they passively attempted to defend Morey while also trying to mend their relationship with the Chinese government. The NBA and Adam Silver are now in a lose-lose situation, with millions of dollars and the league’s reputation on the line. Silver’s response and further actions will decide what the motivations of the league are — if he conforms to China, he will simply confirm that profit is his top priority (and not the rights of the players), but if he defends Morey’s actions, then he will inevitably strain an already tenuous relationship between players and team governors."
Medium.com,Society,The Next Wallet Wave,World,https://medium.com/@fantoni/the-next-wallet-wave-7bb4655a36a9?source=topic_page---------418------------------1," It’s the end of wave season in Beach Break Zicatela, one of the best surfing spots in the world. Famed waves forming powerful barrels hit a beach just in front of Puerto Escondido, a small fishing town in the state of Oaxaca. The best surfers, usually local residents, have started gliding the ocean before they could ride a bike. For them, catching the right wave is part of a craft you develop for decades. They understand how the sun hits the water and reveals its shape from afar. They know almost instinctively when a good set of waves is coming and get in position to ride the hell out of them. For me it’s sort of like time slows down. You become hyper-aware of a lot of different things — the way the wave is breaking, timing, putting yourself in the right part of the barrel. It takes all of your mental capacity to do it just right. — Kelly Stater, pro surfer Much like local Puerto Escondido surfers, entrepreneurs in Mexico are trying to catch a different kind, no less exhilarating, waves. Indeed, the waves of adoption of mobile-only financial services by consumers are the biggest fintech trend in tech. International investors like Andreessen Horowitz and Goldman Sachs are pouring money into what some see as the biggest fintech opportunity in Mexico: challenger banks — bundles of financial services for consumers. Think Monzo, Revolut, Chime, Paytm or Chinese giant Ant financial for Mexico. While Banks are still figuring out how to connect their own retail mobile apps to the internal banking backbone, a software Frankenstein, they’re giving space for startups to take advantage of a unique moment. It’s not that they don’t serve most of the potential customer, they do. Banks just serve them poorly. User-centric and asset-light tech challengers are gaining traction and preparing for an all-out assault of financial services. In March 2018, the Mexican congress approved the first comprehensive fintech law in Latin American joining a small group of countries around the world with innovation-friendly rules of the game. By September 2019 deadline for applications to become a regulated fintech, the CNBV, Mexican financial services regulator, received 85 applications of which 60 referred to wallet models. This means that the regulatory risk, one of fintech’s biggest uncertainty, for investors and potential acquirers can be significantly reduced. A country better known for avocados and walls than its financial system, Mexico has one of the fastest instant government-supported money wire systems in the world: SPEI. Starting this year, the new government has teamed up with Mexican banks to build a mobile-first layer. It is deploying CoDI across the country, a new QR code-based project leveraging SPEI network. Did I mention both are commission-free? The Mexican credit bureaus, Buro de Credito and Circulo de Credito, launched decades ago are as sophisticated and broadly used as the American credit scores. It lowers the barrier for a startup to access consumer creditworthiness and add additional data pools to create powerful credit scoring algorithm. While pitching his latest fintech startup to a big bank, Oliver Samwer famously argued banks were fast becoming the plumbers of the financial industry, therefore essential but inconsequential. The financial pipes, valves and, tanks managed by financial institutions, and government entities work well in Mexico. Technology companies have the choice to connect to any number of local, international banks and government infrastructure. While much of the talk about developing economies is about banking the unbanked, I believe the biggest opportunity lies with consumers already linked to the financial services. Smartphone adoption and debit card penetration are actually pretty high, higher than 60% according to INEGI and the World Bank. It covers all the middle class and the emerging middle class. However, credit card access remains abysmal compared to other Latin American countries. Despite access to banks, transactions above 25 dollars are still 90% cash-based according to the Mexican statistics agency, INEGI, often driven by the informal economy. A typical blue-collar worker gets paid on a debit card every two weeks and goes directly to an ATM or the bank branch to cash her total balance. As the penetration of e-commerce and digital services has grown, this huge consumer base still uses cash to pre-pay their phones, subscribe to Netflix and Spotify and Uber. Every time digital money transforms into physical cash and vice versa, retailers and banks bite several percentages points off hard-earned money. These fees have skyrocketed as digital adoption continues and banks educate clients to move their financial activities online, and with good results. According to EY’s Consumer adoption index, Mexico’s consumer adoption of fintech is one of the highest in the world with 70% of fintech adoption, higher than most rich economies studied. The consumer seems ready to move to digital money. Over the past ten years, fintech companies have won market share by focusing on a single financial need, unbundling banking services such as lending, payment gateways, wealth management, and insurance. Today, a new global trend calls for providing more services to a captive client base to enhance unit economics and retention. What differentiates wallets is the entry point: crypto exchange like Bitso, mobile top-ups like UnDosTres, lending like Zinobe or asset management like Fintual. Connecting to consumer’s financial daily life creates daily interactions, building one of the strongest relationships of consumers and companies. Non-financial services industry players such as Apple and Grab are quickly seizing on the opportunity to expand to financial services. In Mexico, eCommerce giant Mercado Libre and mobile telecom operator Weex are both leading the challenger bank race by offering ambitious wallet products. Micro-mobility leader Grin acquired earlier this year Flinto, a Mexican wallet to expand to a super app strategy with a wallet at its core. These companies have a broad consumer base with frequent interaction and most importantly a brand people love unlike, you guessed it,… banks. Some industry observers argue there are too many dollars and players chasing the same opportunity. I disagree. Yes, most will not scale to become good VC investments but the diversity of well-financed initiatives all but assures the Mexican financial services industry will have successful independent Neobanks. Timing and positioning in the consumer adoption wave will matter as much as strong execution. If banks and financial institutions keep underinvesting in entrepreneurial innovation, the next wave of challenger banks maybe even bigger. Beyond consumers, hundreds of thousands of SMEs are underbanked, lacking access to credit, insurance, and essential financial services. Beyond the hype, the challenger bank trend in Mexico may be even stronger than people think. Formidable teams are ready to seize the opportunity. I don’t need easy. I just need possible.

Medium.com,Society,Indigenous Movements in South America stand up for their rights amid far-right politics,World,https://medium.com/humanist-voices/indigenous-movements-in-south-america-stand-up-for-their-rights-amid-far-right-politics-8a8798ebd3c3?source=topic_page---------419------------------1," By Pamela Machado (Freelance Journalist, Brazil) and Scott Douglas Jacobsen (Secretary-General, Young Humanists International) The global call for stronger environmental protection, sustainability and climate change mitigation has shown that there is much wisdom in indigenous communities that can be learned in order to build a society that respects the limits of the planet. For centuries, indigenous people have lived their lives in accordance with natural and ecological forces, and as resources become scarce in the world nowadays, indigenous communities play an increasingly important role in shaping the new global order. The Indigenous movement has long been overshadowed amongst other more influential social movements and due to lack of resources and more powerful voices, indigenous groups gained little recognition in the global media scenario. Despite years of resistance, the UN Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples, the most comprehensive framework in this realm, was only adopted by the UN General Assembly (UNGA) in September, 2007, leaving evidence of the long-standing struggle of indigenous groups to have their rights assured in an international organization. This plea for the respect for the rights of the indigenous around the world continues to provide a context for countermovements to the negative populism emergent in addition to the development of international grassroots coalitions who develop from and work in solidarity with the indigenous subpopulations of the world. As per some of our previous coverage on the indigenous of Brazilian Amazon forests or the tribes found in the Amazon forests, we continue to find the development of a strongman politics with an arising merger between religion and politics grounded in male authority with derivative impacts on the indigenous populations of the region or the country. The rise of far-right politics in the global political landscape urges social movements to keep fighting, and in South America, the government of Brazil’s Jair Bolsonaro represents a risk for the survival of the communities in the Amazon and their legacy. As the main rainforest and home to numerous communities, the indigenous groups are campaigning for stronger policies to protect their lands in the Amazon, but those movements clash directly with political interests and corporatism. The state of the indigenous peoples in the Amazon is clearly under threat, as has been found by relevant experts and made public with a letter to Bolsonaro. The letter called for the non-interference and neutrality of ideological values professed by the current government towards the matters of indigenous rights and land protections in Brazil. “Brazil has one of the most ethnic diversity in the world, and the highest number of isolated and uncontacted peoples, giving the country great cultural wealth.” Indigenous people acre actively protesting against Brazil’s vile policies under Bolsonaro. In August, we witnessed the first march of indigenous women against the government, organised by Abip, Brazil’s Indigenous People Articulation. The march counted with the participation of 120 different peoples from different states across Brazil and South America. “This government is denying our right to exist,” said Sonia Guajajara, leading figure in the indigenous movement and one of the organisers of the march. The struggles outlined by the indigenous movements are further recognised by international actors, like the Advocacy Director for Survival International, Fiona Watson, as she calls out not only Bolsonaro’s administration for disregard of indigenous rights, a long standing modern history of exploitation of indigenous lands for corporate purposes: “For decades, Brazil has led the way in the protection of uncontacted tribes’ lands, recognizing that they’re the most vulnerable peoples on the planet… But President Bolsonaro is clearly intent on completely dismantling this work, and wants to open up indigenous territories across Brazil to loggers, miners, and ranchers… He doesn’t care how many Indigenous people die in the process, and has openly expressed his racist contempt for them on many occasions.” Some see this as a pivotal moment in human history apart from others in the contacting, if choosing to do it, of uncontacted human subpopulations, e.g., the Amazonian tribespeople. This seems like a different time in the living historical record because of the quiet continuation, but noticeable attenuation, of the legacy and impact colonization. Contact, if done, or study with contact, also if done, can be done with honour and respect. Brazil as the largest state in South America; and, Brazil’s live case of the Amazonian forest not simply burning but being actively burned and then attempts to stop or halt the burning being prevented by the governmental representatives or forces. Bolsonaro’s history shows statements unfavourable — to euphemize — to indigenous peoples living in the Amazon. His statements on record: “There is no indigenous land where there are no minerals. Gold, tin and magnesium are in these lands, especially in the Amazon, the richest area in the world. I do not enter this bullshit to defend land for Indian” “There is no indigenous territory where there are no minerals. Gold, tin and magnesium are in these lands, especially in the Amazon, the richest area in the world. I’m not getting into this nonsense of defending land for Indians” Campo Grande News, April 22, 2015 “Not a centimeter will be demarcated either the an indigenous reserve or as a quilombo [territory for descendents of African slave communities].” Hebrew Club, Rio de Janeiro April 3, 2017 In short, Bolsonaro in these and other quotations represents a common racist with a supremacist attitude who stated precisely the intent as leader if in power and, once being elected into power, began to enact racist policies and the continuation of a 500-year history of colonization of the Amazon with no regard or care given to the health and wellbeing, and land claims and rights, of the original inhabitants of the land who live there now. The threats to indigenous communities are not confined to Brazil, extending to other territories in South America where their rights have been neglected throughout history, as seen in Brazil, we can see an echo of an emergence of indigenous peoples’ movements from taking to the streets and using one’s body to requests or formal complaints on specific issues to the founding of united indigenous movements in Ecuador, Argentina, Colombia, Venezuela, Bolivia, and others. In Ecuador, “Thousands of indigenous people, some carrying long sticks, converged on Ecuador’s capital as anti-government protests and clashes led the president to move his besieged administration out of Quito,” Associated Press stated, “The South American country of 17 million people appeared to be at a dangerous impasse, paralysed by a lack of public transport and blockaded roads that were taking a toll on an already vulnerable economy.” The sharp increases in the fuel prices created the basis for the protests led by the indigenous activists. President Lenin Moreno ended the subsidies creating the basis for the rapid rise in the fuel prices. Protestors were reported to break through the police barricades and then enter into the congress building. Rioters clashed with police and video footage, as per the AP reportage, sowed police beating some protestors and activists. In Argentina, efforts to revive lost indigenous languages are taking shape as the country was once home to 38 different groups, but for many reasons, those cultures were silenced. Cristina Messineo, a language specialist says: “Argentina is a country that historically has negated and hidden its multi-linguistic matrix, especially relating to native peoples. The myth that we are all white and European and that the Indians belong to the past falls apart when you consider the latest polls, where the number of those recognizing their indigenous roots (nearly 1 million), exceeds the number who see this as a homogeneous nation speaking a single language.” This year, researchers have engaged in creating Argentina’s first comprehensive language map. Pope Francis has made some noises as to the rights of the indigenous, where, as a matter of fact, is Argentinian. In Colombia, the indigenous Jiw have lost self-sufficiency since, at least, the 70s and, recently, lodged a formal complaint to the Land Restitution Unit in Colombia. The Jiw and 33 other ethnic groups have been stated as at-risk of extinction. Other movements have taken place in Venezuela where the Founding Congress of the United Indigenous Movement of Venezuela hosted 800 delegates took part from all over Venezuela, as well as in Bolivia, sometimes, their gods come to their aid, so it seems — as the rains snuffed out the fires there. A country with indigenous peoples continuing to march over the troubles from them. The development history of South America is filled with the combat between the native communities, on one side, and colonial actors, on the other. It is important to note that the regional context for the rights of the indigenous in Brazil and its neighbours reflects the same struggles internationally for the rights stipulated in some human rights documents including the aforementioned UNDRIP. Numerous communities in the Global South have faced ongoing struggles to keep their culture, language and lifestyle alive. The 500-year history is really the centuries-ongoing story of the indigenous in relation to the colonial cultures. Photo by Ben Ostrower on Unsplash"

fter spending a few years away, Canada tends to confuse me in ways I did not expect. Why don’t we have any sense of escalator etiquette? Why is my bus either late, non-existent or coin operated? Why can’t I find decently made bread? But perhaps the most baffling is how we can put up with having a boring election in such an eventful time in modern history. Oh, it is not actually boring, it just appears to determined to seem that way. After all, we are dealing with a centre-left government trying desperately to hold onto power after a series of ups, such as pot legalisation, and downs, like the SNC scandal which saw Trudeau boot out our first indigenous justice minister and the banishment of electoral reform to the shadowy policy netherworld known as In-Due-Course-Land. More interestingly, this election has brought revelations that should have sunk the chances of the governing Liberals. The most shocking of which was the outing of our Prime Minister’s history of donning black and brown face, a subject that is too uncomfortably terrible for words. Of which I have a few, but that will come later. There have been more of course, and I am happy to bring up the Conservatives failings, be it about foreign aid cuts, Andrew Sheer the Resume Fibber or even its handful of disqualified candidates. These are less than ideal actions for a party that is trying to offer itself up as the viable alternative, or at least second-best date to the wedding, to a country that is facing major problems that we seem determined to forget. That is not to say the Greens and NDP have had much going for them, but at least they are consistent in being the feel-good-if-politically-irrelevant alternative to the Liberals. In particular, Jagmeet Singh, leader of the NDP and resident non-white party leader, has really come into his own this election, but that is a topic for another week. So that is why, in the spirit of every good safari out there, I want to talk about a trio of political elephants that remain fixed in our national living room and how our parties this election seem content to ignore them for the sake of holding on to the dubious achievement of having the most boring election in the west. So strap in, grab your favorite elephant rifle, or camera if you prefer, and let’s talk issues. To begin let’s meet the first elephant, the terror of most 20- to 30- somethings who hope to see the world somewhat less catastrophically changed that it already is, known by most as Climate Change. If you have been watching the news, or having it implanted in your brain via social media, you might have noticed that we had some climate strikes the other week across Canada with even environmentalist hero and right wing-hate magnet Greta Thunberg telling our PM where he can take his lack of adequate climate goals. People my age and younger are angry and will probably remain angry. This should be the election that should have taken climate seriously, but… Well, it hasn’t been. There were signs that this election should have been the one too. Early indications pointed to this being the one that would have the environment put center stage with the majority of voters stating that they viewed the issue as their top concern before the election was called. Trudeau laid out a campaign message that was blandly green and the Greens appeared to be ready to ascend to third party status. Even the Conservatives acknowledged the climate is a bit of a problem, though carbon taxes might not be the answer. What happened? Well, nothing is what happened and I do not have a concrete answer on why. One of the major issues that I believe brought this about is simply a lack of political will to make it the main issue. The environment and climate change in general still feels like a distant problem for most, while the economy remains a key issue. I do not fault anyone who feels this way, but the economy is not the enemy of climate action. Or, rather, the economy is intertwined with the environment and should begin to adapt to it. This should have been a message that had made during this election, as has been proposed by Green parties in other nations such as Germany. Instead, the politics of climate change in Canada appear to be fixed on whether the carbon tax should, or should not, exist. Which, if that is the best we can do, Canada is ill prepared to face the decades ahead. So, with the first elephant of modern politics quietly asked to leave the room, we next have the second elephant, Populism. It’s a scary word with a host of implications in the current climate. There is many, many definitions to the word, but the one I tend to go with is it is a pseudo-ideology that emphasizes a mentality of us, the ordinary people of the world, versus them, the elites, who are keeping us down. It can be on either end of the political spectrum, but currently it is fashionable on the right side of things, as demonstrated by many fringe parties in Europe of Europe and the President-Who-Shouldn’t-Be down south. Yet, despite the uptick in support internationally Canada appears immune to the current brand of populist rhetoric. Or… Well. Maxime Bernier and his watch-list of candidates have attempted to pick up this mantle and wear it to electoral victory, but it has not seemed to work as well as they had hoped. Though, we still have another week and half of electioneering to go at time of writing, so who knows. This seeming immunity hides the fact that Canada has all the same issues that have brought right wing populism back to life, particularly in parts of the country that are not Ontario and Quebec. I’m an Albertan and an academic at that, but even I can feel the pinch of an economy gone bad out here. People have trouble finding paying work and the perception is that the rest of the country has forgotten about the province. While much of this is the pinch of the stupidly rich now having to find more realistic jobs, this has a tendency to cause resentment, with the primary outlet being the rise of right-wing populism. Also Wexit, but that is a story for another day. Premier Kenney was brought into power on the back of this resentment and frustration which, unlike previous bust phases of our screwy economy here, is unlikely to vanish quickly. The oil is not going to top a hundred dollars a barrel soon, if at all. This is a dangerous mix and bodes ill for the politics of the province. And yet, once again, the conversation during this election has not focused on such issues, or other signs of populist thinking, beyond allowing Bernier to join the debate scrum. Perhaps that is for the best, but resentment of this kind will only continue to build without some sort of release value. Worse, if the globe economy begins to turn downward in the next few years, we might have a collective problem on our hands. So, the third and final elephant, one particularly white in colour, through with an uncomfortable habit of dabbling in face make up. As I mentioned in the intro, this is topic that has come to light that is difficult to tackle, particularly as someone who is in no way racialized. While my upbringing was not particularly ideal, I do acknowledge I do have a certain degree of privilege working for me. There are other people who have been talking about this and deserve recognition. With that out of the way, PM Trudeau’s history of wearing black and brown face is troubling and speaks to an undercurrent that we in Canada do our best not to talk about, which is our troubled relationship with race. We are a white majority country with the stated goal of creating a cultural mosaic that draws from people from across the globe, be they be from Asia, Africa, the Middle East or even Europe. It cannot be overstated how unique this is as we in Canada, for the most part, have quite favourable views on immigration, the Bernier’s in the room aside. But this is an unthinking approval, which masks an uncritical understanding of how minority groups are effected by unthinking systemic forces that makes them welcome, but only to a point. By engaging in such acts our Prime Minister takes part in a tradition that only reinforces this sense of separateness and highlights issues we very much have, despite our aspirations to cultural equality. So, why bring this up, beyond doing the White-Dude-Dance-of-Shame? Because this is a problem that was quickly swept under the political rug in order to maintain the illusion of a boring election. Beyond Jagmeet Singh’s impassioned speech on the matter, politically the brown/black face revelations lived and died in a matter of days. This might have been a fantastic opportunity to have a larger conversation about the state of racial politics in Canada beyond indigenous issues, which also deserve an article in their own right. Or, at the very least a push to have our Prime Minister explain, in his own words, why this was a problem. Unfortunately, that did not happen. Instead, we had Singh demonstrate his moral backbone and the rest of Canada proceeded to file Trudeau’s actions away as just another uncomfortable moment in our political history. It goes without saying that there are other, equally important issues that should have been addressed during this election. Such other include the continuing safe water crisis on indigenous reserves, the debt crisis on the Maritimes or even just talking more about our Arctic policy beyond just shoving that out the door at the last minute. These three issues of Climate Change, Populism and blackface, are simply the most obvious flashpoints that should have made some sort of wave in an election that sorely needed more drama and contention. Instead, here we are with another, boring Canada election, something that will baffle me well up until the next writ is dropped in four years."

Medium.com,Society,A Prisoner’s Dilemma over The South China Sea’s Resources,World,https://medium.com/@charlesbeuck/a-prisoners-dilemma-over-the-south-china-sea-s-resources-60c7c8734964?source=topic_page---------426------------------1," Location, Location, Location A stretch of sea encompassing an area of roughly 1,400,000 square miles, the South China Sea touches upon the borders of the People’s Republic of China, Taiwan, the Philippines, Malaysia, Brunei, Indonesia, Singapore, and Vietnam. Particular areas within this sea that have been disputed include the Spratly Islands, the Paracel Islands, and the Scarborough Shoal. In terms of the Spratly Islands, some or all of them are claimed by Vietnam, China, Taiwan, Brunei, Malaysia, and the Philippines. The Paracel Islands are claimed by China, Taiwan, and Vietnam. Lastly, China, Taiwan, and the Philippines all claim the Scarborough Shoal. With components of each of these features claimed by more than two actors, negotiated settlements can be difficult. This is only further complicated by the resources that any successful claimant might gain access to, should their efforts at control succeed. Sources of Value Why You Should Be Concerned With resources assessed as having economic worth in excess of $1.4 trillion up for grabs, and a greater share of the wealth of the sea lane, there is a lot of incentive for the disputing countries to stake a claim that will see them net their piece of this appealing pie. So far the dispute has resulted in few casualties, and only limited clashes between countries with claims in the dispute. There is cause for worry however. China has acted to seize parts of its claims, and has even built up artificial islands to cement its control in the region. Other countries have taken actions to secure their claims as well, such as the Philippines over the Second Thomas Shoal. The major hope is that a major conflict won’t break out for fear of the trillions in trade becoming threatened. While World War III might be unlikely, there is a significant threat to the world that is proceeding apace, one which may be even more costly to humanity as a whole. Given the overlapping claims in the South China Sea, and how each has industries that rely on fishing to varying degrees, there is incentive to take their piece of the valuable resource before it can be taken by the others rather than to cooperate in maintaining the fisheries they rely on. Much like in the Prisoner’s dilemma, there seems to be a lack of significant trust to pursue mutually binding fishing guidelines, so each state opts to defect and continue their policies of destructive harvesting. Further, China’s efforts building man-made islands in the South China Sea have a traumatic impact on the coral reefs in the area. Already thousands of acres have been destroyed. The loss of this biodiversity might well become irreplaceable if more is not done to reign in the actions of those disputing the South China Sea. As if this was not bad enough, loss of access to adequate fisheries will threaten the existence of a number of industries, hundreds of thousands of jobs will be at risk, and millions of people will have their food security threatened. If this scenario occurs, at the minimum we can expect significant upheaval and potential population displacement, which in turn might well spur more conflict in the region. To make a difference, effective solutions and an atmosphere of cooperation among the disputants of the South China Sea is needed, and soon. Want to Learn More About the South China Sea?

Medium.com,Society,Tunisian Election Results in Uncertainty and Another Election,World,https://medium.com/citizen-truth/tunisian-election-results-in-uncertainty-and-another-election-20d29d410a65?source=topic_page---------428------------------1," While Tunisia’s post-Arab Spring transition has been relatively smooth compared to neighboring countries, low voter turnout and lack of a clear election winner suggests a shaky road ahead for Tunisian politics. Eight years ago Tunisians overthrew their long-time autocratic dictator president, Zine El Abidine Ben Ali, during the 2011 Arab Spring. Now in 2019, Tunisia has held its third free election since the toppling of Ben Ali, who recently died in Saudi Arabia in exile, though discontent surrounds the election results. According to DW, Tunisians have become increasingly disappointed with the performance of political parties, with respect to solving unemployment, poor public services and the high costs of living. As a result, Tunisia’s electoral commission announced that voter turnout reached only 41%, compared with 60% in the 2014 parliamentary elections. About 7 million Tunisians are eligible to vote. Two key competing parties, the Ennahda Islamist party and the Qalb Tunis, or the Heart of Tunisia, both won only a small percentage of the vote though both also claimed the majority, thus creating a state of uncertainty about who actually won before all the votes were counted. The moderate Islamist Ennhda party, headed by Rashed Al Ghanouchi, claimed it won 17.5% of the votes, while the Heart of Tunisia, headed by jailed media magnate and presidential candidate Nabil Karoui, reportedly won almost 15% of the votes. Official preliminary results are expected to be released Wednesday. Signs suggest forming a coalition government will not be easy, as according to Reuters, several of Ennahda’s rivals have stated that they will not join a government it leads. “The task will be very difficult and complicated to reach an agreement to form a government,” said Yamina Zoglami, a senior Ennahda official. The legislative elections with 16,000 candidates from 200 parties followed a presidential race that ended inconclusively and led to uncertainty, forcing a runoff slated for October 13 between Kais Saied, an independent, and Nabil Karoui of the Heart of Tunisia party. Since no party won a clear victory, observers believe the political climate remains vague, and it will be difficult to form a coalition government of 109 seats. The process of choosing members of the coalition can take no longer than four months, two for the winner to choose and two for the president to choose another politician to attempt to form a coalition if the first one fails to form a government. If no one can form a coalition, then it’s back to the polls. Read the original article and sign up for our newsletter at https://citizentruth.org"

Medium.com,Society,“The Walking Dead” Is Not Fiction In Central America,World,https://medium.com/@cvt.communications/the-walking-dead-is-not-fiction-in-central-america-c75ff196e9e3?source=topic_page---------430------------------1," By Andrea Cárcamo, CVT senior policy counsel Right about the time I began representing asylum seekers from Central America as an immigration attorney, I started watching “The Walking Dead” (TWD), a TV show about the zombie apocalypse. I have never been someone able to deal with gore, but my husband and I figured out a system in which I run out of the room during violent scenes and return once he tells me the scene has passed. I have been able to watch multiple shows using this method, including the quintessentially violent show “Game of Thrones,” and, of course, the beginning of “The Walking Dead.” I say “the beginning” because when the series shifted from humans and zombies killing each other into humans ruling over humans through torture and terror, I could no longer watch. After each of the few episodes I watched in which Negan ruled by torturing and displaying the dead bodies of those who disobeyed him, my chest stayed tight and I felt hollow. To my husband’s chagrin, I had to stop watching the series to keep my sanity. Weirdly enough, even after I stopped watching, scenes still interrupted my train of thought, and I wondered why I had been particularly affected by certain scenarios. After some time, I realized this reign of terror by Negan was a reality that I was exposed to through my job. The details in these episodes were replicated in the experiences I heard every day from asylum seekers from Central America, who escape real-life reigns of terror in which gangs are Negans, and the Ricks, Carls and Michonnes were my clients. You may think this is absurd because TWD’s plot is based on the zombie apocalypse, and therefore there are no working governments. However, my clients from the Northern Triangle — El Salvador, Guatemala and Honduras — fell outside their government’s protection because they were poor and lived in gang-controlled areas. I am familiar with this because it was part of my job to research it. For an individual to qualify for asylum, she must show that her government is either unable or unwilling to protect her. As an attorney representing asylum seekers, I have spent countless hours doing research on these governments’ inability and unwillingness to protect my clients. But it is the collective experiences hundreds of clients have shared that illustrate all too well the similarity of their lives to TWD’s rule under Negan. Most of my clients mentioned they could no longer go out on the street after specific hours because the neighborhood gang imposed a curfew, and violating it could mean a beating or even death. As part of my job, I had to send notices to clients’ parents living in El Salvador, Guatemala, and Honduras. When I tried to send notices to families in El Salvador, I was informed that not even the mail could be delivered to certain neighborhoods — it was too dangerous. Most of my young female clients had been raped (by gang and non-gang members), with no repercussions for the perpetrators’ actions. Many of my female clients were forced to be a gang member’s “Haina,” a term used for the girlfriends of gang members, with death as punishment for not complying with the gang member’s wishes. Gangs use children and women to watch the neighborhood to see who comes and goes, and to take drugs across different parts of the city where they live. Gangs are masters at identifying vulnerable children and creating an addiction to drugs in their developing years, thereby making them completely dependent on the gang and even subjecting them to sexual assault and trafficking. Sadly, one of my clients was such a kid, and his level of suffering in the hands of the gang is something no child or adult should ever experience. The gangs are able to impose a tax called “renta” without intervention from law enforcement. People in Northern Triangle countries often have to choose between letting their families go hungry or risking death at the hands of a gang. A considerable number of the women I talked to fled after they had been threatened or had already faced the gang’s bullets because they had not been able or willing to pay the tax imposed by the gangs. One of my clients left her country with her son after she saw her friend’s seven-year-old son dead on the street, where the gang had left him after killing him for everyone to see. Just as Negan knew that beating someone to death in front of everyone would make them listen, gangs know the most painful way to hurt a mother is through her child. The governments of El Salvador, Guatemala and Honduras are an illusion to individuals who have no choice but to live in gang-infested areas because they are poor. In the rare cases that gang leaders are jailed, they have access to cellphones due to corruption and ineffectiveness of the government. Access to phones has allowed these gang members to continue extorting individuals and raping women even though the gang member was in jail. Some of my female clients came to the United States because un-jailed gang members had taken a picture of them and sent them to jailed gang leaders through their phones, who chose them to rape as if they were shopping on Amazon. Once the jailed gang member made his choice, the woman was told that she could either be killed or report to the jail to be raped. While some get raped, many die for refusing, and others who choose to flee face the dangerous trip to the United States. Gangs have more power than police officers at times. One of my clients had several cousins who were police officers in El Salvador, and yet she was incredibly afraid of contacting the police. When a close cousin of hers was killed, another of her cousins in the national police tried to conduct an investigation, but gang members prohibited him from entering the area where the murder took place. He had no choice but to comply, because he was powerless against the gang. Let me reiterate that — an investigator from the national police was successfully prevented from continuing his investigation by the gang. In fact, many asylum seekers are police officers who escape with their family facing persecution by the gang because they were trying to do their job and protect individuals. What we have come to in the U.S. is the callousness and dismissal of asylum seekers who flee from a life that mirrors the storyline from a post-apocalyptic horror show. That so many of my clients have lived, for all intents and purposes, in Negan’s world is almost too much to bear. But these are the facts: many of those at the U.S. southern border are fleeing from reigns of terror led by gangs, and their governments are useless in protecting them — or even complicit in allowing the terror to continue. The answer is not to demonize asylum seekers and to cut all their options to the point they are stuck in Negan’s world to die. Today, as the tenth season of “The Walking Dead” is underway, my current work with the Center for Victims of Torture only drives home the parallels between fiction and reality. I still cannot bring myself to watch the show. But I can try in my own way to help those who feel as if they have, finally, escaped Negan’s world."
Medium.com,Society,Who is Winning Through their Proxy Sponsorships in Yemen: Iran or Saudi Arabia,World,https://medium.com/intpolicydigest/who-is-winning-through-their-proxy-sponsorships-in-yemen-iran-or-saudi-arabia-e25aab3e5c85?source=topic_page---------431------------------1," By Tanvi Chauhan Now entering its fifth year, the brutal civil war between the Saudi-sponsored Hadi factions and Iran-sponsored Houthi rebels has turned Yemen into a humanitarian catastrophe. The Kingdom began air-strikes against Yemen in early 2015, but only when war-groomed Houthis struck two major Saudi oil installations, U.S. policymakers and the global community turned to Yemen, Iran, and the wider issue of proxies. But in retrospect, of the two archrival states involved, what has each one gained and lost with their proxy? Who is really winning? Saudi Arabia Riyadh’s proxies initially brought in some geopolitical gains. From the outset, Riyadh could act on a whim because their proxies hardly questioned them. This is evident with at least three major incidences in the early years: Iran’s nuclear deal, GCC’s Qatar boycott, and Saad Hariri’s resignation in Lebanon. Kashoggi happens much later. Because the nuclear agreement promised to give Iran a better position with the West, the Saudis exploited their Yemeni connection to stall, counter and block Iran’s ascendancy. To re-stamp their regional footprint, Saudis began their first airstrikes soon after the JCAO was finalized. Protecting their proxy gave Riyadh the pretext needed to take those steps. Even with GCC’s Qatar boycott, Saudi Arabia exploited their support for Hadi to leverage a political action against an Iran-friendly state. Whether or not the boycott injured Qatar is an extraneous issue; what’s noteworthy is that Saudis successfully rallied the entire GCC to boycott Qatar for cozying up to Iran. The same goes for Hariri’s resignation in Lebanon. Hariri resigned in fear that Saudis would expel Lebanese workers from the kingdom and halt billions in remittances thus weakening the Lebanese economy. Lebanese Hezbollah were training the Houthis, so Riyadh aimed to directly settle scores thereby pressuring Hariri. Even if Hariri retracted his resignation three weeks later, Riyadh had undoubtedly exercised new-found geopolitical leverage outside the GCC into the Levant via its proxy-protection scheme. Those initial political check-mates did not save Riyadh from impending damage to its soft power and national security. As a Sunni Wahhabi hegemon, Saudi Arabia is held to strong moral standards in the Arab world. This morality appeared eroding when its air campaign killed ordinary Yemeni civilians. The Saudi-coalition airstrikes missed so many targets that the round figures by 2017 estimated over ten thousand civilians killed, three million others displaced, 700,000 cholera cases noted, and the world’s worst humanitarian crisis initiated. Human Rights Watch, Amnesty International, and the UN spoke out against the aerial campaign. The U.S. also accrued blame for Yemen’s devastation given its arms sales to the Kingdom. That was not all; radical Sunnis were now uniting against the Zaydi Houthis and other Iran-backed Shiite militias. Throughout the civil war, the Hadi-Saudi coalition worked with ISIL and AQAP against the Houthis. If history is any mirror, then such synergies have only led extremist groups to galvanize war environments to propagate their own agendas. Indiscriminate airstrikes, partnerships with terrorists, and receiving international condemnation, Saudis’ proxies crushed the kingdom’s global prestige. But Houthis are not only a social or economic menace. Houthis now use sophisticated technology and demonstrate unmarred resolve — these are direct dangers to Saudi’s national security. Between the years 2015–2016, thirty-six ballistic missiles were fired over the border from Yemen. Although Iran-supplied missiles did not incapacitate the kingdom’s security, it increased Saudis’ security concerns. The military incursion meant to intimidate the insurgents served to actually polish their combat performance over the years. And what about the multi-billion dollar arms? But what good are they in the face of organized guerilla warfare and strategy? In fact, twenty Abram tanks were reported as “battle damage replacements” in combat. Such collateral damage to colossal equipment shows Saudi’s lack of strategy against an otherwise weak opponent. So as we have it today, Saudi’s national security floats in peril, and unlike Iran who is only so involved (and denies even that involvement), Saudi Arabia sees no option but to persevere until it redeems its reputation, eliminates all military threats in its backyard, and dominates the political scene. But today, it is accomplishing none of that. Why? Thanks to protracted war-grooming and organization, Houthis can now fight Saudis militarily, weaken them economically, and damage their reputation morally. And all this while, Iran’s association to the Houthis (namesake, partial, or full-blown) has been nothing short of a readymade dessert that Iran savors on. And on. Iran In a region ethnically, culturally, and linguistically Arab, Iran uses non-state actors to both safeguard and enhance Iran’s Persian-Shiite-theocratic existence. Enter the Houthis — a systematized and politically-minded rebel group. Houthis ’willingness to engage in political settlements rendered ‘sense’ to Iran’s sponsorship of them. Although never officially stated, most states now acquiesce: Iran makes calculated regional decisions, not fanatical ones. During the onset years, Iraq, Lebanon, Qatar, and Turkey grew closer to Tehran in crushing ISIS, and neither one rebuked Iran for sponsoring the Houthis. Qatar also stood unperturbed by the boycott aimed to isolate it. Russia who is as much a hegemonic revisionist as Iran drew towards Tehran, propelled further by their Syrian collaboration. Russia appreciates Iran’s value due to its “network of allies and clients that span the Middle East — all outside the US’s sphere of influence.” But such soft power victories only go so far in an actual war. Iran’s national security gains are worth mentioning. By prevailing over Houthis’ successes without necessarily causing them, Iran enjoyed new-found deterrence, indirectly showed its capabilities, and insured prospective members to its future security net. Economically, Houthis’ authority in the Bab al Mandeb strait and Red Sea chokepoints put Saudi tankers and shipments in danger. Militarily, Tehran gains from Riyadh’s debilitating impasse by accumulating advantages elsewhere like Iraq and Syria — being especially stellar in crushing ISIS. Furthermore, since Houthis use Iranian technology, Yemen is a perfect military testing ground for Iran to refine its own national defenses. Throughout, Iran perpetually denied arms provision to Houthis, cloaking its Houthi connection with a mere humanitarian and ideological garb, while enjoying the stresses Houthis caused Riyadh. Obviously then, Houthis will relish Iranian sponsorship and Hezbollian training in effect to become Saudi Arabia’s “Hezbollah.” While the Saudi-led coalition has reprimanded Iran in dragging the conflict, this has neither stopped the Houthis from firing missiles, nor Tehran from supplying them like Qiam -1 missile that missed Riyadh International Airport. Riyadh could now face direct retaliation from its backyard in the event it ever attacked Iran or the Shia crescent. Although this may not deter Riyadh from attacking, it would increase its costs of doing so. Iran’s Yemeni proxies indirectly mollified Iran’s security dilemma by distracting, occupying and troubling the Saudis. Today in Yemen, Iran has nothing to lose by playing the proxy game, while Saudi Arabia can lose many things by not playing it. Iran has a Ph.D. in proxy warfare, while Saudi Arabia is still attending school. But to be sure, nobody is really “winning” in Yemen. The death toll is too high, failing peace talks, appalling humanitarian conditions, heinous war crimes, crumbling infrastructure, and an overall failed statehood. What the involved proxies and states need is no strategy on how to win a proxy contest, but a maturity on how to end the futile bloodshed."
Medium.com,Society,The Charge of the Brexit Brigade,World,https://medium.com/@fbotnz/the-charge-of-the-brexit-brigade-80a707636bc4?source=topic_page---------432------------------1," The Charge was going fine without Parliament. Boris Johnson, the prime minister of the UK, was talking stoutly about getting a “better deal” from Brussels and removing the Irish backstop, which was the part of Theresa May’s deal with the EU that hard-line Brexiteers hated the most. His gambit was to prorogue Parliament to silence those pesky Remainers and run out the clock by simply surviving. A “no deal” Brexit is the default option of the Lisbon Treaty. Alas, the Charge met withering political cannon fire. A Conservative defected to the centrist Liberal Democrats and Johnson lost his one-seat majority. To add insult to injury, Tory Remainers did unto Johnson as Johnson and his fellow Brexiteers did unto May. They voted against his government. Consequently, the House took control of the parliamentary agenda and tabled a bill (the Benn Act) taking a no deal Brexit off the table. In reply Johnson lashed out, expelling these one-time moderate rebels from a Conservative Party dominated by hard-line Brexit rebels who (hypocritically) have routinely defied party whips. In response to losing control, Johnson put a motion for a general election. Labour responded by saying he could not have one until he passed the Benn Act. Johnson gamely started his election campaign even though he had not been able to go to the Queen to get an election but this “campaign mode” event was overshadowed by complaints about using police recruits as props in a party-political broadcast. One of the recruits fainted during the speech. His Remainer brother, Jo, also resigned from Cabinet and politics that day. The opposition parties declined to take the election bait. Instead they decided to let Johnson wallow, impotent in office. Under the Fixed Term Parliaments Act, Johnson needs a two-thirds majority to call an election. The opposition denied him this. So all Johnson could do was accuse them of running away from the people. In the meantime, he is stuck on the Treasury benches, without a majority and without the ability to call an election. Worse, he is now stuck with a law (the Benn Act) that requires him to write to the EU to ask for an extension if he cannot get an acceptable deal by October 19th. To add judicial insult to legislative injury, court challenges to the legality of his advice to the Queen to prorogue parliament were made. One made in England failed, but one made in Scotland succeeded and was heard by the Supreme Court of the UK. The Supreme Court voted 11–0 to rule the prorogation as unlawful. So now parliament is back, and still refusing to let Mr Johnson have his election. Boris Johnson’s attempt to charge his way to Brexit has got stuck in parliamentary and judicial mud. None of this resolves Brexit. It just reconfirms there is no majority for anything in the UK parliament. The tactical shenanigans (on both sides) change nothing fundamental. The clock to a no deal Brexit is still ticking. All Brexit issues raised to date are still on the table. The questions of the rights of Britons resident in the EU and EU nationals resident in the UK remain. The Irish border is still there. The matter of the “divorce bill” remains. The future relationship remains up in the air. The opposition were able to unite to pass a law requiring the UK to ask for an extension. However, the EU can say no. Any one of the EU 27 can veto an extension. The PM could ask for an extension in such a way the EU decline to give it. Speculation is rife about ways in which the PM can thwart the Benn Act. Realistically, as was the case in March, the UK still only has three real and agreed options: 1) Leave with No Deal with the EU on WTO terms (i.e. the treaty default) 2) Leave with May’s Deal (agreed with the EU and still on the table) 3) Remain (by revoking the notice to withdraw under Article 50) Nothing substantial has changed, just the occupant of Number 10. Johnson is desperately trying to get a “better deal” from Brussels. However, the critical blocker remains the Irish border. As Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany put the point in recent days, Germany can leave the EU anytime it wants. It does not have a Belfast Agreement with another state requiring it to maintain an open border and all that goes with it: namely, a customs union, a single market, regulatory alignment and common enforcement measures at the external customs frontier. The deal the UK has already done with Ireland constrains the form its exit from the EU can take. A new deal can be done, of course, but the hard-line Unionists in Northern Ireland object to anything that gives Northern Ireland different trading rules to the rest of the UK. The indivisibility of the UK is their sacred cow. The indivisibility of the four freedoms is the EU’s sacred cow. I have to say, the UK position on the Irish border is deeply problematic. The gnarly problem stems from commitments made in relation to the Belfast Agreement to ensure the soldier-guarded border of the Troubles remains a bad historical memory. While Mr Johnson blusters about trying to get a deal, Michel Barnier, the implacable chief negotiator for the EU, says there is nothing new on the table that is acceptable. The conditions of the 1998 Belfast deal, which were not of the EU’s making, constrain what is doable in any new Brexit deal. If one insists on the continued unity of the UK in terms of rules and regulations, insists on honouring the Belfast Agreement, and insists on achieving Leaver demands for the end of regulatory alignment with the EU and the jurisdiction of the EU courts that in the EU view are essential to the integrity of the single market, Brexit is objectively undeliverable. The commitment to an open border and unfettered economic cooperation between North and South was made possible by membership of both Ireland and the UK in the EU with its “indivisible” four freedoms. When both North and South are in the customs union and single market, it is easy to have an open border that you can drive a truckload of goods across with no customs checks. When North and South are on WTO trading terms, this is “unworkable” and not “operational” according to the EU. The UK’s view is that the EU are artificially magnifying the difficulties Brexit poses for customs checks. However, it takes two to agree a deal. If the UK decides to leave the EU without a deal, then a hard border with customs infrastructure seems inevitable. The UK has been light on the detail of how the much derided “magic” border will actually work in practice without customs infrastructure. If negotiations collapse and the UK leaves without a deal, goodwill with the EU may evaporate. WTO tariffs would appear by default. Things could get very ugly very quickly. Every single business failure, business closure and business migration out of the UK would be blamed on Brexit. The UK is not likely to be united after Brexit. It will continue to be disunited. Attitudes will harden. Tactically, Labour want to force Johnson to ask the EU for an extension as stated in the Benn Act, which would require him to break his promise to deliver Brexit by Oct 31st. It is not clear to me this is a particularly good tactic. Johnson can just say his hands were tied by a Remainer parliament determined to thwart the will of the people, blame Labour for the unwanted extension and campaign on electing a parliament that will “get Brexit done” and deliver what people voted for in 2016. Further, the EU has indicated that it would require a good reason for a further extension. It has no obligation to grant extensions forever. The Benn Act cannot compel the EU to respond to a UK request for an extension positively. All it does is compel the UK to write a letter requesting one. The EU can reply with diplomatic words to the effect of: “Sorry, no extension. Time’s up. Make your mind up. Is it May’s deal, no deal or revoke?” It would only take one EU leader to veto an extension. As things stand, Johnson has until October 19th to come up with something he can present as a “better deal” to Parliament. His latest proposal seems too flawed to be approved at the forthcoming EU summit on October 17th and 18th. However, even if the EU give him something (which seems unlikely) there is no guarantee he can get his own deal through the UK parliament. Given that he has lost his majority, the EU will be sceptical about the ability of Mr Johnson to deliver parliamentary approval. So the EU will probably say: “The UK can have an extension if it holds a general election or a second referendum.” As Mr Johnson wants an election, he will probably accept an extension on those terms and start talking about winning Brexit “do or die” in “extra time” forced upon him by perfidious Remainers. Alternatively, the opposition could move no confidence. Those opposed would have two weeks to agree on a Prime Minister and Cabinet that could command the confidence of the House for long enough to ask the EU for an extension with a purpose. Such a purpose would be a second referendum or an election. However, to date, the opposition has been just as fragmented as the government. Sooner or later, in spite of the tactical shenanigans, the question of Brexit will return to the people one way or another. In the absence of an acceptable alternative to May’s Deal, which remains on the table as far as the EU is concerned, the remaining realistic options are to revoke Article 50 and Remain or to Leave with no EU deal on WTO terms. Unless Boris Johnson pulls a rabbit out of the hat in the next week, everything else is pie in the negotiating sky. Anything could happen. Mr Johnson might yet pull off a deal at the eleventh hour. If, as seems more likely, the EU reject Johnson’s last-ditch pitch, Parliament could move no confidence. However, the fragmented opposition would have to agree on an alternative prime minister. Those expelled from the Tory party and the Liberal Democrats balk at installing Jeremy Corbyn in Number 10. Labour balks at installing anyone else. As the EU has said for most of this year, there is no majority for anything in the UK parliament. There is a majority against everything. This cannot continue. At some point, all the parties will have to face the people in a Brexit showdown to break the parliamentary deadlock. I do not doubt that tactical shenanigans, blustering, posturing and blame games will continue until Brexit’s bitter end. While glorified in poetry, the Charge of the Light Brigade, gallant as it was, changed nothing of consequence. They got to the (wrong) guns but were driven away shortly afterwards. It was a bungled, misguided and misinterpreted mission: very brave but very stupid. Brexit, I suspect, will end up being judged by history in much the same way."

In 2019 being in the time of global crisis as we are you would maybe think it was mentioned in the strategy. The audience member were surprised to find out it was not the case. This caused a great deal of anger or mild academic frustration from the crowd that was gathered today at the University of Oslo to give suggestions or ‘hearing’ of the strategy. It was a ‘høringsutkast’ or hearing draft as we call it in Norwegian. The strategy was drafted to be heard by the employees at the university and the students. It was great to see the inspiring long speeches for climate, and most of the suggestions came with suggestions in relation to other fields as well. Moving from the problem or troubling case of the climate crisis and the feeling of despair to potential for collaboration is not necessarily an easy process. It is easy to argue that we need to collaborate ‘more than ever’, because such an argument could be made at any opportune time. Few would suggest actively collaborating less and building walls (well some would). Criss-crossing disciplines or knowledge areas is however not as straightforward and it does not sounds straightforward, not even the word. Transdisciplinarity can be translated into the Norwegian term ‘tværrfaglighet’. ‘Tværrfaglighet’ in Norwegian perhaps directly translated could mean crossdisciplinarity, as such going across. However ‘tverr’ could as a second or third meaning allude to involuntary and unwilling. It additionally hints at that every discipline is bounded or rooted in ‘faglighet’ – subjectness or disciplinarity. However the Latin trāns (“on the other side of”) as such indicates a crossing of sorts. There is much to choose from, and perhaps the term can encompass it all. The combination of frustration and possibilities. Building bridges, even imaginary ones between people, is a labour that requires effort and great care. Today at the strategy meeting I was lucky to get the microphone and I spoke of my heartfelt concern. The wish I expressed was to make it easier for students even early in their education to start collaborating more across or between disciplines. Collaboration could curiously start before Ph.D or the late stages of a master’s degree, at least that is what I believe to be the case. The interesting intersection of three overlapping topics may for many seem like a disastrous combination, and it is. However I think that we should be able to discuss or consider these together. People talk of a nuclear triad. A nuclear triad is a three-pronged military force structure that consists of land-launched nuclear missiles, nuclear-missile-armed submarines and strategic aircraft with nuclear bombs and missiles. Transplanting this triad term we could consider this a Crisis Triad. Then again we could put crisis in front of a lot of words these days. It was in Ingjerd Hoem’s article about different type of crisis, that I come back to, I stumbled across one definition of crisis by Narotzky and Besnier: Crisis refers to structural processes generally understood to be beyond the control of people but simultaneously expressing people’s breach of confidence in the elements that provided relative systemic stability and reasonable expectations for the future (2014:4). Ingjerd criticises this version for the way insinuates that structural relationships are outside of one’s own control. I find this interesting as I have experienced a few conversations lately related to this statement or critique. The first conversation I had was a few weeks back one of my aunts started talking to me about the climate crisis. I was leaning back in a chair and she went on about how everything had gone to far and that the global systems were out of control. “There’s no point doing anything now,” she said with a frustrated voice. I talked to her and argued that she could, followed by an attack on a series of climate friendly solutions that had been disproved or not proved as climate friendly as originally people had an impression of. I hinted strongly to her that she could make a difference as an individual, despite it being a small difference. The second conversation was after my moving in party at around 5am in the morning. I talked to someone who told me how useless it was to recycle, not that she did not want people to recycle, however it was so useless. It was the big politicians and the big systems that should be held responsible. “Do you think anything of what you do makes a difference?” She would say, and it was hard to disagree when she expressed it so heartfelt. When I asked her about what we could do I struggled to find any answers. When I asked her what she wanted to do she accused me of blaming her, like the politicians for the problem. After a while we said we could do a workshop together, which may or may not happen. However I am not so sure if blaming yourself is the worst if the alternative is blaming others, my psychologist brother may not agree. Therefore in the time of crisis and work between disciplines or across, betwixt, between or any other direction – it may not be a straightforward endeavour. Ingjerd Hoem argues towards the end of her article that a crisis can lead to a reflexive orientation of social practice. How it will change is however more uncertain. AI Social Research is an organisation working to increase collaboration between the fields or computer science and social science. The mission: Making artificial intelligence work for our shared ecology. We live in a time where both the climate crisis and the AI arms race (or friendly football match) is occurring simultaneously. There are many solutions that can be used for good in the field of artificial intelligence, however for the prosperity of our planet we have to be critical and take great care in the applications of these technological advances. We are currently working on releasing a book project in 2020. This is a project where social scientists and technologists are looking at artificial intelligence from a variety of different perspectives. The idea is not only the book itself, but the process of meeting up underway with a total of six meetings during the course of 2019, and more meetings outside of this between those who have shared interests going forward. In addition to this we are collaborating with the International Summer School at the University of Oslo (existed for 70+ years) to see if we can set up courses in artificial intelligence in 2020 or 2021 with people from different countries and disciplinary backgrounds. We wish for the AI Summer School to be a focal point for AI Experts in Norway, Scandinavia and Europe during summer time. We additionally wish that we can make the school cross disciplinary boundaries and ensure collaboration between scientific fields. To me bridge building is both a vague potential exercise as much as it is a clear set of activities that we must undertake to bring people closer. One thought is to match programmers with social thinkers in research and writing efforts. In addition to this we may want to make it easier for social scientists with an interest and technology as well as technologists with an interest in social science pursue these venues. I may of course think too narrowly when I categorise simply by these descriptions, yet we had to start somewhere in relation to artificial intelligence. If we can write together and learn more about the practical approaches to methods there may be an advantage for both. It may be too easy to bring forth crisis and then idea for collaboration, however I see great potential in bringing together people from different disciplines to discuss artificial intelligence and the climate crisis. As someone in between social science and computer science I want to actively take on this role of a bridge builder."
Medium.com,Society,"Uprooted by Turkey Coup, a Cadet Seeks to Rebuild His Life in Canada",World,https://medium.com/@abyasun/uprooted-by-turkey-coup-a-cadet-seeks-to-rebuild-his-life-in-canada-2cb33500dcb9?source=topic_page---------436------------------1," Three years on, Turkey’s most enigmatic and puzzling coup has left an indelible mark on a generation. The ill-fated coup tore apart families, divided friendships, sent tens of thousands of people, majority of whom innocent, to jail, ripped apart many communities, snuffed out space for civil society, academia and media, and sparked a sweeping purge of perceived critics from the ranks of public service. For promising cadets of Turkey’s Air Force Academy, it proved a moment of disaster that has upended their lives and freedoms ever since. M. Kaya (who goes with a pseudonym for his security) was one of the cadets who were in a camp in western Turkey when then-Air Force Commander Gen. Abidin Unal paid a visit to the country’s future pilots to boost their morale and share his experiences during his presence there. The summer camp was in the western province of Yalova. Everything, for M. Kaya and his fellows, was progressing smoothly and according to the schedule. But a sudden call from commanders to attend what was supposed to be an exercise in Istanbul changed their lives forever, and beyond recognition and repair. They found themselves between coup plotters and pro-government supporters in several locations in Istanbul, including two bridges and several entrance points. What transpired thereafter was captured live on TV as angry people lynched several of the cadets on two bridges. Even three years later, the chaotic and bloody episodes of the mob lynching of cadets perpetually hover in the collective consciousness and memory. The tragedy still remains a stain on the public conscience. This past July 15 marked the third anniversary of Turkey’s coup attempt. Some commemorated it as a triumph of people’s resistance against the coup attempt and as an embodiment of their unassailable commitment to democracy. But others, like M. Kaya, regard July 15 as the dawn of another coup (by civilian authorities) and as an act of betrayal of soldiers and cadets by their own commanders and people. What makes his anguish more painful and unbearable is a raft of convictions rained down by politicized courts as 259 cadets were sentenced to life in prison. In the aftermath, he hardly regained his footing again, looking confused and adrift, and perpetually seeking to find his composure and compass amid the maelstrom of Turkey’s post-coup crackdown and witch-hunt. Uprooted by the coup, M. Kaya found himself scrambling to build a new life from scratch. He was, as were his friends, dismissed from the military. He faced an investigation, which was later dropped. Hardly knowing what to do, he enrolled in an Istanbul University a year after. But his military past never left him, repeatedly creating obstacles and perils during his fluctuating civilian life. He was never drawn to the university and the mundane nature of student life, something that was unmistakably different from the colorful climate of the military academy. Perennially haunted by the painful memories of the coup, M. Kaya went through a punishing ordeal in Turkey before finally settling down in Canada, where a small Turkish diaspora community began to thrive, in a quest to build a new life from ruins. Air Force Academy: An Interrupted Dream In a telephone interview (and later via a detailed emailed statement), M. Kaya offered a portrait of a young, idealist man striving to realize a fancy dream of being a pilot in NATO’s second-largest military. His life, as he portrayed in his sketchy and brief story, starts from a rural village in southeastern Turkey where Turkish is people’s second language, something they have to learn, but not until the school time. To climb the social ladder and to be promoted in business and politics, many aspirant people from the region see speaking Turkish without an accent a must for a successful career in Turkey’s social fabric. For an aspirant pilot from the region, and given the nationalist character of the Turkish military, this has become all the more so. M. Kaya proudly rose to the occasion and embraced that challenge. He even mocks that domineering culture. The former cadet vividly remembers the days in the Academy and he fondly speaks of his former commanders now serving in jail over coup charges. His only wish is to see the release of his friends and former commanders. His academy education came to an unexpected halt in 2016 as the country was rattled by a putsch. Needless to say, M. Kaya and his generation have emerged as the biggest victims of the post-coup crackdown. A large segment of a generation of cadets was brutally beaten by a mob, then swept up by law enforcement and sent to jail en masse over charges of coup involvement. But life sentences to 259 cadets, for the majority of Turkey’s people, except some die-hard followers of the ruling party, were nothing other than a blatant miscarriage of justice. The disproportionate punishment became all the more disturbing when some senior commanders managed to get lenient sentences, all the while cadets have been left to languish in prison for the rest of their lives. There is ample reason to regard post-coup trials as sham trials amid the undeniable signs of political interference in the judicial process. In a country where 3,500 judges and prosecutors were arrested, there was scant hope for people like M. Kaya to get a fair trial in Turkey’s politically-dependent courts. After a career interrupted and a life turned upside down, M. Kaya found himself among several choices, all unpalatable and unappetizing than the other — the prospect of jail in Turkey or a new thrust abroad. With no viable alternative available at hand, he was made to choose the second path. He went to Canada. A Young Enthusiast Seeks to Find His Footing in Business (and Life) When he first set foot in Canada, he undertook some mundane works. In this new country, life is as challenging as it was in Turkey, given the existence of odds and barriers that govern the lives of a diaspora community. He learned this from his first foray into the shaky world of online commerce. In Toronto, his life began to be tugged by the pull of different dynamics animated by the unforgiving demands of the modern economy where immigrants or asylum seekers find themselves on an unequal footing with the native citizens of the country. Yet, one debacle after another, one blunder after the next one, he is still undeterred by the prospect of new failures as he now began to establish himself as a young entrepreneur in online commerce. It is an evolving career shaped by trial and error, learning and patience. “I began to purchase different products from China to sell them to customers around the world, from Bahrein to Israel, from the U.S. to Australia. First business ventures may end up in failure. I was no exception,” he told me, offering a glimpse into his new career. At first, he entered the fob-key business. When the machine he bought from China failed to operate adequately, the initiative went bust. “While in Turkey, when I was overwhelmed by stress due to what we went through, I tried to occupy myself with exigencies of the business life. There I began to take interest in philography paintings, for thinking that it may work out due to a small number of experts in the field. But that tumbled, too.” Undeterred by failure, he opened an account and purchased a domain to advance in online commerce. But as he lacked capital, this startup business also went nowhere. Apart from the lack of essential liquidity, he also had no know-how about how to organize things smoothly and efficiently in order to survive in the digital market. Marketing was another key element to promote his products and website, but he had no money to hire a professional to take charge of marketing operations. With boundless energy and confidence of a rookie idealist, he lurched from one sector to another to finally find his footing in a field where he would thrive. “My money and efforts brought nothing, but I accumulated experience. Upon the advice from a friend, I received dropshipping training on the internet. After I watched several tutorials and training videos on how to run the business, I became fixated with this. But for all those efforts, the website thing went bust, it was a blunder.” Many Shades of Diaspora Life He burned all his savings during these preliminary steps in the ever-shifting business ventures and forays. In Canada, as in many other modern economies, time is the most valuable commodity. Yet, time was passing and he was struggling to find his compass. He has then left himself to the forces of nature and destiny, allowing the Fortuna of the ancient Roman belief to determine the contours of his fragile and unstable life. After several ill-fated but bold attempts in business, he ended up working in low-paying construction jobs along with other Turks. “While I was aspiring to be a pilot in Air Force Academy with flight courses, I found myself working alongside with Turks in the construction sites [in Canada],” he demurred with a mixed sense of despair and cynicism. “The biggest disadvantage of working together with Turks is the lack of practice to improve my [English] language. Because we all speak Turkish,” he lamented. He has both good and bad memories from his joint ventures and working together with people with different backgrounds and social affiliation. In Canada, someone has little option to choose partners and employers. That brought him into uncomfortable encounters with people whom he deemed as political opponents back in Turkey. M. Kaya worked with Gulen-affiliated people and the supporters of the ruling AKP, which has been governing Turkey for the past 17 years. He never felt a compulsion to mask his contempt for AKP people. But this was not home and this was exile where he had to work with people, no matter what their backgrounds. He also had some misgivings about the people linked with the Movement over the material terms of working and inadequate payment. After working in construction sites, he bought a low-model, old car with little money he saved. The next chapter in his fast-moving life was working as a delivery man for a sushi restaurant. When there was no customer order, he was expected to work in the restaurant as part of the agreement with the owner. He had little option but to accept the offer. Two days after he started to work, the deal soon faltered as the restaurant’s owner only demanded washing dishes from him in the kitchen instead of delivering outside orders to customers. He came close to fight with the owner. He was able to get payment for his two-day labor after a brief squabble. He then left the work for another attempt in another job. For M. Kaya, driving a car was a new phenomenon he came to experience in Canada. When he was in Turkey, there was very limited time outside the academy life. After the purge, his economic conditions did not allow him to buy a car during his brief time at the university in Istanbul. Following the restaurant drama, he began to work at a pizza store in one of the bustling and busy districts of downtown Toronto. He was very careful and even meek while driving when he first began to get acclimatized with the urban traffic he never experienced before. He worked hard nonstop for 21 days, literally without a break. The last day, he perilously came close to another fight, this time with the owner of the pizza store. He obediently left the job. He tried other jobs briefly, too. But holding on at a sector or a position was no easy task, partly because of his short temper, partly due to the low wages and unbearable conditions that most immigrants are expected to endure stoically. His rage began to build up against employers whom he viewed as overweening figures with little regard for workers’ rights. Though economically self-reliant he might be, he was still far from an ideal position. Upon the advice of a Turkish-Canadian whom he admires and respects, he bought a car with a lease. As many newcomers in North America, he began to work as an Uber driver to put things in order in his life. Apart from its economic benefits, the Uber-Lyft business creates a social experience of its own and provides a peculiar social interaction for people of diverse backgrounds. In Uber and Lyft, he not just saw a job and, although not handsomely, a steady flow of cash, but also a rare opportunity to indulge in citizen journalism. “I seem to have made 3,000 rides with Uber-Lyft so far now. I told the majority of these 3,000 passengers what I went through in Turkey, the dictatorship, the dismal state of more than 700 babies in jail, the cadets, and the 17,000 detained women. I feel pity for some Turks who appear to be ashamed of talking such topics.” While Uber became his main work, he did not totally abandon the online commerce. He began a dropshipping business with a friend. To him, dropshipping is one of the most reasonable things to do. Without stacking storage with goods, they can immediately send products to customers after processing orders. “Through an app, we purchase goods from U.S. Amazon and then load them into our store in Canada Amazon. If there is an order from a customer, the process plays out like this. My company buys the product, in line with the order of the customer, from the U.S. Amazon and then sell it through Canada Amazon. The profit margin is designated by us.” Along with Uber, he seriously began to make some money from online trade. To a newcomer in trade, the appeal of business and the allure of money is undeniable. He is hooked. The more someone makes money, the more he gets attuned to the intriguing and puzzling details of the trade. Still, the market and his business prove to be slippery and unsteady, depending on the wavering demands of customers. He reminds that his family has been in the trade for 20–30 years. At one point, he politely overturned his father’s offer for financial help when he occasionally struggled to find his footing in this venture. College Degree: An Unfinished Dream There is only one thing, the former cadet says, left in this life to be achieved: having a college degree. It is a wish and dream that remains unfulfilled, something that could be the crown achievement of his life after all the setbacks that beset his young life in the past three years. He sees it partly as a mission to be accomplished, and partly as an expression of gratitude to his family’s lifelong efforts for him. “My father worked as a shepherd for many years. He worked as a farmer. Given the fact that the conditions were unfavorable, he was not allowed [by his family] to proceed in education after elementary school, and he began to work as a shepherd, and then as a worker in cotton fields. My mother was never sent to school, even for a day.” Finishing a college, he asserts, would be a tribute to them. It would also be a rebuke to those who called him and his friends traitors, and who expelled them from the academy. Diaspora life in Canada also raised the issue of identity and belonging. He does not conceal the sense of grudge and resentment toward his former country. It is hardly surprising then that he sees his settlement in Canada as a gateway out of a life stuck in provincialism that defines people’s sense of belonging in Turkey. “That shepherd’s son was emancipated from a life stuck in the Middle East and he describes himself as a world citizen, not just as a Turkish citizen,” the cadet said. The former cadet adds that there is a life that exists outside the Middle East — a region, in his portrayal, is riven by war, bloodshed and death. “There is nothing that scares or deters me from doing in this life. When I first came to Toronto, I faced the challenge and fear of losing my [traditional] and cultural values that my family transmitted to me. But now, the diaspora life gave more than it took away.”"
Medium.com,Society,Countervailing Forces Against Ritalin Use in France,World,https://medium.com/mad-in-the-family/countervailing-forces-against-ritalin-use-in-france-73d01afce002?source=topic_page---------437------------------1," In the United States, 7.77 percent of children take stimulant medications. In France the number is only 0.46 percent. A new study in the journal Social Science and Medicine explores why French children take stimulants far less than children in the United States. The study, authored by medical sociologist Manuel Vallée, is called “The countervailing forces behind France’s low Ritalin consumption.” Vallée looks at how particular forces in society, in concert with government agencies, became an effective check on stimulant marketing for kids in France. The study considers one particular case-the low use of Ritalin among French children. Vallée asks: How does France limit its children’s use of psychostimulant drugs? To answer, he looks at “countervailing forces” in French society that mobilized to check the pharmaceutical industry’s influence with respect to Ritalin, which is the only stimulant approved for children in France. The forces he identifies are government agencies, medical professionals, and consumers (parents). Vallée shows how French child psychiatrists worked against industry efforts to market Ritalin in three ways: How do marketers generally expand consumption of their drugs? The study identifies several methods including marketing and promotion; controlling the science that underpins the development of new products; constructing new medical categories and expanding existing ones; and funding consumer groups. (The story of how these tactics have succeeded in expanding the use of stimulant drugs by children in the United States can be found in my book A Disease Called Childhood: Why ADHD Became an American Epidemic.) So how can the industry be tamed? How can those who oppose aggressive marketing of drugs for children become effective countervailing forces? The history of psychostimulants in France sheds light on this. Stimulant manufacturers have historically had a weak presence in France. Marketing Ritalin for kids arrived in France in 1975, 14 years later than in the United States. France hasn’t allowed certain other stimulants-for example, Dexedrine-to be prescribed for children at all. This is in contrast to the United States where Dexedrine was approved for childhood behavior problems in 1961. Also, Ciba-Geigy (now Novartis) pulled Ritalin from the French market between 1985 and 1995 because the drug was causing “a public relations nightmare.” Since France does not allow direct-to-consumer advertising of stimulants, manufacturers couldn’t promote their drugs there as they have in the United States. They also did not lobby doctors as aggressively as they have in the United States because of significant resistance to prescribing stimulants for kids. Vallée and other medical sociologists have observed that governments can shape what medications are consumed by deciding which ones become legal and how tightly they are regulated. Between 1975 and 1985, France limited the prescribing of Ritalin to hospital-based pediatric specialists (child psychiatrists, pediatricians and pediatric neurologists), whereas in the United States any practicing doctor, and in some states nurse practitioners, can prescribe Ritalin to children. In France, only three hospital pharmacies were authorized to distribute Ritalin; the U.S. imposed no such restrictions. Also, French parents could only receive a one-week supply, whereas parents in the U.S. could obtain 30-day supplies. Post-1995, some French regulations were relaxed, but Ritalin prescription remained low. Doctors did their job. French pediatricians rejected the guidelines of the American-produced diagnostic manual, the DSM-III, and followed their own classification manual for childhood emotional problems. In the French manual, the definition of ADHD is not as broad as in the American guide. French doctors reserved stimulants for severe cases, and then only in children over age six. In the United States, stimulants may be prescribed to children as young as four. In France, stimulants were part of a broader approach which included family and individual therapy, school interventions, parenting groups, etc. French doctors would not hand parents a prescription after a 20-minute review of a checklist; while in many clinical practices in the United States, stimulants are a first-line treatment, French doctors generally view them only as a last resort. French parents became more informed. In the process, they became more firmly opposed to drugging their children. The French support group HyperSuper has focused on increasing parental access to psychosocial interventions and actively opposed reductionist conceptions of ADHD. The group’s American counterpart, CHADD, accepts funding from the pharmaceutical industry and has largely adapted the biological narrative of ADHD and treatment with stimulants. In short, French doctors, parents, and government agencies were not co-opted by the financial influence of the pharmaceutical industry, and cooperated together to keep children off of stimulants. Vallée concludes that industry influence can be curtailed when it lacks support from regulators, doctors, and consumers. The French model shows that not only government policies, but also public opinion, can become a countervailing force to the power of major marketers. Vallée plans to follow his study with a book on the treatment of ADHD in France. The French model provides a good example for regulators, doctors, and families in the United States, where the medicalization of children’s normal reactions to stressful situations has gotten out of control."
Medium.com,Society,Get the popcorn — Prince Harry and Meghan are on TV! Why do we show up for British Royalty?,World,https://medium.com/@tamaranaidoo/get-the-popcorn-prince-harry-and-meghan-are-on-tv-why-do-we-show-up-for-british-royalty-8cb1592505ac?source=topic_page---------438------------------1," With much fanfare, media from all corners of the world converged to watch over the Southern African tour of the UK royals, the Duke and Duchess of Sussex and their son, Archie. The globe cooed over Archie while prominant commentators remarked on how Meghan had ‘redefined what it means to be royal in Africa’ (CNN,2019). But with the legacy of British colonialism still thriving in Anglophone Africa and the ceremonial role that royalty plays in British politics, why do we continue to pull out the red carpet treatment for the British royals? Prince Harry, former American actress Meghan Markle and their son, Archie, toured South Africa with Prince Harry going solo to Angola, Botswana and Malawi. According to the press, the royal couple sought to avoid the trappings of an official royal tour, opting instead for a casual affair where they would meet youth at innovative NGOs, visit internationally renowned human rights activists Iike the Arch Bishop Desmond Tutu and the royal couple would conduct their fair share of meetings with Presidents from all three African countries (Telegraph, 2019). The curious thing is, isn’t meeting Presidents and being entertained by Southern African elites and its most innovative social thinkers whether they live in a shack or mansion, the essence of ‘red carpet treatment’? I suspect we may all have been tricked by the royal PR companies as to the down-to-earth nature of this trip. Bring on the Royal Soft Power Tactics In foreign policy theory in order for states to convince other states to follow a certain course of action, they may use hard power or soft power. States with different types of powers use different tactics. The United States or China are considered significant actors in international relations as they are global powers. There are also those states with a large regional footprint like Argentina that have their own set of tools and tactics available to subject other states to do as they say. Power in military prowess, economic assets or in some cases being a global leader on a particular issue can award international respect. For instance, South Africa cannot compete with the United States in the United Nations Security Council to convince other states on a certain action because it cannot match the hard power of the US military arsenal. South Africa does not either hold the purse strings on large foreign aid projects to pressure states into obedience. Importantly though, South Africa is respected for its human rights postioning thanks to the peaceful end to Apartheid in 1994. This international respect can be converted into soft power and used to lobby other states on an issue. Here in this post, I won’t touch on the implications of Brexit and how the UK leaving the European Union could affect the UK’s international standing. Suffice it to say that through the UK’s global conquests during colonialism, the UK’s economy to some extent is still intertwined with those of former colonies. During colonialism these relations were about sending taxes and raw materials to the UK from colonies. Today you can identify the health of these sovereign inter-state relationships through the extent to which a country trades with the UK, the amount of foreign direct investment that the UK provides another country, the magnitude of foreign aid awarded by the UK to another state or the frequency of official state visits between countries. Like all things in life their is a good and a bad side to wielding hard and soft power. Sometimes it can be useful to push despots to take better care of their people. Other times these tactics are used in favour of whoever weilds the power. The British royal family constitutes a display of soft power. Its a reminder of the historical ties between countries, albeit a happy rendition of modern allegience, reinforcing the idea of allies in global decision-making, an idea communicated most convincingly by rags-to-royalty Ms Meghan Markle. Let’s be clear, the UK is a democratic state and the British Royals play meerly a ceremonial role (Town and Country Mag, 2019). The world just reconfirmed this via Prime Minister Boris Johnson’s dictatorial move to suspend the UK parliament over the recent summer so that Prime Minister Johnson would be able to call the shots on the controversial Brexit details. This was a move agreed to by Queen Elizabeth II because she couldn’t say no due to the monarchy’s neutral stance in British politics. Be that as it may, the British Royal family brings in significant revenue to the British economy. The royals generate around USD 767 million a year through tourism to the UK. Brand UK exports benefits greatly from Queen Elizabeth II marketability to which the Windsor name contributes GBP 160 billion annually (TRT World, 2018). After all a trade deal is so much sweeter with an invitation to Buckingham Palace! The Usefulness of the Royal Stamp of Approval From what I can deduce, the Southern African Royal Tour in the case of South Africa was a win-win situation. While at first terrifying headlines appeared around the visit to South Africa as a ‘murder capital’, as a South African I’m proud to see the royal couple’s press coverage ensured South Africans doing humane and socially innovative projects received the limelight. This hopefully will translate to an increase in tourism, international funding for social projects and greater demand for African produced goods that Prince Harry and Meghan Markle took the time to integrate into their outfits and activities. The royal couple (or their PR company) moreover, did their homework on common social issues, we appreciated their salute to femicide, racism, poverty, student loans, de-mining amoung a host of other issues. Thanks to the royal family’s soft power, following in Princess Diana’s footsteps Prince Harry and Meghan Markle will help human rights activists add these items to policy agendas in the global normsetting process. In all this I am dismayed that northern press have the audacity to announce that the Duke and Duchess of Sussex are redefining royalty without bothering to draw more attention to African royalty. Paying tribute to the African royal elites was in fact entirely missed in the press, accentuating the importance of European over African royalty. Unfortunately, when it comes to the pervasive nature of soft power it’s difficult to track from the outside what exactly the outcomes are expected to be. I’d like to recognise here that though positive outcomes seem to arise from the latest royal tour, it’s important to keep your eyes peeled for the hard money issues skirting in the background. Certainly, with Brexit afoot the Brits are pumping resources into the Commonwealth to be assured that relations are ripe to renegotiate trade deals, whenever they finally leave the EU. I’ve mentioned the progressive statements from the royal couple are an awesome arsenal for activism. At the same time, I am annoyed that global media make out these statements to be novel all because they come from a royal family. If anything, this showcase reiterates that these royals are just ordinary people with extraordinary prestige that is awarded by us, the international public. In the words of Meghan Markle shared during the South African leg of the trip: “No matter where you are, everyone is dealing with a different version of the same thing.” (Meghan Markle, 2019)"
Medium.com,Society,A New Brexit Deal Is Impossible — So What Now?,World,https://medium.com/discourse/a-new-brexit-deal-is-impossible-so-what-now-4531fff137c8?source=topic_page---------439------------------1," The protocol for protecting the Northern Ireland border in case of a failure to secure a trade deal, the so-called backstop, is hated by the PM and his party, but won’t be removed from the deal. The EU is “unconvinced” — diplomatic for “You seriously expect us to accept that?” — and the government could only offer a “clarification” of the proposals. It’s blatantly clear that, given the differences, the view in government that a deal is now incredibly unlikely, and the unwillingness of the government to compromise at all, a Brexit deal is impossible. For the government, this is likely a blatant ploy — give unworkable proposals to the EU, and then use them and the rest of the UK establishment as scapegoats for abject failure in a general election campaign — straight out of the populist playbook. My side of the Atlantic has broken out into a full-on epidemic of Bannonism, hasn’t it? But the government faces a couple of existential threats before such an election could even happen. A vote of no confidence would be one — and, in the event that the government refuses to budge and Boris squats in №10, the Queen would be likely to sack him and the rest of the government. This could lead to one of two outcomes: the 14-day period designed to allow time for a new government to be formed could elapse, triggering an election, or a new government could secure the confidence of the House of Commons in this time. This would probably be a government of national unity supported by every MP against leaving without a deal — or leaving at all, for that matter. This government, depending on who leads it, could do a few different things. The first would be an election — it is probably better to fight an election having chucked the government out of power first, and so this isn’t inconceivable. More likely, though, would be an extension of Article 50 to hold a referendum between Remain and the thrice-defeated Brexit deal. That means that it is entirely possible that Theresa May might, having already been out of office for several months, finally see her deal go through. Crazy times. An entirely different threat to the government’s existence is scandal. Boris might go down (there is a genuine reality that he could face a jail sentence, and a long one at that) over sexual harassment allegations and a potential abuse of office while Mayor of London, leaving the government rudderless and the populists leaderless. Ironic, isn’t it?— release plans for longer sentences, and almost immediately get one yourself. Not the best souvenir of your time in office. It’s hard to see who would step up to the populist mantle in the same way as Boris. Brexit planner-in-chief Gove seems to have a little too much integrity, Chancellor Javid seems to be too genuine and well-respected, and First Secretary Raab is, for the lack of a better word, dull. Not to mention stupid. If any of these did step up, their first act would be to attempt to call an election to gain legitimacy, of which they would at that time have precisely none, and going into an election after your leader’s been sent down for groping a journalist or giving taxpayers’ money to his woman on the side never really goes well. Assuming, though, the government doesn’t lose a vote of no confidence, or get dragged down by a scandal, they might survive long enough to get to the October 17th — the date of the European Council summit, and the date on which the PM has to request an extension. The government can try all the strategies to get around the law they want, but none of them will be remotely legal. The only way to avoid having to get an embarrassing extension is to do something almost equally embarrassing: pass your successor’s deal — you know, the one you rejected twice and resigned over with a few members of the government (including Mr Raab). So barring the emergence of some weird constitutional quirks (or the Queen coming out in full support of a hard Brexit), the UK won’t leave the EU at the end of the month. Unless, of course, we’re pushed by the EU. Stranger things have happened…"
Medium.com,Society,Learning lessons: Protesters stay one step ahead of rulers,World,https://medium.com/the-turbulent-world-of-middle-east-soccer/learning-lessons-protesters-stay-one-step-ahead-of-rulers-3f97a6bda64f?source=topic_page---------440------------------1," By James M. Dorsey A podcast version of this story is available on Soundcloud, Itunes, Spotify, Stitcher, TuneIn, Spreaker, Pocket Casts, Tumblr, Podbean and Castbox. There’s a déjà vu feeling to this year’s wave of protests across the Arab world. It’s not that this year saw the toppling of the leaders of Algeria and Sudan as a result of popular revolts, a harking back to the 2011 protests that overthrew the leaders of Tunisia, Egypt, Libya and Yemen. It’s that it’s the protesters in Iraq, Lebanon, Jordan, Egypt, and Morocco rather than illiberal or autocratic regimes that have learnt the lessons of 2011. Had illiberal and autocratic leaders learnt the lessons, they would not have been taken again by surprise by mass protests, often sparked by a black swan. Lessons learnt would have meant putting their ear to the ground, hearing the groundswell of anger and frustration boiling at the surface over lack of economic opportunity and basic services, widespread corruption that benefits the few and complicates life for the many, and a clamouring for the ability to vent those grievances. Lesson learnt would have meant addressing those concerns before its too late and spill into the streets in massive votes of no-confidence in the political and economic system and its leaders. It’s a lesson that is valid beyond the Arab world with similar protests, like in 2011, erupting across the globe in countries such as Hong Kong, Russia, Peru, Haiti, Ecuador, Indonesia, and world-wide climate change-related demonstrations. For their part, demonstrators in Algeria and Sudan concluded from the 2011 protests that toppling a leader was the beginning not the end of the process. In Algeria, protesters remain in the streets six months after President Abdelaziz Bouteflika stepped down, battling the army for a political process that will guarantee structural change rather than enable an electoral process that ensures that the military and its aligned business interests remain the power behind the throne. Sudanese demonstrators surrendered the street only after agreement had been reached with the military on a three-year-long transition towards civilian rule. The Sudanese and Algerian experiences, like the lessons to be learnt from the 2011 revolts, suggest that the playing field in the wake of the fall of an autocrat is striking a balance between protesters’ demands for fundamental change and the determination of elites and the military to preserve their economic interests, some degree of control of security and safeguards against being held accountable for past abuse. What demonstrators have going for them, beyond the power of the street, is the fact that popular discontent is not the only thing that mitigates against maintenance of the pre-protest status quo. Countries across the Middle East and North Africa, characterized by youth bulges, can no longer evade economic reform that addresses widespread youth unemployment, the need to create large numbers of jobs, and inevitable diversification and streamlining of bloated government bureaucracies. Algeria is a case in point. Foreign exchange reserves have dropped from US$193.6 billion in 2014 to US$72 billion in 2019. Reserves cover 13 months of imports at best in a country that imports 70 percent of what it consumes, “If the state can no longer deliver goods and services, socio-economic discontent will rise further…. In order to avoid such a situation… the state and its citizens will have to renegotiate their relationship. In the past the state provided, and Algerians abided. This is no longer economically feasible today, nor is it what Algerians appear to want as they seek more transparency, less corruption, and better governance of Algeria’s resources,” said Algeria scholar Dalia Ghanem. Attention in the past years since the 2011 popular Arab revolts has focussed on the consequences of the Saudi-UAE led counterrevolution that brutally rolled back protesters achievements in Egypt and contributed to the Iranian-backed military campaign of Houthi rebels in Yemen and the devastating subsequent military intervention in that country as well as civil wars in Syria and Libya. Yet, the past eight years have also been characterized by issues-oriented protests that often involved new, creative forms of expression of discontent. Iraq, Algeria and Sudan rather than Egypt contain lessons for the future. Egypt’s field marshal-turned-president Abdel Fatah al-Sisi may have squashed recent protests with mass arrests and security force violence, but his conspiratorial depictions of a plot engineered by the repressed and weakened Muslim Brotherhood are unlikely to dampen widespread discontent with his failed economic policies that have benefited the elite and impoverished many. Mr. Al-Sisi may have ended the protests for now, but continued refusal to address grievances makes Egypt an accident waiting to happen. The demography of protesters in Iraq proves the point. The protests could have been avoided had the Iraqi government focused on tackling corruption, ensuring the delivery of basic services, and creating jobs for university graduates and opportunities for those who returned from defeating the Islamic State to find that they were deprived of opportunities. One lesson of the protests in Iraq and Hong Kong is the fact that repressive government responses, the killing of more than 100 demonstrators in Iraq or the banning of face masks in Hong Kong, fuel rather than calm public anger. Said Hong Kong pro-democracy law maker Fernando Cheung: “This is adding fuel to the fire. This will mark the beginning of riots in Hong Kong.” Dr. James M.

Medium.com,Society,Where is the Middle East in the Quantum Race?,World,https://medium.com/discourse/where-is-the-middle-east-in-the-quantum-race-a2d0a2053772?source=topic_page---------441------------------1," The quantum race, like the space race before it, is a technological marathon with major implications for international relations. This defining quality sets the stage upon which the race is run, presenting competitors with an opportunity to demonstrate their economic and technological prowess to the rest of the world. Perhaps even more so than in the case of the space race, the winner of the quantum race will establish the winner’s name as a world leader in the Digital Age by gaining an unparalleled, strategic security advantage. With such high stakes, countries across the globe are investing in building their quantum capacities, if not to win the race, then at least to not be left behind. While China and the U.S. are currently frontrunners, countries from Europe to Latin America are joining the race, rapidly investing in quantum technology research and development. And yet, a region that has for so long dominated discussions about international relations and security appears to be missing in the line-up. Where is the Middle East in the quantum race? For most nations in the Middle East, quantum investment is simply not a major priority. There is a complex set of reasons, unique to each country, for why this is the case. Many countries in the region have been plagued by war and instability over the last decade-producing both a deficit of government funds and an inadequate environment for exploration and innovation to occur. As with the space race, the countries that have risen to the top of the quantum food chain have done so upon the backdrop of relative stability, growth and wealth. Several countries in the region, however, have begun to emerge as quantum competitors with increasing capacity and focus: Israel, the Gulf countries, led by the United Arab Emirates (UAE) and the Islamic Republic of Iran. These countries share some of the conditions required for the establishment of international technological partnerships, investment and a privileged focus on innovation. The ambitions and specialities of their growing quantum programs, however, differ notably in relation to their specific geopolitical situations. Israel, a country known for its heavily U.S.-funded defence and arms expertise, is investing in quantum technologies largely for security applications. The Gulf counties, well-known for their economic reliance on oil production, are distinctly invested in the areas of innovation and capacity-building, especially in the UAE where there is a growing focus on quantum applications in the energy industry. Iran’s quantum efforts, largely directed through well-established and internationally connected knowledge institutions, are also heavily influenced by the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA, commonly known as the Iran nuclear deal). While scant information is available about these countries’ nascent quantum efforts, their momentum is growing, slowly but surely. From a geopolitical perspective, the ability to compete on the global stage with quantum technology research and development would be a critical advantage for any nation in the Middle East. The quantum race began in earnest in the early 2000’s, making Israel a late-comer to the game. Just last year, Israel’s Prime Minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, announced the country’s entrance into the quantum race with an investment of NIS 100 million in a quantum technology research fund (approximately USD 28.2 million equivalent). According to The Jerusalem Post, the ongoing project is a collaboration between the Defense Ministry’s Administration for the Development of Weapons and Technological Infrastructure (MAFAT), the Higher Education Committee and the Israel Science Foundation. The project’s aim is to support Israel’s intelligence-gathering capacity, and as such will likely focus on the areas of quantum communications and computing. This month, Israel’s Ben-Gurion University of the Negev (BGU) announced plans to pursue joint quantum research and development programs with the Israel Defense Force (IDF) and U.S. Defense Forces, along with other high-tech industry players both in Israel and abroad. Significantly, Israel is the largest cumulative recipient of U.S. foreign aid since World War II and the vast majority of this funding, quoted at $134.7 billion total, goes directly to Israel’s defense programs. As such, Israel’s ability to support scientific research and development (R&D) with military funding has come to resemble the American system, where the Department of Defense (DoD) is one of the biggest funders of national scientific research and development. This has manifested as vast amounts of military investment in Israel’s high-technology sector. According to the OECD, the country’s gross domestic spending on R&D since 2015 has been the highest in the world. As a result, the science and technology sector in Israel is one of the most well-developed and profitable in the world. Historically, Israel has prioritised the development of home-grown technological expertise and innovation through industry and its higher education system. The immense amount of military and defense funding coupled with highly-skilled immigration booms and an extremely economically and socially invested network of Jewish populations living abroad have enabled Israel to build a thriving, national high-technology industry. Geographically surrounded by Muslim-majority countries in a radically contentious area, Israel has maintained its space in the Middle East essentially through establishing its presence as a highly militarized nation with vital support from powerful friends. Within this context and motivated by a lack of natural resources, Israel became the leader in high technology military exports that it is today. Given this context and history, Israel’s recent pivot in focus toward quantum technologies is no surprise. The country’s keen focus on security and defense applications currently dominates the scope of their quantum R&D programs, but civilian applications are promised as the next phase of development. While Israel may eventually corner the market in quantum computing and communications for military applications, the Gulf nations of Saudi Arabia, Qatar and the UAE have entered the race with a different aim. This year the Gulf nations launched quantum computing research groups in their respective countries with the goal of creating an ecosystem for capacity-building and ultimately, knowledge production, in quantum technologies. Already an authority in technological research in the Middle East and a rising star in research output worldwide, Saudi Arabia’s King Abdullah University of Science is well-positioned to become a regional leader in the quantum computing space. Further, Saudi Arabia’s Aramco presents existing experience with supercomputer systems, a considerable advantage in the quantum race. Recently, the UAE has turned its focus toward forming vital partnerships with global tech giants and has been rewarded by agreements with some of the biggest names in quantum computing, D-Wave and Microsoft. Last year, the Dubai Electricity and Water Authority (DEWA) announced its participation in the Microsoft Quantum Computing Programme to develop quantum-based solutions for energy-optimization. Notably, DEWA is the first organisation outside of the U.S. to participate in the program. This suggests the UAE is taking a forward-looking approach to shift its economy and applying quantum innovation in the sustainable energy sector-a strategic pivot for a country where 30% of the GDP is directly based on oil and gas output. Last year as well, the UAE Minister for artificial intelligence enacted a partnership with Canadian quantum computing company, D-Wave, to bring the region its first quantum computer, which will be housed at the Museum of the Future in Dubai. Broadly, these advancements are couched by the motive to ensure the ongoing production of innovation through knowledge development, a trend that is currently sweeping the Arab states. The pressing need to begin diversifying the economies of these oil-producing nations has also contributed to investment in new quantum programs. However, the Gulf countries lack the population sizes and national research budgets to compete with the rest of the world in the quantum race. For this reason, the Gulf countries are looking toward public-private partnerships as a way to develop their quantum computing sectors further, bringing vital knowledge and facilities to the region. These recent developments appear to be at least in part a response to a widely-referenced 2019 World Government Summit report authored in partnership with PricewaterhouseCoopers (PwC) by Simone Vernacchia. The report seems to have stoked a fire, urging the Gulf countries to begin investing in quantum technologies: If they do not, they risk missing out on the many advantages that will be on offer across every sector, and they will face an increasing threat if they fail to plan for the next generation of cyber-security…. Building up knowledge and specific skills in the field, along with preparing defensive post-quantum computing cyber-strategies, can be considered urgent priorities. The report makes clear the risks of missing the moment to join the quantum race but also points to a number of regional opportunities for quantum innovation within the existing oil production industry, national security apparatus and diversification into new industries. It is clear from the establishment of these early partnerships between the UAE, D-Wave and Microsoft, that the report’s warnings are not being taken lightly. Rather, the advice is being heeded as essential to ensuring the supremacy of the region’s economy and continued security. A regional competitor to the UAE, Iran is also vying for a place in the quantum race and hoping to take the lead in quantum technological facilities and know-how in the Middle East. The country has had sights set on quantum research as a game-changing industry since around 2015 with the signing of the JCPOA. The JCPOA deal stipulates that in exchange for Iran limiting its uranium-enrichment activities, sanctions against the country imposed by six of the world’s biggest powers will be lifted. The agreement also opened a door for Iran to collaborate with Euratom, the European atomic energy community working in high technology development for nuclear power. Given the tumultuous U.S. withdrawal from JCPOA, Iran’s recent quantum efforts have focused on collaboration with European countries and the continued development of its own national capacities. Although several sources from 2017 state that Iran has entered talks with European nations to collaborate on quantum technology it is unclear whether or not any agreements have been actualised. The Atomic Energy Organisation of Iran (AEOI) appears to be the main authority involved in negotiations to build the country’s quantum industry. While European collaboration is a nebulous topic, it appears that the AEOI has been busy at work, proclaiming the two recent victories of creating Iran’s first laboratory equipped with quantum technology research facilities and running its first photon entanglement experiment. Iran also boasts some of the most well-developed quantum information science programs in the region. As such, the quantum literacy of Iran’s scientists and engineers is higher than in many countries that lack such long-standing research specialisations. The Islamic Republic’s two leading quantum research groups, the Sharif University quantum information group and the Quantronics Lab at the Iran University of Science & Technology are internationally renowned and well-equipped. These advantages were achieved either despite international sanctions, or in the more likely case, after they were lifted through the JCPOA. Last year, the first National Conference on Quantum Technology was held in Tehran and the International Iran Conference on Quantum Information, led by the Sharif group, is now in its sixth year. These conferences serve to bring international knowledge of the latest quantum developments to the region, helping to put Iran on the map as a contender in the quantum race. It is still early days for the Middle East in the quantum race. The growing quantum programs in the Gulf nations, Israel, and Iran have only been formally created within the past three years and as such their outputs and impacts remain minimal. Nevertheless, these countries, which have been lucky enough to prosper in relatively stable economic and political circumstances, have seized the valuable opportunity to participate in and even to help build what is promised as the next technological revolution. While only time can tell exactly how the quantum race will pan out, this regional competition will undoubtedly open up possibilities to shift existing power dynamics not just between these quantum-empowered Middle Eastern countries, but also on an international scale."

Medium.com,Society,Tanaka Mitsu and Japan’s Second Wave Feminist Movement — Unseen Japan,World,https://medium.com/@unseenjapan/tanaka-mitsu-and-japans-second-wave-feminist-movement-unseen-japan-45bd4ba74c68?source=topic_page---------444------------------1," By Alyssa Pearl Fusek Japan’s support of the US war in Vietnam became the catalyst for the emergence of leftist movements. Thousands took to the streets to protest the government’s pro-war stance. Women in their twenties and thirties, armed with college educations and childhoods spent in the shadow of postwar Japan, sought to stake their claim in New Left movements unhindered by patriarchal values or systems. Out of this desire came Japan’s “second-wave” feminist movement, the ūman ribu movement ( ウーマンリブ運動; ūman ribu katsudou). These women redefined the word onna (女; “woman”) in their campaign for the “liberation of sex” (性の解放; sei no kaihou). In addition, Ribu rejected socially determined labels such as “mother”, “housewife” and common words for “woman” like josei (女性). Enter the persistent and tenacious Tanaka Mitsu (田中美津). Born in 1943 just two years before Japan’s surrender in WWII, Tanaka would become inseparable from the ribu movement. While her tenure in ūman ribu activism would only last five years, but her impact and discourse would go on to become eternal. Tanaka grew up in a typical working-class family. As a result, she didn’t subscribe to the elitism underscoring the feminist movement. In fact, Tanaka would go on to use her socioeconomic background to critique said elitism. The majority of women surrounding her had college educations. Tanaka’s schooling, however, ended with her graduation from Toshima Metropolitan High School. During her mid-twenties, Tanaka lived near the University of Tokyo, ground zero for student movements, most notably the Zenkyoto takeover. Tanaka’s first participation in activism was her formation of the anti-Vietnam War movement “Sending Love to the Injured Orphans of the Vietnam War”. She witnessed firsthand the overbearing masculinity present at leftist gatherings and sought spaces dominated by women. Soon enough, she began attending ribu leftist rallies and gatherings, where she would pass out copies of her manifesto and loudly make herself heard. Other women couldn’t help but take notice of her. The next movement she began would be the Group of Fighting Women (グループ戦う女達; guruppu tatakau onnatachi). What Tanaka lacked in a college education she more than made up for through reading. She gravitated towards and devoured the literature of Marx, Sartre, Engels, and others. These influences and more would culminate in her first and most well-known manifesto, “Liberation from the Toilet” (便所からの解放; Benjo kara no kaihou). She went on to write her other manifesto “Declaration of the Liberation of Eros” (エロス解放宣言; Eros kaihou sengen). Tanaka wasn’t afraid to delve into taboo, even morally grey subjects in her writing. She called for “the revival of the womb” through political action. Her poetic flair in describing the intersections between body and leftist thought elevated her to shamanistic status. Tanaka writes in “Liberation from the Toilet”: As far as men are concerned, a woman is split into two images — either the expression of maternal love: a “mother”, or a vessel for the management of lust: a “toilet”. Part of Tanaka’s discourse focused on the intersection of women and violence. Mothers who killed their children (子殺しの女; kogoroshi no onna) were prime targets for abuse and criticism by the media. Ribu actively voiced their support for these women. While Tanaka called these women murderers, she said they were merely victims of patriarchal and capitalist systems. She avoided coloring the issue in moralistic terms, instead choosing to focus on the inherent violence in women’s sex. Tanaka’s stance on abortion followed in the same vein. It was a violent act, but unavoidable because women had no control over their bodies. At the time, abortion was illegal. In 1948 the government passed the Eugenic Protection Law allowing abortion under defined circumstances. Ribu women took to the streets to protest the perception of the government trying to control their bodies. The media often mistakenly lumped the ribu movement with the extremist Japanese Red Army. As a result, many women backed away from ribu. For ribu women, this was only another attempt by the mass media to tarnish their worth and dismiss the feminist cause. Being a leftist, feminist activist, it was inevitable for Tanaka to come face to face with other New Left groups, including the Japanese Red Army. Nagata Hiroko, leader of the sect 京浜安保共闘 (Keihin Ampo Kyoto), was Tanaka’s main point of contact. She even visited the group at their mountain encampment. Right away Tanaka knew she could never ally herself with a group so entrenched in violence. Tanaka was absolutely shocked when she learned of the purge that killed 12 people. One of the victims was a woman who was eight months pregnant. It was the memory this woman, Kaneko Michiyo, that would go on to haunt Tanaka. Nagata’s actions and participation in the purge particularly stiffened Tanaka’s belief that women were forced to violence and overcompensate for their biological sex. Ribu thought focused on the takedown of hierarchical structures members believed impeded both men and women. Tanaka’s self-insertion in the inner workings of the ribu movement rubbed many women the wrong way. This became more evident when the Group for Fighting Women, along with other ribu groups, opened the Ribu Shinjuku Center (リブ新宿センター) in 1972. The center became a commune, publishing house, and safe space for women. Women offered consultation services on abortion and divorce and organized social protests. Tanaka’s overbearing presence strained relations among the already exhausted activists running the center. Tanaka encouraged the women to write, but also took it upon herself to edit their work. In some cases, the original writer’s voice was lost underneath Tanaka’s ideals, upsetting many women. It was also difficult to understand what Tanaka was or wasn’t responsible for. It would be Tanaka’s overseas hiatus in 1975 that led to a shift in power dynamics. Tanaka wrote numerous letters to Tokyo with her ideas on how the center should function. Tanaka’s distance from the heart of the feminist ribu movement did not, as some scholars claim, herald the end of ribu. Tanaka herself, however, has stated in a conversation with famed feminist Ueno Chizuko that she believes ribu declined in 1975, partly due to her absence. The Center remained open until 1977. Tanaka herself wouldn’t return to Japan until 1979. Tanaka remained in Mexico and gave birth to a son. She ended up parting ways with the father. After returning to Japan, she lived the single-mother lifestyle as many ribu women did. During this time Tanaka gravitated away from her radical, head-on beliefs in favor of a more liberal approach to the self. After years spent campaigning for liberation of sex, Tanaka redirected her energies towards the liberation of the body. She studied Eastern medicine and became a certified acupuncturist. Tanaka may have moved on to more personal activism, but she still remained in touch with ongoing issues. During the 2007 elections for Tokyo governorship, she threw her vote in for politician Asano Shiro as part of the campaign “Women Winning for Asano!” (アサノと勝とう!女性勝手連; Asano to katou! Josei Katteren). Tanaka’s life is getting renewed attention thanks to a documentary coming out next month titled「この星は、私の星じゃない」(“This Star is Not My Star”) based on her book with the same name. At the age of 76, Tanaka shows no signs of slowing down. She continues working as an acupuncturist at a rehabilitation clinic in Hachioji. She’s also grown interested in Okinawa and the issues between civilians and the US military presence. While Tanaka certainly shouldn’t be credited as the sole face of 1970s ribu, it’s inevitable to think of her as such. She placed herself at the forefront of the movement through sheer determination. Men and women were both awed and disenchanted with Tanaka. However, none could deny her impact on the ribu movement. Nevertheless, with her captivating rhetoric, Tanaka managed to become another great feminist in a long line of hard-working Japanese feminists. Shigematsu, Setsu.

Medium.com,Society,"In Syria, the Alt-Right finds it isolationist voice",World,https://medium.com/@Ryan_Bohl/in-syria-the-alt-right-finds-it-isolationist-voice-6a0327ae087?source=topic_page---------445------------------1," For the third time, President Trump is trying to withdraw from Syria. For the third time, his own allies, including Lindsey Graham, are attacking him — and pressure is piling high on the White House to find some kind of way to remain in Syria to keep America’s allies, the Kurdish-dominated YPG, from enduring a major Turkish offensive. But I think this will be the last Syrian ‘withdrawal’ — not merely because third time’s the charm, but because as impeachment now closes in, Trump needs to build up his base’s loyalty. And there have been few greater rifts between Trump and his otherwise fanatical base than Syria. Thus to close the ranks, Trump will probably give his Alt-Right base what it has long sought in Syria — and in doing so, will help solidify their neo-isolationism as part of the Republican Party’s platform for many years to come. Syria: where the Alt-Right meets the Old Left Syria is a weird place in American politics. Its Ba’athist state ideology is rooted in anti-Israeli resistance and Arab socialism — old school planks of America’s Old Left, and ideas which, in the early days of the 2011 Syrian uprising, pulled many Left-wing Americas towards affinity with the murderous Bashar al-Assad. Noam Chomsky, amongst others, has at times defended Russian airstrikes and Assad’s own war crimes. The Old Left anti-imperialism knee jerk was predictable. What was surprising was the surge of their ideological rivals, the Alt-Right, rushing to agree with them. By 2012–13, an odd assortment of Old Left vanguards and Alt-Right activists had weaved a narrative arguing against U.S. involvement in Syria. To the Alt-Right, Syria is a symbol of everything they despise about American foreign policy. It is a country without strategic resources, like oil, making it worthless from a pure dollar standpoint. It is very far away, with Europe and America’s Middle Eastern allies absorbing its refugee crisis, making it not very urgent to the U.S homeland. And to the Alt-Right, the civil war is a battle not between the legitimate aspirations of a downtrodden population and a totalitarian government but a struggle between an authoritarian but still preferable regime facing down a horde of ‘globalist’ jihadists — flipping the whole script on who is the good guy and the bad guy. That last part is the most important in understanding the Alt Right’s fixation on Syria: to them, Assad is the “least bad” of the actors on the ground, and he ticks their boxes in a number of important ways. He is a brute but secular dictator; he, therefore, is an ally against jihadism. He is nominally anti-Israel; for the white supremacists, this is a plus. But that doesn’t totally exclude the non-white supremacists; Assad’s tacit, long-standing truce with Israel negates his rhetoric. The white supremacists focus on the de jure state of war between Syria and Israel; the rest of the Alt-Right can focus on the de facto peace now decades old. The anti-Israel rhetoric, coupled with no real follow-through, thus bolsters two planks of the Alt-Right in Assad’s favor. Assad’s enemies, meanwhile, are nothing more than anti-Christian, anti-Western jihadists created by the same nefarious forces that produced 9/11 — whether that’s the more realistic narrative of the Gulf Arab states or a shadowy, ridiculous global Illuminati cabal. All the Syrian rebel factions are just jihadists of differing stripes, their records of Assad’s war crimes mere “agiprops” created by their well-financial backers. Even if Assad isn’t exactly ideal, his enemies are the epitome of evil, however, the varying factions of the Alt-Right define that word. But more than anything, the Alt-Right is motivated by the notion that this is a blow against the Forever Wars they believe dominate American foreign policy. A scroll through Reddit’s now-quarantined /r/The_Donald reveal this strong sentiment. Comments that talk about the ‘forever war’ lead the discussion on Trump’s tweets: And it is this sentiment, far beyond the specifics of Syria, that matters. The Alt-Right is now in the bloodstream of the GOP: it is the party’s base, and will be for many years to come, even as it evolves and fractures. They may debate the specifics of isolationism, but seem unlikely to cast it aside entirely: instead, it will motivate their decisions in the GOP’s primaries and shape the party’s overall conversation towards foreign policy. That is a remarkable change in a party that just 16 years ago rallied to President George W. Bush to invade Iraq, and which ran on that wartime platform and won in 2004. Much has changed about the party, but its shift towards isolationism is perhaps is most dramatic — and leaves the world wondering just what kind of American retrenchment is steadily unfolding in front of us."

Current polls put Labour ‘just’ 11 to 13 points behind. So can Jeremy Corbyn do it again? Things are highly unpredictable and volatile but I thought one way to make an informed guess (and it’s not more than that) is to look at where Corbyn was in 2017 in the period just before the election and where he is now, potentially a few weeks out from a November election. The surge during the 2017 campaign came from Labour and Lib Dem voters who, ultimately faced with a choice between Tory and Labour, finally came round to Corbyn. His net favourability score shot up from -42 at the start of the campaign to zero by the time it was over (these figures are all from YouGov’s favourability surveys). All of the gain that Corbyn made came from those who had voted Labour or Lib Dem in 2015; none of it came from Tory voters. Corbyn’s favourability among Labour voters rose from -10 to +77, for Lib Dem voters from -53 to +10, and for Tory voters from -84 to -84. Let’s compare Corbyn’s net favourability today with where it was before the start of the election campaign in 2017: On the surface, Labour support looks broadly similar to how it did in 2017 as Labour approached the election. However in 2019 Corbyn will start 10–20 points behind where he was in 2017 with Lib Dem voters. That suggests that this time the Lib Dem voters may be harder to pull over. If we segment the Labour support further, we can look at those who feel ‘somewhat unfavourable’ and ‘very unfavourable’ towards Corbyn. Those who are ‘somewhat unfavourable’ are more likely to come back; those who are ‘very unfavourable’ will be harder to pull back. The number of Labour voters who have a ‘very unfavourable’ of Corbyn is now a few points greater than it was at the start of the 2017 election campaign. If you look at the 2017 figures before the campaign launch (February to April) the numbers are similar to where we are in 2019: we are maybe in the low 20s now rather than the mid 20s of 2017. Broadly then, there is nothing hugely different in these headline numbers. There is nothing here that indicates that Corbyn could not rise during a campaign once more but it does look like Labour voters may be a little more resistant and the Lib Dems much harder to shift. Another way of looking at the question of whether Labour can win back its voters from the Lib Dems is to look at how strongly former Labour voters are now attached to the Lib Dems. Again, the news is not terrible but it is not good for Labour. The proportion of previous Labour voters who think ‘very favourably’ of the Lib Dem leader is low (8% or below). But the proportion of them who think of Jo Swinson ‘very favourably’ is about twice as high as the proportion of them who thought of Tim Farron ‘very favourably’. On these figures it looks like Labour will struggle to squeeze the Lib Dems as effectively as they did in 2017. Things get worse when we segment support by region. Let’s start with the positive. Corbyn’s net favourability score has actually increased in one part of the country: London. His net favourability has risen from -42 to -37. The rest of the country — and the key battlegrounds where Labour needs to win seats — looks significantly worse. Outside of London, Corbyn is 8 to 10 points down across England and Wales. When you dig further into those numbers, they get worse. Among those who hold an ‘unfavourable view’ the proportion who hold a ‘very unfavourable’ view of Corbyn has also increased(outside London). The proportion of people who now hold a ‘very unfavourable’ view of Corbyn has risen in all the places where Labour needs to win and hold seats. These regional favourability ratings are among all voters but it seems reasonable to expect that the splits are reflected within the Labour and Lib Dem voters. So when we think about where the next Corbyn surge might come from it looks like the swing would be bigger in London and smaller everywhere else. So what does all this add up to -could there be another Corbyn surge? On the basis of these numbers one cannot rule it out. However Corbyn is starting from a few points lower with Labour supporters and 10–20 points lower with Lib Dems. Labour voters who have flirted with Swinson look twice as likely to stick than those who flirted with Farron. Of most concern for Labour under Corbyn is that if the surge does come, it may be in the wrong place. It is not just that more voters in the North, Midlands and Wales dislike Corbyn, the problem is the level of dislike among those voters has hardened by 10–13 points, making it much harder to win them back. So my prediction is we can’t rule out another Corbyn surge. It won’t be as big as it was. And it will be in the wrong places."
Medium.com,Society,September Shakes Up Chinese Trade Talks,World,https://medium.com/goods-services/september-shakes-up-chinese-trade-talks-ce6423ff44b4?source=topic_page---------448------------------1," The Chinese holiday is over, and the U.S.-China trade talks are scheduled to resume this week. A lot has changed in the last few weeks, potentially changing the trade talk calculus. In no particular order, the situation in Hong Kong continues to escalate. The U.S. economic data show sectorial weakness in the U.S. economy. Chinese price inflation is taking off because African Swine Fever is decimating the Chinese pig herd. Finally, the U.S. House of Representatives has started an impeachment inquiry into President Trump. Generally, the United States supports democratic regimes globally. Therefore, we’d expect the United States to support Hongkongers protesting for more democratic freedoms. If Trump sides with Hong Kong he will do so at the detriment of the trade talks. So far, Trump has remained silent, a position that is much appreciated by President Xi. If he reverses this position, it is possible Beijing would walk away from the talks altogether. Two pieces of data came out the first week of October and the numbers were underwhelming at best. First, the manufacturing sector is officially in recession. The manufacturing sector was supposed to benefit from Trump’s tariffs, however, the sectorial recession brings into question how successful tariffs are at bringing back manufacturing jobs. Second, the unemployment rate fell to a 50 year low in October. But low unemployment isn’t pushing up wages and the number of new jobs created is slowing. The strength of the U.S. economy hinges on the consumer. If consumer spending slows, the U.S. economy could move south very quickly. If the economy turns, Trump might be more inclined to accept an interim trade deal with China to ease pressure on the economy. So far the consumer hasn’t been directly impacted by the tariffs. However, new duties in October and December will undoubtedly result in higher retail prices for everything from electronics to apparel. The Chinese government is trying to control food inflation caused by skyrocketing pork prices. For over a year, the Chinese have battled African Swine Fever (ASF), a disease that has killed over a third of all Chinese pigs. Pork is a huge part of the Chinese diet. To manage prices, the government released frozen reserves, removed tariffs on U.S. pork, and some local governments are subsidizing pork prices. If the situation keeps worsening, China may be forced to negotiate with the United States to keep peace at home. The U.S. House of Representatives started an impeachment inquiry into Trump’s dealings with Ukraine. The Representatives are considering obstruction charges. China has taken notice. Less than a week before the next round of discussions between the United States and China, Vice Premier, Liu He, the lead negotiator for China announced that China will not offer to reform its industrial policy or government subsidies. This state comes after the impeachment inquiry started. Government reforms are a central issue for the Trump administration and specifically the main focus of U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer, the United States’ lead negotiator. This may leave the two sides at an impasse. China has been in Lighthizers’ crosshairs for decades. Before becoming the U.S. Trade Representative, he had thirty years of experience as an international prosecutor. Most people negotiating with China accept short-term wins instead of long-term structural changes. Lighthizer does not want to fall into this trap that has plagued his predecessors. The talks broke down in May when Trump accused the Chinese of balking in the eleventh hour. Originally, China agreed to make changes to industrial policy and government subsidies. Then China pulled back and only agreed to purchase more agricultural products. China took back its long-term promise and instead gave the Trump team a short-term win. Trump responded with more tariffs, to apply additional pressure on China. Presumably, Trump had unwavering support from Lighthizer for this decision. If China will not put government reforms on the table now, then there might not be much to talk about unless Trump has had a change of heart since May."
Medium.com,Society,Trump Greenlights Turkish Invasion of Northern Syria,World,https://medium.com/@four4thefire/trump-greenlights-turkish-invasion-of-northern-syria-12e6db0e546c?source=topic_page---------449------------------1," Sunday night brought an extraordinary development in foreign policy from the White House: This has been a desire of Turkey for 30+ years, and had been discouraged by the US as late as Saturday when Secretary of State Mike Pompeo stated that “we’ve made clear that this conflict shouldn’t be militarized.” President Trump, however, has been wanting to do this very thing for some time: The problem here is the president either doesn’t understand or care that what Erdogan is going to do has nothing to do with ISIS. The Turkish military will sally forth into territory the SDF and other groups are not going to willingly give up, and when they push back and defend themselves Erdogan will have his excuse for the slaughter of them he wants. Anyone who doesn’t happily accept their new Turkish overlords will be deemed a “terrorist” and dealt with. This is the oldest trick in the book for dictators like Erdogan, to make sure the men, women, and children who will be cleansed from the newly acquired territory is something to prop up the regime that is having issues at home. At his recent UN speech, Erdogan waved around maps of the new “safe zone” borders that expand Turkey’s border by nearly 20 miles, while declaring they can “easily resettle the 1 to 2 million refugees” that will need to be moved. He neglects to mention the part that they are not going to go willingly, and his government cannot even control the rebellious Kurdish factions inside existing Turkish borders. What will follow is a whole lot of bloodshed that will spawn another generation of it to come after. As for the United States, it is a foreign policy disaster. Another American ally left twisting in the wind, very bad people empowered by spur of the moment and poorly-planned decision making from the White House, and no discernable plan or direction in America’s projection of interests to the rest of the world other than how the president feels at any given moment, or worse whoever the last foreign dictator he talked to that he wanted to impress. Folks can rant and rave about “America First” and “Endless Wars” all they want, but rhetoric — especially partisan rhetoric — doesn’t mean crap once you are talking about international affairs. These decisions have generational impacts on millions of people, and should be treated as such, not just tweeted about. All this to benefit enemies who hates us, as well: the despicable dictator Erdogan, his enabler in Vladimir Putin, and their allies, Iran. Oh, and Turkey is buddying up to China and getting some of the lost support it used to get from the United States from places like Qatar. God help the 2 million people in Northeast Syria, for President Trump just made sure we will not only break recent agreements and stand idly by, but make lifelong enemies out of most of them in the process. That is, those of the 2 million who survive what is coming from the Turks, the soon to be let loose ISIS fighters, and whoever else joins in, long enough to hate us for it."
Medium.com,Society,The Boris Johnson we know is years in the making,World,https://medium.com/@josephcrossleyemail/the-boris-johnson-we-know-is-years-in-the-making-41e067775abc?source=topic_page---------450------------------1," Thirty-seven years ago a schoolmaster at Eton College sent Stanley Johnson a letter. Inside, it contained several warnings about his young son, Boris. Boris, the schoolmaster wrote, had “neglected” his academic studies, “adopted a disgracefully cavalier attitude” to his classical studies, and seemed “affronted when criticised.” We learnt this all when Rory Stewart, to mark his “resignation” from the Conservative Party, read this letter out at Letters Live 2019 in London. It shows us the Boris we know isn’t a new creation, brought forth by the Brexit era. He’s a product four decades in the making. His disregard for our political conventions, his disdain for the role of Parliament and the courts in our political system, and his aristocratic confidence that he is right to rule show the marks of that boy at Eton. All grown up, but hardly different. He saw himself, too, as an inevitable Prime Minister. When young Boris’s sister was once asked what he wanted to be when he grew up, he answered “king of the world.” His entire life, he has not just seen himself as deserving of power but destined for it. Now that he’s got everything he wanted, he’s holding onto it the only way he knows how. He can’t respond to criticism as his predecessors did — Cameron with upper-class confidence, May with indignant denial that her government was falling to pieces — so Boris shuts all criticism down. Parliament, he prorogues. He’ll “respect the judiciary”, of course, but he “profoundly disagrees” with their rulings. He lies to the Queen, and to the people, to prevent the conversation from focusing on real issues; the Irish Border, his relationship with Jennifer Arcuri, tax cuts to the wealthiest when more than four million people in the UK live in poverty. Boris has mastered the art of the right-wing populist, finding every new way in the book to stop us talking. Either you can’t get a word in with Boris, or he leaves you struggling with a mess of falsehoods that bury you so deep you’ve no time to work through it all. This isn’t democratic. That’s the point. And now that we can see what Boris has been like all his life, it’s clear democracy is the last thing he wants. That’s not to say he dreams about running a dictatorship. Men like Boris dream of the in-between system, the “illiberal democracy” style of Viktor Orban in Hungary and his fellow autocrats. Boris wants the people to vote for him, but he also wants to courts and the press to only say nice things about him. And it’d be nice if he had a bit of sway over what they said. He’ll keep Parliament around, but won’t really listen. Won’t really let them contradict him too much. He’s worried. If he lets people start talking, they’ll start asking the wrong questions. People might wonder how we can trust a man who declared “I don’t want an election, you don’t want an election, nobody wants an election”, then turned around a matter of days later and charged the opposition with running a “zombie parliament” (as Attorney General Geoffrey Cox put it) because they won’t run elections. That and a million more questions might come up if Boris lets us talk. Boris doesn’t like our democratic system. It was our job to see that coming, and to our collective credit, most of us did. But for those who had their doubts about his critics, or for anyone who decided we should at least give the man a chance, there are no more excuses. Since his childhood, this man has had designs on running Britain like his own little fiefdom. He wants to be significant and to be remembered. He wants ‘Johnson’ to stand alongside ‘Churchill’, ‘Thatcher’, and ‘Blair’. It doesn’t have to be that way if we rally against him. Show this man that he has no more the right to be Prime Minister than anyone else does — perhaps even less right, given his track record. We’ll always have people like Boris Johnson. At least as long as we’ve got ourselves a weird semi-aristocracy of public school and Oxbridge boys brought up to be proper and successful Tories. The correct response towards them is not to accept their continued existence or to roll over and give them power. We need to stand up against them. That means supporting an anti-Johnson unity government (yes, Jo Swinson, even you) and standing firm against his plot to force Brexit at all costs. It might also mean, scariest of all, playing politics to secure a majority for the opposition at new elections (yes, Corbynistas, even you). Above all, it means denying Boris the job and the power he thinks is owed to him, and making him and every other born-to-rule Tory learn that they have to work for the right to run the government. Because that’s what will hurt them the most."
Medium.com,Society,Philippines Declares Polio Epidemic and Launches New Immunization Campaign,World,https://medium.com/@themillennialsource/philippines-declares-polio-epidemic-and-launches-new-immunization-campaign-ae09447693ea?source=topic_page---------451------------------1," On September 19, 2019, the Philippines announced the re-emergence of polio within the country. The announcement came 19 years after the WHO declared the infectious disease eradicated on the islands in 2000. The announcement came following two confirmed cases of polio, a 3-year-old girl from Lanao del Sur in the Davao region, and a 5-year old boy from Laguna province, south of Manila. In addition, the poliovirus was detected in samples taken from Davao waterways and the sewage in Manila. According to the Philippines Department of Health, a single confirmed polio case or the collection of two positive, genetically linked environmental samples from separate locations is considered an epidemic in a polio-free country. Polio is a highly infectious disease that primarily affects children under five years old. It can cause irreversible paralysis, and 5–10% of paralysis cases are fatal due to loss of function of breathing muscles. Polio spreads by direct contact and through the poliovirus entering the environment via the feces of infected patients. There is currently no known cure for the disease, but it can be prevented by immunization. Oral polio vaccination is safe to administer and highly effective in preventing polio. However, the WHO and UNICEF estimate that immunization coverage in the Philippines has been dropping in recent years, from 88% in 2013 to 70% in 2018, far below the recommended rate of 95%. Low immunization coverage is also linked to the country’s measles and dengue fever epidemics, which the country declared earlier in 2019. The Philippines has not fully recovered from a 2017 vaccination scandal that has been linked to the deaths of at least three children, causing national panic. In 2016, the Philippines started administering the world’s first dengue fever vaccines to high-risk children. Dengue fever is one of the most common viruses spread by mosquitoes; the Philippines reported 200,000 cases in 2013. The maker of the vaccine, French pharmaceutical company Sanofi, projected that the vaccine could reduce the number of dengue fever cases by 24% over five years. The campaign ended suddenly in November 2017, when Sanofi released new research revealing an alarming issue with the vaccine. For those who had previously had dengue fever, the vaccine worked well. However, children who had no previous exposure to dengue fever were still catching the disease after vaccination. Far worse, the vaccine actually increased the risk of deadly complications for these children, resulting in multiple deaths — possibly far more than the three officially reported. The WHO has acknowledged that of the 830,000 children who received the Sanofi vaccine, about 100,000 are now at elevated risk. The scandal led to widespread public distrust of all vaccines. According to the Journal of Human Vaccines & Immunotherapeutics, confidence in the safety of vaccines among Filipinos dropped from 82% in 2015 to just 21% in 2018. The WHO has offered repeated reassurances that other types of vaccines are safe and effective, estimating that immunization prevents 2 to 3 million deaths each year. Unfortunately, the WHO previously endorsed universal use of the Sanofi vaccine on Filipino children. Rebuilding public trust will take time. In April 2019, amid the measles and dengue fever outbreaks on the islands, the Philippines Department of Health joined with the WHO and UNICEF in the #VaccinesWork campaign. The campaign aims to combat the downward trend in vaccination rates in the country. In response to the recent outbreak, the Philippines will launch a polio immunization campaign in October 2019, with the goal of providing oral polio vaccinations to every child under five years old in high-risk areas. The Department of Health is also closely monitoring the environment throughout the country to detect any presence of poliovirus. “I strongly urge parents, health workers, and local governments to fully participate in the synchronized polio vaccination, and practice good personal hygiene,” Philippines Department of Health Secretary Francisco Duque III said in a statement on Twitter. According to the WHO, since the introduction of the polio vaccine in 1988, cases have decreased by over 99.9% worldwide, from 350,000 that year to only 33 in 2018. However, as the current situation in the Philippines shows, a resurgence of the disease can occur anytime the vaccination rate declines."
Medium.com,Society,Betrayal from Washington,World,https://medium.com/@steverussell_9575/betrayal-from-washington-78100b49d216?source=topic_page---------452------------------1," became public in December of 2018. The next day brought a resignation letter from former Marine Corps General James “Mad Dog” Mattis. Announcing his departure as Secretary of Defense and, even more importantly, the indispensable office in the Trump White House known as “Adult in the Room,” Mattis wrote: One core belief I have always held is that our strength as a nation is inextricably linked to the strength of our unique and comprehensive system of alliances and partnerships. While the US remains the indispensable nation in the free world, we cannot protect our interests or serve that role effectively without maintaining strong alliances and showing respect to those allies. Mattis was plainly still trying to defend the “free world” while serving a POTUS who started diplomatic fights with Mexico, Canada, Germany, Great Britain, and France while expressing personal admiration for the leadership of Vladimir Putin, Rodrigo Duterte, Kim Jong-Un, Mohammad bin Salman, and Recep Tayyip Erdoğan. In less than a year, all the adults have been evicted from the White House, and nobody familiar with Kurdish history was available to talk Mr. Trump down after he was once more impressed by the strong leadership of the Turkish autocrat, Mr. Erdoğan. The announcement went out on Sunday and there were reports early Monday morning that U.S. troops were withdrawing. There are under 1,000 U.S. troops remaining, and their primary function is to discourage attacks on the Kurds with their ability to call in air strikes. The troops on the ground are — if possible — even more outraged than Pentagon brass. Any veteran who has served in combat understands the feelings that develop for the people with whom you share danger. Now, feelings be damned, we abandon the Kurds. When the U.S. invaded Iraq, the power centers were Sunni, Shi’a, and Kurds — two based on religion and one on ethnicity. Only the Kurds stood with us both times.

When we ordered and policed no-fly zones, the reason was our charge that Saddam Hussein was “using poison gas on his own people.” Mr. Hussein, if called upon to defend himself, would have said: Those are not my people. Those are Kurds. Now we betray the Kurds. When U.S. troops chased ISIS across the border from Iraq into Syria, Barack Obama was charged with “invading another country” in spite of the fact that the Syrian government had long since lost control of the country and was in no position to police ISIS even if Bashar al-Assad had been so inclined. The U.S. response to the objections was to train and supply combined forces of Syrian rebels and Kurds. Those forces, with U.S. and European air support, became the tip of the spear that ousted ISIS from the real estate where it had located its terrorist “caliphate.” Now we betray the Kurds. Mr. Trump’s foreign policy is ahistorical because he knows no history and will not read a briefing book. Lacking conventional policy anchors, he makes policy by personal relationships with foreign leaders. Among foreign leaders, he gets along better with autocrats than with small d democrats. Mr. Trump’s personal relationship of admiration for the Turkish autocrat Recep Tayyip Erdoğan secured action in a weekend telephone call to actualize the Kurds’ worst nightmare. We are feeding them to the Turkish army after they served us so faithfully against ISIS, taking up a fight our government promised to win. Our POTUS tweeted out his view of the future, disclaiming any responsibility for the problem that many of the hardest core ISIS fighters are being kept as POWs by our Kurdish allies: Turkey, Europe, Syria, Iran, Iraq, Russia and the Kurds will now have to …figure the situation out, and what they want to do with the captured ISIS fighters in their “neighborhood.” And now we betray the Kurds. U.S. troops on the ground are outraged, U.S. generals are outraged, and U.S. voters ought to be outraged. Good job, Kurds. Sorry you took so many dead and wounded for us. We wish you the best when the Turks show up to destroy you. In what value system is this not evil? “Betrayal” is a hard word. Do you have a better one?"

Medium.com,Society,Misogyny and Armenophobic hate underpins the furore over Armine Harutyunyan,World,https://medium.com/@oc.media.social/misogyny-and-armenophobic-hate-underpins-the-furore-over-armine-harutyunyan-4cb09436d127?source=topic_page---------454------------------1," The public outrage over Armine Harutyunyan walking down the runway at a Gucci fashion show reveals deep-seated sexism and anti-Armenian sentiment in Georgian society and shows the failures of Georgia’s media. While the Gucci fashion show on 22 September, in which models dressed in outfits ‘inspired’ by mental illness, could have inspired a discussion about the commodification of a serious social issue, instead it was the appearance of a particular model that caused a firestorm of outrage in Georgia. It was the presence of Armine Harutyunyan, a Yerevan-based artist, on the Gucci runway that sparked consternation among Georgians online; Harutyunyan was criticised for not being conventionally attractive enough to participate in the fashion industry, much less a Gucci runway show. But the criticism was not only limited to the young woman’s appearance, it was also deeply charged with anti-Armenian animus, a deeply rooted issue in Georgian society. The furore arose after a number of Georgian news articles were published that claimed that Harutyunyan had become the face of Gucci — she had not, she simply walked down the runway in a single Gucci show. The articles did not seem to intend to foment attacks on her, however, by reporting only fragmented information and not reporting the wider context, the emphasis was thereby put on her physical characteristics and her ethnicity. The article by Fortuna is an archetypical example: the headline reads: ‘A 23-year-old Armenian girl became a model for Gucci’. The rest of the article is focused on the admiration that Harutyunyan has received from Armenians. ‘Armenians write online that Armine is remarkably natural and original in her beauty’, the article reads. Neither Fortuna nor the majority of articles initially published about Harutyunyan spelt the young woman’s surname correctly — spelling it ‘Arutian’ (არუთიანი) instead of ‘Harutyunyan’ (ჰარუთიუნიანი). This basic mistake reveals that this news was published not to inform the public, but rather to be cheap sensationalism and clickbait. ‘Is it even a woman?’ read one dehumanising comment from a Georgian social media user. The overwhelming majority of comments on Georgian social media attacked Harutyunyan’s appearance from a perspective that upheld traditional and sexist beauty standards. Many of the comments underlined the users’ beliefs that an appearance that deviates from traditional norms could be neither beautiful nor feminine. ‘How can someone have a relationship with her?’ read another comment, highlighting the widespread view that a woman’s worth and sexuality is tied to their value and subordination to the desires of men. While misogyny was certainly a common sentiment in online discussions, there was also a pronounced trend of Armenophobia. ‘Armenians now have someone or something to be proud of’, one comment read. ‘Why does she overshadow the Milan Fashion week and not Ararat’, read another comment, notably combining both ethnic hatred and sexism. But it was not just average Facebook users who worked themselves into an angry lather over the issue. Nika Gvaramia, TV journalist, executive director of TV channel Mtavari Arkhi, and former government minister also decided to offer his opinion. Framing his comments as a defence of freedom of speech, he began his post by writing: ‘Man, this Armenian model girl sure is ugly’. He continued by stating that sharing this unsolicited opinion about Armine Harutyunyan was not, in fact, ‘bullying’ and that calling it as such was nothing more than ‘political correctness’ ‘gone wrong’. He further wrote that by becoming a public figure she opened herself up to criticism. ‘Nobody entered the model’s personal space by going to her home in Tsakhnadzor [sic] and taking photographs’, his post read. ‘Her presentation was made public, with a message — see how beautiful and natural she is.’ Despite Gvaramia’s pretension that his post was a social critique, the reality is that it was simply another drop in a deluge of posts that help reproduce harmful attitudes within Georgian society. Worse still, the post also exhibited a pernicious attitude towards the nature of freedom of speech. Gvaramia presents himself as a liberal and as someone who stands for the rights of marginalised groups. However, his deployment of the term ‘political correctness’ to criticise what he perceives to be a limitation of freedom of speech creates the notion that liberalism and hateful opinions towards marginalised groups and people can co-exist — so long as such opinions are expressed under the aegis of ‘freedom of speech’. Considering that Gvaramia is a public figure with a broad audience, his regressive comments have a significant social impact and are a failure on his part to exercise the role which he has carved out for himself, that of a liberal critic of Georgian society. If he had been responsible and put thought into the matter, he might have written about the toxic norms, control mechanisms, and generally oppressive character of the fashion industry. Instead, he reproduced the body shaming and the anti-Armenian sentiments which are all too common in Georgia. Gvaramia said Armine was from ‘Tsakhnadzor’, in an attempt to portray her as a ‘provincial’, a ‘villager’. The fact that he could not even spell the name of the town correctly (it is ‘Tsaghkadzor’, not ‘Tsakhnadzor’) combined with the fact that Armine is not even from Tsaghkadzor points to the lack of care and the non-progressive nature of his role as a public ‘progressive’. While recent nationalist sentiments in Georgia have focused on socially excluding variously the LGBTQ+ community, migrants from the Middle East, and Muslims — the case of Armine Harutyunyan shows that xenophobia towards national minorities still has deep roots. As ethnic minorities still face systematic and structural oppression in their everyday lives, it is incumbent upon the media and media figures to take up their role and responsibility as a pillar of a fair and democratic society and help stop such injustice instead of simply stoking the fires of hate. The public outrage over Armine Harutyunyan walking down the runway at a Gucci fashion show reveals deep-seated sexism and anti-Armenian sentiment in Georgian society and shows the failures of Georgia’s media. While the Gucci fashion show on 22 September, in which models dressed in outfits ‘inspired’ by mental illness, could have inspired a discussion about the commodification of a serious social issue, instead it was the appearance of a particular model that caused a firestorm of outrage in Georgia.

Many of the comments underlined the users’ beliefs that an appearance that deviates from traditional norms could be neither beautiful nor feminine. ‘How can someone have a relationship with her?’ read another comment, highlighting the widespread view that a woman’s worth and sexuality is tied to their value and subordination to the desires of men. While misogyny was certainly a common sentiment in online discussions, there was also a pronounced trend of Armenophobia. ‘Armenians now have someone or something to be proud of’, one comment read. ‘Why does she overshadow the Milan Fashion week and not Ararat’, read another comment, notably combining both ethnic hatred and sexism. But it was not just average Facebook users who worked themselves into an angry lather over the issue. Nika Gvaramia, TV journalist, executive director of TV channel Mtavari Arkhi, and former government minister also decided to offer his opinion. Framing his comments as a defence of freedom of speech, he began his post by writing: ‘Man, this Armenian model girl sure is ugly’. He continued by stating that sharing this unsolicited opinion about Armine Harutyunyan was not, in fact, ‘bullying’ and that calling it as such was nothing more than ‘political correctness’ ‘gone wrong’. He further wrote that by becoming a public figure she opened herself up to criticism. ‘Nobody entered the model’s personal space by going to her home in Tsakhnadzor [sic] and taking photographs’, his post read. ‘Her presentation was made public, with a message — see how beautiful and natural she is.’ Despite Gvaramia’s pretension that his post was a social critique, the reality is that it was simply another drop in a deluge of posts that help reproduce harmful attitudes within Georgian society. Worse still, the post also exhibited a pernicious attitude towards the nature of freedom of speech. Gvaramia presents himself as a liberal and as someone who stands for the rights of marginalised groups. However, his deployment of the term ‘political correctness’ to criticise what he perceives to be a limitation of freedom of speech creates the notion that liberalism and hateful opinions towards marginalised groups and people can co-exist — so long as such opinions are expressed under the aegis of ‘freedom of speech’. Considering that Gvaramia is a public figure with a broad audience, his regressive comments have a significant social impact and are a failure on his part to exercise the role which he has carved out for himself, that of a liberal critic of Georgian society. If he had been responsible and put thought into the matter, he might have written about the toxic norms, control mechanisms, and generally oppressive character of the fashion industry. Instead, he reproduced the body shaming and the anti-Armenian sentiments which are all too common in Georgia. Gvaramia said Armine was from ‘Tsakhnadzor’, in an attempt to portray her as a ‘provincial’, a ‘villager’. The fact that he could not even spell the name of the town correctly (it is ‘Tsaghkadzor’, not ‘Tsakhnadzor’) combined with the fact that Armine is not even from Tsaghkadzor points to the lack of care and the non-progressive nature of his role as a public ‘progressive’. While recent nationalist sentiments in Georgia have focused on socially excluding variously the LGBTQ+ community, migrants from the Middle East, and Muslims — the case of Armine Harutyunyan shows that xenophobia towards national minorities still has deep roots.

Medium.com,Society,"Unfortunately, temporary settlements are not temporary",World,https://medium.com/swlh/unfortunately-temporary-settlements-are-not-temporary-cad1a4641a25?source=topic_page---------455------------------1," The statistics are clear. According to an internal UNHCR report, “The average time refugees spend in camps is 17 years.” Let that number sink in a bit……Globally, millions of displaced people are waiting in these camps until they can either return home, be integrated into a host country, or ultimately be resettled. In the case of refugees displaced due to regional conflicts, there is often no foreseeable end to decade long wars. And as richer nations turn their backs on these refugees, the world’s refugee population find themselves in a waiting pattern where temporary can seem permanent. Lest we forget about people who are displaced from changing climate. Entire communities are suffering from the result of natural disasters and the consequences of climate change, destroying their communities and forcing them to leave their homes in search of new beginnings. In a most recent example, the unprecedented destruction caused by Hurricane Dorian, has left an estimated 14,000 people displaced in Grand Bahama and Abaco islands of the Bahamas. Between 2017-2018, California’s wildfires destroyed over 24,000 homes. What’s immediately glaring is the number of growing displaced persons is increasing faster than the world can respond. British architect, Ian Davis, examines contemporary and historic experiences with providing shelter in the immediate aftermath of natural disasters in his 1976 book, Shelter After Disaster. Relief is crucial, but in the longer term, as Davis describes it, relief can be the enemy of reconstruction. The more resources that are poured into temporary arrangements, the less that are available for reconstruction. Problems with temporary camps and fabrications When people stay for so long, the bareness of camps, their lack of services, sanitation, and their segregation from the surrounding society become chronic problems. These transitory spaces have varying quality, efficiency and environmental conditions and present many challenges to residents and host countries. Camps have been known to present hazards to health through the transmission of disease and illnesses like Cholera. Issues around income, security, justice, as well as mental health, remain a constant factor in the daily lives of the displaced population. There are beacons of success, such as the Kilis in Turkey or Kakuma Camp in Kenya, with qualities like modern container housing, monthly stipends, and sustainable farming practices, that create a much higher quality of life. But given that camps are unlikely to be truly temporary, why do developed nations continue to fund them rather than allocate resources to more permanent solutions? Why isn’t the current approach toward aid designed for longer term solutions, which if managed well — has proven to benefit local economies and urban environments? Possible solution While the issues stated above have been prevalent for decades, what modern tech solutions can be utilized to create meaningful impact? Non-profits like New Story, a startup founded in 2014, work on the problem of building housing quickly, and are pioneering solutions to combat access to adequate shelters. New Story partnered with construction technology company ICON and together have developed a 3D printer designed to print homes where they’re needed most. This year they’ve built, improved and modified their Vulcan 1 (the first 3D printer designed to print homes), and with the Vulcan 2, plan to print the world’s first 3D printed community. A single home can be built in 24hrs. Sounds crazy, right? New Story operates on the motto “Crazy until it’s not”. Using in-house built mobile surveying software, New Story gathers data from the field to help us learn about the individuals and communities they are serving. The software is designed to be simple but effective, and functions with or without internet connectivity. Side note: I’d love to learn more about the engineering of software for field data collection, as these techniques could be interesting when thinking about cases for software use offline or in rural areas without connectivity. One such case for field data software is in building out and modernizing contract tracing for the spread of infectious diseases, as mentioned in my previous article. In addition to pioneering these modern housing solutions, New Story plans to share their knowledge base with other nonprofit organizations and governments, so collectively shelters can be built faster, better, and stronger. Conclusion Every year the statistics of displaced persons are growing at a faster rate. According to New Story, “an estimated 3 billion people will be living without access to adequate shelter by 2050 — a 200% increase over three decades.” The current solutions address the refugee and displaced persons crisis as a temporary issue, when in reality families could live an extended period of their lives in a displaced state. Considering deploying aid resources toward more innovative and permanent infrastructure is a starting point — since we know that these temporary settlements are not actually temporary."
Medium.com,Society,The Future of A.I. Is (Probably) Chinese,World,https://onezero.medium.com/the-future-of-a-i-is-probably-chinese-ab6a8cf5c927?source=topic_page---------456------------------1," he Sino-American relationship has been quite a roller coaster this year, courtesy of the belligerent occupant of the White House. With its technical and operational superiority in 5G mobile networks (the vital infrastructure for technologies like A.I. and the Internet of Things), Huawei might be an avatar for China itself: ambitious, future-focused, and a serious threat to U.S. exceptionalism. The deluge of American complaints about Huawei being a national security risk (due to its links to the Chinese state) should be recognized for what it is: cover for the United States to engage in economic warfare, throwing its significant weight around to help ensure Huawei is blacklisted across the globe. The desperation of the U.S. efforts reflects a cold truth about the international competition in technology, and A.I. in particular: China is opening up a lead. Following their public commitment in 2017 to develop world leadership in A.I. by 2030, China has backed up its strategy with several billion dollars’ worth of funding and a cohesive bureaucratic effort to manage the plan’s execution. This outpouring of investment is already bearing tangible fruit, from cutting-edge computer vision technology to new kinds of autonomous drone swarms. With the benefit of a command-and-control economy, China has created an environment tailored to provide as few barriers possible to technology companies. Rules like data privacy and antitrust are only selectively enforced by the state; as with many things in China, there is one rule for friends of the Party and another for the rest. This is all bright news for China’s champions of A.I. development: Baidu, Tencent, and Alibaba. Not only do they enjoy the fruits of the investment tethered to the Chinese 2030 strategy, but they are also able to develop their technology without scrutiny from a hostile media. Data is food for A.I. systems. Just two years since that 2017 announcement, a wide range of indicators herald the success of China’s efforts so far. PwC has predicted that A.I. will account for a $16 trillion boost to the global economy by 2030, with almost half of that coming from the Chinese economy — worth a staggering 26% boost to the Chinese GDP. In the private sector last year, Chinese firms attracted more VC funding than American funds for the first time ever. A majority of the world’s unicorns (startups worth more than $1 billion) now come from China, which has 14 A.I. unicorns building everything from autonomous vehicles and smart city technology to drones and health care technology. There is another element to the explosive growth of Chinese A.I. technology: the sheer amount of data generated by China’s 1.4 billion citizens. Data is food for A.I. systems. A.I. extract patterns from pools of data, and more data means more accuracy and efficiency. Luckily for China’s nascent A.I. industry, there is no place on the planet with as much data as China. Aside from the size of the population, over half of all people living in China access the internet regularly via smartphones. Smartphones produce much more data than desktop computers, due to the number of sensors they have and how their owners tend to carry them around all day. With support from the state to the tune of over $50 billion, a purposefully impotent regulatory regime, and the sheer quantity of available data, it’s easy to see how the growth of Chinese A.I. has been so meteoric. On the other hand, Google and its mother company Alphabet can boast strong evidence that Silicon Valley retains the world’s foremost A.I. Just last month, it published a study in the journal Nature touting results of an A.I. system that can reportedly detect signs of acute kidney disease 48 hours before human doctors. Through its autonomous driving arm, Waymo, Google has a credible claim to the world’s most advanced driverless cars. In Seattle, Amazon has carved out superiority in retail A.I. with Amazon Go, its ambitious plan for autonomous stores (the company is targeting 3,000 openings in the next two years). The world’s biggest technology companies (Amazon, Alphabet, Apple) are all from the United States, and all boast cutting-edge A.I. Of course, the United States also has an advantage in the education sector, with most of the world’s top universities for computer science. It’s likely that a research team at Stanford, or at Alphabet, will be the first with a seismic breakthrough towards something like artificial general intelligence (human-level intelligence that is broad and adaptable). However, for all of Silicon Valley’s technological pre-eminence to date, the technology giants face mounting challenges tied to the grim outlook for technology policy over the next few years. The United States is embroiled in political gridlock. Congress has stalled entirely under both President Trump and President Obama before him, with parties ostensibly in power unable to pass most of their legislating agenda. Even then, A.I. is hardly a political priority for either party. The only political candidate really stressing the need for the US to have a dedicated plan for A.I. is the lonely figure of Andrew Yang. The contrast with China, a country putting much of its considerable resources behind a national A.I. strategy, could not be more stark. And make no mistake: even though the United States is no state-controlled economy, the government plays an important role in managing the corporate environment that Google and Amazon have to navigate. While Chinese technology champions benefit from their country’s patronage, the ones in the United States are under government attack. Trump’s tiffs with Amazon (over Jeff Bezos’ ownership of the Washington Post, a “Fake News” staple) and Google (over a perceived anti-conservative bias) have hammered the companies’ stock prices and forced them onto the defensive. The Republicans have certainly shredded regulations, which should suit the tech giants, but they have also slashed funding for research and development. The Department of Defense remains a large source of funding for innovation (this is, after all, the organization that invented the internet), but “only” for about $2 billion — far less than the $50 billion on offer to companies in China. The election of a Democrat in November next year might make matters worse. The bookmaker’s favorite to be Democratic nominee, Elizabeth Warren, wants to break up Google, Amazon, and Facebook — making Trump’s attacks look insignificant by comparison, and potentially compromising those companies’ expensive A.I. research programs. In any scenario, it is difficult to see how the regulatory and political environment for U.S. technology companies will improve in the immediate future. By no means are Amazon and Google likely to implode anytime soon — but in a context of intense competition with dynamic Chinese companies, these challenges might be enough to see China take a decisive technological lead. If China possesses the world’s best deep learning algorithms, we can expect those algorithms to absorb new information and grow at a faster rate over time than any other A.I. It really matters if the world’s leading A.I. comes out of computer labs in Shenzhen, rather than Silicon Valley. Particularly given the capabilities A.I. is expected to offer within the next few years, let alone decades, we should all be wary about what it would mean if Xi Jinping (now set to be president of China for life) had access to the best of this technology. China is already deploying facial recognition A.I. to track Uighurs, a minority group of mostly Muslims facing persecution by the state. More advanced A.I. will only strengthen the country’s ability to enforce authoritarian control, likely with terrifying consequences for minority groups. A technological advantage in A.I. would create the risk of unstoppable cyber attacks — a taste of this was delivered recently by Chinese hackers, targeting U.S. financial services and utilities. More advanced A.I. would give China more capacity for censorship, amplify their naval power, and enable greater persecution of political dissidents. Even worse, developing true A.I. supremacy might amount to a compounding advantage — the most advanced A.I. teaches itself through machine learning. If China possesses the world’s best deep learning algorithms, we can expect those algorithms to absorb new information and grow at a faster rate over time than any other A.I. The stakes could not be much higher. The fight over Huawei may prove to be an early sign of the technological fallout to come."
Medium.com,Society,The (Court) Historian and His Library,World,https://medium.com/@abyasun/the-court-historian-and-his-library-9bf1f19f646f?source=topic_page---------457------------------1," F
or Turks of every walks of life and social creed, Ilber Ortayli is a household name known even by teens. His lifelong immersion in history and linguistics endeared him to the public as an intellectual sage, if sometimes haughty and self-righteous, and made him a polyglot of a rare type in Turkey. During his television programs and appearances, his outlook smacks of smugness and aloofness buttressed by a strong sense of elitism. Ortayli’s rise to national fame from academic obscurity came after his expertise and reputation on the Ottoman history extended beyond the confines of the tight-knitted academic world. Imparatorlugun En Uzun Yuzyili (The Longest Century of the Empire) still remains his magnum opus, and in it, he exhibits a combination of lucid analysis and laborious research over the roots of the Ottoman decline in the face of internal and external challenges during the 19th century. His academic credentials, however, are not without controversy as many historians regard him as a charlatan rather than a well-established historian with a great pedigree. Despite the disunity and discord over his credentials and self-embellished style, what made him charming was his unswerving opposition to President Erdogan’s anti-democratic policies. When asked by a female TV reporter about the government’s grand project of building a new Turkey, his response was blunt and profane. “Bullshit, they can build nothing with this mindset. Let them eat their own shit.” In his bluntness, laid his deep skepticism toward the intellectual capabilities of the government staff for such an arduous task. His answer became a social media hit. Ortayli, who publicly had a skeptical view, tinged with elitism, of the Erdogan administration, baffled his large group of fans, if not blind disciples, when he announced to donate his gargantuan library to President Erdogan’s palace last year. The turnaround came as a betrayal and shock to millions of people who frequently locked on to screen to watch this history guru, even though they did not agree with everything he said. Ortayli, for many people, was seen as something of a last stand against a science-mocking team of rulers. His surrender signified the melting space for independent-minded intellectuals and critics of these troubling times. I was shocked as well. Ortayli was not a court historian and he never got along well with them. But he ended up being one of them in a self-negating move that would go down in public memory as a betrayal. But the riddle is not just the donation of books. It is who he is leaving his most valuable treasure. Imitating the presidential library format of presidents in the U.S., the Turkish ruling elites came up with the same idea to burnish the Turkish president’s image as a book lover in the same fashion. But if Ortayli’s sympathy-inducing public tantrums on TV against unlettered people defined who he was, leaving his most valuable items to a man who was never known to seriously have engaged with books would be the most brutal ironies of his life and our time. Ali Bulac, a journalist and writer, recalls from his days as an advisor to Erdogan while he was Istanbul mayor in the mid-1990s that the incumbent president had a strong aversion against even some 30-page-long book summaries. Convinced that the first Islamist mayor of Istanbul should get familiarity with world politics and history from an intellectual point of view, Bulac unsuccessfully tried to persuade Erdogan to read some of the books he selected for him. He never managed to set Erdogan reading as the new mayor always found an excuse to occupy himself with the demands of his job; going to the opening of a kebap-house or a wedding of his fellow businessmen and their family members. From his experience with Erdogan, the well-known journalist surmises that the Turkish president might not have read a single book in his adult life over the past 40 years. He shared this note at an editorial meeting in the newsroom of a now-defunct newspaper in Istanbul. If Erdogan, in a similar fashion with the current U.S. president, had barely touched his finger over the pages of a book to completely read it, then why did Ortayli leave his entire books to the presidential library? For what reason? Isn’t it against what he fought against so far today? The press statement issued by him to ward off public criticism was far from satisfying. It is quite normal, he reasoned, that he leaves his books to the Istanbul branch of the newly emerging Presidential library. “Was I expected to leave my books to the Library of Congress?” he demurred. It is quite usual, he then asserted, he leaves his books, after 50 years of collection, to a proper library that is open to public access. He noted that some libraries declined his previous offers due to overwhelmed bookshelves and unfavorable conditions. Apart from this unimpressive rationale presented to the public, no one truly has a cogent explanation over why this self-loving, snobbish and elitist history professor committed such a sin against books. We may never know the full answer. But Ortayli, at least for this writer, has lost his allure and his most important asset: going against the grain. He is no longer an independent historian. He is a court historian, the president’s historian."
Medium.com,Society,Europe does battle again with the demons of migration,World,https://medium.com/@Rashmee/europe-does-battle-again-with-the-demons-of-migration-4d2a2e23b901?source=topic_page---------458------------------1," A new migration plan soon goes before EU ministers. It’s already been agreed to in principle by Finland, France, Germany, Italy and Malta, all of which said they would automatically accept an equitable share of migrants rescued at sea. German Interior Minister Horst Seehofer pledged that Germany would take in 25% of those saved. The hope and expectation are that other countries share responsibility. That, however, may be unrealistic, considering that the European Union is facing resistance to unified and collaborative action on a more anodyne issue by far — climate policy. Piotr Naimski, Poland’s chief strategic energy adviser, recently said Poland would not meet the EU goal of cutting net carbon emissions to zero by 2050 and that other European countries should share responsibility instead. Poland is the biggest of four EU countries that refused in June to sign up to the bloc’s goal of becoming the first carbon-neutral continent by 2050. Migration is a more emotive issue than carbon neutrality and the European Union is seeking to strike a difficult balance on migrants. How to allow access to people genuinely fleeing persecution and violence in other parts of the world without creating a counter-current that encourages economic migrants to use any means possible to get to the European Union on the pretext of seeking refuge? There are two obvious steps, both badly needed and long overdue. First, the Dublin regulation must be fixed expeditiously. This rule requires migrants to apply for asylum in the first EU country they physically enter and nowhere else. This generally means countries on the geographical front line of the migrant flow — Greece, Italy, Spain — are left to deal with the issue as best they can, always and forever. Geography, as has been said, is destiny. What this means, the way things are set up, is that the front-line countries feel permanently beleaguered and permanently aggrieved, with all the attendant consequences for domestic political opportunism and grandstanding. We’ve already seen the results of this in Italy, with the rise of Matteo Salvini’s League party. The situation is not quite the same in Spain but there is no saying it won’t, or can’t, change. After all, Spain is about 7 nautical miles from Africa at the nearest point and, consequently, a magnet for migrants crossing the Mediterranean. Think of Greece, with mounting unrest around the overflowing refugee camps on its Aegean islands. At least 45,000 asylum-seekers arrived in Greece this year, mostly by sea. That’s more than half of the 77,000 refugees and other migrants who crossed into Europe from the Middle East and North Africa region in 2019. Rejigging the Dublin regulation must be a priority. It would restore a sense of equilibrium and fair play among EU members with respect to migration. It would also lower the political temperature around the issue. The second meaningful fix for migrants to Europe is about process. More resources need to be allocated to the speedy processing of asylum applications and for failed claimants to be deported as quickly as possible. That can only happen if Europe takes a holistic approach towards relationships to the home countries of the failed claimants. Claus Sorensen, former director-general of the European Commission’s Civil Protection and Humanitarian Aid department, suggested that this is possible if the European Union mobilises “all its foreign-policy instruments, including development assistance and investment funds and initiatives in security, trade, energy, agriculture, fisheries, climate action, air transport and health.” Unfortunately, many of the countries that haemorrhage people are afflicted with corruption and governance issues but there’s no other way than to engage. That’s not strictly a quid pro quo, more a way of signalling benign intent and recognition that collaboration gets better results than cudgels. Direct investment in countries that produce the most migrants is a strategically smart idea. So is the creation of a system that allows for easier legal short-term migration to Europe through scholarships and streamlined visas. Sudanese-British billionaire Mo Ibrahim recently made this point during a debate on global inequality at a Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation Goalkeepers event in New York. The migration issue needs less hysteria and more European strategic planning, he said. “People need to understand in this global world we all depend upon each other. In Europe, there is hysteria about migration. The best way to deal with migration is not by having this armada of military boats in the Mediterranean but creating jobs in Africa,” Ibrahim said. If Europe’s renewed battle with the demons of migration is to succeed, it must identify the demons — it’s not the migrants themselves but the iniquitous systems that force them to leave home and deal with them on foreign shores.

Medium.com,Society,“There will be riots”,World,https://medium.com/@_stevenpoole/there-will-be-riots-73790a287aac?source=topic_page---------460------------------1," It’s lunchtime on Seventh Street in Horden, East Durham. Pavements stand empty as the weary terraced houses provide a backdrop of boarded up windows and old red brick. On the corner, the door of one house is open and from inside comes the sound of laughter. The flurry of activity in the Hub House community centre is testament to the popularity of their staff, the advice they offer, and the deeply entrenched poverty in one of the most deprived areas of the UK. In the back garden, a man is drying the tears from his cheeks. Frank has watched his local area suffer ever since the closure of the coal pits three decades ago. “It’s going to get a lot worse the way the government’s going on now,” he says. “There’ll be riots again like they had down in Tottenham. Everyone will be smashing in shops, pinching tele’s, if there’s not enough police there’ll be hell on with people getting murdered and that. “People will just go along with it, thousands, everybody is just pissed off having nothing.” The boarded-up houses on the numbered streets of Horden are a particularly striking example of endemic destitution, but the social issues that affect this community are symptomatic of the burgeoning epidemic of poverty impacting people across the UK. The small terraced Hub House is a care facility on the front-line helping with social isolation, hunger, debt, problems with benefits and other concerns that reflect the hardship of the area. When the UK colliery industry was shut down, it destroyed the majority of employment opportunities in areas such as East Durham. However, it is the government policies of the last ten years that have compounded poverty for people in the former mining villages. Austerity measures enacted in 2010 left the seven councils in the North East of England with half a billion pounds less to spend each year. County Durham was among the worst affected areas in the country with its funding cut by 31% between 2010 and 2017, according to research from Cambridge University. Universal credit has also disproportionately blighted the area. A study this year in the British Medical Journal stated that “rather than providing a safety net, universal credit is undermining basic rights to a decent standard of living, housing and health at a time of stringent cuts to public services.” The authors found that there was an “uneven impact of welfare reform in the UK” and that there were “financial losses higher in older industrial areas such as North East England.” In Horden, Frank sees the reality of universal credit on a daily basis and has experienced the ruthless nature of the system having been sanctioned for turning down a job opportunity he couldn’t afford to travel to. “In the street where I live, everybody is more or less in the same boat on universal credit,” he says. “My benefits have gone from £207 a month down to £114. If it wasn’t for these (the Hub House) I don’t know what I’d do. “I come here, and I can get a food parcel. It was embarrassing at first because I hadn’t had one before, but now I don’t mind coming up here because they help you out. “That’s the situation, you just can’t live on this. It really gets me down.” As he thinks of the next generation, Frank worries for his own children. “I feel sorry for my daughter, the youngest, she’s only eighteen,” he says. “She’s got all this to come.” At the East Durham Trust (EDT), the community facility that supports the former pit villages like Horden, and centres such as the Hub House, Chief Executive Malcolm Faller sees this increasing poverty within a wider generational decline of wealth and opportunity. “Since the industrial revolution, what we’ve had in the British working class is progress year on year, or generation on generation,” Malcolm says. “It’s the kind of thing that ‘you’re not going to go work down the pits son, you’re going to go to grammar school.’ “So, you always looked for progress, even if not in terms of job, in terms of material wealth, your children did better than you, there was a sort of progression. “What you’re seeing now, after more than 150 years, is the first time ever there is a reverse of that. How do you live with that, that you can’t actually provide for your family?” For young people moving into the world of employment, there are now statistically higher numbers in work than ever before, as figures this month in the UK hit a national record of just over 32.8 million. Nevertheless, for many people the quality of jobs has been deteriorating. According to research published by the Living Wage Foundation, one in six workers in the UK, or 5.1 million people are now in low paid and insecure work. The highest rates feature in the North East of England, the West Midlands, and Wales. This problem of underemployment is most commonly represented by the no obligation of zero hours contracts, or the precarious gig economy which now employs one in ten working age adults in the UK, or 4.7 million people according to the Trade Union Congress (TUC) and the University of Hertfordshire. These changes to the UK labour market led the Joseph Rowntree Foundation (JRF) to announce in December 2018 that “in-work poverty has been rising even faster than employment,” with 8 million people living in poverty from working families, including four million children. “In the next generation that’s what we’re up against,” says Malcolm. “A whole generation who won’t be able to give their children what their parents gave them. That’s the first time that that will be reversed, and that’s a catastrophic situation.” “My kids have flown the nest,” Frank says. “But now they’re on their own, can they manage being on their own? “It’s only going to get worse in this country, like I said there’ll be riots on again I reckon in the near future, it’s out of control.” The 2011 riots in Tottenham, London, were initiated by the police shooting of a local man, Mark Duggan. However, the disturbances spread to cities across the UK, from Liverpool and Manchester, to Birmingham and Nottingham. In the wake of the violence, politicians, academics and journalists highlighted the social exclusion and disenfranchisement that many people and communities felt, as a reason for why such anger was unleashed. A 2012 collaborative study called Reading the Riots, from The London School of Economics and The Guardian, found that “Undoubtedly, the rioters were a group who felt dislocated from the opportunities they saw as available to others.” The authors revealed that out of the 270 rioters they interviewed, when asked if they felt “part of British society”, only 51% said yes. As opposed to 92% in the population as a whole. A sense of alienation from wider society did not cause riots in Horden, but the same grievances have contributed to important national events in recent years. Assessing the dynamics of the 2016 referendum to leave the European Union, a report commissioned by the JRF found that those who voted to leave were poorer, less educated and more likely to be living on the margins of society. A key insight of the paper was using data on both individual and area level motivations, resulting in findings stating that “a lack of opportunity across the country led to Brexit.” It reported that leave voters generally live in areas left out of recent economic growth and where the government’s austerity programme has reduced public services. “Groups in Britain who have been ‘left behind’ by rapid economic change and feel cut adrift from the mainstream consensus were the most likely to support Brexit,” the report said. “These voters face a ‘double whammy’. “While their lack of qualifications put them at a significant disadvantage in the modern economy, they are also being further marginalised in society by the lack of opportunities faced in their low-skilled communities. This will make it extremely difficult for the left behind to adapt and prosper in future.” County Durham voted overwhelmingly to leave in June 2016 despite the area receiving considerable funding from the European Union. On the front desk at the EDT, administrator Leaona Clarkson thinks that people just wanted change. “I think it’s because we’ve been forgotten about for so long by all political parties,” she says. “The ironic thing is this was an area that voted massively to leave, yet the EU provide us so much funding.” In between 2007 and 2013, the North East received £494 million from the EU, and was set to be given another £595.6 million from 2014 to 2020. “I would say I see the benefits more than I’ve paid, when I get my tax breakdown. I think I’ve only paid about £14 of my whole earnings last tax year to the EU. I mean £14 pounds in a year, I’d pay that a week to keep somewhere like this (the EDT) running, it’s mental. “You just have to look around here though, we’ve always been Labour and look at the state of the place, there’s nothing here for anyone anymore, everything’s closing down.” Leaona said that East Durham has seen a continued social and economic downturn over the past few decades, and it is now becoming noticeable in the next generation of parents. “The head of year at one of the local schools honestly believes that once kids reach eight years old their parents aren’t able to help them with their homework,” she says. “Teachers, unfortunately, don’t have the time to teach kids everything they need to know. They need that extra from home, and parents who 100% care will try and help them the best they can but if you don’t know yourself then you just don’t. “Kids just need to feel happy, kids just need to feel safe, and they’ll learn themselves. At the minute parents don’t feel happy and parents don’t feel safe. It’s a massive problem that we’ve got in our area.” According to the DWP, 30% of children in the UK live in poverty, with 70% of those coming from working families. Coming from a disadvantaged background prohibits a child’s ability to engage with education. The Child Poverty Action Group (CPAG) has shown that children who have lived in persistent poverty during their first seven years have cognitive development scores on average 20% below those of children who have never experienced poverty. This is a factor as children progress through school. In 2015, the CPAG revealed that 33% of children receiving free school meals obtained five or more good GCSEs, compared with 61% of other children. The Economic and Social Research Council (ESRC) found in a 2012 study, that the main barriers to people moving out of poverty were their educational performance and their difficulty in getting into higher education. This experience of social exclusion, in which people cannot fully access the opportunities and resources available to the rest of society, damages children’s future chances and limits their potential. On Seventh Street, Frank lives on the parameters of society. With spending cuts and universal credit, he is without the support he could previously get from the government. “The numbered streets are a sight in themselves,” says Malcolm, discussing the risks for disadvantaged people like Frank who find themselves with nowhere else to turn. “There is no safety net. When you look at one of the biggest issues of course, we’re talking about universal credit, but really the mechanisms that go around that with public spending obviously impacts on councils which is what people like him would have depended on.” The East Durham Trust, like many other similar organisations across the UK, are vital to the people in their area. As an independent community centre, it operates thanks to donations and projects funded by the National Lottery. “Community centres like ours are all living on the bread line. They’re all sailing very close to the wind in terms of their future,” says Malcolm. The Equality and Human Rights Commission has forecast that by 2022, 1.5 million more children will fall into poverty in the UK, increasing the rate of child poverty to 41%. If this prediction is accurate, such an increase in child poverty will have huge repercussions on the future integration of a large part of the population, and in turn the potential of UK society as a whole."
Medium.com,Society,Running Covert Propaganda Against Americans is Illegal. Trump Tried it Anyway.,World,https://gen.medium.com/running-covert-propaganda-against-americans-is-illegal-trump-tried-it-anyway-c324133b218a?source=topic_page---------461------------------1," ach new revelation in the money-for-dirt scandal involving the White House and Ukraine appears to add another nail in the impeachment coffin. So far, however, the list of impeachable offenses has focused on whether President Donald Trump’s actions amounted to an illegal solicitation of foreign election interference, or more simply, a broader abuse of his power to secure a personal benefit. While both of these are important (and impeachable), it’s critical that we not overlook the bigger purpose behind the president’s actions: The White House was attempting to employ an illegal, covert propaganda operation against the American public. This is explicitly against the law. The 1991 Intelligence Authorization Act prohibits the U.S. government from using covert actions — which include propaganda — to “influence United States political processes, public opinion, policies, or media.” As a former FBI counterintelligence agent, I know about propaganda operations because I investigated them. Most of my cases involved foreign “perception management” campaigns — covert activities designed to influence the attitudes and opinions of the American public toward particular issues that would benefit the intelligence service’s host country. These activities pose a national security threat because, in an open society and a free marketplace of ideas, it is essential that people know the true source of information in order to assess credibility and critically evaluate its content — especially when they are exercising fundamental rights, like voting, based on it. Russia’s perception management campaign in the 2016 election is what led special counsel Robert Mueller to indict 13 Russian nationals and three Russian companies for spreading misinformation on social media while posing as American groups and citizens. The Ukraine saga shows how these tactics have been adopted by the Trump administration. Initially, the partial transcript between Trump and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky released by the White House suggested that Trump’s main objective was to get Ukraine to open an investigation into alleged corruption by former Vice President Joe Biden and his son, Hunter. Ukrainian officials have confirmed there is no evidence of wrongdoing by either. But the goal, it seemed, was to use the law enforcement arm of a foreign country to go on a fishing expedition to dig up or manufacture the appearance of dirt, which could then potentially be used by Trump in his upcoming campaign. In other words, Trump appeared, based on his conversation with Zelensky, to be mainly interested in the fruits of a sham foreign investigation into the Bidens, which he could repurpose for his own benefit. The administration’s focus wasn’t simply that Ukraine investigate Biden — it was that Ukraine publicly broadcast it would be conducting an investigation. Last week, however, the House Intelligence Committee released a memo detailing behind-the-scenes text messages between State Department officials that tell a different story. In the texts, U.S. ambassadors Kurt Volker and Gordon Sondland engage in an extended negotiation with Zelensky regarding the conditions of a potential visit to the White House. The conditions do not merely involve a promise by Zelensky to open and pursue an investigation into the Bidens (which could be done quietly); rather, they convey to him that he must make a “public announcement” about these investigations in order to get a meeting with Trump. In other words, the administration’s focus wasn’t simply that Ukraine investigate Biden — it was that Ukraine publicly broadcast it would be conducting an investigation. The focus on the messaging about the investigation, rather than on the substantive investigation per se, indicates that the Trump administration was interested in shaping public perception — specifically that of American voters. In fact, many of the texts between Volker and Sondland — in coordination with Trump’s personal attorney, Rudy Giuliani — involve carefully tailoring Ukraine’s message to dovetail with Trump’s specific concerns: Investigating Burisma (the company affiliated with Hunter Biden) and “getting to the bottom of what happened” in the 2016 election by casting doubt on Russia’s role. The one-sided crafting of the announcement to be given by Ukraine is evidenced by Zelensky’s pushback, who on August 10 insisted on a date for a White House visit before committing to a statement announcing an investigation explicitly referencing these two points, according to the committee’s memo. The most important feature of the back and forth between the State Department and Ukraine is their insistence that the public announcement comes from Ukraine alone. It’s not unusual for U.S. officials to be involved in crafting a statement with a foreign country, but typically they are publicly issued as joint statements. Here, however, nothing about the proposed statement, which was drafted and proposed by the State Department in coordination with Giuliani, indicated that the U.S. precipitated or participated in its creation in any way. In intelligence terms, this is called black propaganda. Black propaganda attempts to conceal the true source of information so that the target (in this case, the American public) cannot accurately assess the credibility of the message or the motives of the source behind it. By having the information emanate from a separate and more credible outlet, the target audience is more likely to believe it. A unilateral statement from Zelensky would manipulate the American public into believing that Ukraine had independently reached the conclusion that there was a basis to investigate the Bidens and the origins of the 2016 U.S. election interference. By cloaking his own role and motives behind the statement of a foreign country, Trump could corroborate his own claims and have “proof” that his views were not politically motivated, but instead grounded in real facts. In short, the Trump administration was using a propaganda technique to covertly plant credible seeds of doubt about a political opponent and the Russia investigation in anticipation of the 2020 election so he could capitalize on it. The good news is that propaganda is neutralized by one thing: exposure. The whistleblower who brought to light the machinations of the White House and its State Department enablers not only started the ball rolling on impeachment, but stopped a covert psychological operation against the American public dead in its tracks."
Medium.com,Society,How The London Mayoral Race Could Change UK Politics,World,https://medium.com/discourse/how-the-london-mayoral-race-could-change-uk-politics-75edb0f06fcd?source=topic_page---------462------------------1," It’s been quite a few months for Rory Stewart. Appointed to the Cabinet in May by Theresa May, he ran to succeed her in the Conservative leadership race just a month later. In the race he defied all initial expectations, finding large popular appeal (although, unfortunately for him, much of this appeal was not with the 160,000-strong Conservative membership) and finishing fifth in a large field. He stuck to the principles that had guided his leadership bid after Boris Johnson became PM, though, unlike many of the Conservatives running who readily joined the new PM in government — Health Secretary Matt Hancock, for example. In not joining the government and voting against it in key votes, he found himself cast out with 20 other Tory MPs, who now sit as independents. But unlike many of them, he doesn’t plan to fight on, trying (likely in vain) to win a race against a Conservative, or to have the Tory whip reinstated. He has realised that the party has been lost to populists and right-wingers, and that liberals now need a new home. Running for Mayor of London, against the Conservative Shaun Bailey (and the current Labour Mayor, Sadiq Khan) will provide the first key test for the new Conservative party, and for the now-homeless liberal Conservatives. Can a centre-ground candidate, with popularity across the UK, beat a Conservative to the final two — and then the current Mayor? You might think that Stewart and Bailey will split the right-wing vote in a mostly liberal, left-wing city, handing Khan a second term. But due to the electoral system, which involves a second-preference vote, the effects of this will mostly be mitigated. Bailey, a high Tory, isn’t popular in London, and so won’t be able to beat Stewart or Khan. But where the people who vote for Bailey put their second preferences could decide the contest. Furthermore, Stewart is close enough to Khan ideologically that he might take votes from Khan, or at least steal some second preferences. The system is beneficial to a popular centre-ground candidate with large appeal. To win, a candidate has to receive some form of endorsement from at least 50% of the electorate, and this is where Rory Stewart could excel. While campaigning for the leadership race, he walked through a huge amount of towns and cities, meeting people of all races and ethnicities, cultures, backgrounds — and crucially, political leanings. Through his use of social media, he built up support through his calm and reasonable interactions with members of the public. He got large support in traditional Labour areas, and from voters who are definitely not traditionally Conservative, and this ability to build a broad support base will serve him well in the race to become the new Mayor of London. Beyond, though, the race itself, and all the implications that could have for the centre-ground and the liberal ex-Tories, Stewart becoming Mayor could boost his chances of holding even higher office. Boris was Mayor for 8 years before re-entering Parliament and three years later becoming PM, and the parallels between the journeys are difficult to avoid. For now, though, Stewart has a race to win — and the implications of this race will help to shape UK politics for years to come."
Medium.com,Society,Egypt Releases Foreigners Accused of Supporting Terrorism During Anti-Sisi Protests,World,https://medium.com/citizen-truth/egypt-releases-foreigners-accused-of-supporting-terrorism-during-anti-sisi-protests-3c141adc62c8?source=topic_page---------463------------------1," On Thursday, Egyptian authorities released six foreigners who were detained amidst mass protests on September 20 against Egyptian President Abdel Fatah al-Sisi. A statement by the Egyptian prosecutor general read that the release of the foreigners came by request from their embassies and was conditional upon the foreigners immediately leaving Egypt after being released from custody. A spokesperson for the Jordanian Foreign Ministry, Sofian al-Qudah, confirmed in a statement the release by Egyptian authorities of two Jordanian nationals who were arrested during anti-government protests on September 20. The statement named the two released as Abdel Rahman Hussien al-Rawajbeh and Thaer Matar. Four other foreigners — two Turkish, a Palestinian and a Dutch — were among those released Thursday, according to the website Egypt Today. The foreigners were all accused of collaborating with the outlawed Egyptian Muslim Brotherhood Group to disturb public order and create a state of chaos throughout Egypt. They were also accused of providing financial support for terrorists and training them on how to use specialty weapons. The prosecutor general’s statement added that an investigation into the foreigners’ activity was still underway despite their release and that more findings will be announced. Egypt Today also reported that well-known Egyptian TV presenter, Amr Adib, broadcast a video showing passports of the arrested along with videotaped confessions about taking part in the protests against Sisi. Adib said the arrested foreigners confessed to conspiring against Egypt. The video was broadcast during an episode of Adib’s popular talk show, “Al Hekaya” or the Tale, aired on MBC Misr. Reacting to the MBC Misr video, Jordanian spokesperson Qudah told Jordanian Radio Station “Al-Qakil” that the Egyptian authorities did not interrogate the arrested Jordanians. Egypt’s Attorney General, Hamada al-Sawi, has ordered an investigation into the anti-Sisi protests that ripped through Egypt in late September. The protests were sparked by videos posted to social media by Egyptian actor and building contractor Mohammad Ali accusing Egyptian President Abdel-Fatah al-Sisi of corruption. The now self-exiled Ali made allegations that Sisi and other Egyptian high-ranking military officers were involved in financial corruption and wasteful spending on luxuries. Ali accused Sisi of spending millions on luxury presidential palaces and hotels while Egyptian citizens suffered through poverty. Ali himself has worked as a building contractor with the Egyptian military for more than 15 years before he showed up on social media, alleging the complicity by the Sisi regime. Sisi downplayed Ali’s allegations claiming the palaces were built for all of Egypt and not himself personally. “Yes, I have built presidential palaces, and will continue to do so. I am creating a new state; nothing is registered with my name, it is built for Egypt,” Sisi told the eighth National Youth Conference in New Cairo in early Septemeber before the outbreak of protests. The president’s remarks and Ali’s allegations of corruption and lavish spending come as the country has gone through recent economic hardships compelling the Egyptian government to impose austerity measures. According to Middle East Eye, Egyptian authorities said in July that the country’s poverty rate had reached 32.5 percent, up from 25.2 percent in 2011. Protests against Sisi are unprecedented since the Egyptian President took office after toppling former late Islamist president Mohammad Morsi under mass pressure during the June 2013 revolution. The now-current president Abdel-Fatah Sisi, who served as defense minister of Egypt under the former government, took office for the second time in 2018’s elections, winning 95% of the votes. In April 2019 an amendment to Egypt’s constitution passed allowing Sisi to extend his term as president until 2030. In 2011 the Egyptian revolution overthrew President Hosni Mubarak who ruled Egypt for 30 years. One year later, a presidential election brought to power the first democratically elected president of Egypt Mohammad Morsi. Morsi, who died a few months ago in prison, belonged to the outlawed Islamic Brotherhood of Egypt. Read the original article and sign up for our newsletter at https://citizentruth.org"
Medium.com,Society,The Trudeau Dilemma: Why The Canadian PM Deserves A Chance Despite His Past Mistakes,World,https://medium.com/@ali.umair.ch/the-trudeau-dilemma-why-the-canadian-pm-deserves-a-chance-despite-his-past-mistakes-a95aeb1bbf86?source=topic_page---------464------------------1," The public outcry over Trudeau’s blackface escapades from twenty years back certainly have not helped his chances for re-election. The primary question many in Canada have to answer in two months is ‘Does the Canadian Prime Minister deserve forgiveness for his past errors in judgement?’ As a visible minority myself, and as someone with their fair share of knowledge in the role of social identity and race in national and international politics, I strongly believe that he should be. Forgiving someone like Trudeau for such blunders should relatively be easier as compared to — say — a violent strongman like Roberto Duterte or a quasi-dictator like Xi Jinping, right? But as recent scandals such as the SNC-Lavalin affair have demonstrated — if anything, the media and the general population have not budged in their vitriol. There are two primary reasons for this. Firstly, Trudeau, as someone who has publicly welcomed criticism through his pro-democratic and ‘open-door’ policy, tends to attract exactly the type of unrestrained criticism that he ‘welcomes’ in less severe times. Secondly, as one of the leading posterchilds of 21st century liberal institutionalism, human rights and other awoke movements, Trudeau has always been swift in criticizing transgressors of his liberal worldview. This naturally makes him an easy target for retribution. There is a reason that I stated that I am a visible minority. I know firsthand how it may feel for someone to be offended by Trudeau’s blackface exploits. The historical connotations, especially for African-Canadians and African-Americans, are painful and downright offensive. I can’t help but feel that other minorities, such as Arabs, Indians and Pakistanis, would find this practice equally disturbing even if uninformed about it’s historical origin. Mind you, it isn’t a touch or two of makeup to make a person look as if he or she was of a darker tone or from a particular ethnic background. This is black paint. So how does one overlook or rationalize the absurdity of Trudeau’s act? You really can’t. But forgiveness should be possible. As the social constructivist project concedes, we human beings are subjects of our time and immediate environment. There is a reason most people who were born in Saudi Arabia in the 1990’s are Muslims, or many people raised in Texas in the 1970’s have a thing for firearms and the rights to carry one. And it’s not genetics. As hard as we try, except the very best of us, we always tend to succumb to the common behavioral patterns and identity schemas of our immediate zeitgeist. Let’s be honest. Have our views of Muslims, Jews, Whites, Blacks, Homosexuals and the Environment been static and unchanging? No. And this usually has a lot more to do with external factors than we would like to believe. Germany had to adapt to this very human problem in the post-Nazi era. So did Americans after the 1960’s: you would be surprised the views many living Americans have held in the past. After all, not everyone living is on the right side of history. Infact, almost half aren’t in most cases. Many of the proponents who have spoken so openly in support of the victims during the recent #MeToo movement were lipsealed just a decade ago. They found the courage to speak up. But most found courage only when their views had developed to a certain point and coincided with others around them. Time and space. Trudeau, a schoolteacher during the time these pictures was taken, was a member of the society around him. As were we all. We knew, or thought differently about many things that we respect and treat delicately today. Like climate change. Gender. Other religions. But we eventually outgrew these early biases and views. Not just because of our own inherent wisdom. But because we developed as a society. Let’s not be naive. Let’s forgive — and move on. There is a Trudeau in every one of us, in one way or another."

Medium.com,Society,"Trump has robust, sensible foreign policy goals. But he doesn’t have any follow-through",World,https://medium.com/@KounalakisM/trump-has-robust-sensible-foreign-policy-goals-but-he-doesnt-have-any-follow-through-267b937d2e81?source=topic_page---------466------------------1," Donald Trump’s successful 2016 road to the White House was paved with irreverent campaign rhetoric and a world of good intentions regarding American foreign policy. Like Barack Obama before him, he called the Iraq War a mistake and recognized China as a rising global competitor. Where Trump differs with his predecessor on foreign-policy goals is mostly reflected in an approach toward personnel and a highly personal style that forswears process and favors disruption. The president’s critics should realize, however, that when it comes to both Trump’s instincts and intentions, his desired foreign-policy outcomes are mostly aligned with those of past presidents and in sync with longstanding American goals. Trump, in many ways, has pursued a rigorous global re-ordering to keep the United States on top of its game in leading the world. Unfortunately, he has also been his own worst enemy at executing strategy, closing deals or putting in the extra hours of work required to manifest even the simplest solutions or to strengthen the closest alliances. One need look no further than his erratic series of disjointed, on-again, off-again 140-character policy pronouncements, threats, enticements, love letters, rebukes and imperious rants that has kept both Congress and other nations in the global commons allergic to supporting an otherwise agreeable global agenda. Regardless, POTUS has achieved some remarkable success in a few areas, most notably in North Korea. The Singapore summit with Kim Jong Un was a true historic breakthrough moment when the head of the Hermit Kingdom was on the big stage and a leader-to-leader dialogue followed 45’s “fire and fury” ultimatum. Trump’s bold and risky — yes, dangerous — action broke an ongoing diplomatic logjam that had blocked progress over several U.S. administrations. The world awaits the next step of Pyongyang’s “complete, verifiable, irreversible” denuclearization. It’s been over a year since the Singapore summit, however, and Kim is still shooting off rockets. Why? What’s lacking has been the hard yeoman’s work of American diplomacy required to achieve no nukes. If anything, North Korea appears to be flaunting its disregard and disdain for Trump’s overtures, actions and openness. The jury is still out, but time only helps Kim improve both his weapons systems and negotiating position. Good intentions and failed execution continue throughout the Indo-Pacific and in Central Asia. It’s time to get out of Afghanistan, for sure, and Trump hopes his 2020 re-election campaign will highlight a resolution to the Afghan adventure. Talks with the Taliban seem headed toward a negotiated withdrawal of American troops. Trump might get it done. Any illusion that this will be a lasting peace, however, will certainly be quickly dispelled, though not before the extraction of the political value of images of U.S. troops coming home. Meanwhile, Taliban bombings and brazen Kabul attacks are only a preview of al Qaida and ISIS’ coming horror show. Instincts and intentions are only going to get the president so far in foreign policy, whether in Russia, China, Ukraine or Turkey, or with NATO burden-sharing allies. His repeated desire for regime change in Venezuela, Cuba and Nicaragua are laudable goals, but require sustained attention, multilateral action, analytic understanding, consistent pressure, backchannel negotiation, coordinated intergovernmental process and a little bit of luck. Needless to say, the president has talked a good game, but can’t walk the talk to deliver necessary outcomes. Nicolás Maduro, for example, doesn’t seem to be going anywhere, and Juan Guiadó looks increasingly like the incredible shrinking man. In Latin America, Trump’s track record is abysmal. Bullying instead of bargaining has become the negotiating style of the man who would be king. Treaties are torn up, allies are alienated, policies are pronounced without a plan and tariffs are the big hammer used to smash global trade’s status quo. Tariffs, in fact, are seen by the president as the only tool in a policy toolbox full of more appropriate diplomatic, defense and development instruments. Relying on a more subtle and complex combination of policy tools could get the American trade or treaty job done less traumatically. Using traditional policy tools, however, requires patience, which is not seen as a virtue in this president’s Twitterocracy. When faced with an impossible task, like shutting down the U.S.-Mexico border, his response is often as simple as it is ridiculous: “I want it done at noon tomorrow.” High noon has come and gone, and the border challenge is as critical today as it will be tomorrow . . . and the day after, and every day that follows until America’s leadership can unify this country, help shape and define its collective interests and legitimately speak on its behalf with one voice in foreign affairs. It’s been done before and it can happen again. Until then, the road to foreign-policy hell is being paved with good intentions. Markos Kounalakis is a part-time, small cog of a public servant in a big national wheel. Otherwise he’s a Hoover Institution visiting fellow."

Medium.com,Society,Strategizing Countermeasures Against Foreign Interference in Singapore,World,https://medium.com/intpolicydigest/strategizing-countermeasures-against-foreign-interference-in-singapore-630f033a9d84?source=topic_page---------469------------------1," By Muhammad Faizal Abdul Rahman Singapore organized a conference on 25 September 2019 to examine Foreign Interference Tactics and Countermeasures. Countermeasures should focus on three strategic factors that may constitute a framework. A strategic framework is essential as foreign interference is an instrument of political warfare — coercive means short of conventional war − that lies in the continuum between diplomacy and aggression. Foreign interference functions as the invisible hand of hostile foreign states seeking to undermine a target state’s national interests. The first factor is establishing clear goals. In countering the invisible hand, the target state must first establish clear goals for the countermeasures. The second factor is appreciating the foreign state’s worldview and the attendant hostile intent. Should foreign interference be deterred or are its risks tolerable? The third factor is assessing how components of the target state are susceptible to the foreign state’s covert manipulations. The target state must assess what its vulnerabilities are and where they lie in its four components: infrastructure, information, ideas, and individuals (4Is). The steps that the foreign state undertakes to grow its influence in the target state and manipulate these vulnerabilities constitute the lines of effort (LOE) for foreign interference. For countermeasures to be effective, the LOE must be disrupted. Denying the Foreign State At the strategic level, there must be clear goals for foreign interference countermeasures. Countermeasures essentially aim to change the mind of the hostile foreign state — deterrence — either by punishing or denying the foreign state its goals. The national power that smaller states have may exact only limited punishment on bigger or more powerful states in retaliation against foreign interference. Global interdependence of people, economies, and technologies further complicates retaliation. As the national interests of various states are intertwined, smaller states may face a greater risk of blowback. Smaller states must be more circumspect in deterring foreign interference. Smaller states like Singapore should leverage their unique strengths instead of replicating the hard measures — military, economic and cyber — that form the bigger states’ primary instruments of retaliation against foreign interference. Instead of exacting punishment, smaller states can use their unique strengths to develop countermeasures that deny the foreign state of significant gains from its interference. For example, Singapore leveraged the strength of its laws to expel Professor Huang Jing in 2017. The expulsion disrupted the LOE that the foreign state — which the professor served as an agent of influence — had invested time and resources to build. The disruption may reduce the attractiveness of foreign interference as an instrument and sent a deterrent message to the foreign state. Nevertheless, smaller states must have an appreciation of the foreign state’s worldview to be certain that the denial countermeasures work as intended. Appreciating Worldview of Foreign State Foreign interference is part of a foreign state’s exercise of national power to become stronger. In determining why a foreign state intervenes in the target state, it is necessary to appreciate how the foreign state views and wants to change the world. A confluence of external and internal issues shapes this worldview. External issues include shifts in the distribution of geopolitical power. Internal issues include domestic politics, public opinion, and agendas of interest groups (e.g. businesses). The worldview of the foreign state also determines how it uses its national power — diplomatic, informational, military and economic — and take risks to grow its influence and interfere overseas. For example, prolonged economic stagnation drives Russia to prioritize the use of its military power to gain control over foreign lands — such as Crimea — in restoring what it views as its former sphere of influence. China views the economy as the foundation for its global rise and, therefore, prioritizes the use of its economic power first — Belt and Road Initiative — to influence access to markets and natural resources. By appreciating the foreign state’s worldview, the target state can better determine what the foreign state regards as significant risks (e.g. agent of influence forfeiting monies) to be avoided and significant gains (e.g. policy changes) to be made through foreign interference. Denial countermeasures — such as political donations regulations in Singapore — that effectively attack the foreign state’s strategy by disrupting the LOE for foreign interference can, therefore, be developed. Assessing Vulnerabilities of Target State Countermeasures that disrupt the LOE for foreign interference can impede the foreign state’s ability to manipulate the target state’s vulnerabilities. Fundamentally, the foreign state would find it difficult to manipulate vulnerabilities that have been assessed and addressed. In assessing its vulnerabilities, the target state must map the relationships between parties that have stakes or influence in its 4Is. On the one hand, these parties — such as key personnel, suppliers, political and community figures — are in the right position to detect and defend the target state’s 4Is from foreign interference. On the other hand, these parties are also in the right position to act as agents of influence for a foreign state. Vulnerability assessment requires significant investments in intelligence capabilities, but it enhances the target state’s long-term resilience against foreign interference. Maps of relationships between parties are firstly useful for investigating the scope, scale, and sophistication of foreign interference when it happens. Secondly, the maps can help the target state develop programs to raise awareness among these parties regarding the potential risks of being knowingly and unknowingly involved in foreign interference. Thirdly, the maps can help the target state cultivate partners — such as from community organizations and private sector — to counter foreign interference. Playing a Long Game In sum, countermeasures against the threat of foreign interference should focus on these strategic factors to be effective. The focus is necessary as the threat will persist as long as divergent foreign policies exist and as long as the domestic policies of one state have external effects on the interests of another state.

Medium.com,Society,Will Hong Kong break China?,World,https://medium.com/@bramerius/will-hong-kong-break-china-da78c6e7dd53?source=topic_page---------471------------------1," We are witnessing some truly remarkable defiance in Hong Kong, where the authority of one of the world’s strongest superpowers is being challenged, tested and withstood. On the seventieth anniversary of China’s people’s revolution, the events in Hong Kong convey some very illuminating lessons for those of us who reap hope from defiance and for whom rebellion can be the only justified response to a world rife with inequality and barbarism. It is not just Hong Kong that is burning, people are lining the streets from Equador to Iraq, to the more familiar protests against climate change and the Extinction Rebellion which will shake London this month. Let’s make something clear. These protests have been led and sustained by students and workers, who are demanding both more economic equality as well as political freedom. The protests are not, as the Chinese government would very much like us to believe, orchestrated by international forces hostile to China. This, of course, is the cliche explanation most governments seek, when they are the target of mass popular unrest. But like most protest movements we have seen in the 21st century, Hong Kong’s rebels are driven by a desire for more economic justice and political freedom, a goal eloquently expressed by student group Demosisto: “(…) we push for the city’s political and economic autonomy from the oppression of the Communist Party of China and capitalist hegemony.” In spite of Hong Kong’s international reputation as a wealthy financial centre, over 1.3 million people live beneath the poverty line. The city attracts billions in foreign direct investment, but this is mainly down to massive levels of exploitation of its working population. In recent years, Hong Kong has increasingly been sucked into China’s hyper-capitalist initiative of creating economic zones that are equivalent to globalisation at micro-level, relying on cheap land, labour and minimal regulation, resulting in massive wealth creation, but leaving a wasteland of exploitation, inequality and environmental destruction in its wake. In a way, China’s development in the last decades resembles the experiences of Europe’s industrial revolution, with millions of rural dwellers adapting to new lives in industrial super cities. Likewise, this development, which once spawned the socialist movement in Europe, is now once more creating a new, militant labour movement which has nothing to lose but its chains. The working class in Hong Kong (as well as in other large Chinese cities) is large and dwells relatively close together, giving it both unity in purpose and action. This movement is the backbone of the protests on the streets of Hong Kong and it is important for progressives internationally to recognize this. If international solidarity is not forthcoming and the Hong Kong protests remain relatively isolated, the movement might yet take a different, more sinister direction, as some elements look to the Trump administration to speak out on their behalf. This would be a disastrous course and greatly endanger the genuine demands of the protests which are in many ways universal and could connect to the grievances we are increasingly seeing on streets across the world. For now, let’s share the excitement that one of the world’s most powerful capitalist countries (yes, China) is trembling at the defiance on the streets of Hong Kong. Perhaps this will awaken the enormous militancy and anger so far contained by China’s murderous dictatorship. Protests like this could potentially unleash the true energy locked up in China’s ever expanding economy. If this happens, who knows what else might be possible."
Medium.com,Society,Rights Groups Urge UN to Investigate 1988 Massacre of MEK Activists,World,https://medium.com/@Masoud_Dalvand/rights-groups-urge-un-to-investigate-1988-massacre-of-mek-activists-476c364b12f9?source=topic_page---------472------------------1," Human rights groups have called on the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights Michelle Bachelet to launch an independent investigation into the 1988 massacre of thousands of political prisoners, primarily affiliated to the People’s Mojahedin Organization of Iran (PMOI, Mujahedin e Khalq or MEK), by the Iranian regime. Numerous non-governmental organizations made the appeal to the UN human rights chief during the Human Rights Council’s 42 ndsession in Geneva. The actions by the NGOs included addresses at the Council’s plenary, written submissions and organizing side events about the 1988 massacre. More than 30,000 political prisoners, mainly MEK activists and supporters, were massacred in Iran in the summer of 1988. The massacre was carried out on the basis of a fatwa by Khomeini which ordered the execution of all prisoners who continue to support the MEK. Three-member Death Commissions were set up to approve all the death sentences. Ebrahim Raisi, who in 1988 was a member of the Tehran Death Commission and authorized the execution of thousands of MEK supporters, was appointed as head of the Iranian Judiciary earlier this year. Alireza Avaei, who in 1988 was a member of the Death Commission in Dezful, is today Hassan Rouhani’s Justice Minister. The perpetrators of the 1988 massacre have never been brought to justice, according to human rights groups. On August 9, 2016, an audio tape was published for the first time of Khomeini’s former heir Ayatollah Hossein-Ali Montazeri acknowledging that that massacre of MEK members took place and had been ordered at the highest levels. The NGOs say it is time for the UN to investigate Iran’s 1988 massacre. Milica Javdan of the Women’s Human Rights International Association addressed Bernard Duhaime, Chair of the UN Working Group on Enforced or Involuntary Disappearances, and Fabian Salvioli, UN Special Rapporteur on the Promotion of Truth, Justice, Reparation and Guarantees of non-recurrence on 11 September 2019: “In the summer of 1988, 30,000 political prisoners were massacred by the Islamic Republic of Iran. The mass atrocity was based on a fatwa by Supreme Leader Ayatollah Khomeini. His decree called for the execution of all political prisoners affiliated to the People’s Mojahedin Organization of Iran (MEK), who remained steadfast in their resistance to the Iranian regime. The victims were buried secretly in mass graves. For 31 long years the Iranian government has tried to conceal the truth about the mass executions from the International Community,” she said. “Mr. Special rapporteur Salvioli, to this day the grieving families of the victims have not received any information about the fate of their loved ones. There is no paper trail on the prisoners’ whereabouts, no trial documents and no graves to visit. The victim’s families look to you for answers.” “Mr. Salvioli, what measures has your office taken in order to investigate this matter and to seek answers from the Iranian government about the true fate of the victims of the 1988 massacre? Many of the perpetrators of this heinous crime still hold senior positions in the Iranian judiciary and government. Such as Judiciary Chief Ebrahim Raisi and Justice Minister Alireza Avaei. On 25th of July 2019, in an official interview, Mostafa Pour-Mohammadi defended the 1988 massacre and said newly caught Mojahedin (MEK) activists would face capital punishment. Impunity breeds reoccurrence!” Ms. Sahar Sanaie, speaking for the International Association for Equality of Women, told the Human Rights Council on September 13, 2019 that “mothers, fathers, children and other members of the victims’ families expect from the High Commissioner for Human rights Michelle Bachelet to launch an independent international inquiry to know the truth about their loved ones and to see the authors of this massacre brought to justice.” “Thirty-one years after the 1988 mass extra-legal executions of political prisoners in Iran, we believe that until the full truth is unveiled and the perpetrators are held to account for their crimes, there will be no incentive for the Government of Iran to change its policy on human rights,” she added. Two conferences were held at the UN headquarters in Geneva on September 20, in which international human rights experts called for an end to the impunity enjoyed by Iranian regime officials in regard to atrocious human rights conditions in Iran, most specifically those involved in the summer 1988 massacre. “Why should there now be a tribunal on the crime against humanity committed in 1988? First, because lawyers have examined evidence and know beyond doubt that a crime was committed. If Iran disputes that, we have a process for that,” Kirsty Brimelow QC, an international human rights lawyer, told one of the panels. “30,000 human beings are only the tip of the iceberg. 120,000 of the MEK members have been killed. Back then Maurice Copithorne dropped the issue of the massacres because he thought it had already been dealt with by his predecessors,” Alfred-Maurice de Zayas, former UN expert on the promotion of a democratic and equitable international order, told another panel. Three women, all victims of the regime’s atrocities in prisons and who had lost several family members to the extrajudicial executions because of their support for the MEK testified during the conferences. Sima Mirzaee, a family member of 14 individuals (affiliated to the MEK) executed by the Iranian regime, Massoumeh Joushaghani, a former political prisoner in Iran and Azadeh Alemi of the Women’s Human Rights International Association gave firsthand testimonies of the horror they had endured. Seven NGOs drew the attention of the UN to the presence of mass murderers in Iran’s Judiciary. In a joint written statement, the NGOs pointed out that perpetrators of Iran’s 1988 massacre of MEK political prisoners continue to hold senior ranks in the Judiciary. They urged UN High Commissioner for Human Rights Michelle Bachelet to support the launch of an independent fact-finding mission into the 1988 massacre.

Medium.com,Society,I will never forget the chants of ‘Azadi’ in Time Square,World,https://medium.com/@media_41618/i-will-never-forget-the-chants-of-azadi-in-time-square-ec5e2dd5e884?source=topic_page---------473------------------1," Fourteen-year-old Kashmiri American Zaara Malik says the thousands of people who came out to support Kashmir in New York last Friday left her mesmerized. T
he past month and a half or so has been nothing short of a whirlwind for me and our family. My whole world has revolved around one thought: Kashmir. Whether it has been meetings, protests or just attempting to spread awareness, this is all we have been doing. I admit: I, as a first generation Kashmiri American who visited home each year, didn’t always feel connected to Kashmir. Until my visit in 2016 that is. Burhan Wani (the commander for a rebel group that fights the Indian army) was killed and I saw a different side to Kashmir. I saw a revolution against India. The unrest lasted for six months. This is when I learned the history of Kashmir. I researched for hours and hours. I found that the last three generations had been fighting to be free, to be on their own. I thought to myself: Why is nobody saying something about this in the United States? My passion to bring light to the conflict started from there on. Even as an eleven year old I would search everyday to see if any media had picked up the protests in Kashmir. I was absolutely shocked when I found nothing. Fast forward three years later, and media outlets as big as the BBC, CNN and The New York Times are reporting and talking about the issues in Kashmir. Now thousands of people in the streets of New York City are advocating for Kashmir and Kashmiris. Trying to put this past Friday into words is just as crazy as the events that occurred. I saw thousands of people spending a beautiful Friday on the streets and shouting for something I care the most about. Walking down the perimeter of the protest and seeing people all the way down the streets pack the area, yelling “AZADI” is a moment I will never forget. Our struggle has become everyone’s struggle. My motherland being saved isn’t a mission for just Kashmiris anymore; it is now for everyone against injustice. Regardless of race or religion or background. My heart was overwhelmed with love and pride. Thousands of people are yelling the slogans I’ve grown up listening to. People are taking time out of their lives to support us and speak for our silenced voices. Seeing people stop and stand in one of the busiest places in the world, Times Square, and read our posters and stand by our cause is a sight I will never forget. Even being in total exhaustion after hours of standing in huge crowds, feeling the voices of people yelling freedom slogans are moments that will stay forever in my heart. As I said before, being a first generation Kashmiri American, there are times when I haven’t felt as connected as I wanted to be to my roots. But after the vigil and protest on Friday I have never felt more Kashmiri. Growing up in a world where things such as Islamophobia and genocide can happen in the dark, I was immensely grateful to see so many people come and stand with Kashmir. It was a historical turnout. I was able to speak to a police officer on Friday who was supervising the protest and he said even the security felt a bit overwhelmed after having thousands more show up than expected. I felt a sense of pride and love wash over me in that moment. Kashmir has been subjected to so much suffering, but if there was one thing I learned from Friday it was the power of the people will always overcome the obstacles that are thrown at us. Friday was and forever will be one of the most important days of my life. The story of people of all kinds coming together to help save my homeland will be the story I cannot wait to share to later generations."
Medium.com,Society,The Colombian city forgotten by peace,World,https://medium.com/muros-invisibles/the-colombian-city-forgotten-by-peace-e5e7405a4366?source=topic_page---------474------------------1," Buenaventura hasn’t had a high school built in 44 years, suffers from an extreme lack of healthcare, and four in five of the mostly Afro-Colombian residents have no regular access to potable water — all despite the fact that 60 percent of Colombia’s international trade flows through the Pacific coast port city. During much of five decades of civil war, Buenaventura was considered the most dangerous city in Colombia — notorious for particularly gruesome killings as the FARC rebel group, Colombian paramilitaries, and narco-traffickers fought to control the main maritime cocaine-smuggling route. A landmark 2016 peace deal was supposed to have changed all that, but for many residents of Buenaventura and surrounding areas in the state of Valle de Cauca -cut off geographically from the rest of Colombia by the Andes mountains- the war never ended. “The peace is two steps forward and one step back,” said Oney Bedoya, an international security consultant and Colombian army veteran. “Our entire culture suffers from post-traumatic stress. It creates an inability to trust, a lack of social cohesion, and damaged people lashing out — generations who grew up in violence.” And that generational violence is taking its toll. Since 2015, Médecins Sans Frontières says it has treated 21,000 victims of psychological or sexual trauma in Buenaventura, which locals have dubbed “The Forgotten City”. “Our entire culture suffers from post-traumatic stress.” “When we arrived, there was one functioning hospital and one psychiatrist who offered services three days a week,” said Yann Le Boulaire, head MSF coordinator in the region. “This for a city with a population of over 400,000 people.” He described patients suffering from extreme psychological trauma resulting from prolonged exposure to violence — many also hampered by stigma as people in the region often associate seeking help for mental problems with weakness. “But we’re making progress,” Le Boulaire said. “Twenty-one thousand people out on the street telling the community that the trauma isn’t their fault is the best awareness programme we could have.” According to an August 2019 study by the International Crisis Group, 45 percent of cocaine exports leave Colombia through the Pacific coast. Decades of government neglect and increasing lawlessness have allowed dissident groups to put down long roots and flourish in Buenaventura. “Things got much worse here in the late 90s,” explained Darwin Molina, a local activist who tries to help local citizens from poor neighbourhoods get elected to political office. “The US ‘War on Drugs’ and the escalation of hostilities under (former Colombian president) Uribe brought FARC out of the jungles and into the city.” Molina described a four-way war over the lucrative cocaine trade that transits the city as leftists from FARC battled right-wing Colombian paramilitaries, narco-gangs from the state capital of Cali, and US-backed Colombian state forces. “We have lost a generation — either to crime or displacement.” In 2001, even amid the escalating violence, the Colombian government decided to privatise and modernise the formerly public port. As the flow of goods increased, so did the fighting to control territory that became more valuable by the day. “All the national companies left because of the violence. And any youth that wants a better education? Well, they left too.” Molina said. “We have lost a generation — either to crime or displacement.” A study by the Norwegian Refugee Council found that in 2013 and 2014, before the end of hostilities, 13,000 people were displaced yearly from Buenaventura alone. People in Buenaventura speak of the “invisible frontiers” of the city — sections such as Antonio Nariño and La Planta, that police cannot enter. Violence is commonplace in these lawless zones and residents keep silent due to fear of the criminal groups that have carved out private fiefdoms in the city. Molina took The New Humanitarian on a tour of his neighbourhood, adjacent to two such conflict zones. He pointed out the crime scenes of 11 murders that had occurred over just the last three months. “A few weeks ago an 11-year-old child was caught in the crossfire of a gunfight. After being shot, he tried to run home to that doorway,” said Molina, gesturing towards a nearby building. “He died before his parents realised he had even left the house.” State authorities reported 703 murders in the Valle de Cauca region during the first four months of 2019, an increase of 75 percent over 2018. For comparison, New York, a city with nearly 20 times the population, reported 80 murders during the same period. Molina and several aid workers who spoke to TNH insisted the actual rate in Buenaventura is far higher, with many murders going unreported due to fear of reprisals. Buenaventura police say the small neighbourhood gangs are employed by narco-traffickers to destabilise the city through terror and keep the authorities away, leaving them free to run their cocaine empires from the port and surrounding areas. “We don’t deal with wounds,” said Le Boulaire. “There are no wounded here, except psychologically. We deal with deaths.” “Much of the violence is invisible, that is to say it is never reported to the police,” he continued. “We deal primarily with people suffering from psychological trauma. Eighty percent of the people who come to us for help have been eye-witnesses to a homicide.” One aid worker, who asked that his name not be used for security reasons, spends days trying to track down, collect, and identify the bodies of people who have disappeared. “The truth is that no one knows how much of the violence goes unreported. Government studies are only a guess,” he said. He works in regions controlled by dissident groups, often interviewing the very same criminals responsible for the violence in an effort to find the remains for loved-ones who have been without answers for months or years. In 2016, a popular vote on a peace accord between the Colombian government and FARC failed by a razor-thin margin. Then-president Juan Manuel Santos pushed the controversial accord through anyway, officially ending the longest-running conflict in the Americas. But the nation remains deeply polarised over its implementation, and recent events have placed the deal even further in jeopardy. President Ivan Duque, who won the 2018 election after promising to dismantle and renegotiate aspects of the accord, has used parliamentary strategies to slow down and challenge its roll-out. He cites the criminal activities of FARC dissidents, who have refused to lay down arms, and calls for FARC leaders to be charged with war crimes — leaders who were granted immunity under Santos in return for joining the government. On 29 August, three ex-FARC leaders proclaimed a return to arms and vowed to return to the jungles on the Venezuelan border to wage war once again. Under the 2016 peace accord, the government promised to develop former rebel-controlled areas, but the process has been slow and political corruption on all levels has led to much of the money being squandered or used inefficiently. And in the vacuum left by the FARC, a plethora of other dissident groups has risen up to battle over a region now largely ignored by the government. “The government isn’t living up to its promises,” said Father Jon Reina, one of the leaders of strikes that shut down the city in 2017 over frustration with a lack of infrastructure and investment. “Our problems are threefold: corruption; the drug trade; and an utter lack of economic opportunity for those who live here. This creates a cycle of violence that can only be addressed at the federal level.” Some here worry that the recent FARC fracture could worsen the situation in Valle de Cauca even if it doesn’t signal an official return to war. “When a youth with no education is given the opportunity to work for the narcos, he can earn more in a few weeks than he would otherwise earn in a two years working a minimum wage job,” said Molina. He worries that as the new FARC dissidents look for allies and foot-soldiers in their renewed war, this region is likely to be fertile ground for their recruiting efforts. “If the government doesn’t cultivate the peace, they will reap war,” Molina said. “Whether that war is officially acknowledged or not.” jc/ag"
Medium.com,Society,Rory Stewart May Have Just Lost The Conservatives the London Mayoral Election Before It’s Started,World,https://medium.com/black-isle-journalism/rory-stewart-may-have-just-lost-the-conservatives-the-london-mayoral-election-before-its-started-575ab7de43e7?source=topic_page---------475------------------1," R ory Stewart is seen as a popular politician in Westminster. Only a few months ago, he was running to be the next Conservative Party leader and Prime Minister. Seen as a moderate who was unlikely to win, he embarked on a campaign titled; #RoryWalks. He started a social media campaign that caught on very quickly capturing the public’s imagination. He did something that very few Tories ever do; go out on the streets and talk to the public. It proved popular, and was praised by politicians on all sides for being respectful and inclusive. However, some saw it as Stewart attempting to model himself as “one of us” so as to distance himself from his voting record. While he may have been proposing bold policies on social care, he was constantly reminded that his past voting record in backing austerity, showed he was simply another “party man”. In the leadership debates his rivals jumped on his Brexit plan. While Boris Johnson and Michael Gove were more than happy to say they’d allow the United Kingdom (UK) to leave the European Union (EU) on October 31st, Stewart pledged to never let that happen as can been seen from his appearance on Sky News below. Ultimately he ended up coming fifth in the leadership election with Boris Johnson eventually seeing off then foreign Secretary Jeremy Hunt in a vote of Conservative Party members. T hroughout the leadership race more and more details came out about what Stewart had done prior to becoming a Member of Parliament. After attending Eton, during which time he tuted Princes Harry and William, he went on to graduate from the prestigious Oxford University. Like his father, he joined the UK’s Foreign Office as a Diplomat and was sent to Indonesia. Following this posting he went to Montenegro following the the Kosovo War. He supported the US led invasion of Iraq in 2003 and that year say him become the Deputy Governor of the Iraqi region of Maysan. Unlike his American counterparts he didn’t hide inside a compound, but instead went out to talk to locals. With postings like these it is alleged that he was in fact a Mi6 Officer, something the MP himself denies. Not content with the postings of the UK Diplomatic Service, Stewart embarked on a walk across war-torn Afghanistan, which he wrote a book on, and visited Iran several times walking across the vast Persian country on his own. These trips have only added speculation to the claim of him being a British Spy. O n September 3rd 2019, Stewart and 20 other Tory MPs backed an opposition motion in Parliament to take control of the order paper. This move was launched so that MPs opposed a a no-deal Brexit to create a new law effectively stopping the Prime Minister taking the UK out of the EU without a deal. Conservative MPs had been warned that should they vote against the government, they would lose the “whip”. When you hear about “the whip,” people tend to be referring to a document which is sent to MPs and peers from the whips (MPs) and highlights upcoming parliamentary business. It contains official instruction from leaders about how to vote on legislation, such as whether they should vote for or against a bill or an amendment. MPs of each Party usually vote “with the whip” in Parliament. Losing the whip is considered very serious. It effectively means that an MP or Peer in the House of Lords, are expelled from their party because they have not followed strict instruction from the leadership. As expected Stewart and the 20 other Tory MPs did have the whip withdrawn for refusing to back the government. Ironically Rory Stewart received the news via text as he was receiving GQ’s “Politician of The Year” award. Stewart remained defiant and pledged to continue serving his constituents as an Independent MP. T oday, October 4th, Rory Stewart made the not totally unexpected announcement that he would not be standing as an MP at the next General election. He cites that as he is barred from standing as a Conservative candidate, he wouldn’t want to damage his Tory friends chances. Writing in The Cumberland and Westmorland Herald, Mr Stewart said: “As you will be aware, I am no longer allowed to run as Conservative MP in Penrith and The Border. “Because I have loved the constituency so much, I had considered standing as an independent; but I have decided that I wouldn’t want to run against those Conservative members who have been such wonderful colleagues over the last ten years. “I am hugely grateful to all the members of my local party who have written in support, and to the Chair and President of my local party, who have resigned from the Conservative Party in support of my position. “But it should be no secret that there are also local party members who would rather I did not run again. I don’t want to test loyalties, destroy old friendships or push any of these issues any further.” Robert Craig, president of the Penrith and The Border Conservative Association, said Mr Stewart would “possibly” not have made the decision if he still had the Tory whip. “I suppose had that changed… it seems to have become clear that, that wasn’t going to change and he has other ambitions.” Mr Craig praised Mr Stewart as an “inspirational” MP and criticised Mr Johnson for taking the party in an “extreme” direction. J ust over an hour after the news had broken that Mr Stewart had resigned as a Conservative, the independent MP announced that rather than leaving politics, he was going to run as an independent candidate in the 2020 London Mayoral Election. He released an open letter in the Evening Standard to outline to Londoners why he is standing. In the letter he says; “ I would like your vote so that we can transform this great capital — the most intricate, diverse and astonishing city on the planet, the financial centre of the world, and the cradle of our democracy — together.” He went on to cite his experience of managing big projects abroad; “ It didn’t matter whether I was clearing 30,000 truck-loads of garbage out of the old city of Kabul, or whether I was introducing the plastic bag tax or reducing violence in an East London prison — I learned how to understand the problem clearly, grasp the solution, and then have the energy and determination to drive it through.” This news will come as a massive blow to the Conservative Candidate for London Mayor; Shaun Bailey. The Tories have invested heavily in Bailey’s campaign as they are keen to regain control of City Hall from Labour’s Sadiq Khan. Speaking at The Conservative Party Conference this week Bailey went on the attack; “What London really needs is a full time mayor, someone focused on making the city a safer place to live. Whose ambition is not to improve their own public image, but to lift up millions of people in London and show them that they have another choice.” The Tory hopeful has already been seen a divisive after a 2005 pamphlet he authored emerged in which he attacked Muslims and Hindus. Bailey complained about the cultural practices being taught in UK schools appering to blame it on immigrants. He said; “You bring your children to school and they learn far more about Diwali than Christmas. I speak to the people who are from Brent and they’ve been having Muslim and Hindi days off. What it does is rob Britain of its community. Without our community, we slip into a crime-riddled cesspool,” Accusations of Islamophobia are the last thing Conservative Party HQ (CCHQ) needed. In the 2016 Mayor election, Tory candidate Zac Goldsmith was widely condemned for running an Islamophobic campaign against Labour’s Sadiq Khan. Bailey hit back in the only way he knows; by attacking Labour. His spokeswoman told The Guardian at the time; “Shaun has made it his life’s work to help those from migrant and disadvantaged communities, and to suggest otherwise is ludicrous. “As someone who has received racist abuse from the Labour party, who, let’s not forget, branded the community worker a ‘token ghetto boy’, this is a little rich.” With Rory Stewart now throwing his hat into the ring, many commentators have already signalled that is has killed off any chance Shaun Bailey had of becoming Mayor of London. They are split on whether Stewart can actually win, or rather that he will take votes away from the Conservatives and hand Sadiq Khan another win. The Liberal Democrats may also be facing problems as Stewart’s centrist policies are have been widely praised by some Lib Dem supporters. While there may be uncertainty on whether Rory Stewart can actually win the election next spring, there appears to be absolutely none when it comes to writing off Shaun Bailey’s chances. R ory Stewart is popular across all the parties. He could see support from Centre right Labour voters, all the way to those on the left of the Conservative Party. LBC presenter James O’Brien read out a very interesting message from a listener this morning. It said; “Perhaps Rory Stewart is piggybacking the London Mayoral job like Boris Johnson did, with a view to another bid at becoming Prime Minister once the current mess has calmed down.” O’Brien remarked that Stewart might not even need to win, rather just running a strong campaign might increases his chances. Whatever the reasons, Boris Johnson and his supporters may well be regretting expelling the popular MP from Penrith, After all, it may have just cost them what they consider as one of the “Jewels In The Crown” of politics."
Medium.com,Society,New Report: Somalians Killed in US Attack Were Civilian Farmers,World,https://medium.com/citizen-truth/new-report-somalians-killed-in-us-attack-were-civilian-farmers-9f507262a40c?source=topic_page---------476------------------1," A new report from Amnesty International finds that three Somalian men killed in a U.S. airstrike in March were civilian farmers with no connections to terrorist groups, despite claims from the U.S. military’s African Command (AFRICOM) that the men were members of the terrorist group Al-Shabaab. Amnesty also found that AFRICOM failed to investigate the matter after a Foreign Policy journalist provided evidence that at least one of the slain man was a civilian. “It’s bad enough that the U.S. Africa Command appears not to know who its air strikes are actually killing and maiming in its secretive war in Somalia. But it’s reprehensible that AFRICOM offers no way for those affected to contact it and has failed to reach out to the families of victims after its version of events was called into question in this case,” said Abdullahi Hassan, Amnesty International’s Somalia Researcher. Critics argue the case represents a disregard for human life and reckless use of the word terrorist, as AFRICOM has provided no evidence of its claim. Amnesty interviewed 11 people about the incident, including witnesses, family members, and a company where one of them worked. Everyone they spoke to was “adamant that none of the men was a member of Al-Shabaab,” and Amnesty notes the group did not get involved with the slain farmer’s burials, which the group usually does when its own members are killed. “This is just one of many cases of the U.S. military wantonly tarnishing large parts of the Somali population with the ‘terrorist’ label,” said Hassan. “No thought is given to the civilian victims or the plight of their grieving families left behind.” Amnesty writes that the three men leave behind 19 children between them. President Trump signed an executive order in early 2017 declaring south Somalia an “area of active hostilities,” since then AFRICOM has carried out at least 131 strikes. The Intercept’s Murtaza Hussain wrote on Tuesday that one of the most overlooked aspects of the Trump era has been the increase in civilian deaths in Somalia and other wars abroad. Hussain writes that while the Pentagon has always downplayed civilian deaths in conflicts like Iraq and Afghanistan, with independent organizations finding numbers vastly higher, the Trump administration has overseen a particularly sharp uptake in non-combatant casualties. According to the Watchdog group Airwars, civilian casualties in Iraq and Syria increased more than 200 percent between 2016 and 2017. Hussain points to the recent massacre of 40 pine nut farmers in Afghanistan and the fact that U.S.-allied forces have killed more Afghani civilians in 2019 than the Taliban as evidence of the Trump administration’s unrestrained bloodletting. Trump has loosened rules of engagement, defended war criminals and punished prosecutors investigating them. “Does this matter? Do the extremely violent deaths of innocent people — wedding guests and farmers in distant countries — factor into the moral calculus we use to judge Trump as being fit or unfit for office?

Medium.com,Society,Crypto May Be the Future of Humanitarian Aid,World,https://onezero.medium.com/crypto-may-be-the-future-of-humanitarian-aid-e1556511788f?source=topic_page---------480------------------1," video from San Cristóbal, Venezuela, dated March 2019 shows a never-ending line of people waiting on the street. They are all waiting, the narrator tells us, for their turn at the bank, hoping to withdraw money to buy food and goods before hyperinflation drives the value of Venezuela’s currency further into the dirt. Venezuela’s political and economic crisis has been escalating since 2010. President Nicolas Maduro’s refusal to declare a state of national emergency means aid groups can’t intervene on the people’s behalf, and in February 2019 the government began to block shipments of supplies donated by U.S.-backed aid groups. Maduro feared the supplies would foster favor toward the U.S. and the leader it had recognized as legitimate in his place, Juan Guaido. Many Venezuelan citizens have tried to leave the country, some hiding rolls of dollars in their hair to keep it from being stolen at the border. Venezuelans need a way to access the world economic marketplace that bypasses the regime’s control, a way to attain a degree of financial independence. And for some citizens of Venezuela, help has arrived in the form of bitcoin. In countries where the government controls their people by controlling the money, digital currency can be a powerful solution for the oppressed. As a cryptocurrency, bitcoin is built on a decentralized electronic ledger called a blockchain. That ledger isn’t controlled by any one person, but by multiple users around the globe running “nodes,” copies of the entire ledger, on their computers, which can’t be cut off or censored. Cryptocurrencies are stored in digital wallets, which can send or receive bitcoin from anywhere in the world — bypassing banks and paying far less in cross-border transaction fees. In countries where the government controls citizens by controlling the money, digital currency can be a powerful solution for the oppressed. Alex Gladstein, chief strategist at the Human Rights Foundation and vice president of the Oslo Freedom Forum, says bitcoin is doing a lot to help the billions of people living in authoritarian countries. He told OneZero that around 95% of bitcoin transactions he sees are made under authoritarian governments because of the need for a better economic system. “It’s extremely early,” he says, “But what we’re seeing is really interesting.” People who have never had a bank account are figuring out how to use bitcoin as a store of value, exchanging it person-to-person for fiat currency or goods, or sending it across borders in the form of remittance payments. Sending money abroad securely is vital, as theft is rampant at the Venezuelan border. “It’s about liquidity,” Gladstein says, adding that the Venezuelan border was “totally lawless.” Venezuelans now need only a smartphone and internet access to trade bitcoin or other cryptocurrencies. They use WhatsApp to pay for goods or fiat currency, use LocalBitcoins to trade it, or the encrypted messaging app Signal to send currency to others. That allows them to be paid for freelance work they do online, save money to leave the country, and send money abroad without the regime knowing. Authoritarian regimes are also trying to use cryptocurrency, though with less success than their people. Maduro launched a digital currency called the Petro in October 2018, supposedly backed by Venezuela’s rich oil reserves. The government required citizens to use it when buying a passport, and ordered the country’s largest bank to open Petro desks, yet the currency still hasn’t taken off with the general public. A region near the tiny town of Alta Pereira, where 5 billion barrels of oil were to be drawn from the earth to back the project, turned out to be nothing but a couple of dilapidated oil rigs, and the people living there didn’t even know what the Petro was. China also has a state crypto ready to launch as of 2019, and Iran has been mulling one since at least 2017. Several organizations are using cryptocurrency to channel aid into Venezuela. Payment company Airtm started Airdrop Venezuela with the goal of sending $10 in cryptocurrency to 100,000 Venezuelan citizens via their app. It has raised more than $300,000 so far and already started distributing money. CEO Ruben Galindo told OneZero he decided to start his company after seeing banks freeze citizen’s assets with no warning, completely cutting them off from their money. In 2001, the Argentine government did exactly that to prevent a run on the banks and forbade withdrawals from U.S. dollar-backed accounts. Today, 65% of current Airtm users are Venezuelans. “Our aim is to become the biggest bank in the world,” says Galindo. Bitcoin Venezuela and eatBCH both accept donations in bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies, and then exchange that money for local currency to be distributed to local people to buy food and supplies. “Crypto is borderless, it works everywhere, with everyone. That’s huge,” says José, one of the co-founders of eatBCH, who did not want to give his surname for fear of reprisals. He’s enthusiastic about the effect crypto has had on Venezuelan citizens through charity efforts like this, and promotes the project on Twitter. “There have been times when donors feel moved by someone in one of our pictures [and] contact us and then specially donate to that person or family, helping them immensely. There was one guy… when we told him that the meal we were giving him was free of any attachment, he started jumping around and thanking God.” “If you tried to send that money through the bank you’d have the cops knocking on your door.” GiveCrypto, a San Francisco-based nonprofit co-founded by the CEO of crypto exchange Coinbase, has raised $4 million in cryptocurrency donations, and claim 100% of that money is donated to people in need. From February to April of this year, the company made small donations of cryptocurrency to families in Venezuela, many of whom regularly have to skip meals because of the cost of food. And it isn’t just Venezuela. Gladstein claims that an acquaintance in London used bitcoin to pay a relative’s medical bills in Tehran. It was the only avenue available to send cross-border payments given the current economic sanctions on Iran. “If you tried to send that money through the bank you’d have the cops knocking on your door,” says Gladstein. Chinese importers in Russia are using cryptocurrency to bypass the government’s strict capital controls, buying up millions in a crypto called Tether designed to maintain parity with the U.S. dollar and sending it across the Chinese border from Russia. The Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation teamed up with the creators of cryptocurrency XRP last year to create Mojaloop, a digital payment platform designed for users without access to banks. Physical bitcoin ATMs that let users buy, sell, and send cryptocurrency without a smartphone have surged in popularity in developing countries, although they present a rare weak point, as governments can shut down or remove the machines. The distributed ledger technology (DLT) on which cryptocurrencies are built can be used to keep any kind of public record, and not just financial transactions. Humanitarian organizations are piloting some exciting uses for DLT. Humanitarian Policy Group (HPG), a division of U.K. think tank the Overseas Development Institute, describes a recent project called Whiteflag which lets humanitarian groups share sensitive information such as the locations of hospitals on a secured blockchain. Only trusted entities with permission to access that blockchain can view the information. The World Food Programme’s Building Blocks food voucher project is built on the Ethereum blockchain, and recorded $1 billion in cash-based transfers in 2017, according to the HPG. Cryptocurrencies are by no means perfect. Several high-profile hacks of crypto exchanges in recent years have lost investors a good deal of money, and the same anonymity that helps the oppressed can also aid criminal activity such as money laundering. “People have figured out how to use it to their benefit, but it’s totally agnostic; bad people can use it too,” Gladstein says. Power outages and restricted access to technology in developing countries are also major obstacles to more widespread cryptocurrency access. To reach mainstream adoption, policymakers also have to balance regulation and consumer protection — a difficult prospect given the decentralized nature of digital currencies. This technology is in the earliest stages, especially in the humanitarian field. But it is helping people get around the economic restrictions authoritarian regimes use to control their citizens. And according to Galindo, people under authoritarian rule are good at finding ways to do the impossible. “You have to be a hustler to get around the problems you have as a Venezuelan commoner,” he said. “Cryptocurrencies present a great benefit to the people there.”"

Medium.com,Society,US Corporate Leaders to Attend Saudi Conference One Year After Khashoggi Murder,World,https://medium.com/citizen-truth/us-corporate-leaders-to-attend-saudi-conference-one-year-after-khashoggi-murder-32f4361f3e32?source=topic_page---------482------------------1," Last year, top executives and investors protested the annual investment conference in Saudi Arabia known as ‘Davos in the Desert’ after the savage execution of Washington Post journalist Jamal Khashoggi was revealed to have been ordered by Mohammad bin Salman, the Saudi crown prince. Although Wednesday marks the one year anniversary of Khashoggi’s murder, Wall Street appears to have warmed back up to the Kingdom, with the Washington Post reporting that senior executives from JPMorgan Chase, Goldman Sachs, Blackrock, Citigroup, and other major firms are slated to attend this year’s conference. “It’s not a principled stance for businesses to stand against the Saudi murderers of Jamal Khashoggi until they hope people have forgotten about him (which in any event they haven’t),” said Kenneth Roth, executive director of Human Rights Watch. Last October, Blackrock CEO Larry Fink was one of many executives who made a big deal out of refusing to attend Saudi Arabia’s Future Investment Initiative, also known as Davos in the Desert. Last November, Fink was honored by the International Rescue Committee with the charity’s Humanitarian Award for his supposedly principled stance. Critics believe Fink and other CEO’s were merely protecting their brands from bad PR in the wake of Khashoggi’s murder last year, and have judged that international outcry has now quieted enough to continue pursuing profits in the Kingdom. “The greed of Goldman Sachs, JPMorgan, Citigroup and BlackRock is insatiable,” tweeted Senator Bernie Sanders. “Who cares if the Saudis are starving millions of Yemeni civilians or that our planet faces a climate emergency? Profiting off of $1.5 trillion in Saudi oil is just too important.” The conference is scheduled to take place at the same Ritz-Carlton hotel in Riyadh where bin-Salman imprisoned hundreds of rival Saudi leaders last year in a move to solidify his power over the country. “More than 150 executives have confirmed their attendance, the list shows, including more than 40 executives representing U.S. companies,” according to the Washington Post. “The head of Russia’s sovereign wealth fund was attending, along with other executives who represent major banks, tech companies, business conglomerates and defense contractors from China, India, the United Arab Emirates and several European states.” An invitation letter reviewed by the Post boasted of the ‘unparalleled networking among CEOs, world leaders, and experts,’ the event will offer. Trump’s son-in-law Jared Kushner, whose close relationship with bin Salman has emboldened the prince to claim he has Kushner “in his pocket”, is reported to lead the US delegation to the conference. Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin, who pulled out last year, may also attend, as per the Post. The Washington Post speculates that beyond arms deals and investment from the kingdom’s $320 billion sovereign wealth fund, corporate executives are especially interested in the coming initial public offering for Saudi national oil company Aramco, which is estimated to have a valuation between $1.5 and $2 trillion. JPMorgan Chase, Goldman Sachs and Citigroup are among the top banks the Kingdom has chosen to underwrite the listing, whose top executives are scheduled to attend the conference. Critics argue the quiet enthusiasm of top US firms in pursuing business with the authoritarian Saudi monarchy shows the moral bankruptcy of modern globalized capitalism. Additionally, while CEOs like JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon publicly call for action on climate change, they spend hundreds of billions financing new fossil fuel production and compete for advisory roles at Saudi Aramco despite the seriousness of the climate crisis and the crimes of the crown prince. “Saudi Arabia must not be allowed to cover up this murder and go about business as usual, detaining and harassing its critics,” said Joel Simon, executive director of the Committee to Protect Journalists. “The U.S. must make public what the intelligence community knew about threats to Khashoggi and who it has determined is responsible for his murder.

Medium.com,Society,Blazing Bolsonarism — How Politics Influences the Environment,World,https://medium.com/blank-101/blazing-bolsonarism-how-politics-influences-the-environment-44c98ea0dad5?source=topic_page---------484------------------1," Written by : Heera Shetty ; Researched by : Rohan Kumar In July, a reporter asked the Brazilian President, Jair Bolsonaro, how to combine agricultural development and environmental protection. Bolsonaro’s reply? “It’s enough to eat a little less. You talk about environmental pollution. It’s enough to poop every other day. That will be better for the whole world.” This is not the worst comment by the Brazilian government with regards to the environment. What’s worse, it’s these guys who are responsible for over two-thirds of the Amazon rainforest. Popularly called the ‘lungs of the world’, the Amazon forest is responsible for more than 6% of the world’s oxygen. It also holds 15% of the world’s biodiversity and helps regulate rainfall at local and global levels. In today’s world, it is the most important ecosystem of the world, keeping global temperatures from skyrocketing as well. And right now, it is being burnt. In this year alone, almost 73,000 fires have been recorded, and this is 85% more fires than were seen in the whole of 2018. These are the worst fires in almost a decade, and satellite images show the spread of smoke & carbon monoxide to neighboring countries as well. 20% of the Amazon has already been cleared, and if we lose just 5% more, the Amazon will become drier and Savannah-like, and the changes would be irreversible. At first, scientists thought that the tipping point would be 40%. However, due to increasing temperatures due to global warming, scientists believe that the tipping point is now 25%. If we trigger that, there would be almost 200 billion tonnes of carbon dioxide being released to the atmosphere and no Amazon rainforest to absorb it. This shift would result in vast amounts of carbon to be released, having catastrophic effects on our climate. Put simply, we’re in deep trouble. How did we ever get to this point? According to the World Wildlife Fund for Nature (WWF), climate change may have increased the drying effect of dead trees. However, the fires in Brazilian Amazon have been caused due to deforestation by humans. What’s more, 80% of this deforestation is for cattle ranching. Amazon Brazil provides one-third of global cattle supply and putting the Amazon into ‘productive use’ by making it available for cattle grazing was a primary agenda of Bolsonaro’s government. Environmentalist groups have not shied away from blaming Brazilian President Bolsonaro for the irreparable damage done to the rainforest. Greenpeace, a non-governmental environmental organization, even went on to call the President and his government, “a threat to the climate equilibrium”. This is because a very dangerous form of politics called Bolsonarism has assumed complete control in Brazil. During his campaign for presidency, Bolsonaro promised to exploit the rainforest to ‘boost Brazil’s economy’, and now that he’s President, he’s kept his word. Just half a year into his tenure, deforestation has gone up by 84%, and any funding towards environmental organizations had been cut off. The number one priority of Bolsonarism is to convert the public lands of the rainforest to private cattle grazing properties that will only profit a few. These lands, most of which lie in the Amazon, include the public areas settled by indigenous people, people whose livelihood depends on the forest. The loss of the Amazon affects them the most. President Bolsanoro, however, remains stubborn as ever in accepting his role in the fires claiming it is the dry season of ‘quiemada’, and even went on to say that NGO’s are the ones causing the fires to blame it all on him as revenge for cutting their funding. It’s not just the President, however. Ricardo Salles, the Minister of the Environment in Brazil, tweeted (very conveniently) to say that the fires were caused by ‘dry weather, wind and heat’. Needless to say, no Environmental Minister in the past 30 years has enjoyed as much autonomy as Ricardo Salles. His claim was quickly rebuked by Haley Brink, CNN meteorologist, who said that the fires are definitely “human-induced”. After what seemed to be an eternity, President Bolsonaro finally spoke up about the fires in a Facebook Live Broadcast saying that the government lacks the resources to fight wildfires in the Amazon region. He, however, added that the government is running an investigation and will take up measures to curb the fires. And yet, it is still not clear what those measures actually are. The Group of Seven (G7), an international organization offered up to £22 million in aid which was rejected by the President Bolsanoro. Why? Because French President Emmanuel Macron had insulted him. Clearly, the President’s ego is more important than saving the lungs of the world. Bolsanoro’s chief of staff even commented that they were ‘thankful’, but they felt that the resources could be more useful in reforesting Europe. As the blame game continues, the Amazon rainforest, the vessel that holds a massive amount of the world’s carbon dioxide, continues to burn. ‘Measures’ aside, all President Bolsonaro has done is exploit the resources of the Amazon, which climate scientists worldwide agree is the most valuable asset Earth possesses. Bolsonarism is not just a threat to Brazil but to the entire world, because it destroys the Amazon, which is strategically vital to combat global warming. The Amazon fires show us how much politics influences environmental climate change, and how crucial our choice of the people who represent us. This alone is a reminder that it is high time we stop ignoring climate change and actually do something about it. On an individual level, we can eat less meat and reduce our plastic consumption. However, what we truly need is a global structural change, because the world is not going to wait for us, and we may realize that a bit too late."
Medium.com,Society,Save British Democracy by Nationalising the House of Lords,World,https://medium.com/@luketmurphy/save-british-democracy-by-nationalising-the-house-of-lords-2113f011425b?source=topic_page---------485------------------1," In his book ‘Heroic Failure: Brexit And The Politics of Pain’, Fintan O’ Toole concludes that the UK: “cannot be governed without radical social and constitutional change.’ and that, ‘[the]model of the British state is sanctified by the vestiges of explicitly pre-democratic forms of rule — the monarchy and the unelected House of Lords.” But what does the House of Lords actually do? If I had a pound for every time I heard someone say that then I would have nearly seven pounds. In one line, the House of Lords is the second chamber of Parliament and has the power to suggest changes to legislation sent to them by the MPs in the House of Commons. Sometimes this process is thought of as ‘correcting the homework’ of the House of Commons. But, the House of Lords can not override the Commons when it comes to making primary laws. This is because the Commons is elected at general elections by us and the Lords are just appointed. If the Lords could override the elected commoners, we would not live in a democracy. It would be something else. Without going over old ground, governments have been trying to reform the Lords for ages — at least a century. I will now try to summarise this century of debate: - “I can’t believe the House of Lords is unelected. It’s a fucking outrage in this day and age.” David Lloyd George, Liberal Party 1911. - “I can’t believe the House of Lords is unelected. It’s a fucking outrage in this day and age.” Nick Clegg, Liberal Democrat Party, 2011. And the argument against reform has always gone something like this: “Well, to be fair to the Lords, there is actually a lot of expertise there from people who don’t want the hassle of running in an election. And we should spend our time thinking about schools or hospitals, the First World War or Brexit, and not waste time fiddling with the House of Lords. People don’t want to elect more politicians. It works fine as it is.” The Establishment, Always. But I think the House of Lords could save us. It could make our democracy and our system of government better. To do this, we should bring it into a sort of public ownership. The UK has one of the most centralised governments in the world. We elect MPs to renew Trident and councillors to change bin collection days. There is nothing in between, and nearly everything is done at Westminster. (Except the three devolved governments which I will come to). In the UK, about 80% of tax money is spent by central government in Westminster. Whereas in Spain this is about 30%. This means that in Spain, just as an example, government for regions and their equivalents of city/county councils can spend taxpayer’s money in what, they view as, the best way for the local area. Then they are held to account by voters, as you do with any other politicians. I’m not arguing for regional assemblies in the UK. But there is a problem of representation in this country. The ‘First Past The Post’ voting system used at our general elections means a lot of voters waste their vote because they live in safe seats. And without any other serious, yet accessible, level of government, it is not hard to imagine that some British people feel unrepresented. The UK has had almost exactly the same system of government since 1707. All that has changed since then is an expansion of who can vote for MPs at General Election to poor people, women and young people. There has been no real change in the actual system. This is good in some ways. But one of the repeated reasons given for the Brexit vote is that it was an ‘anti-establishment’ vote. It is now common wisdom to say, ‘people were motivated to vote Leave because the government was not listening to them, and it was the only opportunity for those that thought they were being ignored to be listened to.’ Well, we’re all listening now. The UK is also, at times, absurdly asymmetrical. Scottish residents, with their vote to elect MSPs to what is now a quite powerful parliament (it can now change various taxes) are more represented than people in Wales which has a less powerful assembly, Northern Ireland that has an assembly that has been suspended for over two years, and England which, as a nation equivalent to Scotland, has no political representation whatsoever. At the same time, there is a general point to be made about the House of Lords. It continues to exist in its present form — a hodgepodge of aristocrats and retired politicians — because no compelling vision has been given for what it could or should be. The argument is mostly crying about it being ‘unelected’ but less about which people should be elected, by who and for what purpose. In this sense, the House of Lords should be viewed as a blank canvas. Reform the House of Lords so it represents the people of the UK better. So it represents our entire economy and culture better. And it represents our citizens, nations and regions better. Let’s reform the House of Lords so the public feels it belongs to them, that it could have influence over it and use it as a new mechanism to air their views meaningfully — or even be in it. And let’s reform the House of Lords so expertise is a condition and not an accident. All whilst never stepping on the toes of the House of Commons which is and will always be superior. The concept that the Lords ‘marks the homework’ of the Commons is good, but let’s change the profile and motivation of the people who do the marking. The House of Lords could be reformed so that voters have different types of representation. This is the ultimate question. What is the current point of the House of Lords? Is it to provide representation of some sort? Or is to provide expert marking of MP’s work? The question has various answers because we never took the time to design it, make efficient or optimal. Maybe our government would be better if we took the time to improve it. Maybe the people would feel better about their own government if we took this time. I propose four types of Lord: This comes with your day job. For as long as you have the role in real life you can sit in the Lords. Examples include: And many more I may, perhaps through my own bias, have missed. Political scientists among you may think this resembles ‘Corporatism.’ Briefly defined as the domination of society by powerful groups. However, Lords from the above organisations would sit alongside individuals representing themselves or their expertise, as well as geographical non-constituency areas like ‘Cornwall.’ So I would say there is no domination of groups here, we are merely trying to get the UK’s different peoples, groups and communities to talk to each other better and reform the membership of those who mark the homework of the real democrats — MPs in the Commons. 2. Elected Elected for terms of 5 years. To represent non-constituency areas such as cities, regions and nations. For example, Nottingham has 11 constituency MPs spread across the county and the city. Citizens could also elect a Lord to represent ‘City of Nottingham’, ‘Nottinghamshire’, the ‘East Midlands’ region, ‘England’ or the even more historical areas like ‘Mercia’. Lords for ‘Cornwall,’ ‘South West of England’ ‘Scotland’ and ‘The Peak District’ can all be elected. And they will overlap. Overlapping is fine because it already exists. Only MPs in the Commons need a strict, definitive and exclusive boundary of a constituency because it is from this connection that their sovereign democratic mandate is born. But it would be fine for a Lord for ‘England,’ a Lord for ‘Merseyside’ and a Lord from the ‘University of Liverpool’ to have productive opinions on legislation before sending it back to the Commons. After all, if we’re going to have an asymmetrical political system, then at least let’s make it relevant and useful. Elected Lords will sit in the Lords to debate legislation from the points of view of these areas they represent. By definition, they will have a different perspective on the problems of different areas, above or below the constituency, and how they interlink with other areas or issues, unforeseen or unrepresented in the Commons. This would widen democratic representation across the country and open another door for citizens to lobby or raise their concerns if they feel their MP isn’t listening, or if their MP says ‘this issue is not relevant to my constituency.’ But it would not infringe on the ultimate democratic primacy of MPs who represent their constituents in the House of Commons and make the constitutionally superior decision when it comes to lawmaking. Elected Lords are there to mark their homework only. 3. Appointed This would broadly remain as now, appointed by parties. The appropriate reform to make would be that appointments must be explicitly in the public interest. This is to ensure people who may not fancy running in an election like Doreen Lawrence and Tanni Grey-Thompson are still recognised. But for reform to work, cronyism must be held at bay. Of course, you could write a convincing paragraph to justify anything is in the public interest, so it would require the Appointments Commission, which endorses Lords for appointment, to be fully independent of government, and able to operate with its own charter and rules. Like the BBC. The Appointments Commission would need to be powerful enough to reject appointments if the nominee is not sufficiently justified as being in the public interest — if it smelt, felt and sounded like cronyism without public benefit. Yes, some of these would be former politicians, there’s nothing wrong with that, they can be beneficial. But at least there is a) a system in place for why they are there and b) do not dominate the composition and are part of a wider, more varied, membership. Currently these ‘working’ or ‘people’s peers’ are there for life. This should not change as long-term thinking should be encouraged. Retirement or de-appointment for criminality or misconduct should, of course, be possible. 4. Hereditary The revolution will not be televised. 90% of hereditary lords were abolished under New Labour and 10% remained after arduous negotiation and ultimately compromise. Like it or not the United Kingdom’s story is of many things — including aristocracy. House of Lords reform is about better representing and better governing the country so these, currently 91, Hereditary Lords should stay. Besides, they are voted in by the hereditary community — an example pour encourager les autres. These four types of Lord could be similarly sized — but this can be flexible. Like now, most Lords will only attend debates sporadically or when relevant. Cutting down the numbers for the sake of it is not an end in itself. There are 755 Lords at the moment and you’d save a bit of money if this was reduced. But reform should be a positive act where we broaden and optimise the membership of those marking the homework. And it can all sit in the beautiful palace of Westminster, its home. But it can also travel and help engage the people in the spirit of democracy, representation and expertise. It can take 3 days of debate to Grimsby and Lincolnshire. Regionally elected Lords from Falmouth can host proceedings when they visit Cornwall. A special sitting can take place during the opening of Blackpool Illuminations and the Eisteddfod Genedlaethol Cymru, so no citizen will miss the opportunity to see the institution of Parliament in action. And when they come back to London after meeting the people and our communities, who may or may not have felt historically marginalised, they can use these experiences to mark the homework of the Commons better. Make our laws better and our government think again, better. And the mother of Parliaments will be a little less dusty, a little less dimly lit and a little less alien. The current House of Lords effect is something that other countries struggle to replicate but, if asked, might like to draw on. Legislatures and second chambers around the world suffer increasingly from permanent gridlock and hyper-partisanship yet the current House of Lords stands out with many independent non-partisan ‘expert’ members adding value but unable to block legislation repeatedly proposed by the superior Commons. Its life membership offers the breathing space to stand back from the short-termism that plagues so much of government’s decision making. I am complimenting the current House of Lords which is why I have not argued for it to be scrapped or totally elected. But the painful crisis the UK is now experiencing is despite the House of Lords’ positive attributes. We should embrace the spirit of expertise and potential for different types of representation in this place as the first positive step into a new era. Brexit could bring a sort of ‘zero hour’ in British history without similar precedent. At that crucial time, we should neither forget the strengths of our system nor ignore the great blind spots the political class has which in large part brought about the causes of Brexit. Most importantly, we should have vision to create government in a public, robust and relevant way. The House of Lords is an obvious catalyst for this change."
Medium.com,Society,Why Do We Care About Ukraine?,World,https://medium.com/swlh/why-do-we-care-about-ukraine-4ffbd9dd6982?source=topic_page---------486------------------1," Ukraine Is now constantly in our news. This story is about why Ukraine matters. U
kraine, also known as ‘the Ukraine,’ has been in the news a lot lately. Between Trump’s latest scandal and the Russian aggression starting in 2014, the obvious question is: Why is America involved in Ukraine? This is a very good question. Since 2014, the obvious answer is that we have been trying to deter Russian aggression. Now, we have some issues regarding Trump’s criminal behavior. One of these issues has been heavily covered in the media. The other issue that I would consider more troubling has not received much media coverage. The Ukrainians stopped cooperating with the Mueller investigation in order to get Javelin missiles back in 2018. See Ukraine, Seeking U.S. Missiles, Halted Cooperation With Mueller Investigation from the New York Times. In 2018, Trump was probably going to stop the delivery of these missiles if the Ukrainians kept cooperating with the investigation into his involvement with Russian interference in the 2016 election. Now, we know that Trump was trying to get the Ukrainians to help him create dirt to use against his perceived rival in the 2020 election. Ukraine is ‘between a rock and a hard place.’ If they don’t help Trump, they leave themselves defenseless against the Russians. If the Ukrainians help Trump, they can’t expect any help from a future Democratic administration. If they help Trump, they leave Putin’s operation in the 2016 election up for debate. If a Democrat is elected, Russia’s involvement with the Trump campaign in 2016 and beyond may be exposed. Russia may be subjected to even heavier sanctions from America. Russia is not concerned with the small number of Javelins sold to Ukraine. The Javelins deter the Russians from moving further into Ukraine, but if Russia wants to completely take Ukraine, the small amount of military assistance America is providing will not stop them. Trump and Russia have clear positions. Ukraine doesn’t know what to do."
Medium.com,Society,It’s Not (Just) About Climate,World,https://medium.com/@alex.lamb/its-not-just-about-climate-a34ef4baa60?source=topic_page---------487------------------1," The Climate Emergency is finally getting the attention it deserves. Even as I write, I can hear the huge protest outside my window as of hundreds of students and school children campaign their hearts out, trying to make a difference. I’m delighted and relieved that so much is finally happening. But I also feel a cold certainty that protest alone won’t save us. The human race is faced with a network of tightly-linked problems more complex than anything we’ve previously known. And that network is already getting in the way of our best attempts to repair the damage our species has caused. If you don’t believe me, ask yourself this: how is it that in the face of such obvious and escalating danger, that resistance to the climate reality is more vehement than ever? Why are we still faced with farmers setting fire to the Amazon, oil companies looking to drill the Arctic, and flat-out denials of scientifically-established facts from leaders of the world’s most powerful nations? As the facts get clearer, it seems our collective behavior just gets worse. It’s easy to point the finger at corporate greed as the cause of this, but how does that greed actually work? It’s increasingly clear that in the world we’re making, there’ll be nowhere for tycoons to spend their money and nothing for them to spend it on. Furthermore, how are these tycoons securing the votes of populations guaranteed to die like flies if the status quo is maintained? I’d propose that we need a deeper explanation of what’s going on. Only when we understand the bigger picture will we be able to take our determination to affect change and direct in a way that erodes the barricades of misinformation rising before us. In this article, I aim to give you my best sense of how we can achieve that, channeling everything I’ve learned in research on both complex systems and human behavior, from across half a dozen academic disciplines, and incorporating ten years of sustained investigation. My journey to understanding this problem had an unusual start. It began with a quiet conversation with a science fiction writer near the end of his life. As a boy, I’d been enchanted by the work of author Jack Vance but never expected to meet him. Then, quite by surprise, while I was living in Berkeley about a decade ago, I got the chance to spend some precious evenings with him at his home in Oakland. It was one of those rare chances we get to meet our heroes. By the time I met Jack, he was in his nineties, blind, and only partially mobile. Nevertheless he was still sharp as a tack, witty, and a capable jazz musician. Because of his physical limitations, he’d spent a significant amount of his later years listening to talk radio, most notably: Rush Limbaugh. By the time I found myself talking with him about climate change, his opinions had skewed hard to the right. When I suggested to him that climate change was real, he challenged me. “Have you looked at the data yourself?” he asked. “Or are you just repeating something others have told you?” Of course, I hadn’t done the research and admitted as much. “Then how do you really know?” he said. Meeting Jack was so important to me that I couldn’t help but take his words to heart. So I started studying. It helped I had a science background myself and that my wife was doing a postdoc at UC Berkeley, granting me access to scientists from a broad spread of disciplines. From where I stood, I had both the training and the opportunity to examine the data and talk to experts on everything from climate science to social psychology. What I quickly concluded was that our situation actually had relatively little to do with rising temperatures. Don’t get me wrong, the climate crisis is absolutely real, but there’s plenty more going on. We’re facing staggering levels of biodiversity loss, with about half of the species in the world that were around in 1970 now irretrievably lost. This makes the current rate of extinction around a hundred times faster than the process that killed off the dinosaurs. The garbage patch in the North Pacific is now about twice the size of Texas and microplastics have made their way into every step of the food chain, disturbing food-webs everywhere. At the same time, through our use of fertilizers, we’ve declared war on pollinators, causing a mass die-off of bees and other insects. That same die-off is now cascading through our ecosystems, wiping out the birds and amphibians who rely on those insects. Inevitably, the rest of those ecosystems will follow suit, eventually reaching the plants and fungi we need to survive. At the same time we’re facing unprecedented levels of deforestation and environmental destruction. The upshot of this is that it’s not so much that things are getting hot, it’s that we’re completely off the map from how our planet has historically functioned. Quibbling over hockey-stick graphs or solar cycles is almost comically irrelevant. You could take the warming out of the picture entirely and we’d still be headed towards the biggest social meltdown in the history of the human race. We’re on about a thirty year fuse to societal collapse whether you factor in the temperature or studiously pretend it’s not changing. In order to understand how to fix such a mess of existential threats, it’s first important to notice what they all have in common from a sociological perspective. They’re all what you might call global downsizers. These problems are already directly impacting the ease with which our species can extract wealth from its environment. It’s getting harder and therefore more expensive to catch fish, grow crops, raise animals, beat diseases, or handle weather. Because these forces restrict our growth, it means technology can no longer keep up with the ever-increasing demand for freedom and opportunity. The net result is a growing sense that the walls are closing in. It’s a kind of global cabin fever. And that changes how people think. In his book Thinking Fast and Slow, Nobel Prize winning behavioral economist Daniel Kahneman points out that people perceive losses very differently from how they see gains. Let’s say I present you with a choice: you can either have a hundred dollars or we can toss a coin. If the coin comes up heads, you get two hundred dollars. If it comes up tails, you get nothing. Most people presented with this scenario settle for the hundred dollars. Now let’s turn the situation around. I take out a gun and tell you that I’m taking a hundred dollars. Or we can flip a coin. If it comes up heads, I take two hundred. If it comes up tails, you walk away with your wallet intact. Under these conditions, people will usually flip the coin, despite the fact that mathematically speaking, these two situations are exactly the same. In other words, when situations feel like losses, people start to gamble. And as I outlined in my article on cheap rhetoric, this is just as true in politics as it is in economic games. So as the global cabin fever worsens, the political stakes go up. The more that people feel like they’re losing, the more risks they’ll take to hold on to what they feel they deserve. The most obvious manifestation of this is what you might call panic nationalism, the weirdly internationally coordinated jingoism seen everywhere from the USA to Turkey to Brazil. But there are plenty of other examples. For instance: large-scale population movements, the rise of risky financial instruments like Bitcoin, and ratcheting intergroup tensions in areas like Kashmir. Unfortunately, these same cabin fever behaviors have the direct effect of accelerating the problems that cause them. Panic nationalism drives resource extraction, as we’ve seen from Putin, Trump, and Bolsonaro. Escape-route economics drive energy demands. By at least one measure, the energy used to mine Bitcoin globally now exceeds that used by Switzerland. And of course, intergroup tension inevitably results in environmental damage. So yes, greedy corporations play a significant role, and yes the climate matters, but unless we fix these problems together, the global panic feedback will just keep accelerating. This is why ideas like the much-trumpeted Green New Deal make so much sense. Because unless you fix the opportunity problem, you don’t fix the climate. However, I suspect that endeavors like the Green New Deal are just the start. We’ll need far more. People coordinate most effectively when two things are true: there’s opportunity for personal gain and others are taking similar action. What this means is that to save the world, we can’t focus exclusively on the global threat and taking steps to avert it. That’s likely to only exacerbate the panic and the attendant bad behavior. Instead, we need to set our sights on what comes afterwards. We need to build a concrete picture of what people gain by saving the world, crazy though that may sound. The picture has to be better than what people imagine they already have. It has to smell like hope. And then we have to broadcast that vision as hard as we can. Ideally, that vision should be full of opportunities for personal profit. While I find that concept upsetting at some level, and believe that the drive for profit is what created this mess in the first place, human psychology won’t change before we need to act. In my opinion, figuring out what that vision is and speaking to the opportunities it represents needs to be the next objective of the climate movement. I’m not sure yet what dream will resonate most with people whose choices need to change. That’s something I’m still researching. But as a life-long science fiction enthusiast, and a firm believer in the power of science to do good, I know what I’m hoping for. For me, learning how our world actually works opens the door to us having more than one. Why settle for a safe home for for seven billion human beings when we could figure out how to build safe homes for trillions? I don’t want to just see a handful of precious cultures; I want there to be more than we can count. I want a solar system full of raucous, wonderful human voices shouting their indomitable courage into the endless night. And I believe the journey to that place starts right here, right now."

elcome back ladies, gentlemen and people of all other colours of the gender rainbow, to another edition of Canada’s most boring election! To recap for those just joining us, in the past three weeks since election call (has it really been that long already?) we’ve had elusive platforms, falsified resumes and candidate screw-ups, with even our very own Prime Minister in brown -and- black face! Yet, somehow we are determined to consider this a boring election. Remember that as I begin discuss one of Canada’s least interesting, yet somehow perennial, topics: foreign aid cuts! Why foreign aid? Well, for those less wonky, or perhaps simply more well adjusted, Opposition leader Andrew Sheer recently announced at a campaign rally in Toronto that, if given the chance, he and the Tories would slash Canadian foreign aid spending by a massive 25 percent! Has he no shame? Taking money from the mouths of innocent children across the world? Or, if you are of a more fiscally conservative bent, couldn’t he have gone further? I need another tax cut! Well for the former, it’s not as bad as it looks. For the latter, have I got good news for you. If anything, I’m surprised he has taken this long to announce such a measure. You see, foreign aid in the Canadian context is a lovely thing, at least politically. We don’t spend too much, and when we cut what little we do spend, it makes for a wonderful talking point. Why is this? Well, let’s look at the history and numbers of foreign spending in Canada. How is that for fun? First, a history lesson. As a few people might remember from Social Studies class, or the more patriotic side of your dinner table, Canada has a reputation of being a net good in the world, with much our international efforts being for the benefit of those less fortunate. We give so much that our budgets sag under the weight of our goodness! Unfortunately, this is one of those misconceptions that tends to dog conversation about foreign spending among those with better things to do with their lives that debate policy. Historically, and by this, I mean since the end of the Second World War, Canada has been a nation that has been happy to play the nicer, gentler second fiddle to the United States. In the wake of the Marshall plan that revitalized Europe after the devastation of the World War 2. Canada, along with other developed nations, decided to join in the fun and give out money to better other new (read: former colonial) nations on the world stage. For us, this started formally with the Colombo Plan in 1950, which focused on new Commonwealth nations in Asia, with our priorities shifting and expanding from there to many other money destinations over time. This was an optimistic time from which where our international, or at least our domestically international, image of being the Duddy Do-Rights of the world comes from. During the 1970s an independent international commission headed by former PM Lester Pearson set out to examine 20 years of development assistant and spit out a number that all other donor nations should achieve through a bit of light summer reading called Partners in Development: Report of the Commission on International Development. That number 0.70 percent of GDP, with GNI having taken over as preferred term in recent years. Those terms being respectively gross domestic product and gross national income. Obviously, Canada had well exceeded this number, right? Well no. In actuality Canada remained, and continues to remain, behind on this magic number of 0.70 percent. In 1986 for example, Canada had only reached 0.46 percent, while a year later we reached 0.50 percent under Mulroney. This would be the high point for Canadian foreign aid, with our international aid funding dropping quite swiftly soon after. By the year 2000, that percentage had halved to a grand total of 0.25 percent, a place from which it would hover even into today's current political climate. Current estimates as of 2018 put our spending on international aid at a little over 0.28 percent of GNI or around $6 billion a year. Interestingly, this is higher than it has been as the Trudeau government has been quietly cutting our foreign aid since they come to power, a measure that was taken up from the previous Harper government. What worked for one works for another after all, especially when they can do so while still appearing the be the better party. To put this in perspective, this 0.28 GNI translates to around 6 billion Canadian dollars or about 1.8 percent of our national budget. Looking at this from a budget perspective, this makes foreign aid one of the lowest priorities in the hypothetical pie chart, behind even things like Crown Corporations. For those playing the home game, this percentage is still well below what was hoped for in 1970, with the OECD, one of the big shot international organizations of the world, being quite critical of Canada last year. So, with the scary numbers out of the way, it should be a bit easier to understand why foreign aid is a lovely budgetary wiping child for the perspective fiscal conservative political leader among us. This comes down to several factors. First, few people really know, or care, about the amount of money going out of the budget towards foreign aid. In general, the average voters has bigger issues to worry about, like the environment, childcare, education, the environment, the economy and whether the government will finally fill in BC like an artificial lake to get our oil to market. What this means is when a government, or governmental hopeful, pledges to cut foreign aid, those who think we give too much away already are ecstatic, while those who have better things to worry about just shrug. Or write a blog about it, but I’m weird. Second, foreign aid in general is a mystery box, making those curious unlikely to get to far before getting confounded, furthering the gulf of understanding and, thus, interest. What money that is put in tends to go to a wide variety of nations and causes via an ever more snake-like number of channels. So even if you are interested in where this money goes, you end up discovering that of all countries Russia gets funding Russia gets funding, even through you do not know why, how, or whether it’s actually going to Putin’s retirement fund. So, like most bureaucratic issues, you get tangled into the weeds pretty quick, with little hope of disentangling yourself. Best to just forget about it and let the politicians play. This, at least, is the calculus of most political parties and, for the most part, it works. Third, and perhaps a bit uncomfortably, in Canada we tend to like the idea of foreign aid as charity but would rather not have to pay for it. In the eternal battleground of political ideas, the economy and whether I will have a job tomorrow trumps whatever good feelings I might have about allowing my government to fund new water facilities in Mozambique. Though people of my generation do care about our impact on the world seemingly more than other generations, our priorities are elsewhere, no matter how much my earnest peers with clipboards try to tell me otherwise. Like much of foreign policy in Canada, Canadians have the luxury of apathy, and that is why cutting foreign aid makes for easy political brownie points. Slashing 25 percent of funding, as Sheer has promised brings that amount down by about 1.5 billion, with the subsequent amount of funding being around 1.3 percent of the budget. Yes, an extra billion is nice, but in a budget that tends to total in the neighbourhood of about 311 billion each year, this is the governmental equivalent of pocket change. Will this have an impact on his chances of forming an majority? Well, that’s a larger question and one that requires a longer conversation. Yet, if what I have said is any indication, foreign aid talk tends to only appeal to a certain type of voter, but only as a perk rather than a main reason to support the Tories. In other words, this is an issue that is fringe at best and will probably only interest mad people like myself rather than sway any undecided voters. Still, even one is looking for a relatively safe source of funding to cut, you can do worse politically than go after foreign aid."
Medium.com,Society,Tackling drought in arid lands through devolved disaster risk management,World,https://medium.com/@UNDP_Kenya/tackling-drought-in-arid-lands-through-devolved-disaster-risk-management-982bd861e534?source=topic_page---------490------------------1," Nestled in Kenya’s North-West corner and bordering Uganda, South Sudan and Ethiopia, Turkana is a land of geographic extremes. Kenya’s largest County is not only one of its hottest, but also one of its most arid: daytime temperatures in the capital Lodwar hover around 35⁰C, with virtually no rainfall for the majority of the year.[1]The dry heat is intense, and during the day locals in towns and rural areas alike clamour for shade to escape it. Although home to the expansive Lake Turkana, the County suffers an acute lack of fresh water and as a result of its harsh climate, is also prone to drought — a feature exacerbated by the harmful effects of climate change. Just earlier this year an estimated 800,000 people in the County faced food shortages due to drought and to compound the damage inflicted, flash floods followed when the rains finally came. — Jeremia Akolom, Counsellor, Lorugum Sub-County Hospital For the County’s health system this presents a real challenge, as the mostly rural pastoralist population often live far from health facilities, and admissions rapidly increase as drought worsens. In Loima Sub-County at Lorugum Sub-County Hospital, a chart clearly shows this trend, with a spike in admissions during the drought response coinciding with a rise in fevers and respiratory tract infections, placing considerable strain on the hospital’s limited resources. – Benjamin Mogire, Anaesthetist, Lorugum Sub-County Hospital In Loima, access to water is limited at the best of times: the Sub-County sits on a saline aquifer which is not potable, so the tanks at the hospital in Lorugum have to be refilled by delivery. Two health workers at the hospital, Jeremia Akolom and Benjamin Mogire, explain that running a hospital is a water intensive process, with multiple needs including to maintain a sanitary environment, to keep equipment sterile and to support recovering patients. The local pastoralists, however, must roam in search of water and pasture for their livestock, which in times of drought can lead to conflict as different communities compete for scarce resources. This dynamic is complicated further by the significant numbers of internally displaced people (IDPs) living in Loima Sub-County and Turkana more widely, having fled clashes such as tribal conflicts and election violence, and who also require access to fresh water.[2] – Josephat Lotwel, NDMA By providing funding and specialist technical assistance, UNDP collaborated with the County Directorate of Disaster Management and the National Drought Management Authority (NDMA) to produce the Turkana County Hazard Atlas, an open-source meteorological and topographical analysis of hazards in the County. The Hazard Atlas is intended to serve as a reference guide to both the County Government and development partners so that hazards are endogenized in the planning of future projects, eliminating preventable risks and potentially saving lives. — Benedict Mukoo, County Directorate of Disaster Management The Hazard Atlas has formed part of the analysis for development projects of all kinds in Turkana and will provide a platform for large-scale projects to improve access to fresh water and combat drought more permanently. Irrigation projects to promote food security have been one of the notable success stories of recent times. As the effects of climate change worsen over the coming years and decades, exploring aquifers and building dams will be essential tools for supporting life in Turkana through water management. A direct result of the studies conducted during hazard mapping is that plans for several major projects are currently seen as potentially viable — which could one day provide the people of Lorugum, Loima and the rest of Turkana the ready access to water they need. ***************************************************************
UNDP has supported drought management in Turkana County through the Integrated Support Programme to the Devolution Process (ISPDP) in Kenya, which aims to enhance the effectiveness and efficiency of the devolution process and to give grassroots stakeholders a voice in the delivery of services by the devolved governments. ISPDP is a joint project run by UNDP Kenya (with other partners including UN Women) and implemented by the Ministry for Devolution and Planning.

Medium.com,Society,The importance of economic diversification in the Middle East,World,https://medium.com/@simone.tagliapietra/the-importance-of-economic-diversification-in-the-middle-east-9e0cc92a0050?source=topic_page---------491------------------1," The recent attacks on Saudi Arabia’s oil facilities have highlighted the role of the world’s largest oil exporter and of the overall Middle East as cornerstones of global energy. They also underlined the persistent risk of volatility in oil prices and the importance of economic diversification in the region’s petrostates, which governments have been addressing but, so far, with limited success. Historically, Middle Eastern petrostates have turned to diversification during periods of low oil prices, typically proposing various initiatives to increase the private sector’s role in the economy, encourage small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs), to create jobs and invest in education and innovation. Such plans have been abandoned when oil prices recover. Changes in global energy markets and demographic forces make diversification especially urgent today. The fall in oil prices since 2014 has created major financial pressures. Between 2014 and 2017, Saudi Arabia used $240bn of its foreign reserves to cover the large budget deficits caused by falling export revenues and to defend its currency peg. The need to create non-oil jobs is becoming increasingly urgent. The Middle East is among the youngest regions of the world, with 60 per cent of its population under the age of 25. As a result, 20m young people are expected to join the regional workforce by 2025. As rightly pointed out in the region’s various diversification plans, the development of SMEs has a central role to play. But for SMEs to develop in the region, its financial sectors must change. A recent survey by the World Bank and the Union of Arab Banks of more than 130 regional banks showed that only 2 per cent of lending in petrostates goes to SMEs. This is substantially lower than the average in middle-income countries of 18 per cent and in high-income countries of 22 per cent. There are two possible and complementary approaches to unlock financing for SMEs in Middle Eastern petrostates. The first concerns the development of the domestic banking sector. In petrostates, banks are often poorly capitalised, as oil revenues flow directly from national oil companies to governments, bypassing the banking system. As a result, the economy may be capital-rich and a net international saver in the oil sector, but capital-poor and reliant on foreign lending or family savings in the rest of the economy. A well-regulated and adequately capitalised banking system integrated into global financial markets would play an important role. This would entail the development of financial regulatory and supervisory frameworks, with adequate incentives for SME financing. The second concerns the development of alternative channels of financing for SMEs. This would include the development of capital market instruments to mobilise savings; a large and diversified investor base and broader capital market development; adequate financial infrastructure and legal frameworks; and regulatory and supervisory frameworks that support the safe development and integrity of capital markets and fintech-supported SME financing. An important alternative channel of SME financing might exist in sovereign wealth funds (SWFs). Middle Eastern petrostates have some of the largest SWFs in the world. These could be used to invest in SMEs, rather than as tools to perpetuate rent-seeking through financial or real estate speculation. Given their size, the region’s SWFs could be the main driver of economic diversification, should their investment strategies be refocused on local production and SMEs."
Medium.com,Society,The Queen: Puppet or Powerhouse?,World,https://medium.com/uk-law-review-2019/the-queen-puppet-or-powerhouse-1ad053d594cb?source=topic_page---------492------------------1," Late 2019’s political developments have bought about a sharp focus on Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth II and her role — or perhaps lack thereof — in political decision making. Considering the scrutiny placed upon the Queen after the Prime Minister advised her to prorogue Parliament in September 2019, it should be outlined, especially in light of future Brexit developments, the powers that the monarch actually possesses. In order to place these powers and their interplay with the government and Parliament, it should also be questioned how the Queen’s current powers differ from those of monarchs historically. A monarchy is essentially a form of governance, in which the monarch holds sovereign authority until death or abdication. This power, of course, varies from purely symbolic in nature to restricted powers under a constitutional monarchy (like the UK’s currently), to the more extreme and historically contextualised autocratic or absolute monarchy. It is this latter form, linked to the theory of divine right in the West, that gave early English monarchs their absolute power. Compared to the restricted powers of the Queen, monarchs before the 13th century were at will to control their subjects and rule according to their whims; however, this autocracy began to slowly erode with the signing of the Magna Carta in 1215. This established, not without controversy at the time, that the Monarch were subject to the law as agreed; at the time, this was the King and the Magna Carta represented the first great public act of the nation, agreed upon by the Barons at the time. This erosion arguably culminated, however, in the Glorious Revolution of 1688 with the deposition of James II and VII, establishing the true constitutional monarchy. The monarch’s powers were limited further by the Bill of Rights 1689, a direct result of the Revolution the year before, and Act of Settlement 1701. The Bill of Rights, in particular, allowed for the first time for the Regent’s power to be defined, written down and limited. While much constitutional convention has been established since, as will be discussed below, this radical change in monarchy power restriction essentially left us with the current framework from which the Queen operates. Her power is still formally possessed but, by convention, is effectively only ceremonial as the British Parliament and government exercise their powers under the Royal Prerogative on behalf of the Queen. While clearly restricted in the exercise of her powers, the Queen still possesses a number of these, known as the Crown Prerogative, or prerogative powers. These are powers held in reserve by the Queen; however, the sovereign also has some core rights other to these. Walter Bagehot, essayist and author of The English Constitution (1867), famously attributed three rights, and arguable duties, to the sovereign — to be consulted, to encourage and to warn. In fact, the Queen is entitled to express her opinions on governmental policy to her chief minister; however, these are treated as confidential between the Queen and the Prime Minister. It is therefore, at times, hard to tell the subtle influence the Monarch has. In light of this, at least in theory, Bogdanor’s assertion, in his book The Monarchy and the Constitution (1995), that ‘the wise use of inﬂuence will obviate the need for the use of the prerogative powers’ rings true. Due to this, while the Queen retains serious power, it could be seen to be primarily be used by way of influence before the final decision is reached with regard to policy. Though the cardinal convention is that the sovereign must act upon the advice of her ministers, there is a rather unsettled boundary as to when said advice is final and must be obeyed. Lord Esher’s observation, when advising King George V, makes for an interesting point of thought as there is a lack of clarity in ascertaining when the Queen (or any sovereign) must concede: If the Sovereign believes advice to him to be wrong, he may refuse to take it, and if his minister yields the Sovereign is justified. If the minister persists, feeling that he has behind him a majority of the people’s representatives, a constitutional Sovereign must give way. One of the key powers is that of Royal Assent whereby the Crown must agree to proposed legislation before it can be passed into law. This is also compounded by the fact that the Queen must act on the advice or her ministers. The reason behind this is that conventionally, the monarch is not permitted to hold political opinions and this avoids compromising her constitutional status; however, there is a thought experiment of what might happen if the queen decided not to do this, perhaps if confronted by an Abolition of the Monarchy Bill. This assent is often considered to be merely a formality; though, technically, the Queen has the right to veto or reject bills presented, but the last monarch to do this was Queen Anne in 1708. This would have the potential to plunge the country into a constitutional crisis. There is, however, a balance of trust vested in the Crown in Parliament that would make this rather unlikely, as well as the public outrage this would likely cause. The phrase ‘Queen in Parliament’ is used to describe the British legislature, consisting of the Sovereign, the House of Lords and the House of Commons. While Royal Assent may be one of the most recognised powers held by the Queen, especially by law students, it is far from the only one to be aware of. The Queen can also appoint ministers; while most government officials in the UK have to be voted into office, she can select advisors and cabinet officials herself. She is also responsible for appointing a new Prime Minister after a general election, or after a former Prime Minister resigns (as would have been the case when Boris Johnson took over the position from Theresa May earlier in 2019). The Queen also retains the right to declare war against other nations; however, the Prime Minister and Parliament usually take up this power. The last time this power was utilised by a monarch was in 1939 by George VI. Furthermore, the Queen is able to issue a Royal Pardon to anyone convicted of a crime as was the case posthumously for famous World War II codebreaker Alan Turing in 2013. The Queen is also technically responsible for issuing passports; however, while these are given in her name this power is exercised for her by her ministers. The final power, though there are others, to consider here is one of a rather topical concern considering the action of Prime Minister Johnson in September 2019. The Queen has the power to prorogue Parliament . Now, when this occurred they was, understandably to an extent, criticism, with the Speaker Jon Bercow calling it a “constitutional outrage”; however, the Queen cannot be said to be behind this move, though technically she was the one to call for it. In the words of James Palmer with regard to this incident and the monarch, “they’re a hinge on a door pushed by someone else”. This being said, after the potential embarrassment caused by the recent September 2019 Supreme Court ruling that the prorogation was unlawful, the Queen has been reported by several sources to have sought legal advice as to the possibility of removing Prime Minister Johnson if he fails to seek an extension under the Benn Act or refused to step down after a vote of no confidence. Linking back to the above powers and rights, it is clear that the Queen does not expressly possess the reserve power to remove a Prime Minister; however, it was argued in a 2003 Select Committee Report that the Queen may “in grave constitutional crisis… act contrary to or without Ministerial advice”. This is, of course, rather unprecedented, but in the light of potential constitutional crisis, fire may be the only way to fight fire; however, this is entirely speculative, if illuminating, as to what may occur later in 2019 with the October deadline approaching. With Parliament having returned earlier in September 2019, and the current Brexit deadline of the 31st October fast approaching, as well as rumblings of no confidence votes and extension refusal possibilities, the Queen’s role in the constitution and the powers she can and may exercise gain increased importance.

Medium.com,Society,Narcotics Anonymous in Iran,World,https://medium.com/@mordey.alastair/narcotics-anonymous-in-iran-ec0121955d2b?source=topic_page---------496------------------1," One of the most amazing things about the 12 Step movement today, regardless of what your personal opinion is, and something which people scarcely believe when they hear it, is the fact that Narcotics Anonymous has become so successful in Iran. This might have something to do with the size of the problem. In 2014 an estimated 2.2% of Iranians were addicted to illicit drugs, some 60% of those to opiates (which continue to flood in from neighbouring Afghanistan). Methamphetamine is also increasingly being used by Iranian heroin addicts, in the time honoured tradition of the ‘speedball’ (mixing a stimulant with an opiate). This has resulted in the curious fact that in Iran today, there are more NA meetings than in the rest of the world combined (excluding the United States). Crazier still, is the fact that the Iranian government considers NA to be the most important NGO operating in the country. Founded in 1990, the fellowship in Iran is host to approximately 16,000 of the worlds 60,000 meetings (the USA has approximately 27,000). But despite being somewhat smaller, it seems that the Iranian fellowship is even more active than its American counterpart. By 2008, the Iranian fellowship was responsible for approximately a quarter of all the basic texts (NA’s equivalent of AA’s ‘big book’) which were distributed globally. More amazing still is the fact that more than forty thousand one-year medallions (which denote a year of ‘clean’ time) had been handed out, slightly more than in the United States suggesting that once people entered the fellowship in Iran they were more likely to stay. In a sense this is not particularly surprising. Despite numerous other problems including a large amount of relative poverty, Iranian people are arguably better integrated into their society (in psychosocial terms) than their western counterparts due to the persistence of traditional cultural and religious norms that serve as a binding agent. In plain English, religious observance amongst Iranians has rendered them more able to readily absorb the ‘spiritual programme’ of NA than their western counterparts, and regardless of what fundamentalist atheists may have to say about the matter — it stops people sticking needles in their arms. Sometime in 2017 a post which demonstrated the power of the fellowship of NA in Iran started going viral on social media. It had originated from a 2006 letter which had appeared in the monthly newsletter of Narcotics Anonymous, ‘The NA Way’. It was penned by a recovering addict known only as ‘Habib’. It was a very short letter; “My name is Habib and I am an addict. Greetings to all the addicts at the central prison of Qazvin, and to all NA groups around the world. I am writing this letter as I pass the final moments of my life. I am very close to death. I wish to send a message to all fellow members: I got clean through a narcotics anonymous meeting in jail, and through attending these meetings, I stopped using drugs. I have become very close to God. I feel good, and I am at peace with myself and the world. I have accepted the will of God. I’d like to ask you fellows to stay clean and be of service. Try to help other addicts stay clean, physically, mentally and spiritually. Please continue this path to save other addicts. I have nothing else to say. My name is Habib and by dawn my life will end. I will be hanged for the crimes I committed, but I have been clean for eighty-four days beside you. I wish success for all addicts…members and non-members. God bless.” Perhaps, and most especially at this time, it is worth remembering the commonality of human experience. Addiction is a great leveller. It is an equal opportunities destroyer. But it is also an equal opportunities transformer. It has the power to achieve things that political leaders are incapable of, namely— bridging the gap of human misunderstanding."

As an adult, we took this letter to the Department, did more paperwork, paid money and waited for months. Then I got my dual citizenship certificate, yay! Then I lost it. This lets you know another part of the process. When I went back to the Department, they didn’t issue another certificate. They gave me a letter saying that they had my record on file.

In an impressive display of environmental illiteracy and breathtaking arrogance, the mayor assumes the capital’s residents are fools, arguing that by lifting the restrictions, he will somehow reduce air pollution. The plan, the work of consultants awarded the project without any kind of public oversight, is a huge step back and reopens the center of the city to all vehicles as long as they are occupied by two people, in the process sending a message that restrictions are an inconvenience that can be relaxed. This is the worst kind of populism, coming as Spain goes to the polls for the fourth time in as many years. There is only one way to manage cities: increase traffic restrictions in residential areas. Car use has to made increasingly difficult, particularly those high emission levels. The idea that lifting restrictions will produce better results is crazy. Martínez-Almeida’s approach here is simply to kick the can down the road in the hope of winning electoral support, and leave the problem to somebody else for later on. Madrid Central was a relatively modest move: there are fewer traffic restrictions in the Spanish capital than most other European capitals, and the indicators would advise a progressive extension of its restrictions. Instead, what has the mayor of Madrid, supported by a coalition of climate change deniers, done after taking office? Push ahead with his electoral promise to eliminate Madrid Central. When the courts blocked him, he said he would present “more efficient measures.” What are those measure? Eliminate restrictions that people had already accepted, and once again allow cars to drive wherever they please. Hopefully, Brussels will take note of these measures, legislate if possible against their implementation, and sanction City Hall for its efforts to roll back desperately needed measures. In the meantime, voters need to understand which political parties are trying to do tackle the climate emergency, and which are in denial, minimizing its impact, or trying to implement “smoother transitions”, a euphemism for “let somebody else sort it out.” Smart cities need smart politicians. Stupid politicians will come up with stupid solutions, as we have just seen."

This article examines this claim, and question wording concerning Scotland’s relationship with the United Kingdom. The figure comes from a Survation internet panel conducted on 12–16th September 2019, funded by Scotland in Union. It is not explicitly acknowledged in Nash’s article that the question Survation asked is different to the one put to Scots in 2014: If there was a referendum tomorrow with the question ‘Should Scotland remain in the United Kingdom or leave the United Kingdom?’, how would you vote? In the sample of 1,003 Scottish adults aged 16 or over, 54% responded ‘Remain’ and 37% said ‘Leave’. Removing those undecided and refused people gives the 59% figure Nash cites. This is the third time that Survation have asked this quasi-2016 formulation. The central estimates for ‘Remain’ and ‘Leave’ are stable from November 2018 to September 2019: In the latest reading, the estimated Remain lead is nearly the same in September 2019 (17 points) as in November 2018 (18 points). This stability undermines the article’s headline that independence supporters are ‘turning’. When the 2014 question is repeated, latest polls suggest the split in opinion is much closer. Panelbase (for The Sunday Times) conducted their poll on 18–20th June, estimating 48% backed No and 46% chose No. A Lord Ashcroft-badged poll¹— which did not include 16 and 17-year-old Scots in the sample — estimated a small Yes lead (Yes on 46%, No on 43%) at the start of August. YouGov (for The Times) conducted a poll on 30th August — 3rd September, estimating a thin No lead: 44% to 43%. These close surveys raise the question: who is changing their view? As Prof John Curtice (University of Strathclyde) states: All of this increase in support for Yes registered by the polls has occurred among those who voted Remain. On average, the five polls find that 57% of Remain voters would now back Yes, compared with 50% in the second half of last year. This net pattern contradicts what Nash asserts: the UK’s withdrawal from the European Union appears to be inducing No voters who backed Remain in 2016 to reconsider their 2014 choice. In 2014, the Scottish referendum question was: Should Scotland be an independent country? Scots could vote ‘Yes’ or ‘No’. The question is simple, but potentially imbalanced. People are asked to consider one possibility, without the other. The proposed question was initially ‘do you agree Scotland should be an independent country?’, which has clear issues of acquiescence bias. When looking at Scottish independence polling, you should consider: The Survation question for Scotland in Union may inadvertently cause cognitive issues, due to its similar formulation to the 2016 EU referendum question. The Electoral Commission will review the question, even if the same wording is put forward by the Scottish government."

uropean Union is one of the biggest economic zones of the World — consisting of 28 countries with €15.8 trillion ($17.2 trillion) in 2018 GDP (PPP). With 4 out of the Top 10 economies of the World situated in the EU, no wonder it wields considerable influence in global economics & politics. The diverse amalgamation of countries does come with its own challenges as we have seen over the years. Greek Debt crisis, Italian recessions & more recently Brexit has rocked this boat on numerous occasions in the past decade or so. Europe never really recovered from the real estate meltdown of 2008 & the following European Sovereign Debt Crisis which started in 2009. The biggest indicator of this decline has been the fall in the value of the single currency Euro by over 30% against the US Dollar to date. Meeting the expenses of such a huge economic zone, of course, requires the generation of revenue. Each member, in turn, contributes to the revenue stream of the EU. However, the contribution of revenue to the region’s budget is not uniform and some contribute more than the others. Same goes for the beneficiaries as well. Today’s visualizations, which rank the countries on who contributes the most & the least, come from the European Commission."
Medium.com,Society,Coming soon: a massive laboratory for ‘Green New Deals’,World,https://medium.com/@simone.tagliapietra/coming-soon-a-massive-laboratory-for-green-new-deals-4ed9a3a14?source=topic_page---------505------------------1," Many on the American right view the ‘Green New Deal’ as an unrealistic, Soviet-style, fantasy destined to turn the country into a ‘hermit nation’, but such a project is now about to be tested on half-billion people across the Atlantic. Ursula von der Leyen, the incoming chief of the European Union’s powerful administrative branch, adopted the ‘European Green Deal’ as her top political priority. For the first time ever, a large economy will cut a path to climate neutrality by 2050 — a milestone that scientists consider to be the only sensible way to protect the world from the more dramatic impacts of climate change. Should this experiment succeed, the ‘European Green Deal’ might become a seminal blueprint for other countries around the world; a tangible example that pursuing climate neutrality is not only technically feasible but also economically and politically viable. The receipt of success for the ‘European Green Deal’ is as simple as it is breath-taking: to intelligently promote deep decarbonisation by accompanying the economic and industrial transformation this necessarily implies, and by ensuring the social inclusiveness of the overall process. That is, climate policy alone is not sufficient to sensibly pursue climate neutrality. For instance, a strategy only based on raising the price of carbon — either through a visible carbon tax or through an imperceptible emissions trading system — would not bring us anywhere, as people will fiercely reject it. Just ask the ‘Gilets jaunes’. Only a much broader policy — also encompassing its economic, fiscal, industrial, labour, innovation and social policy aspects can sensibly face such a challenge. This is hardly surprising if considering that shifting our economies from fossil fuels to deep decarbonisation represents one of the major socio-economic revolutions ever seen in history. To be clear, this is not going to be an easy ride. As in any revolution, there will be winners but also losers. What a ‘European Green Deal’ should do is to facilitate this process by providing a clear sense of direction to both investors and citizens, as well as putting in place mechanisms to ensure that the most vulnerable segments of the society are supported and not left behind. But to be politically sustainable over time, the ‘European Green Deal’ foremost needs to be honest about its nature. Recalling Franklin D. Roosevelt, the US discourse often presents the ‘Green New Deal’ as a radical silver-bullet for boosting economic growth and for creating millions of well-paid jobs. But ‘Green New Deals’ needn’t redefine our economics and further polarise our politics. All they need to do is to shift our economies from fossil fuels to zero-carbon in a way that’s socially and politically viable. That is, ‘Green New Deals’ should not be promoted as powerful economic bazookas, but rather as efficient reallocation mechanisms, fostering investment shifts and labour substitution in key economic sectors, while accompanying the most vulnerable segments of the society throughout the process. In practise, this means promoting a shift from fossil fuels to renewables, turning diesel cars-related jobs into electric cars-related ones, compensating low-income households for higher gasoline prices, or re-training coal miners to get new jobs. ‘Green New Deals’ are not going to turn countries into ‘hermit nations’, but they are not going to turn countries into economic paradises either. They simply are tools to achieve something more basic: ensure that climate change does not compromise our life in this planet. And this already looks like a good reason for them to be well worth our time. This is how President von der Leyen should present the ‘European Green Deal’ to make it a successful and sustainable experiment. In these terms, nobody would see it as a fantasy destined to turn Europe into a ‘hermit continent’, but rather as a good — and necessary — operation to ensure the well-being of current and future generations."
Medium.com,Society,Things You Can Say About Boris Johnson That You Shouldn’t be Able to Say About a Prime Minister,World,https://medium.com/@willblack_53220/things-you-can-say-about-boris-johnson-that-you-shouldnt-be-able-to-say-about-a-prime-minister-90d0fe102804?source=topic_page---------506------------------1," When you train to be a journalist you have to rapidly learn a lot of law. You need to be able to cover everything from a magistrate’s court to the Supreme Court to parliamentary proceedings without getting sued — or convicted of contempt of court and thrown in jail. I did my training just over a decade ago and back then, in the pre-Trump days, there was an expectation that politicians would at least pretend to have integrity. Back in those simpler times, when the law was the law and facts were valued, a young reporter calling a ‘top politician’ a liar — let alone a racist, an inciter of social conflict or a deceiver of both partners and voters — would have been in trouble. Such is the rapid decline in the quality of ‘top politicians’, on both sides of the Atlantic, that it is possible to call prime minister Boris Johnson (and indeed president Donald Trump) any of those things and have no chance of being on the losing side of a libel case. This is because to be successfully sued for defamation, the statement the journalist makes must be untrue. I will outline examples which would allow a decent politician to sue for libel, yet would not offer that option to Boris Johnson. This is because each can be shown to be true. In 2004 Johnson was sacked by party leader Michael Howard for lying about an affair. We all know about the pre-referendum claims about vast amounts of money going to the NHS after Brexit, when the more likely outcome is stretched services and haemorrhaging clinicians. But Johnson had already proved himself to be dishonest before becoming an MP. He was sacked from The Times for falsifying quotes and, as a journalist, told a friend plotting to get a journalist beaten up that he would provide the intended victim’s address. As a reporter you take pride in getting good quotes that nobody else has. Making them up is just about as low as it gets — though being part of a plot to have a member of the press silenced by a beating is below even the gutter. A vivid example of Johnson’s dangerous irresponsibility can be drawn from just two years ago and involves a mother in jail abroad on trumped up charges. Then foreign secretary, Johnson told the Foreign Affairs Select Committee that Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe (a UK citizen serving a five-year jail sentence in Iran, after being detained on holiday and accused of espionage) had been “simply teaching people journalism”. For a state that jails more journalists than most other countries, this was a dangerous, irresponsible and idiotic claim. Johnson’s words caused the regime to add a charge of propaganda against the state, which risked her sentence being doubled. After much criticism, Johnson still wouldn’t take responsibility. Mrs Zaghari-Ratcliffe remains in an Iranian jail, estranged from her five-year-old daughter. Johnson has made numerous racist comments over the years — which is perhaps one reason why he is popular among the far-right. He has recently been accused of dog-whistle politics by using narratives likely to trigger such people (see below), but his racist comments go back decades. Writing in The Telegraph in 2002, he described black people in Africa as “piccaninnies” with “watermelon smiles”. In 2006, while a shadow higher education minister, he trumped even that grotesque racist remark by referring to people in Papua New Guinea as cannibals. In 2016, after years of Donald Trump spreading lies about the nationality of Barack Obama, Johnson called the then president “part-Kenyan” with an ”ancestral dislike of the British empire”. This line of attack, which appeared in a Sun article after Obama expressed the view that the UK would be better off staying in the EU, seems to have been aimed at invalidating Obama’s opinions by placing him in a racial category. In his short time as foreign secretary, Johnson’s most memorable overseas trip was the one in which the British ambassador, at a Buddhist temple in Myanmar, had to tell him to stop reciting the colonialist-era Rudyard Kipling’s poem The Road to Mandalay. Before Johnson reluctantly stopped, he was approaching a line which refers to the Buddha as a “Bloomin’ idol made o’ mud”. Last year Johnson gained approval within far-right circles by suggesting some Muslim women look like bank robbers and letter boxes due to their clothing. In a squalid example of dishonest journalism, he claimed to be on their side — but the dog whistle could be heard by the far-right and Islamophobes in the US and beyond. Steve Bannon, the white nationalist behind disgraced Cambridge Analytica and former executive chairman of far-right website Breitbart, is one of the few public figures who defended Johnson after those comments. In recent days, Johnson has used every media opportunity — even when the journalist was trying to ask him about allegations of groping women — to repeatedly force the term ‘Surrender Act’ into his replies. This misrepresentation of a piece of legislation, voted through Parliament to prevent this dangerously irresponsible prime minister from pushing the UK over the cliff of a no-deal Brexit, is pure dog whistle politics for the ears of the militant far-right. When asked in Parliament by Paula Sherriff, a friend of Jo Cox (who was murdered by a far-right Brexiter) to refrain from using militaristic and divisive terms such as “surrender” and “betrayal”, as such narratives fuel threats she and other MPs are subjected to, Johnson said: “I have never heard such humbug in all my life”. An MP in Parliament — even if they are the prime minister — cannot call another member a liar. But by calling her comment “humbug” he effectively did just that, while showing a distinct lack of empathy about the many threats received by (especially) female MPs, and particularly by those who are in favour of Remain. Which is the reason Jo Cox was assassinated. Johnson also claimed in the same session that “The best way to honour the memory of Jo Cox and indeed the best way to bring this country together would be, I think, to get Brexit done.” This wanton distortion and co-opting of the memory of Jo Cox for hard-right hard Brexiteers is one of the most disgusting things I have seen a politician do. However, I’m sure that if Boris Johnson stays in power beyond October, he will find new ways to disgust us and perhaps take this grotesque period of politics to a whole new level."

In many ways, even in spite of left-wing sentimentalism with phrases like “the lungs of the Earth” or right-wing denialism of the problems of anthropogenic climate change or human-induced global warming, the protection of the Amazon forests is extremely important. It is akin to keeping most of the oil in the ground in places like Alberta, Canada based on the risks to the international community because of the contributions to the global CO2 levels from burning them. The ongoing fires are a problem for the global environment and for the Amazonian tribes. Bolsonaro stands at the center of the nexus of the problems here. He is making the main executive decisions. He could stop making the decisions to destroy the Amazon without consideration for the lives of the indigenous peoples there. The exploitation of the indigenous peoples of Brazil and the forests of Brazil has a long history, even as far back to 1500 with the conquests of the Portuguese. More than 500 years later, it seems not much has changed for them. The current political catastrophe echoes these exploitations of the timber of the Amazonian forests of Brazil with little or no regard for the indigenous inhabitants of it. Elected in late 2018, far-right president Jair Bolsonaro has a strong agenda to keep exploitation going and please his wealthy allies in the agribusiness sector. His policies clash directly with the rights of indigenous peoples. One of Bolsonaro’s moves to weaken indigenous protections was to significantly cut funding to Brazil’s National Indian Foundation, and its main environmental agency (IBAMA). Since the start of his term in January, IBAMA had a cut of 25% in its budget. An investigation by Reuters learned that local field agents have faced restrictions to do their jobs to slow land-grabbers. The current government is also softening punishments, as of late August the number of fines issued by agency fell nearly 30% compared to the same period in the previous year. Trade is integral to the exploitation of Amazonian tribes and of the Amazon. More modern efforts, supposedly or one may hope, attempt to include things like the Paris Agreement. Cecilia Malmström, European Commissioner for Trade, said that the EU-Mercosur treaty “does not mean that we agree with all the policies of these countries, but it is a way to anchor Brazil in the Paris Agreement.” The European Union is the number one trading partner of the Mercosur states: Argentina, Brazil, Paraguay, and Uruguay. The Mercosur treaty was reached on June 28 of 2019 but it is still to be finalised. “The European Union and Mercosur reached today a political agreement for an ambitious, balanced and comprehensive trade agreement. The new trade framework — part of a wider Association Agreement between the two regions — will consolidate a strategic political and economic partnership and create significant opportunities for sustainable growth on both sides,” the European Commission stated, “while respecting the environment and preserving interests of EU consumers and sensitive economic sectors.” It is one of the biggest agreements ever negotiated for them. With this large treaty, EU-Mercosur, and the importance of the Paris Agreement, Brazil’s vice president Hamilton Mourao thinks it impossible for Brazil to leave the Paris Agreement. Some feel Mourao is naive, like us. And they are getting support from other indigenous communities in the Americas, including some aboriginal communities from Canada. Some Canadian aboriginal peoples recognize the struggle of the Amazonian tribes and express solidarity with them. Inuit Circumpolar Council (ICC) Chair Dalee Sambo Dorough and ICC Canada President Monica Ell-Kanayuk expressed solidarity with the struggle of the indigenous peoples of Brazil. Ell-Kanayuk noted the interconnectedness of the world’s ecological systems in which events in Brazil with the fires of the Amazon can effect the status of the Arctic. New Democratic Leader Jagmeet Singh called on Prime Minister of Canada to stop free trade negotiations with the Brazilian President, Jair Bolsonaro, because of the fear over the problems created in the Amazon. Bolsonaro has been characterised as an “unabashed climate sceptic.” Indigenous communities in South America have faced further difficulties due to widespread wildfires across the Amazonian land in August. There has been international outcry calling for authorities to investigate responsible actors for fires and destruction of the jungle. Amnesty International reprimanded Bolsonaro’s handling of the crisis’. Kumi Naidoo, Secretary-General of Amnesty International called it ‘both an environmental and human rights crisis’. “The Brazilian authorities must immediately investigate and prosecute those responsible for these catastrophic fires, otherwise we will inevitably see them getting worse throughout the rest of President Bolsonaro’s time in office,” said Naidoo. Antenor Vaz, a former consultant for indigenous peoples and employee of the Brazilian national indigenous agency Funai, said, “Most of these people are constantly fleeing, they are constantly being threatened. These people depend on the forest and as fire kills the animals they feel completely desperate with the situation.” Tainaky Tenetehar, of Guardians of the Forest added, “to make it harder, they are stopping the indigenous fire brigade from combating the fires.” This amounts to deliberate stoppage of real efforts to stop the fires not simple efforts to stop the fires. Some start fires. Some try to stop the fires. Then to compound the issue, those who work to reduce the amount of the fires have been continually fought back against in order to keep the fires ablaze. Fiona Watson, the Advocacy Director of Survival International, deliberately target indigenous communities because of the vulnerability of being remote and having few protections. Despite being on the global spotlight recently, Amazonian tribal communities have long battled to keep their land safe from deforestation, corporate interests, agribusiness, and political battles. According to Survival, the Brazilian Amazon is believed to be the home of more than 100 uncontacted peoples. “I feel afraid. The farmers are getting too close, they are invading a lot of our land. We are surrounded,” told Katica Karipuna, from Karipuna tribe, to Al Jazeera. Katica adds that, under the rule of Bolsonaro, things got worse for her community as the president is openly favouring agribusiness and farmers. Even after protests happened on a global scale in light of the fires, the Brazilian government has rejected claims from indigenous groups that requested additional lands after fires left destruction in their homes. “We all breathe this one air, we all drink the same water. We live on this one planet. We need to protect the Earth,” wrote Raoni Metuktire, chief of the indigenous Brazilian Kayapó people, for the Guardian. “If we don’t, the big winds will come and destroy the forest. Then you will feel the fear that we feel.” Photo by Lucas Campoi on Unsplash"

The project connects Kashgar, Xinjiang, in Northwest China, to Pakistan’s Gwadar Port on Arabian Sea coastline in Baluchistan. China is investing across a range of projects there like a 3,000 km highway, dry ports, oil/gas pipelines, power plants, and business parks. Access to the Indian Ocean via Gwadar port will enable China to bypass Malacca Strait. Studies have shown that shipping costs between Kashgar and European ports fell by 36%, 68% for Oman Port, and 50% for Jeddah and Kuwait Ports. Roughly 44.1% of Chinese imported crude oil originated from the Middle East in 2018. China imports 80% of its oil through the Strait of Malacca. As a result, the transit time will drop from 45 days to 18 days for Kuwait, 13 days for Jeddah, and 10 days for Oman and Iran. Nearly five years down the line, the $62 billion CPEC project in Pakistan have run into barriers. Facing a sustained financial crisis, Islamabad is reducing the pace of the projects. Beijing’s investment in the CPEC has led to enormous imports of Chinese machinery and resources, enlarging Pakistan’s external debt. According to the State Bank of Pakistan, the country’s foreign debt, as of June 2019, stood at $106 billion. Given that these loans are in U.S. Dollars, Pakistan has to run trade surplus continuously to repay its external debt. Unfortunately, Pakistan consistently runs trade deficits. Meanwhile, the economic relationship with China remains one-sided. Pakistan’s exports to China was $1.8 billion in 2018, representing 7.7% of its overall exports. Pakistan’s imports from China was $14.6 billion, representing 24.3% of its global imports. Unable to export adequately to generate a trade surplus, Pakistan depleted its foreign-exchange reserves, thus leading to a debt crisis. According to the State Bank of Pakistan, the country borrowed $16 billion in the 2018–19 fiscal year to avoid running out of foreign reserves. Of the $16 billion, $5.5 billion came from Saudi Arabia, U.A.E, and Qatar; while $6.7 billion came from China. The International Monetary Fund, in July, approved a three-year, $6 billion loan package for Pakistan to help rein its rising debts in exchange for strict austerity measures. CPEC is a massive project, and Pakistan is borrowing a tremendous amount of money from China. For instance: Allegations of massive corruption cases have emerged. In February 2019, numerous Pakistani government officials were accused of embezzling funds worth $500 million, meant for the Sukkur-Multan Motorway project. In July, controversies erupted after Pakistan’s Planning and development ministry diverted $171.6 million, meant for BRI infrastructure development projects, to fund other Non-BRI projects. Consequently, the pace of the project has slowed down significantly as China has reduced the funding of CPEC projects due to endemic corruption. The main component of CPEC is a network of roads, railways, and pipelines across Baluchistan. Unfortunately, the security situation in Baluchistan, where Gwadar port is situated, is deteriorating. In Oct 2016, six people died and 19 wounded after two explosions, 65km southeast of the provincial capital of Quetta, Baluchistan province. In April 2019, 21 people were killed and 50 others injured in a suicide bombing at a packed market in Baluchistan. In May 2019, Gunmen stormed the Pearl Continental Hotel in the port city of Gwadar, killing at least five people. Gwadar is a city with a massive military presence. It is viewed by both Pakistan and China as the cornerstone of the CPEC to connect Western China with the Arabian Sea. Home to a long-running insurgency, Baluchistan is Pakistan’s poorest and least developed province. It shares a vast, porous border with Iran and Afghanistan. The Baluch separatists, (the Baloch Liberation Army, Baluchistan Liberation Front, and Baloch Republican Guard) strongly opposes CPEC. According to the Baloch National Movement,(BNM), the largest pro-independence political party of Baluchistan, CPEC violates the human rights of the indigenous people of Baluchistan. For instance, BNM points to thousands of Baloch people forced to migrate from the surrounding areas of CPEC in the name of providing security to Chinese engineers and officials. As Gwadar Port became a Special Economic Zone, the people of Gwadar were been barred from fishing along the sea. Washington is very skeptical of China’s role in Pakistan. Although CPEC is a dramatic advancement in China — Pakistan economic ties, the United States’ worries is focused on China’s strategic intents. Washington is worried about the likely use of Pakistani military bases and Gwadar Port by the People’s Liberation Army and the PLA Navy to expand its Beijing’s influence along the Indo-Pacific region Given that Pakistan has plunged itself into a debt crisis, the United States is utilizing the IMF to slow down Pakistan participation in the CPEC. The IMF attached strict terms, including a commitment to freely float the Pakistani rupee rate, broad spending cuts. Spending cuts may push Pakistan to slowdown the importation of Chinese machinery and resources dedicated for the CPEC projects. Beijing has invested a lot in the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor. Therefore, if CPEC is scrapped or delayed, the bilateral ties between Islamabad and Beijing would surely be damaged."
Medium.com,Society,I Was Vehemently Opposed To Headscarves— Until My Mother Decided To Wear One,World,https://medium.com/fearless-she-wrote/i-was-vehemently-opposed-to-headscarves-until-my-mother-decided-to-wear-one-dbee977482b6?source=topic_page---------510------------------1," Chaste women wore headscarves. Even women who did not wear headscarves wistfully admitted that they were sinning. They swore that they too will one day cover their heads. These women had all kinds of reasons why they didn’t join the cult of the covered. These reasons mostly had to do with fashion and hairspray and a secret longing for the ‘male gaze’, the very danger the headscarf was meant to protect you from. None of their reasons had anything to do with oppression of women. Most of my aunts covered themselves. They thought it was inevitable given they worked outside the house — albeit as schoolteachers at girls-only colleges. They took public buses — they were exposed to the male gaze daily. Of course they had to cover up. But my father wouldn’t allow it. My mother was taught to be a biddable and submissive housewife. Of course, she bent under her husband’s will. For the first few decades of her marriage anyway. She decided to wear a headscarf, despite my father’s objections. She was approaching an age where people start to think about their impending death — and the torment of the afterlife. Fear of Judgement Day rules the Muslim consciousness. It burns on low heat most of your life but as you propel towards the ultimate end, the heat starts licking up slowly. My mother realized that it didn’t matter what her husband thought. She was the one who would need to answer to her God. And so, she started covering her head. When I was growing up, I assumed that women who wore a headscarf were doing it, not for themselves, but due to societal expectations. They were influenced by social conditioning. They weren’t able to think for themselves. They had been brainwashed. It was unfathomable to me that anyone would actively choose to cover themselves. But my mother’s decision wasn’t a tacit acceptance of patriarchy. It was an act of rebellion. Growing up, whenever I turned up my nose at wearing a headscarf, people would tell me — Well, what will you do if your husband makes you wear it? A husband cannot make me do anything, I would always declare with confidence. Sure, sure, followed by a casual, disbelieving shrug. Paternalistic smile. Poor young girl — she hasn’t realized yet that she has no choice in the direction of her life. She hasn’t accepted yet that husbands make decisions and wives follow. In fact, it was a bold defiance against the will of her husband. My father wanted a modern wife. My mother was the one who wanted enslavement to God. When my mother decided to wear a headscarf, she faced down snide comments from my father. As she reached for it before leaving the house, he would passive aggressively suggest that she leave it at home. He would tell her she looks better without it. He would tell her it doesn’t go with her outfit. But she never listened. I am proud of her for taking her own decisions and forging her own path. I am proud that she stands her ground when my father tries to coax her out of it. I am proud because she’s staunch in her decision. Her will. Her choice. Her control over her own life. Maybe not all women who wear headscarves are oppressed. Maybe they are making a choice. An informed, well-balanced choice. Isn’t ascribing assumed motives on women’s decisions no different than infantilizing them? Isn’t it, in fact, sexism? You could argue that these choices are driven by social conditioning — programming, even. But then, what choices in life aren’t? Every choice we make has the winds of history, context, nurture, and environment at its back. So who are we to judge someone else’s choices? Because my mother is dogged. She doesn’t give in. She asserts her right to sweep her graying hair in the protective embrace of fabric every day. And I am proud of her for it."
Medium.com,Society,Hong Kong protests — Everything you need to know,World,https://medium.com/blank-101/hong-kong-protests-everything-you-need-to-know-9fa582f25df9?source=topic_page---------511------------------1," Written by — Shantanu Hedaoo, Vanshika Todi, Aditya Ramesh, Aditya Chacko, Anusha YG On February 8, 2018, Chan Tong-Kai and his girlfriend Poon Hiu-Weng, went from their home in Hong Kong to Taiwan for a vacation. Only one of them returned. One month later, on March 2018, Chan confessed to have murdered his girlfriend in Taiwan. It was just a local story at first, only talked about in tabloids. But then, nearly a year later on February 2019, it was the case cited by the government of Hong Kong to propose legislation that would allow the city to transfer criminal suspects to Taiwan and other places with which it lacks an extradition agreement — including Mainland China. And that’s when everything went downhill. A major distinction between Hong Kong and China is the civil rights that are enjoyed by their citizens. The people of Hong Kong exercise freedom of speech and assembly, while their Chinese counterparts live under the authoritarian rule, where speaking so much as a word against the government can land you in court, where the conviction rate is as high as 99% due to arbitrary detentions, torture, and denial of legal representation being very common. This semi-autonomous working of Hong Kong comes from the ‘one country, two systems’ policy that was leftover from the British when they handed over the sovereignty of Hong Kong back to China in 1997. According to the agreement, China is set to have full authority over Hong Kong and its people in 2047. Problem is, China isn’t waiting till 2047. They’d like Hong Kong with them right now. China has slowly been increasing its political, economic and cultural influence over Hong Kong, and a growing number of Hong Kong citizens are being overwhelmed with hopelessness at the face of it. Hong Kong’s top political leader is elected by a 1,200 strong election committee that is held accountable to Beijing, denying the Right to Vote that the citizens had been promised. Half of its legislature is also chosen through indirect electoral systems that are directly or indirectly pro-Beijing. Pro-Democracy leaders have already been arrested from Hong Kong and pushed out of governmental proceedings under the rule of Chinese President Xi Jinping. Many cases of mysterious disappearances of Hong Kong booksellers who used to sell books banned in China have never been solved either, and show how freedom of speech and press is slowly crumbling. But Hong Kong has always pushed back, just as it’s pushing back now. On June 9, 2019, protesters took to the streets demanding the complete withdrawal of the extradition bill. The protests were largely peaceful, which is why on June 12, when police resorted to violence through means of pepper spray, batons and tear gas to disperse the protesters, the demands and discussion took a turn. This was no longer a fight over a bill now. It became a fight over the encroachment of China over Hong Kong, a fight for the future of the freedom of Hong Kong. How has the Chinese government responded to this? Well, much like its constrictive history, the Chinese government has been trying to repress and silence the citizens of Hong Kong, and they are achieving it through the use of media as well. The Chinese media has always been lying and twisting the truth to their advantage, to the point where people in Mainland China are almost persistently left confused by the ever-changing narrative. It has used “foreign interference” as one of the reasons for the protests, stating that countries like the USA would gain an advantage if the system in China is in chaos owing to the ongoing protests. Considering that USA and China have an ongoing trade war, it isn’t exactly helping the case. Another factor to be considered is the strong censorship ploy that China uses. Due to the unavailability of Facebook, Whatsapp or Twitter, the only social media app used there is Weibo. By blocking keywords such as demonstrations, protest, freedom and extradition, China exercises the most basic form of censorship. And when people do post pictures of the protest on Weibo even without the keywords, the reach is still controlled by the government. It is found that the post is visible on the timeline of the person who made the post but disappears gradually from the timeline of the people who have viewed and shared it. Most of the above is done by software, but to have more effective censorship China makes use of actual people. The government hires companies whose primary responsibility is to monitor and block content. This form of business has proven to be extremely lucrative and has risen in demand during the Hong Kong protests, with thousands of people being hired every day, as ‘censor officials’. To avoid these, many of the recent series of protests have been orchestrated using Telegram, an end to end encryption app. However, there have been multiple reports that the app has been disrupted by computer networks in Mainland China. With such control over what passes and what doesn’t into the Chinese mainland, it’s very easy for the Chinese media to cook up their own stories and spread misinformation. This serves very well for the government under Xi Jinping to run without any dissent from the citizens regarding China. Ultimately, however, the Chinese government recognizes that they are faced with two choices: Allow the people of Hong Kong their democratic rights, or face a huge economic and diplomatic loss, as Hong Kong is the gateway to the international waters. Seemingly opting for the former, on 4 September 2019, Hong Kong’s Chief Executive Carrie Lam formally withdrew the extradition bill that sparked these protests, “in order to fully allay public concerns”. She even added some additional concessions, including a community outreach to talk to people to better understand their problems and initiate a study on the causes of Hong Kong’s social injustices. But even as Lam said she hoped these moves would jump-start a dialogue, she remained critical of the protests, which she said had turned Hong Kong into an “unfamiliar place.” Her comments thus far have only fueled the lack of trust between the citizens of Hong Kong and the government, and the protesters are meeting this with skepticism and they’re not alone. Even some pro-Beijing lawmakers in Hong Kong expressed skepticism that this concession would be enough to end the crisis, without an independent investigation into police tactics. Was the Hong Kong government’s concession a genuine attempt to appease the crisis, or to lend it cover for a more aggressive crackdown? This seems to be the biggest question about Lam’s announcement. But the protesters, at least, don’t seem ready to give up just yet."
Medium.com,Society,Bluffers Guide to Brexit,World,https://medium.com/@willrussell_46069/bluffers-guide-to-brexit-ab934ef8950e?source=topic_page---------512------------------1," Brexit explained in three minutes So, you never really got your head around Brexit? Relax. You are not alone, just look at the Houses of Parliament in London, here is a basic road map you can use to get your head around it. Brexit means Britain’s exit from the European Union. Get it? Britain always possessed an influential lobby of Euroscepticism (criticism of the EU) which for example kept the UK from adopting the Euro in 1999. The sceptics believe the EU has morphed from a Free Trade Zone to a Super State, threatening Britain’s national sovereignty. The Conservative Prime Minister David Cameron (May 2010 — July 2016) wanted to stay in Europe. The whole idea of a Brexit referendum started as a pessimistic campaign pledge which was never expected to actually pass. The strategy was to present it to voters, watch it fail and silence hard-line Brexiters like Boris Johnson, while strengthening Cameron’s position in the Conservative Party. He did not bargain with rising nationalism among older voters and a dismal turnout of younger voters. On 23 June 2016, Britain held a referendum, Brexit was passed and Cameron was gone. Theresa May, Conservative Prime Minister(July 2016 — July 2019) was voted in to make sure Brexit would become a reality. In March 2017, May invoked Article 50 to leave on 29 March, 2019. She had a more moderate take on what Brexit should look like and she entered stalemate with hardliners. She requested the EU for several delays, the latest being - 31 October, 2019. Soft Brexit = Deal = Leave EU with a deal offering a transitory period, keeping the same laws and regulations in place, for two years while they negotiate with the EU a longer lasting free trade deal. Hard Brexit = No Deal = Leave EU with no agreements kept in place On 8 June 2017, May called a snap election. She was confident her Conservative Party would romp home and she could then push Brexit through on her own terms. But she lost the majority in Parliament, rebel MPs upset the agenda. May could not get agreement on a deal because Parliament said no several times because of the backstop. Backstop = Fall back position which would prevent a physical border on the island of Ireland, even if the EU & UK could not agree on some other arrangement. Right now both parts of Ireland are governed by EU member states, so there are no border checks. At what price the backstop? — NI (Northern Ireland) or the whole of the UK adheres to EU regulations. But British MPs refused the backstop because they felt it could trap the UK in the EU or create a border in the Irish Sea with NI having different regulations to rest of the UK. Boris Johnson, became Conservative Prime Minister on 24 July promising to end delays — deal or no deal, they were leaving Europe. The EU stated that the deal that they gave May was the only deal, the best deal, backstop and all. Similar to May, Boris lost a series of votes on the intractable issue. In early September, Parliament passed a law making an immediate no-deal Brexit illegal and potentially forcing Boris into asking for another extension to the leave vote. Boris suspended Parliament, but this was ruled unlawful. A law demanding Boris rule out a no deal and ink a Brexit agreement with the EU by 31 October or extend the leave date to 2020 has now being passed. He wants to call an election but Parliament has denied his request. An Election cannot be called midterm unless 2/3 of MPs agree. Boris may find a way around this, with a no confidence vote in himself, which would lead to an election. But that didn’t work for May — Johnson could lose or win by too short a margin. Anything could still happen — a second referendum, a further delay, a deal, or we may be still here, dithering. Happy Hallow e'en"

After unilaterally withdrawing from the Iran nuclear deal, and imposing as many sanctions as possible on Iran, Donald Trump was trying to play the statesman. That’s a controversial statement. Mr Trump may be president of the United States but he’s not a statesman. He may pretend, but we can see what he’s doing. He has routinely threatened Iran with war — or the nearest economic equivalent, “maximum pressure” sanctions that are beggaring the country and provoking it to ever more desperate measures. And yet, he doesn’t really want to take the US into yet another protracted conflict. This, despite blaming Iran for the mid-September strike on a major Saudi oil facility, which briefly dealt a crippling blow to Riyadh’s exports, and shook global markets. Mr Trump’s secretary of state Mike Pompeo called the drone strikes an “act of war on Iran.” But Mr Pompeo’s boss did not say the same. And did not offer a strong response. As the Washington Post’s Anne Gearan wrote at the time: “Trump is caught between a political imperative to confront Iran — pleasing hawkish Republican supporters and allies Israel and Saudi Arabia — and his own political instincts against foreign intervention and toward cutting a deal.” In fact, Iran’s regional adversaries don’t want a conflict and they’ve been slow on the incendiary rhetoric. So, what happens next? We should give thanks that Mr Trump felt the pain of teetering on the horns of a dilemma. War is not a solution. Equally, there doesn’t appear to be a solution for Mr Trump to seize. He has left himself no particular path for diplomacy right now. Mr Trump’s personality and predilections have made the situation with Iran more dangerous. And then there is the impeachment inquiry. Washington will be consumed with that, not with Iran, for the foreseeable future. Originally published at https://www.rashmee.com on September 30, 2019."

Medium.com,Society,Road to ruin for Cambodian garment workers,World,https://medium.com/@uca.news/road-to-ruin-for-cambodian-garment-workers-2b0aee89fb2b?source=topic_page---------516------------------1," Poor safety standards mean that traffic accidents continue to maim and kill employees G
arment worker Phork Lang has been working in Cambodia’s Svay Rieng province for only seven months but has already been involved in two traffic accidents while commuting to and from work. On July 2, the minivan taking her home from a factory in Santong special economic zone was hit by a truck. “My leg was heavily swollen,” she said. Phork Lang, 26, barely had time to recover from her injury before she was involved in another accident on July 20. This time the consequences were more severe. A truck crashed into the minivan carrying her and 42 colleagues from home to work. Of the 20 who were injured, 16 were seriously hurt. Phork Lang broke a bone in her shoulder and lost consciousness. “A colleague of mine is worse off. She now has blood clots on her brain. She suffers from memory loss and doesn’t remember anyone anymore. She’s still under treatment in hospital in Phnom Penh,” she said. Last week the Cambodian government announced that the minimum monthly wage for garment workers will be increased from US$182 to US$190 in January 2020. But while wages have risen steadily over the past years, other problems in the garment industry — Cambodia’s largest industry with about 750,000 workers — continue to be unsolved. One of them is the significant number of traffic accidents that happen when workers are traveling to and from work, often in overloaded minivans and in trucks that were not designed to transport people but to carry goods or cattle. A July report by Cambodia’s National Social Security Fund (NSFF) showed that in the first six months of this year 24 garment workers were killed in traffic accidents, while 944 were injured. This was a significant increase from the same period in 2018 when 16 workers were killed and 882 were injured. For Rak Rin, a 32-year-old woman who worked at Horizon Outdoor Factory for over three years, everything changed on April 4 when the truck taking her from home to work hit a truck carrying construction supplies. Because she was leaning with her left arm through the bars of the truck, her arm was completely cut off. The same fate struck four of her colleagues. “I was standing in the middle and never saw that truck coming because I couldn’t see what was happening in front of us or behind us,” Rak Rin said. She explained that she barely had space to move around in the truck and the only way to keep balance was to put her arm through the bars. “I wish that the driver had put seats in the truck so that we could sit and not have to put our arms through the bars. Then I would still have my left arm,” she told ucanews.com, adding that she’s now unable to work. Poorly maintained roads Accidents involving garment workers are far from new in Cambodia. Workers have been complaining for years about drivers who overload their trucks with dozens of workers, show little respect for speed limits and other vehicles, are clearly intoxicated or show a complete lack of driving skills. They also complain about Cambodia’s bad infrastructure, with many potholes in poorly maintained roads and a lack of street lights. In 2015 and 2016, more than 100 garment workers were killed in thousands of traffic accidents. While the number of accidents has decreased, Cambodia’s traffic still claimed 40 fatalities and 1,894 injuries last year. In a recent conference about the issue, Luy Chhim, deputy chief of Phnom Penh’s traffic police, confirmed that many vehicles are not designed to transport people, meaning that they are illegal and unlicensed. “But we don’t have other options as the drivers have already bought their trucks,” he said. “Besides that, in some areas buses and minivans can’t reach the villages in the rainy season because the road conditions are so bad.” The deputy police chief added that for now “we are closing our eyes and allowing them to transport workers.” Ath Thorn, president of the Cambodian Labour Confederation, said the accident problem and other issues needs to be addressed. Apart from the minimum wage, unions recently proposed 13 other points to the government including safe transport for workers. “I have proposed that the NSSF arrange a budget that can be used to replace the vehicles the workers are currently using so that they can commute safely,” he said, William Conklin, Cambodia director of international labor organization Solidarity Center, believes the problem can be fixed. “From a union perspective, we now have to confront the government and find a solution,” he said. “Employers should be part of that solution. Their responsibility doesn’t end at the factory door. We worked together to increase the minimum wage from US$60 about 10 years ago to the current US$182. I believe we can also work together to provide safe transport for workers.” Solving the problem, however, may not be easy in the impoverished country. Ken Loo, general secretary of the Garment Manufacturers Association in Cambodia (GMAC), an association that represents over 600 factories, told ucanews.com that it’s not only up to factories to address the issue. “The employer already pays every worker US$7 per month for transport. It doesn’t mean we have to cover 100 percent of it. Workers themselves should contribute more to make sure they will have safe transport, and other stakeholders such as the brands and the government should get involved as part of the solution,” he said. And even with more money on the table, the problem may not automatically go away, Loo warned. “There was a time when workers asked for a higher food allowance, but now that they have it, they don’t buy better food than before. It may be the same with transport. They can ask for more money, but they may not choose a better type of transport and instead use the money for other purposes,” he said. Sineat Yon, Phnom Penh

Medium.com,Society,The Refugee Situation on Samos,World,https://medium.com/@arthur.g.peirce/the-refugee-situation-on-samos-4cb51ad93e0b?source=topic_page---------517------------------1," The inside story The city of Vathy lies on a picturesque section of the Greek Island of Samos’ northern coast. In areas nearby, Turkey can easily be seen from the shore, making the island a hub for migrants seeking entry to the EU. Almost every day people arrive on these shores. Currently, there are well over 4,100 asylum seekers on the island, most of whom are from Afghanistan (37%) with the rest from The Democratic Republic of the Congo (17%) Iraq (12%), Syria (8%), or elsewhere. The numbers are set to rise further, with a massive and unexpected spike in sea arrivals occurring in recent weeks. The camp where the majority of the migrants reside is roughly 600% overcapacity. It was built to house 650 people, but today it houses over 4000. This has forced many residents to live in a rough shantytown composed of old tents and shacks littered around a copse of trees bordering the camp — an area many refer to as “the Jungle”, an obvious echo of the informal camp that existed in Calais until its demolition in 2017. The conditions there are unfit for human settlement. The rubbish and detritus littering the floor have attracted rats and snakes that live amongst the impromptu dwellings and the people within. In addition to this, the unsteady, hole-ridden ground has made walking in the jungle area unsafe, so elderly residents or those with mobility issues find it extremely difficult to head to the town, and to access the services within. One person, who volunteered in a women’s centre told me that a number of pregnant women have suffered miscarriages due to the stress of living in such a place. What is driving this stress, is a sense of stagnation. Most people in the camp are waiting for asylum interviews, approval to move to the mainland, or an appeal. Initially, the asylum process was designed to take only a couple of months, but given the sheer number of people in the camp, the frequency of new arrivals, compared to the relatively few officials in charge of processing asylum claims, the process can, and often does, take a year or more. This has led to many illegally trying to gain passage aboard the ferry to the mainland, but most are caught in the attempt. One man from Afghanistan told me, with frustration, of how his family saved up a considerable fortune to get him to Europe, only to end up stuck on the island. His family remains in Afghanistan. The recently elected Nea Demokratia (New Democracy) party in Greece has vowed to improve this process, limiting processing times to a maximum of six weeks, as well as raise the standards of living conditions in the camps, but it is too early to say how effective these measures will prove to be. With numbers of deportations set to rise, many of the Samos-based humanitarian groups are concerned. There are plans to move the camp further inland. Currently, the Samos camp stands on a junction, roughly fifteen minutes from the city centre. This has allowed migrants access to shops, services, and beaches around the city. In addition to this, over the past few months, a number of NGOs have opened drop-in centres in the city. One NGO, Med’EqualiTeam runs a drop-in medical centre. Another, Action for Education runs a youth centre and language school, catering for 18–23 year-olds, the largest age group in the camp. As no NGO is allowed to operate in the camp itself, it is feared that the moving of the camp would cripple the existing aid infrastructure. This will leave the migrants in Samos unable to either receive the support of NGOs and grassroots organisations, which many have come to rely on or improve their lives once finally settled. Aside from language learning, some organisations like Glocal Roots, Action For Education, and One Digital World operates computer classes and vocational skill lessons for refugee women. Through One Digital World’s curriculum, women, some of whom have never used a computer before, come to learn the fundamentals of computer science, networking, and even basic computer programming. Some refugees participate directly with teaching, passing on to others the skills of their former lives. Many of the requirements currently satisfied by NGOs can also be fulfilled by the Greek state. According to Greek law, even children without residency or identity papers have access to the school system, and of course, all have access to medical care. But, considering the sheer number of people who require these services, and the country’s recent economic problems, it could prove to be the case that demand far exceeds Greece’s capacity to supply. Across Greece, migrant and refugee children struggle to access the education system, and even mainland camps have deeply insufficient medical services. In recent weeks, the relationship between camp residents and the Greek residents of Vathy has deteriorated. A couple of weeks ago, a town celebration ended early when representatives of the Mayor took to the stage and accused migrants and asylum seekers of effectively killing the island’s tourism industry, which many businesses on the island need to survive. Many shops, bars, restaurants, and even beaches have either outright banned migrants, or have taken measures to limit the number who use them. Some asylum seekers have even said they have been forcibly removed from one of the more popular beaches by private security guards. This strained relationship has made Vathy, the main town of Samos, a place with three communities. The resident Greek community, the refugee community, and the international volunteers or NGO staff. The refugees and volunteers mostly interact with each other, leaving the Greek residents disconnected. This poses clear problems regarding integration, with refugees learning more English, French, and German than Greek (this isn’t to say that there isn’t any interest, there just aren’t sufficient teachers), and international volunteers learning little Greek, or knowing Greek culture. One former volunteer described it as being a “bubble”, leaving their assignment in Greece knowing more about the culture, language, and customs of countries like Iraq and Afghanistan, than Greece. This may brew frustration with local communities, seeing hundreds or even thousands of foreign visitors spending months in the community, but not engaging with it. Worse still, according to one NGO worker, many of the local Greeks believe that those who reside in the camp and its squalid conditions do so by choice — that the refugees and asylum seekers live dirty lives. This could be improved through greater integration and communication, and it is possible that more can be done to improve integration efforts, but until then, it is easy to see how miscommunication and disconnection could create further stress and antagonism between communities. But the NGOs, mostly being small and underfunded, simply lack the capacity to improve integration. Despite there being clear efforts to improve the situation by the Greek state and others, there are simply not enough resources to provide for everyone’s basic needs. So, while it is possible that the moving of the camp to another location on Samos could deal with the massive overcrowding problem, the distance from the existing aid infrastructure could prove to be massively detrimental for the migrants stranded on the island."

hen the United Kingdom finally leaves the European Union, be it on the 31st October or a date further down the line, Ireland will invariably find itself both geographically and politically adrift. Although Anglo-Irish relations have somewhat soured over the last three years — in part due to the incessant anti-Irish bashing in publications such as The Spectator — the UK has acted as both a buffer and a valuable ally to Ireland in the European Union. Since Ireland and the UK (along with Denmark) joined the then European Communities in 1973, the UK and Ireland have largely voted in tandem. From 2009–2015, Ireland voted with the UK a whopping 87% of the time in the European Council. This is due to our shared (perhaps imposed might be more suitable) history and culture and, to name but a few Ireland and the UK share: a land border, language, timezone, legal system and even a rugby team every four years. In 2018, UK exports to Ireland were worth £38.3 billion; imports from Ireland were £21.9 billion. That makes Ireland the UK’s 5th largest export market. On the other hand, the UK is Ireland’s largest EU trading partner and exports to the UK make up 11% of all exports. In whatever manner the UK finally exits the European Union, Ireland will no longer have its larger neighbour to sit with at the table. Whether for the force of good or bad, the EU will take on a much more ‘continental’ shape, firmly driven by the Franco-German axis. This is according to Catherine Day, former Secretary-General of the European Commission, who outlined her vision of a post-Brexit EU: “France and Germany will play a bigger role in shaping the future direction of the EU and will no longer have to contend with the questioning and reluctant attitude of the UK. The EU was already working before the UK and we joined but Ireland has never known the EU without the UK. We often saw issues in a similar way to the UK and will miss the role they played as a big Member State which was often a buffer between France and Germany” Although not always the case, there is a desire in the European Council to make decisions unanimously. 28 Member States all with varying political, social, economic and geographic standpoints will always have disagreements. Ireland, a small island that makes up just 0.94% (2017) of the total EU population now has to find new friends within this club."
Medium.com,Society,“Eternal vigilance is the price of liberty”,World,https://medium.com/@WillSadler/eternal-vigilance-is-the-price-of-liberty-74682590ffa4?source=topic_page---------519------------------1," As the turbulent weeks of Brexit court dramas rumbled on, the constitutional lawyer, David Allen-Green had a running joke: “Remember everyone, constitutional law should not be this exciting” But when you strip away the intellectual veneer and break it down to its bare essentials, far from making eyes glaze over, I think that the law and politics concerning how we are governed is something we care deeply about. Namely: who makes the decisions? This is the question that has always been — ostentatiously at least — at the heart of the Brexit debate. Do we want decisions made in Brussels or only at Westminster? How strange then, that Brexit-supporters who claim to be advocates of the latter, have actively sought to undermine British parliamentary sovereignty. In the snap election of 2017, the British electorate delivered a hung parliament that was overwhelmingly against a ‘no deal’ Brexit. When that parliament delivered the will of the people and rejected ‘no deal’ by passing the so-called ‘Benn Act’, the hard-line Brexiteers went nuclear, and tried to thwart that will by shutting down the legislature. In a unanimous ruling, the UK Supreme Court’s eleven justices decided that Boris Johnson was found to have unlawfully prorogued parliament. Despite its true purpose of thwarting plans to block ‘no deal’ being something of an open secret, the government claimed it was a ‘business and usual’ tying up of one legislative session and preparation for the next. At a time of national crisis, the prorogation was due to last five weeks — three weeks longer than experts said was necessary. It was to be the longest parliamentary suspension since the second world war, with up to 19 sitting days being scrapped, far more than six or so claimed by the government. On the one hand, one could argue that the Supreme Court ruling was proof that our unwritten constitution — the rules about who makes decisions and how — was coping well under pressure, especially as the eleven justices voted unanimously that Johnson’s decision was unlawful. On the other hand, merely days before, the High Court had ruled the case was non-justiciable (meaning that they felt it was something the courts couldn’t even get involved in, never mind rule on). Only a few weeks before, legal experts such as David Allen-Green, were putting the chances of prorogation being solved through the courts as very slim indeed. Whilst I feel encouraged by the Supreme Court ruling, it has also shone a light on two things for me: firstly, just how vulnerable checks and balances in other areas of our constitution are, and secondly how even the most functioning liberal democracy is only ever a few bad decisions away from tyranny. In an interview before the UK Supreme Court’s ruling, Jolyon Maugham, one of the lawyers involved in the successful legal action described what was at stake. “How do you feel as a prime minister when you’ve had a little taste of power, uninterrupted by anybody else; where if parliament becomes an inconvenience to you, you can suspend it? If the rule of law becomes an inconvenience to you, you can ignore it?” he asked. Here’s what concerns me. The events of the last few weeks prove that Boris Johnson, and his hedge-fund chums set to make millions from a no-deal Brexit, only support British parliamentary democracy so long as its decisions go their way. Authoritarianism isn’t one thing or another. It lies on a sliding scale, and has to start somewhere. It springs from eddies in the wake of public rage. It paints extreme action as an easy solution. It uses vulnerable people as easy scapegoats. It pits the ‘elites’ against the ‘people’. It tests the boundaries of institutions and the rule of law to find and exploit weaknesses. So, is the British constitution really fit for purpose for the shocks that are set to come? Maugham’s latter reference related to claims by Boris Johnson’s outriders, and heavily insinuated by Johnson himself, that in order to deliver his ‘do or die’ Brexit on 31st October, he may well ignore the law compelling him to seek an extension to Article 50 to avoid a ‘no deal’ departure from the bloc. If he simply ignores the law, the Supreme Court would be likely to issue an order that he must comply. If he still refuses, it’s possible that he could be arrested for being in contempt of court. But what if he requests the extension whilst adding unacceptable conditions, or tries to persuade one EU member — for it only takes one — to veto the extension? I believe that at the heart of our constitutional vulnerability is the royal prerogative — the powers originally invested in the monarch that have been gradually devolved to the prime minister. This gives the prime minister of the day considerable powers that they can exercise unilaterally. This includes the suspension of parliament, something that the government is being rumoured to be considering again despite the Supreme Court decision. It includes the power to set an election date. The main reason why opposition parties refused to support Johnson’s attempt to trigger an election was fears that he’d set this date for after 31st October thereby forcing a no deal departure from the E.U. Furthermore, there are concerns that these prerogative powers could be used to disregard the Benn Act through using something called an ‘order of council’. Crucially, these powers include the prime minister’s responsibility to recommend to the Queen who else can command a parliamentary majority in the event that they can’t. What happens if they simply refuse to recommend someone? This is a scenario that the badly written Fixed Term Parliament Act could lead to. Johnson may lose a no confidence vote in the coming days or weeks, but there is — at best — confusion about whether he’d be legally obliged to resign if he lost that vote. Meanwhile Downing Street briefs that in such an event, he’d stay put, raising the spectre of an unelected prime minister who, despite losing the support of parliament, squats in Number 10 Downing Street. Whilst on one level, the Queen’s eagerness to not get involved in politics is quite right, it also highlights the utter pointlessness of her position, despite a price tag to the taxpayer of some £350 million per year. So whilst the U.K remains a million miles away from the troubling destination of what could be considered an authoritarian regime, history has taught us that it only takes a few bad and unchecked decisions to travel that distance at light-speed. It was the American abolitionist Wendell Phillips who said: “eternal vigilance is the price of liberty.” And even in the mother of all democracies, his advice should be heeded very carefully indeed."
Medium.com,Society,Pakistan PM Imran Khan’s Hate-filled Nuclear Blackmail,World,https://medium.com/@vrcreddy2014/pakistan-pm-imran-khans-hate-filled-nuclear-blackmail-1059d738ecc5?source=topic_page---------520------------------1," Those who watched the Prime Minister of Pakistan Imran Khan’s speech at United Nations General Assembly (UNGA) might have wondered whether the people of Pakistan elected a leader to rule their country or chosen a Mulla to give inflammatory sermons to radicalize the global Muslim community. Though he touched upon Climate change briefly and wailed about how the rich elites are looting Pakistan, he primarily tried to project his country as a patron of Islam and the representative of global Muslim ummah in his almost one-hour long rant. He gave a long and boring sermon to an almost empty hall on so-called Islamophobia and tried to defend radical Islamic terrorism by playing the victim card. The entire world has understood the nature and motives of radical Islam and its pernicious maneuvers. The people all over the world have understood the fact that radical Islam wants to Islamize the entire world through its violent and bloodthirsty Jihad. They want to establish Dar al-Islam and impose the draconian Sharia law on the entire humanity. The innumerable pogroms perpetrated by radical Islamists, in which lives of a vast number of people were snuffed out, bear testimony to the apocalyptic nature of radical Islam. Therefore, an overwhelming majority of the world community has already concluded that the so-called Islamophobia is non-existent. In fact, what we are witnessing now is Islamorealism. Therefore, no amount of obfuscation can stop people from seeing reality. As of now, radical Islam is able to survive and thrive deriving support from the left-leaning journos, activists and politicians who emerged as the prominent supporters of global Jihad and vociferous terror apologists. This situation, however, will not last long considering the world-wide awakening that is happening about the dangers of radical Islam. Pakistan, along with Saudi Arabia, has played an active role in radicalizing the Muslim community. The proliferation of Madrasas across the globe, through which the ultra-conservative Wahabi Islam is being propagated, has become a cause of concern all over the world. In his speech, Imran Khan himself admitted that the Pakistani army and the Inter-Services Intelligence (ISI) trained Al-Qaeda and other terrorist groups in return for money. The entire world, except a few Islamic countries, has already acknowledged the fact that Pakistan, through its indoctrination and terror training activities, has emerged as a global epicenter of Islamist terror. Therefore, Imran Khan’s wild rant about Islamophobia and his attempt to play the victim card is an exercise in sheer futility. As expected, the self-proclaimed ambassador of the people of Kashmir raised the issue of so-called human rights violations in the union territory of India. The Indian government consigned Article 370 to dust bin to stop Kashmir from descending into terror hellhole. The radical Islamists, after resorting to the ethnic cleansing of Hindu Pandits from Kashmir, have planned to either join Pakistan or establish a separate Islamic theocratic state. Indian action of abrogating the said article not only stopped the formation another Sharia-compliant hellhole but also restored equal rights to women, the LGBT community and Dalits, who were reduced to the status of second-class citizens by Islamist hegemony. Imran Khan, the self-styled advocate of Muslim rights, is not able to muster up enough courage to denounce the atrocities perpetrated by China against Uyghur Muslims. Their mosques are destroyed, they are not allowed to celebrate their festivals, men are not allowed to grow beards and women are prohibited from wearing burqas. Most importantly, China, which considers Islam a mental illness, started treating the illness in concentration camps to de-Islamize Uyghur Muslims. But the custodian of global Muslim Ummah, Imran Khan, neither denounced China’s actions nor does he have any words of sympathy for them. And finally, Imran Khan, who started his speech with his raw rhetoric, which is laden with theocratic parlance, ended it with a nuclear threat to the entire world. His nuclear blackmail by pointing to his country’s possession of the Islamic bomb is highly reprehensible. Khan has used an international arena to resort to nuclear blackmail and ended up delivering a hate speech against India. His futile rant only manifested his frustration with his inability to solve his country’s domestic problems. Pakistan’s economy is in deep crisis and the people are struggling with ever-increasing inflation and unemployment. Their lives are becoming increasingly burdensome. But their Prime Minister appointed himself as the ambassador of Kashmir and now he even shouldered the additional responsibility of being the patron of the global Muslim ummah. So, the ordinary people of Pakistan, who don’t have anyone to mitigate their suffering, are left in the lurch. Imran Khan raised the bogey of Islamophobia to divert people’s attention from his failures. He, along with the president of Turkey, Erdogan, and the Prime Minister of Malaysia, Mahathir Mohamad, announced the launching of an Islamic television station to fight Islamophobia. But there are already channels such as Al Jazeera, which are fighting the so-called Islamophobia without any success. All that these TV stations could do is expose themselves as being terror apologists by obfuscating things, which is not sustainable in the long run. In view of Pakistan’s emergence as the most unstable and dangerous country, the world community must take note of its efforts to mainstream radical Islamic terrorism. Its dangerous actions will have a disastrous impact on the future of humanity. If the world community ignores Imran’s radical rant, one day the apocalyptic Islamism, which he and his ilk are nurturing, will knock at every nation’s doors to destroy them."
Medium.com,Society,Climate change will require fast cross-border monetary flows,World,https://medium.com/the-future-is-electric/climate-change-will-require-fast-cross-border-monetary-flows-81be2182c5e3?source=topic_page---------521------------------1," In 2015 and 2016, Canada took in 25,000 Syrian refugees, a small percentage of the ones displaced by the Syrian Civil War. This was embraced by Canadians, as we have a history of welcoming waves of refugees from the freed slaves of the Underground Railroad through Ismaili’s expelled from Uganda to Vietnamese Boat People. It’s in our cultural DNA to open our arms to the oppressed and endangered. Those waves of refugees have become some of our greatest Canadian citizens. The coming decades are going to see more and more of that. The Syrian refugees were not the first where a link to climate change can be found and they won’t be the last. The Civil War was caused in part by drought in that country, and the drought was caused in part by climate change. Only a portion, perhaps 10% of the five million displaced out of Syria, can be attributed to climate change instead of the other, readily identifiable causes of this civil war, but the attribution is there. That flow of refugees has had global consequences. Politics in Canada, the United States and Europe changed substantially as countries struggled with millions of displaced people. Some closed their borders, turning their backs on these people. Others, like Germany, flung their doors wide and accepted the fractious challenge of supporting them in their time of need. Estimates vary on the number that will be displaced by climate change, but start in the tens of millions and rise into the high hundreds of millions by 2050. As we face yet another pair of elections in North America where the choices are stark between major parties on climate action, the world is clearly not addressing the issue with sufficient urgency to prevent this. We will see tens or hundreds of millions of people displaced from their countries by the impacts of climate change. The Syrian Refugees were the first of many. With these refugees come flows of money. They carry bundles of unusual currencies. They try to get money out of accounts in the country that they fled from. They try to transfer money out of the country ahead of them to people who have already escaped. They try to send money back into the country to aid those left behind. They have to transfer money between currencies with exchanges that are unusual and arcane. While the global poor will be overrepresented among the refugees, the Syrian refugees included innumerable well-off middle class people struggling to survive sudden turmoil. And they bring different payment technical challenges with them. They bring mobile apps used for transferring money in their country and are blocked from using them in the countries that welcome them by a variety of concerns. Mobile micro-payment solutions in one region don’t exist in North America or Europe. Some turn to new, crypto-currency solutions, only to find either no ability to accept it at one end or the other, or merely fraud, losing their money entirely. Even in Canada we’ve seen the challenges first hand. The Fort MacMurray wild fires once again had climate change as a causative factor. University of Alberta wildland fire Prof. Mike Flannigan pointed out to the CBC this year, “The Fort McMurray fire was 1 1/2 to six times more likely because of climate change. The 2017 record-breaking B.C. fire season was seven to 11 times more likely because of climate change.” The more than 80,000 people forced to flee the fire often left with nothing but the clothes on their backs and what they could fit hurriedly into their cars and trucks. Michael Barnard, one of the authors, participated in one of the corporate responses, attempting to link aid agencies more easily, and heard story after story about flowing money. The aid agencies wanted money, from where ever in the world people might send it, instead of goods. The displaced citizens of Alberta needed money for basic goods, and the only agency able to assist rapidly enough was Alberta Community and Social Services, who were able to work with banks and create pre-filled debit cards. This is space Raj Kotecha, another of the authors, has been working in, as a modern technology- and business-aligned leader in major technology companies, Big Six Canadian banks and now KPMG. The causes of the Syrian civil War, like many similar conflicts, is a complex multi-faceted question. But we have seen patterns like these before. History has taught us a lot about the impacts on human populations in these situations and the sort of help they need in times of crisis. The East Africa region is an interesting case study. Worsening droughts have been a feature of this area for several decades. A lot of research has been done establishing the causal link between climate change and violence in Somalia, Tanzania, South Sudan, Kenya, Uganda and Ethiopia. In some cases the situation has erupted into large scale conflicts and civil war, which in turn has given rise to the need for new and innovative financial services. Somalia and the story of Dahabshiil is a great example. Starting in 1970 as a relatively small scale remittance broker for Somali expats, Dahabshiil, which literally means “gold smelter”, rapidly evolved into an essential service during the Somali civil war. When war initially broke out in 1988, half a million Somalis including Dahabshiil’s founder, Mohamed Said Duale were displaced and the original business suffered significant setbacks. Duale managed to quickly relaunch the service with an emphasis on helping Somali refugees send goods back to displaced family members. Today Dahabshiil has grown to be the largest African money transfer business operating in 126 countries across the world, 40 of which are in Africa. The “Somalian Diaspora” as it has come to be known now exceeds 1 million refugees, Canada is home to one of the largest populations standing at 150,000. The global Somali remittance market alone is now worth approximately USD$800m annually, with Canada accounting for CAD$65m annually. It will be interesting to see similar statistics for Syrian populations over time. Stories like Dahabshiil underlines a well understood concept that necessity breeds innovation. In times of crises speed is important. That trip to the bank is at best inconvenient and at worst perilous. This means fast, reliable and secure wire transfers from person to person. It’s also interesting to note the longevity of these services beyond times of crisis. In the case of Dahabhshiil, it has grown significantly, maintaining its status as Somalia’s primary remittance service and significantly expanding its presence beyond national borders. There are of course important initiatives underway today amongst mainstream global banks to accelerate cross border payments. ISO20022, which aims to standardise payment information across all of the worlds’ major banks, has strong adoption in Europe with other geographies including North America following suit. SWIFT, which owns the lion share of the enterprise wire market has made strong commitments to invest in ISO20022 and more recently, commitments to enable real-time 24/7 payments. Standardization is going to help over the long term. In the meantime we recommend keeping an eye on different approaches to cross-border remittance. Accelerated migration as a result of climate change is a great frame. The needs of displaced populations are real and immediate and climate change is going to play a significant part in defining the magnitude of population displacement in the years to come. What we’re finding is the challenges borne out of this space are a great catalyst for finance sector enterprises to understand and evaluate opportunities stemming from several key areas: ISO20022, un-banked, KYC/AML, mobile payments and of course blockchain."

Medium.com,Society,Should Compulsory Voting be Introduced in the UK?,World,https://medium.com/@syedanoshinj/should-compulsory-voting-be-introduced-in-the-uk-e9de22a0979d?source=topic_page---------523------------------1," To vote is a right. Everyone, in a democratic society like the UK, is given this right — alongside the freedom of expression and choice. A law enforcing compulsory voting takes away these rights simply as a means to create a more just representation in the political system despite there being other solutions. This essay will argue that despite the importance of voting, making it compulsory will be less representative and that the solution to lack of voting is education. First, we must question why we should force a right and how this would be implemented. Surely making it obligatory to vote removes what Britain prides itself on — liberty. Also, to be enforced it would have to become a law, however, a law is reasonable and just which distinguishes it from examples like threats from bullies. One complies with the demands of a bully because of fear. It is not fair, nor is it acceptable. The law is the opposite. Compulsory voting is not just or reasonable because it rejects our fundamental human rights of freedom of choice by forcing us to vote and implementing punishment in the case of the failure to do so. Voting holds a great importance in society. This is undeniable. Nevertheless, respect for those who do not wish to vote is arguably more significant because, in turn, their lack of interest can lead to voting for a random party they know nothing about. Therefore, compulsory voting as a law does not make sense, and cannot be made compulsory easily. Compulsory voting stems from an idea to create more of a diverse and full representation in politics. We need more young people voting to create a society that they want to live in. Thus we must ask ourselves why they don’t vote. Perhaps the lack of voting shows more about their views on the political system than voting — it could show their disagreement in terms of the candidates and how they do not have anyone to truly represent them and their beliefs. These ‘political statements’ have a large hold on society; protests, obstructing the voting card so it’s unusable — these both show a lot on their perspectives and could be more significant than voting. Young people are showing their beliefs using other means which for them are more important than voting. However, abstention could simply be a result of laziness or that they forgot about the deadlines or could not make it to the poll station. On the other hand, if these are the reasons for not voting, this shows a true lack of interest in politics, and do we really want young people — who are voting for the sake of it — to vote? They will be too easily influenced by parents or friends — and this is less representative than abstaining. We understand the importance of voting and the need for more people, in particular, young people, to vote. However, making it compulsory is not the solution. Instead, we must educate the younger generation. The issue lies within the lack of interest and education young people hold. They do not seem to have opinions and instead blindly follow their friends and family for political views. That is not to say they are not mature enough, we just need to teach them to give them opinions on which they can base their votes upon. Furthermore, school is a setting in which one is conditioned, socialised and internalises certain beliefs shared by peers and teachers. If there was a lesson or work where students learnt about the basics of politics — or even simply during form times one could watch videos played by teachers — students would become much more interested and knowledgeable on politics and thus have a stronger desire to vote. Overall, there seems to be a greater issue at hand — the lack of knowledge of politics. Now let us distinguish between a privilege and a duty. As Hohfeld argues, a privilege is correlated with a no-right in someone else. If you have the privilege, or liberty, to exercise free speech, no one has the right to prevent you from doing so. It is important to note that simply having such a liberty does not mean you have a duty to exercise this. Therefore, a privilege is not equal to a duty. One could argue that voting is not a privilege but a right as everyone is entitled to rights in a democratic society like the UK. Hohfeld says a right is correlated with a duty in someone else. Having a right — or as Hohfeld says, a claim-right — does not mean you have a duty. It does, however, mean that someone has a duty to provide you with this right. For instance, for you to have a claim-right to vote, someone else has a duty to provide you with this opportunity to vote. Consequently, it does not seem to matter whether or not voting is a privilege or right because both are similar in that they do not equate to a duty. This means no one has a duty to vote. It would be more useful to encourage voting not to enforce it, which takes away our right to choose and makes our society less democratic. We should look at why young people do not vote and what this as a message is showing — for example, dislike to all candidates, shows our candidates are not as diverse as needed which we must change. Voting is a right, and arguably also a privilege that one should not take for granted, but having this as a ‘task’ makes it less ‘special’. Education is the key solution to combating the issue of abstention and still maintains a diverse society."
Medium.com,Society,How an Emperor Trapped a Con Man,World,https://medium.com/@tudorscribe/how-an-emperor-trapped-a-con-man-935c7119a736?source=topic_page---------524------------------1," Edward Kelley claimed he could talk to angels — and turn metals into gold The castle of Hrad Krivoklat, west of Prague, was built in the 12th century, complete with a Gothic chapel. Statues of the twelve apostles gazed at worshippers from high above and at the altar stood a statue of Jesus, flanked by angels with golden wings. The chapel lasted while the castle went through many changes. By the 16th century Hrad Krivoklat functioned as a prison, and in 1591 a highly unusual prisoner was sent there, a lone Englishman of middle age and cropped ears named Edward Kelley. Kelley was held in a cell at the command of Holy Roman Emperor Rudolf II, born a Hapsburg prince. The Englishman had important decisions to make if he had any chance at all at winning his freedom. He was no doubt forbidden to avail himself of the castle chapel while making his decisions. But if he had, those winged angels might have carried special significance to him. Perhaps they would have comforted him. Or perhaps not. After months of imprisonment, Kelley was in fact due to be released, but for a single purpose. The emperor expected much of the man who came to Prague with the renowned John Dee in 1586. Rudolf had favored him, enriched him, and spoiled him. The English commoner even held an imperial title: He was Sir Edward Kelley of Imamyi, “Baron of Bohemia,” and he lived in high style in Prague. Why did this bounty rain down on Kelley? Because Rudolf, an emotionally erratic Hapsburg obsessed with art, philosophy and magic, was convinced that Kelley possessed a secret of alchemy. There had been tantalizing glimpses of his power. However, Kelley had not come through as yet with what the emperor sought. He’d been arrested for dueling. But it was believed the true reason for his imprisonment was to force him to produce what the emperor wanted. And that was gold — and with it, a road to immortality. While deciding what to do, Kelley reflected. This is only speculation — but these could be the turning points in time that flitted through his mind: March 1582: John Dee, illustrious scholar, astrologer, mathematician, physician, and philosopher, was in residence at his house, Mortlake, when a knock at the door produced a young man who called himself Edward Talbot, in the company of a Dee friend, Mr. Clerkson. Talbot was a name used by Edward Kelley. They had arrived at a prestigious address. Dee had a unique relationship with Queen Elizabeth. He was her personal astrologer — Dee selected her date of coronation — and adviser, but their meetings were discreet and their communications guarded. Courtiers at the pinnacle of her court — Robert Dudley and Christopher Hatton — also believed in Dee. But endorsement could not be open because Dee’s methods skirted heresy. During the reign of Elizabeth’s half-sister, Mary I, he was arrested under suspicion of casting the horoscopes of Queen Mary and Princess Elizabeth with an eye to predicting the succession. This was treason. He managed to exonerate himself, and found favor with Elizabeth but she did not financially reward him to the extent that he wished. Money worries dogged Dee for his entire life. As for “Talbot,” he was born in St. Swithin’s, Worcester on August 1, 1555, according to a discovered astrological chart. Kelley may or may not have attended Oxford. He always wore his hair long or donned a monk’s cowl or cap with hanging flaps to conceal the fact that his ears were missing. It was said he had been pilloried for “coining” (forging or adulterating coins) and lost his ears as punishment. Clerkson brought Kelley to Dee because he had heard that the Queen’s conjurer was in need of a new “skryer,” or crystal gazer. Such men were not uncommon. “Almost every parish, and apparently several aristocratic households, boasted a ‘cunning man,’ who for the price of a beer or a bed would summon spirits or tell fortunes,” says The Queen’s Conjurer: the Science and Magic of Dr. John Dee, Adviser to Elizabeth I. Dee had lofty motives for wanting to communicate with spirits of the other world: to elevate and unite mankind in an era of religious wars, hunger and disease. He sought to understand the universe. On his next visit to Mortlake, Kelley gave him what sounds like a winning audition. After looking into one of Dee’s crystals for a quarter of an hour, Kelley said he’d made contact with an angel named Uriel, “the angel of light.” Uriel had a number of messages for Dee. Kelley was hired. 1583: A boat sailed from England, carrying Dee, Kelley and their respective families. Destination: Poland. Dee had a much younger wife named Jane and small children; Kelley had recently married a widow with children. The trip was paid for by Albert Laski, a Polish count who came to England as an envoy to Elizabeth and was introduced to Dee and Kelley by Robert Dudley, earl of Leicester. Laski was a known dabbler in the occult, and soon spent much of his time at Mortlake. Dee and Kelley had been focusing a tremendous amount of time on their “conferences” with angels. Kelley acted as medium, and Dee pondered the communications, which had to be decoded. The language that the various angels — Uriel was joined by Michael as well as other celestials — used was “Enochian.” These were the pure words God spoke to Adam, before the Fall. Dee sought to decode the entire language and capture the wisdom of the angels in a book. In recent weeks, the angels, through Kelley as medium, had begun to urge Dee to leave England, at the same time that Laski was making his offer. Dee was also worried that Elizabeth’s support of his work was wavering. Rumors abounded that Dee and Kelley were practicing necromancy, which was communication with the dead. Dee did not want to clarify to anyone that it was actually angels they spoke to. Not yet. So it was time to leave England. March 1587: Dee and Kelley, full of dread, were summoned to appear before the papal nuncio Germanico Malaspina, bishop of San Severo, in Prague, the cosmopolitan city of Bohemia. The last four years had been difficult ones. Laski ran out of money almost the instant they arrived in Poland, and the two men and their families wandered through Central Europe, conducting their “actions” with the angels as they sought aristocratic sponsors. They finally were given permission to present themselves in Prague, where Emperor Rudolf held court. Although Rudolf was intensely interested in magic, his court was dominated by papal and counter-Reformation forces. It was a treacherous climate. Dee had managed to obtain an audience with the reclusive Rudolf but that didn’t prevent him from falling under suspicion of necromancy again. It also didn’t help that Rudolf’s uncle, King Philip II, was planning to declare war on Elizabeth I and all English Protestants were anathema. Dee acquitted himself well under questioning by Bishop Malaspina, professing himself a pious man who would never cause religious discord in Prague or traffic in the black arts. Then it was Kelley’s turn to speak. What he chose to say was astounding: “It seems to me that, if one looks for counsel or remedy that might bring about a reformation in the whole church, the following will be good and obvious. While there are some shepards and ministers of the Christian flock who, in their faith and in their works, excel all others, there are also those who seem devoid of the true faith and idle in their good works. Their life is so odious to the people and sets so pernicious an example that by their own bad life they cause more destruction in the Church of God than they could ever repair by their most elaborate, most long and most frequent discourses. And for that reason their words do not carry the necessary conviction and are wanting in profitable authority.” The papal representative remained calm. But he said later, privately, that he had wanted to “throw Kelley from a window” — a common way to resolve conflict in Prague. For a time Kelley and Dee were able to evade arrest or formal censure. But eventually the emperor turned on them. The order came to leave Prague within six days. May 1587: Dee and Kelley found a new sponsor: the wealthy Bohemian noble Vilem Rozmberk. He had a passion for alchemy and had set up several laboratories for experiments — Dee and Kelley now had one of their own. Although Dee was less than enthusiastic, Kelley threw himself into this work. Alchemy was the quest to transform base metals into noble ones — silver and gold — through the Philosopher’s Stone, a legendary elixir. Kelley had brought with him from England a mysterious red powder he said he’d discovered buried in the ground. As a demonstration before dignitaries visiting the laboratory, Kelley dropped a speck of it into mercury held in a crucible. To all who witnessed it, shimmering gold appeared. Soon the news spread across Prague, Europe and even back to England: Kelley had discovered the Philosopher’s Stone and could produce gold. Now the balance of power between Dee and Kelley shifted. Dee wanted Kelley to communicate with the angels and obtain the wisdom of the universe. But his skryer wanted to focus on the alchemy experiments that were earning him fame. This was the time, when the angels communicated something new and shocking: Dee and Kelley must share wives. With great reluctance, Dee’s young wife slept with Kelley. Nine months later, Theodorus Dee was born. In 1589, the Dees returned to England. Kelley would never see them again. It was not long after Dee’s departure that Kelley reached his height of riches and renown. The Emperor’s interest in alchemy went deeper than filling the imperial treasury. Rudolf was as unusual a ruler as Elizabeth I. He never married, recoiled from religious mania, and maintained a cautious stance among war-crazed relatives. “Wise hesitation” is what his supporters called it. His enemies found him inert and unfit to rule a Catholic empire. Modern-era historians speculate that Rudolf was clinically depressed. One aspect of Rudolf’s personality that comes through in the letters and papers of the late 16th century was fear of death. Alchemy’s ultimate promise was immortality. He threw money, property and titles at Kelley, but there was a catch. The Englishman must deliver. He must turn base metal into gold. Despite his tantalizing experiments, Kelley could not prove his abilities to the emperor’s satisfaction. And so Kelley was imprisoned in Hrad Krivoklat. After his release, he was again given a chance to perform successful alchemic experiments. He failed. Kelley tried to flee Prague, but was captured and jailed in another imperial castle. It is said that Edward Kelley died after he crawled out of a Bohemian prison window and fell to the ground. Other reports say he survived to see 1600, but maintained a low profile. As for Emperor Rudolf, the mercurial ruler was perceived as mentally unstable by those in the imperial court by 1598. He died at the age of 59 in 1612, nine months after he had been stripped of all effective power by his younger brother. Kelley is considered a charlatan today, someone who was able to convince wise and astute people of mystical abilities … until his tricks ran out. But that is incorrect. Edward Kelley did perform an act of alchemy. It was on himself."
Medium.com,Society,Untitled story,World,https://medium.com/@ecklewchuk/we-must-stand-shoulder-to-shoulder-to-protect-the-good-friday-agreement-14ea8c0072a?source=topic_page---------525------------------1," Identity in Northern Ireland is a complex matter, it was at the center of decades of violence and conflict, the center of community divides and segregation but it was also at the center of the peace agreement that ended this violence. The Belfast Good Friday Agreement was the culmination of years of hard fought negotiations, compromise and an indomitable desire for peace. It was backed by the vast majority of political parties and secured an overwhelming majority both North and South. A testament to the work of all those involved and the determination of the people on this island to live in a shared society based on the principles of equality and mutual respect. A key objective of the peace talks was to establish equality between the two main communities. This objective is evidenced in a number of provisions throughout the Good Friday Agreement but one in particular resonates. That both Governments will recognise and accept the right of the people of Northern Ireland to identify themselves and be accepted as Irish or British or both. Ireland understood the importance and significance of this provision, amending article 2 of the constitution and transforming it’s nationality laws so that Irish citizenship would be an entitlement versus automatically conferred. Then Minister of Justice John O’Donoghue stated that the legislation would, “ensure respect for the position of those who do not wish to exercise that entitlement. At the same time, those who wish to assert their Irish citizenship are free to do so.” The UK, by contrast, resisted a number of GFA rights based provisions. It has not only failed to implement the ‘birthright’ provisions but is today contesting the very purpose and intent of the provision through the courts. Instead of implementing this provision the Government is attempting to rewrite it by creating a distinction between identity and citizenship. The Government is arguing that the birthright protection amount to no more than a right to identity and that legally, the people of Northern Ireland are British citizens. An interesting interpretation of a text that clearly provides a right for the people of Northern Ireland to be accepted as Irish or British or both. Nowhere in the agreement does it state that the people are to be considered British. Questions over the UKs implementation of this provision stem from a somewhat recent Home Office policy change that restricts the EU rights of Irish citizens who were born British. Pre-2012 NI born Irish citizens encountered few obstacles to their rights and entitlements as an Irish and therefore EU citizen but after this change they lost one of those rights, the right to family reunification under EU law. This change revealed the Government’s failure to implement the birthright provisions of the Good Friday Agreement and alerted NI citizens to the fact that legally they were and are considered British citizens. Many Irish citizens faced confusion when denied this right on the basis of being a British citizen, I am one of them. The Home Office offers Irish citizens a workaround in these refusal letters - renounce British citizenship. Many avail of this option, after all it’s being suggested by a Government department who state that until you go through the process of renunciation you cannot access your rights as an Irish and EU citizen. The purpose and intent of this provision is clear, one need only look at any number of Government reviews or policies that predate the Government’s current hard-line approach to see that. In 2008 former UK Attorney General Lord Goldsmith QC conducted a ‘Citizenship review’. The review contained the interpretation that, ‘the Good Friday Agreement confirms the right of the people of Northern Ireland to take either British or Irish citizenship or both.’ There was the identity cards debacle – that were scrapped as being non-GFA compliant and the Bill of rights recommendations on the same point. Taoiseach Leo Varadkar has repeatedly stated that the “Good Friday Agreement is explicit on this matter” and a host of rights groups and political representatives have voiced the same in response to the British Government’s new direction of travel. I’ve witnessed first-hand the negative impact and emotional trauma caused by expecting Irish citizens to declare themselves as British in order to access their rights both under the Good Friday Agreement and as an Irish citizen. The process of renunciation involves an individual first proving they are British, then declaring themselves as British in order to renounce being British and to do so for a hefty fee. I ask those calling on Irish citizens in Northern Ireland to do so to consider those tables turned, because that is what you are arguing for. There is no domestic UK legislation protecting the birthright provisions of the Good Friday Agreement, if the Government is successful in our case, successful in creating a distinction between identity and citizenship what will that mean for Unionists in a United Ireland? Brexit has been a catalyst for conversations around the reunification of Ireland and any historian will point to the creation of the border as a temporary construct. The constitutional future of Northern Ireland was never set in stone. The Good Friday Agreement, as an international agreement lodged with the UN, will continue in the event of reunification. However, if the British Government is successful in voiding the birthright provisions Unionists will be vulnerable. Ireland does not nor will not have the power to grant British citizenship, this lies entirely within the remit of British Government. If the birthright provisions are to be reconstructed as no more than a right to identity we all lose. Irish citizens in the here and now and British citizens in the event of reunification of this island. It is greatly disappointing that a minority of Unionists are now actively supporting the British Government’s interpretation. A move that is both blind to the dangers of creating a distinction between identity and citizenship and is tone deaf to the history of Northern Ireland. It is even more disappointing that this minority are attempting to create a false narrative around those seeking to have this right upheld. A narrative that only serves to stoke tensions with a ‘themuns’ argument that has no place in this campaign, no place in the Good Friday Agreement and no place in our society. Defining the people of Northern Ireland into two categories, Unionists and Nationalists, does not reflect the shared society we live in but rather reveals a minority that wants to keep us trapped in the past, trapped in that conflict. In 1998 Bill Clinton gave a speech celebrating the Agreement and stated, “There will be those who seek to undermine this great achievement. All the parties and all of us must stand shoulder to shoulder to defy any such appeal.” There are those who today seek to undermine the Good Friday Agreement and are trying to do so under the cover of protecting it. Those who are on record as standing against the agreement, who have spent decades trying to weaken both it’s impact and it’s purpose. As Bill Clinton said, we must stand shoulder to shoulder to defy these appeals. We must reassure those concerned that there is nothing to fear from full implementation of the Good Friday Agreement but rather an opportunity to realise the rights based society envisaged in 1998, an opportunity for all of us, one that we’d be foolish to miss."

Jeremy Corbyn has promised to deliver Brexit on the basis of a second referendum to go back to the people, with a soft Labour Brexit compromise and remain being the options on the ballot. Whatever the nation decides — Brexit or not — will be the conclusion to a debacle that has wreaked havoc across Britain. Corbyn has not only promised to respect the result of 2016 by negotiating with EU leaders for a soft Brexit, but he also asks for confirmation from the electorate after three years of grave failures from Westminster. During the pending second referendum, Corbyn has vowed to stay neutral to avoid haemorrhaging votes from anguished Leavers or Remainers. With the Tories in utter turmoil, the only credible appeal to placate disillusioned voters is for a Labour-led government to take over. Since the Leave campaign won the referendum in 2016, Labour’s forever-changing Brexit stance and Corbyn’s ambiguity has faced ridicule from their critics in the media and the public sphere. Now that Corbyn has fully pledged a viable alternative to a Conservative-fronted saga, there is still a sense of disbelief amongst the pundit class on what the party’s Brexit status actually means. To many Corbynistas, this is just using another accessible excuse to undermine and devalue a future Corbyn premiership wherever possible. Corbyn’s chant for neutrality whilst his Party colleagues and members battle it out on both sides of the aisle has been rebuked by his most prominent critics. What Corbyn is attempting is the same as his predecessor as Labour leader, Harold Wilson, who stood neutral as PM whilst his MPs favoured and opposed the commons market referendum of 1975. Furthermore, the Conservative Party from its headquarters set a neutral tone whilst influential figures in Westminster fought for both Leave and Remain three years ago. But, of course, commentators deem it absolutely unacceptable for Corbyn to do the same. What can we expect from a leader who holds diehard remain seats in London’s metropolitan area alongside hardcore leave constituencies of northern England? The likes of Newcastle, Yorkshire and the northern Welsh heartlands have traditionally voted Labour for decades. Corbyn cannot afford to lose Labour seats that have counted on left-wing activism to help fight the corners of their working-class communities. It has been estimated that, out of the 12 million voters who turned to Labour in the last snap election, 8 million were remain voters in contrast to the 4 million who voted leave. Although Remainers double that of their Leave counterparts who support Labour, Corbyn must search for defectors within both the Conservative and Brexit parties with his soft Brexit proposal. Jeremy Corbyn, if soon to be elected prime minister, has promised to deliver an EU exit in respect of the initial referendum result. A lifelong Eurosceptic, it should be no surprise that Corbyn may discreetly wish to withdraw from the ardent capitalist make-up of the European bloc. To hold on to his support from the Remain activists in his camp, he outlines a second referendum plan so voters across the nation can make a wholehearted final decision after gross incompetency from consecutive Tory governments. The only way to break the deadlock is for the current Party in government to step aside, and give the British people a fresh outlook on Brexit. Recently, EU chiefs dealing with the Brexit negotiations have outlined their preference for a Labour Brexit compared to the toxicity that surrounds a Tory one. Excuses and sheer ignorance in understanding Corbyn’s Brexit position must end. To move forward on a transformative domestic agenda, Brexit must be finalised so the media and the politicians can focus on domestic issues. The only way to end the Brexit impasse is for Corbyn take hold of power and run a people-powered Downing Street for the many and not the few. First published for Backbench U.K."

Medium.com,Society,India/Pakistan UN Summit Fails on Kashmir,World,https://medium.com/discourse/india-pakistan-un-summit-fails-on-kashmir-1b018717566c?source=topic_page---------528------------------1," I
ndian Prime Minister Narendra Modi denounced terrorism at the United Nations this week but did not mention the seemingly endless low-grade war between his country and neighboring Pakistan over the disputed territory of Kashmir. Both countries exercise nominal control over respective parts of Kashmir. However, Modi has recently imposed a wide-ranging curfew over the Muslim-dominant area under his aegis. For its part, Pakistan has issued a warning that India’s crackdown in Kashmir ups the ante for a wider — and hotter — war between the two nuclear powers. Modi told the gathered world leaders at the General Assembly that India’s “voice against terrorism … rings with seriousness and outrage.” But again, Modi simply ignored the current Kashmir dynamics. Still, Modi’s remarks appeared to be, at least in part, a response to Pakistani Prime Minister Imran Khan’s earlier warning of a likely “bloodbath” in Kashmir once the curfew is lifted. As things stand right now, that curfew has essentially cut off all communications of the eight million residents in the region. Since partition of India in 1947, and the resultant creation of Pakistan, the two nation-states have fought two of their three wars over the ill-fated Himalayan region known as Kashmir. This latest imbroglio arises from an August 5 edict issued by Modi which stripped all autonomy from that portion of Muslin-majority Kashmir which it had enjoyed until Modi’s announcement. As stated, Modi pointedly did not mention Kashmir during his UN speech, and spoke only in general terms of terrorism: We belong to a country that has given the world, not war, but Buddha’s message of peace. And that is the reason why, our voice against terrorism, to alert the world about this evil, rings with seriousness and the outrage. Even as these leaders spoke, residents of India-controlled Kashmir held out hope that the meetings and speeches in New York would at least focus the world’s attention on what is essentially a country-wide lock-down and full-blown , never-ending humanitarian crisis in the region. We really hope these leaders will do something to rid us of conflict and suppression,” said Nazir Ahmed, a schoolteacher on the outskirts of Srinagar, the largest city in Indian-held Kashmir. Conflict is like a cancer hitting every aspect of life. And Kashmiris have been living inside this cancer for decades now. In New York, during the General Assembly’s session, dueling protests in support of and in opposition to India’s action in Kashmir were held just across the street from UN headquarters. Trump was also present and urged both India and Pakistan to resolve their differences. (This time he did not pretend that they had begged him to arbitrate or lead peace negotiations between them). As stated, the India-Pakistan conflict over Kashmir dates to the late 1940s, when they won independence from Britain. Since then, the region has remained one of the most militarized in the world, with soldiers and paramilitary police everywhere. Most Kashmiris, however, deeply object to and resent the Indian troop presence. Modi, nevertheless, defends and justifies the Kashmir crackdown, calling it an effort to free the territory from separatism. His supporters have welcomed the move. Modi is a pro-business Hindu nationalist. His party won re-election in India by a landslide last May, and that victory has emboldened him. And even though his economic policies have had mixed results, he remains popular because of his former social underdog status in India’s deeply class-riven society. His Hindu-first platform and programs have alienated many and risks deepening social tensions and conflicts in the earth’s second largest country, clocking in at 1.3 billion people. As might be expected, Pakistan’s Khan is adamantly opposed to Modi’s actions in Kashmir. But, putting aside for a moment all of the other deep and intractable issues involved in this seven-decades-long conflict, Khan’s greatest fear is the potential for even a “limited” nuclear exchange between the two countries — which could very easily escalate, spill over and ignite the Middle East generally, and trigger the end of life on this planet as we know it: Eight million people in an open jail is unprecedented in this day and age. … The biggest worry is what happens once the curfew is lifted? We fear with 900,000 soldiers there, there will be a massacre,” Khan said. There’s a potential that two nuclear-armed countries will come face to face at some stage."
Medium.com,Society,Forbidden even before it even exists,World,https://medium.com/swlh/forbidden-even-before-it-even-exists-28770a60ce0d?source=topic_page---------529------------------1," Both France and Germany want to prevent Facebook from seizing the payment system with Libra. Suddenly the governments are very determined. But why? First France, then Germany: On 13 September, French Finance Minister Bruno Le Maire reiterated his opposition to Facebook’s planned cryptocurrency Libra. He even went so far as to fear that “our monetary sovereignty was in danger”. Le Maire was skeptical about the project from the outset but is now openly hostile. In addition to the loss of monetary sovereignty, he fears “dangers for consumers” and “systemic risks”. If you look at the resistance of governments against crypto currencies, you wonder if the investment in Bitcoin, Ethereum or other coins is still worth it. I have tried to answer this question in this article: The Grand Coalition in the German Bundestag agrees with Le Maire on this issue. CDU parliamentarian Thomas Heilmann told “Der Spiegel” that they were not willing to allow “market-relevant private Stablecoins”. Here, too, the danger of a loss of monetary sovereignty is in the background: “So far, it has been very good for the economy that we have countered crises and inflation through measures taken by the central banks,” said Heilmann. Facebook’s Libra is therefore as good as forbidden in Europe even before it has even begun. The planned digital currency will shock politicians in all countries more than Bitcoin has ever been able to do. The whole thing is somewhat strange, you could compare it to someone who already has rats in the house, but is frightened to death and calls the exterminator when he hears a message on the radio about a field mouse train next year. Bitcoin challenges the established monetary system much more than a Facebook coin could ever do. So the big question is: Why is politics reacting so decisively to Libra — and why so hesitantly to Bitcoin? Some keywords might lie in the quote from CDU man Heilmann: “market-relevant private Stablecoins”. The basic assumption of politicians around the world seems to be that Bitcoin is not “market-relevant”. The cryptocurrency is still in a niche, and politicians are probably assuming that a Facebook coin will not be in the niche for long, but will assert itself everywhere in no time at all. In my opinion, the trust of users in Facebook will be overestimated. Many already go far enough — or too far — that the company already has far too much control over its own life with Facebook itself and Whatsapp. Trusting her with the money could go too far. But let’s note that an already globally accepted currency with a market capitalization of almost 200 billion dollars is obviously less market relevant for governments than a future and potential coin of a corporation whose shares raise a market capitalization of almost 500 billion euros. Secondly, politicians seem to find a stable coin much more threatening than a volatile currency like Bitcoin. I find that quite astonishing. After all, Facebook’s Libra is only supposed to represent the value of a shopping basket of established currencies, which still allows the big central banks to influence the price of Libra itself. Bitcoin, on the other hand, is completely independent of central banks, the value is created solely on the market, and the scarcity of Bitcoin is likely to be much fiercer competition to the euro, the dollar and the like than a kind of “fiat money ETF”. The open question at this point is how governments will deal with existing Stablecoins such as Tether, USDC or DAI dollars. Thirdly, we have the word “private”: Libra could be seen as the private currency of Facebook or a group of companies associated with Facebook. The fact that Internet companies are launching their own currency and thus competing with state currencies is, of course, frightening for governments. The prospect that a company — or a cartel — will have such a big influence on the currency seems unacceptable to many politicians. Bitcoin is now also “private” in the sense that it is not state-owned, but there is no owner. Bitcoin is more of a public good, and there is no corporation that has a central bank-like power here. It seems easier for governments to digest when there is no central bank at all than when a company becomes a central bank. Finally, we have another reason why Germany and France react so sharply to Libra. Because both countries are currently warming up for a state stable coin. Le Maire explained in an interview that a digital currency that is likely to be issued by the central bank can “make transactions faster and cheaper” and integrate the “unbanked” into the banking system. German Finance Minister Olaf Scholz agrees. Both want the European Central Bank to think more offensively about a blockchain-based state digital currency. The idea has been under discussion for years but had no priority. The German government is even planning to create a state blockchain (“federal chain”), which would then facilitate the establishment and financing of companies through tokens, for example. Facebook’s Libra is now coming at exactly the wrong time. One company demonstrates that it can do what states plan for years without becoming concrete much faster and more efficiently. Facebook not only competes with these government projects but also shows governments how inefficient they are in such technical projects. If they don’t use their very own advantage — to ban things in their jurisdiction — governments will be hopelessly inferior to Facebook in building a blockchain. This is somewhat ironic because Facebook itself is miles behind the creative energy of the open-source scene behind Bitcoin and many other cryptocurrencies. Finally, one could speculate about another reason. Governments have known for some years that they cannot actually ban Bitcoin. Bitcoin is decentralized, there is not one head that can be knocked off. Of course, access can be made more difficult by bans, but a complete ban should never be fully effective. On Facebook, on the other hand, governments have one contact — the one, central head that can be cut off. It could be that the sharp pace towards Libra is a kind of compensation — precisely because states have no power over Bitcoin, they have to demonstrate their power towards Facebook’s Libra all the more clearly. Whether one of the reasons is true or several: The governments’ approach is good for Bitcoin. They seem to want to prevent the new technology from being used for money to turn a company into a new central bank — while they are relatively open to the fact that there is new money that no central bank knows at all. And that is the point, isn’t it?"

Medium.com,Society,Is Revoking the UK’s Withdrawal Popular?,World,https://medium.com/swlh/is-revoking-the-uks-withdrawal-popular-ae693bb91b70?source=topic_page---------531------------------1," During their party conference, the Liberal Democrats supported revoking the UK’s Article 50 notification. If the Liberal Democrats formed a majority government, the intended exit from the European Union would be cancelled and the country remain part of the EU. This article considers the popularity of this policy. There are three possible outcomes to the UK-EU relationship. Either: the UK remains part of the EU, or the UK leaves — with or without a withdrawal agreement. As a citizen’s preferred outcome, what support exists for remaining in the EU? There are many ways to ask this question. YouGov asked people via their internet to choose one outcome from four options (plus being unsure). In this question, an alternative deal that involved “remaining in the single market and customs union” may be chosen, and the Remain option contingent on having a new referendum. In the latest reading, conducted on 2–3rd September, 33% were estimated to support remaining in the EU — the most popular option. Higher estimates for remaining in the EU are found if the options were ranked, with YouGov estimating 46% ranked ‘remaining in the EU’ first “in order of what you want to happen” in March and May 2019. Opinium have asked a similar question about people’s “stance” on exiting the EU. In the latest reading, conducted on 10–13th September, 37% were supportive of “remaining in the EU” and 34% were supportive of “a Brexit where the UK has a clear break from the EU”. We can also ask people how they would vote in a hypothetical referendum on EU membership. Recent surveys which have repeated the 2016 EU referendum question — on the principle of the UK’s membership — have averaged Remain at 53% (once people saying they don’t know are excluded). What support exists for revocation — without a further referendum? Few direct questions have been asked about support for this policy, and those usually ask about a future scenario. ComRes conducted an internet panel poll on 11–12th September, finding marginal net support (42% to 39% opposition) for the statement: Do you support or oppose the following statement: ‘If a deal cannot be done with the EU, then the Government should revoke Article 50 and remain in the EU’? We should be cautious here, given a forced-choice question may not give such a high estimate of support. Alternately, Opinium asked their internet panel: If Boris Johnson is unable to make changes to the Withdrawal Agreement that enables it to pass the House of Commons before October 31, what should he do? The ‘cancel Brexit’ option has received around 28% in the five polls, whilst leaving on 31st October — even if it means leaving with ‘No Deal’ — is generally estimated to be backed by around 40% of adults. This is to be contrasted with Opinium’s ‘stance’ question. Outright revocation is a major step, and is not backed by all of those whose preferred stance is to remain in the EU. In the minds of some voters, a new referendum may be needed to negate the 2016 result. It appears there is some support for straight revocation of the Article 50 notification. This is reflective of polarisation: as Leave voters have marshalled behind leaving the EU without a withdrawal agreement, a new referendum and revocation have garnered greater support among Remain voters. In a fractured political system, even 30% of the total vote may be enough to make serious advances."
Medium.com,Society,A look at child labor in Iran,World,https://medium.com/swlh/a-look-at-child-labor-in-iran-c0d15bc95edc?source=topic_page---------532------------------1," Iran, September 26, 2019 — The new school year in Iran began on September 23. At this time of the year across the globe, scenes of children rushing to schools, smiling and laughing, bring joy not only to their parents, but also to those wishing to provide the very best for their country’s future generation. In Iran under the mullahs’ regime, however, the right to education, considered one of the main fundamental rights of children throughout the world by UNICEF, is becoming an unattainable dream. Based on numbers published by state-run media in Iran, the number of children involved child labor is increasing and those actually in schools are unfortunately decreasing with each passing year. More children are joining the “army” of child labor, selling goods and roaming the streets of large cities checkered across Iran. Despite the fact that regime officials go the distance in publishing doctored reports to place the blame of this social catastrophe on any source but the regime, the footprints of this phenomenon can be traced back to its actual cause through remarks made by authorities. The main reason lies in the unprecedented and ever-increasing poverty that is spreading across Iran like a plague resulting from the regime’s unpopular policies that are plundering the Iranian people. Millions of families are in such dire conditions that they literally cannot even adequately feed their children, let alone provide for the fees of sending their children to school. As a result, Iran’s younger generation, the future of this country, have no choice but to roam the streets and work in dangerous workshops in a desperate attempt to help their families make ends meet. “Currently, there are 3.5 million children out of school across the country,” said Hafizollah Fazeli, a regime insider, to the Tasnim news agency, affiliated to the regime’s Revolutionary Guards (IRGC) Quds Force. The state-run Hamdeli newspaper acknowledged the fact that economic poverty is one of the main reasons of families not being able to send their children to school. “The economic poverty engulfing families is creating a major obstacle in advancing education. One of the most important results is children forced into labor outside of their houses, preventing them from going to school,” the September 22 piece reads in part. While carefully avoiding any mention of the role of regime officials on this matter, the Hamdeli article sheds light on the fact that the cost of public education is becoming a heavy burden for Iranian families. “Education is becoming more of a purchased good these days than a service and this is the most important reason why children drop out of schools and enter the labor force… Education is now considered a purchased good and is provided only if a family has the ability to purchase it… As a result, only those affording the costs will be able to have access to education,” the read adds. All the while, the main concern of this and other state-run outlets lies not in the fact that Iran’s children are deprived of education. In fact, they consider this phenomenon a “time bomb” threatening the regime’s security. Regime officials are concerned about poverty evolving into a source of dissent and social unrest. “The truth is that children who drop out of schools have the potential of acting as a time bomb that can explode any day and any moment. Such an explosion that can not only destroy themselves, but also inflict damage to others and the society,” the Hamdeli piece concludes, reflecting the dire concerns of the ruling regime in Iran. Furthermore, incompetent officials in the regime’s Education Ministry and associated department in provinces and cities across the country on one hand, and allocating a very dismal budget for one of the most important ministries on the other are adding to this crisis and resulting in more children dropping out of schools. When the Education Ministry refuses to provide paychecks to hardworking Iranian teachers and has neglected the issue of a shortage in classrooms for 40 years now, it is quite obvious that the mullahs’ regime is neither able nor willing to prevent the catastrophe of young children dropping out of schools. All the while, daily reports are published in Iranian media of regime officials running off stealing millions, and at times billions of dollars, while tens of millions of people are barely providing a single meal for their families. There is no doubt that with each passing day public hatred of the mullahs’ regime is escalating as we speak. All dilemmas in Iran under the mullahs’ regime can only be resolved by targeting the root of these crises, being the very regime ruling this country for over four decades now. Daily protests and demonstrations, and repeating anti-regime protests, are a signal of how the Iranian people have realized this undeniable reality and are joining the organized resistance bent on bringing an end to the mullahs’ corrupt rule."
Medium.com,Society,Venezuela Central Bank Testing Shift to Cryptocurrencies to Pay State Oil Company Bills,World,https://medium.com/@expathos/venezuela-central-bank-testing-shift-to-cryptocurrencies-to-pay-state-oil-company-bills-4a371f684926?source=topic_page---------533------------------1," Venezuela’s central bank is allegedly running tests to determine whether it can add bitcoin and ether to its international reserves at the request of state-run Petroleos de Venezuela SA (PDVSA). According to a recent report in Bloomberg, the PDVSA is seeking to send Bitcoin and Ethereum to the central bank and have the monetary authority pay the oil company’s bills with cryptocurrency rather than continue to drain the countries fiat holdings which is coming to a three-decade low at $7.9 billion. In 2018 Venezuela launched its own cryptocurrency, the Petro backed by the country’s oil (the Orinoco in Venezuela contains the world’s largest — an estimated 1.2 trillion barrels of oil resources) and gold reserves (Venezuela has the world’s second-largest exploitable gold reserves total an estimated 10,000 tons). The Petro’s pre-sale started on 20 February 2018 and ended on 19 March 2018 and the Venezuelan government claimed the pre-sale raised US$3.3 billion. Reuters investigated the Petro six months after its ICO and reported it was an utter failure and there was no indication that the Petro raised the funds claimed nor were Petros being used in any way. However, there have been other reports that it’s working. Dash News reported earlier this year that the PetroApp, enables the purchase of the Petro with Dash, Bitcoin, and Litecoin. “However, there are still many uncertainties about what the Petro is actually worth. The Venezuelan government has supposedly pegged their sovereign bolivar so that “as a ‘unit of account’ the Petro’s value is to be of 9,000 sovereign bolivars”, according to their central bank’s announcement.” The Petro cryptocurrency does have a Telegram group and a Twitter account if readers want to keep up. The APK for the app can be downloaded on the website. The whitepaper is here."

Last Friday, September 21st, more than 4 Million people in 163 countries on all 7 continents left their schools and workplaces to strike for the minor cause of, you know, saving the planet. It was the largest climate protest in history. But it started with 1. 1 continent. 1 country. 1 young girl. More on that in a bit. My question is, what took so long? It’s not like climate change is a secret. Despite major corporations and one president’s wishes, we have known since the 70’s the dire circumstances that we face if we don’t get our collective shit together when it comes to CO2 emissions. Shell Corporation even released a documentary in 1991 with information about earth’s rising temperature and sea levels due to the production of fossil fuel. So why haven’t we been able to gather the necessary amount of energy to spark a global movement toward sustainability when our entire existence is at stake? It’s simple in my opinion: It’s just not a good story. Where is the anecdote we can point to clearly showing the unlikely hero? Where is the clear and immediate danger that we can feel in our bones? It’s almost… too big. According to the revolutionary Green & Brock’s theory of Transportation psychology, when people lose themselves in a story, their attitudes and intentions change to reflect that story. The mental state of narrative transportation can explain the persuasive effect of stories on people. Humans change their behavior because of a strong feeling, not thought. We generally follow our hearts over our heads. Climate change has no one central cause. It has victims, but the catastrophic events and extinctions occurring do not have one big climate change monster to point the finger at. The causes are many, nuanced and often formless. In some ways, invisible. So we generally tell the story in terms of numbers. Statistics. And tell me a more boring story than one starring numbers and statistics. The closest thing we had to a climate movement was when Al Gore produced the documentary “An Inconvenient Truth” in 2006. The documentary showed some astounding graphs and numbers illustrating what was ahead for the earth if we didn’t make major changes toward sustainable development. The documentary received an Oscar, Al Gore won the Nobel Prize and was certainly successful in increasing awareness, alarming many to the huge challenge we face as a species. But Al Gore is not Greta Thunberg. At the time of release, Al Gore was a middle aged politician famous for being a Vice President to Bill Clinton and losing the Florida recount and thus, the presidency, to George W. Bush in 2000. In many ways, just or not, Gore has the face of the oppressor — older, straight-laced, wealthy capitalist — rather than the oppressed. And more importantly, “An inconvenient truth” lacked a compelling story. It was Al Gore literally standing in front of graphs with numbers and statistics. Even though the numbers that those graphs showed were indeed existentially ominous, they were still just, well, numbers. And our minds need stories. Powerfully human, emotional, invigorating stories. It’s the reason we’ll closely follow the murder case in which a celebrity like OJ Simpson is accused and feel terrible for the victims. Meanwhile, around 5 Americans are murdered daily, mostly without notice outside of their community. Or why a natural disaster like the recent hurricane in the Bahamas will garner millions of dollars in donations while countries like Yemen and Libya live each day in dire need of clean water receiving a fraction of the support. The story is just more captivating. And thus we feel it more. Enter Greta. Greta’s journey began with a strike on August 20th, 2018. Part of her legend is that, despite her efforts to recruit her classmates, she was alone. She sat outside Swedish parliament with a sign containing the now famous words “SKOLSTREJK FOR KLIMATET” (School Strike for Climate). A 15 year-old Swedish girl skipping school for 21 straight days to protest the need for policy directed at the climate crisis. This was especially impressive because Greta generally isn’t the most expressive person. She has been diagnosed with Asperger syndrome and selective mutism, mental illnesses that cause anxiety and depression especially in youth. And Greta was no exception to these symptoms, at one point not attending school for a period when she was 11 due to depression. And the climate crisis played a big role in her feelings. In August of 2019, a year after that first strike gathered momentum and grew at a rapid pace, Greta was invited to speak to Congress and UN representatives in the US during what has been dubbed “Climate Week” Adding to her already growing legend, she decided to make the transatlantic trip aboard a 60 ft, emission-free sailboat to avoid the Carbon emissions that come with flying. Sailing along with her was her father. Her Mother, a successful opera singer in Sweden, has given up touring to reduce her carbon footprint and work with the climate movement at home. Greta has substantially changed the lives of those around her. A week after arriving came the most important day in the history of the climate movement, September 20th, 2019. When the Fridays for Future movement expanded from that first lonely strike to a casual 4,000,000(!) protestors of all shapes and sizes world wide. Thanks to her resolve and the rapid spread of her message via social media, the story of the great Greta Thunberg hit a tipping point and spread like wildfire. Why? In my opinion, because Greta’s face alone tells an important story: There is an entire generation facing an existential crisis caused by the inaction of the generations that preceded them. And they are pissed off. I caught on 3 or 4 months ago. I’m not even sure how. I think someone brought her up in conversation and I followed her on instagram. Over time, seeing her posts, and the spread of the Fridays for Future Movement, I began to feel inspired myself. I had been interested in sustainability but like most, only in convenient ways: avoiding single use plastic, bringing my own mug to the cafe, even switching to a vegetarian diet. Enough to believe I was doing my part but I didn’t truly feel the urgency of the movement until Greta entered my life. She is the perfect symbol for this movement. What you would think is a shy and unassuming teenage girl getting up in front of the world leaders and publicly shaming them: “Adults keep saying we owe it to the young people, to give them hope,” Thunberg said at the Economic World Forum, “But I don’t want your hope. I don’t want you to be hopeful. I want you to panic. I want you to feel the fear I feel every day. I want you to act. I want you to act as you would in a crisis. I want you to act as if the house is on fire, because it is.” Wow. Just that quote alone affects me more than any of the 20 ft high graphs in “An Inconvenient Truth”. And I think many people, young and old had the same moment of “Oh shit” that I had. We can no longer just bring our own bags to the super market. 71% of the world’s greenhouse gas emissions come from not only corporations, but just the top 100 Fossil Fuel Corporations. I believe personal lifestyle changes are vital in order to shift your mindset and make sure you become the change that you want to see, but the next step is major policy change. That will not come without a loud and powerful movement. The movement now has a story, a face, a hero and her name is Greta Tintin Eleonora Ernman Thunberg. I mentioned that the numbers aren’t as important as the story when it comes to persuasion, but they are still important and helpful to understand what’s happening. So, here are the most important ones: 2.7 — Degrees in Fahrenheit (1.5 degrees Celsius). This is the maximum increase in global temperature above preindustrial levels before we hit an irreversible tipping point at which many severe effects of climate change will take place according to United Nations’ Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change in 2018. We are currently at a 1.4 degrees Fahrenheit increase since 1880. 45% — How much we must reduce our carbon emissions by 2030 in order to have a chance. And carbon emissions must reach net zero by 2050. 85% — How much of our energy production must be renewable by 2050 and we need to completely eliminate the use of coal now. 3,000,000 — The amount of square miles, or roughly the size of Canada, in which new forests must be planted. There are so many actions you can take that any Google search will present. I think the most important thing is to shift your mindset. Start experimenting very small, what can you change in your daily life to move toward a more sustainable way? How can you incorporate climate action into your news stream or social media timeline? This will plant the seeds in your mind to help you start thinking bigger: How can your home be more sustainable? your workplace? your city? and on and on. The important thing is that you start with one. Like Greta."

The answer can often seem quite ambiguous, as it is often said the games value encompasses more than simply money. While this is certainly true, with Japan knowing more than others the positives of hosting an Olympics, the financial situations of the games cant be merely overlooked. Recent games such as the 2016 Rio Summer Games and the 2004 Athens Summer Games are proof this. If things are mismanaged and everything isn’t accounted for, the economical effects of hosting large scale events such as the Olympics can be felt throughout a country. However, positivity remains strong throughout the general public that Tokyo 2020 can harbor much more economic gains than previous games. Lets take a look at just some of the factors that can help these games be more financially successful than games of the past."

As we approach the end of the first quarter of the 21st century, it is becoming clear that humanity needs to urgently address enormous challenges that arise from an unprecedented confluence of critical conditions on a global scale. Climate change has created an ecological crisis, which threatens living conditions, food production and water availability, undermines the stability of vulnerable societies, instigates armed conflict, and pushes millions of people to seek refuge in more affluent and stable countries. These consequences are more severe in poor and overpopulated regions where a demographic explosion is fostered by gradually improving basic healthcare without however concomitant improvements in institutions, access to education and jobs, namely the key factors that are needed to improve living conditions and economic prospects. Consequences of climate change are further exacerbated by the rapid depletion of the earth’s natural resources, which pushes advanced economies to aggressively extract and exploit yet unexploited resources around the world, while pursuing the development of advanced technologies for sustainable energy production, efficient manufacturing and transportation of goods. Developed countries, which are receiving an increasing influx of refugees and migrants, also face their share of extraordinary challenges. Demographic change has inverted the population pyramid and led to ageing societies wherein the welfare state strives to keep serving adequately the needs of its own citizens, let aside those of refugees and migrants, and where the impetus for societal and economic change is undermined by the shrinking of the younger strata of society. Exponential advances in and convergence of information and communication technologies have brought the massive adoption of the Internet, the ongoing development of numerous applications and services, and the rapid digitalization of every aspect of human activity. This led to the emergence of digital titans — platforms embedded on the Internet that offer near-zero marginal cost of access, duplication and distribution of digital information, services and products. Digital platforms are a catalytic factor of 21st-century globalization, breaking geographic barriers and national borders, accelerating human communication and the spread of information, and contributing to an unprecedented speedup of technological and scientific discovery. In turn, rapid scientific progress and technological innovation in areas such as Information and Communication Technologies, Artificial Intelligence, Robotics and 3D Printing, Nanotechnology and Materials, Genomics and Biology, are creating tremendous opportunities for new products, processes, services, and business models that address human needs and societal problems, and lead to economies of scale and improved productivity in traditional and new economic sectors. However, scientific and technological advancements come with new threats and significant challenges. The pervasiveness of the Internet, combined with the ubiquity of smartphones and the emergence of networked digital sensors (leading to the “Internet-of-Things”), have transformed cyberspace into a “place” where we establish, conduct and communicate most of our professional, social, and cultural activities and interactions, and where we develop and express our personality and sense of self. All these activities are captured and stored in digital format and rendered amenable to computer processing by advanced algorithms that employ machine learning techniques and run on large-scale cloud computing platforms. Therefore, cyberspace has become the largest and most powerful apparatus for monitoring and shaping thought and behavior in human history. This particular capability is the core mechanism for monetizing Internet-mediated interactions through algorithmic advertising, and underlies the thriving Internet economy. Besides the advantages brought by digitalization and big-data processing, the Internet exposes human activity to new and previously unanticipated attack surfaces. When algorithms are programmed to feed humans with experiences through smartphone applications, like online social media services, they ultimately seek to maximize human engagement and feed an underlying “attention economy.” Therefore, these algorithms act essentially as machines designed to harvest, monopolize and monetize human attention. This kind of information overloading affects human cognition and our capacity for concentration, self-reflection and deep thinking. Moreover, and in order to maximize the time humans spent interacting with digital platforms, algorithms self-optimize to accentuate messages that carry sensationalized, offensive or polarized connotations, which are shown statistically to attract more easily the recipients’ attention. More frequently than not, such messages resonate upon latent or even explicitly expressed sexist, tribal, racist, or conspiratorial ideas, and facilitate the spread of misinformation and disinformation bringing upon the phenomena of “fake-news” and “hate-speech.” The proliferation of such phenomena online has been so pervasive, that it is undermining the shared interpretation of facts and events that shapes public opinion and the shared sense of identity, norms, and trust that functional societies need to maintain, bringing us into what is recently termed as the “post-truth” era. The massive spread of fake news and hateful messages, however, is only one of the security challenges that threaten cyberspace. With nearly all communication, control, production, and financial systems having become computerized and connected to the Internet, an alarming number of cybercrime and cyberterrorism attacks try to either disrupt their operation, with severe and possibly lethal consequences on a massive scale, or to usurp and expose valuable data. As humans increasingly develop and express their personality and social interactions through smartphone applications and associated Internet platforms, which monitor and capture these expressions in digital form and combine them with other data regarding the physical context of individuals, the resulting big-data sets enable the construction of a detailed and intimate picture of an individual’s psyche, her activities, interests, aspirations, behaviour and routines. The threat to personal data and to individual privacy is severe and unprecedented. Although many individuals take lightly the protection of their privacy online, social scientists, jurists, and technocrats increasingly recognize the importance of privacy as an essential part of what it means to be human. As Justice Louis Brandeis put it early on, in an 1890 article in the Harvard Law Review, “the principle which protects personal writings and all other personal productions […] against publication in any form, is in reality not the principle of private property but that of an inviolate personality.” Unfortunately, the usurpation of personal data and the attacks against cyberinfrastructures typically transcend national borders and sovereign jurisdictions, rendering protection, investigation and prosecution a nearly untenable exercise. Widespread digitalization and the resulting availability of big data, combined with accelerating advances in Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning, raise yet another challenge for developed and developing societies: automation brings significant productivity gains but will also lead to a massive replacement of humans by robots and intelligent software in many tasks, both physical and cognitive. Consequently, and in contrast to previous industrial revolutions where new technology was associated with long-term job creation and wage growth, several studies predict that the 4th Industrial Revolution will have a large negative effect on jobs, creating significant social problems and exacerbating economic inequality within and between countries. Estimates predict that by 2030, employers will need 20–25% fewer employees, with 30–50% of work activities becoming technically capable of being automated. Automation-induced unemployment is expected to hit both white- and blue-collar workers. At a domestic level, this will exert further pressure to workers who will see their bargaining power, labor rights, wages and job security diminish. At the international front, the capability to manufacture in almost workerless factories at countries with high labor costs could slash the competitive advantage of countries with lower labor costs to attract foreign investment, create jobs, and pursue an export-led path to economic growth. What role are universities expected to play, in view of the challenges described above? Traditionally, the role of the University has been both simple and profound, as articulated in the 19th century by von Humboldt and Newman: to create new knowledge through free thinking, scientific research and discovery, to pass knowledge to the next generation and to transform young students into moral personalities and responsible citizens, through education and mentorship. Furthermore, inspired by the successes of top American academic institutions in the post-WWII period, universities have assumed the role of supporting the translation of scientific results and inventions into tangible products or services, relevant to domestic or international markets, thus becoming a driving force behind innovation and economic development. One could argue that now, more than ever, this role remains relevant, important, and responds to pressing domestic and international needs. As Friedman and Mandelbaum pointed out, the “world increasingly will be divided between high imagination-enabling countries, which encourage and enable the imagination and extras of their people, and low imagination-enabling countries, which suppress or simply fail to develop their people’s creative capacities and abilities to spark new ideas, start up new industries and nurture their own ‘extra’.” The University’s mission seems to focus exactly on the key elements that need to be in place for a country to be “imagination-enabling.” Consequently, many nations around the world, are trying to adopt the model of the American research university, investing on universities as platforms for education, technology development, and innovation. However, several core aspects of university operation have not changed drastically in the last couple of centuries: the demographics of student population, selection of students, educational programs’ structure and delivery, organization of people and disciplines, etc. So, despite the relevance of their mission, in this era of rapid scientific progress, technological disruption, globalization and planetary-scale challenges, a key question that arises is: can universities adequately fulfil their mission, in ways that are relevant to the particular needs and capabilities of 21st century’s societies? This question is relevant both for universities established in advanced economies, as well as for those in developing countries or areas in crisis. If we look at universities as platforms for research and innovation, and catalysts for economic progress at a national and possibly international level, it is interesting to recall an insightful observation by Silicon Valley’s Y Combinator seed-capital-firm cofounder, Paul Graham. “If you think of technology as something that’s spreading like a sort of fractal stain, every moving point on the edge represents an interesting problem,” said Graham, adding that “one guaranteed way to turn your mind into the type to start up ideas […] is to get yourself to the leading edge of some technology. […] When you get there, ideas that seem uncannily prescient to other people will seem obvious to you.” Graham is right: providing students with educational experiences at the leading edge of technology is probably the best approach not only to prepare them for the future, but also to give them skills necessary for shaping that future. However, this requires significant and continuous investment in resources and know-how, which are not accessible readily outside established world-class centers of innovation. Moreover, with the onslaught of digitalization and the emergence of a handful of Internet behemoths, which collect, own and process big data from nearly every aspect of human activity, a large part of meaningful research and innovation increasingly depend on the continuous availability of such data and can only happen behind the closely guarded gateways of these behemoths. On the other hand, if we think of the effects of climate change, migration, ageing, inequality, etc. as a stack of fractal stains, which originate from the vulnerable areas of our world and the poorer strata of our societies, and permeate the lives of favored social groups and regions, every moving point on those fractals’ edges could represent an opportunity to experience global predicaments in their true dimension, outside the comfort of learning about problems from a distance or through the distorting view of social media. One could argue that this is necessary to truly understand the practical and moral dimensions of such problems, and, therefore, develop effective and ethical solutions through science and technology, and bring upon innovations that address pressing human needs. The benefits could be significant, both for those who will receive solutions to their problems in the long-term, but also for those who build valuable knowledge by gaining hands-on experiences on complex problems in the short-term. Nevertheless, implementing the necessary pre-conditions for these benefits to materialize requires creative design, bold experimentation and meticulous implementation. How can universities, with their current structure and resources, be transformed into platforms that provide solid educational experiences while seeking innovative solutions to global problems? In the following, I try to formulate a non-exhaustive list of pertinent questions. As discussed above, the design, implementation and adoption of new technologies increasingly comes with profound implications that often raise unintended but serious ethical concerns or harmful consequences. How can we educate a new generation of scientists and engineers to identify early on potential harmful implications of their work and come up with solutions to mitigate them? Also, how can we prepare students to recognize moral dilemmas and ethical concerns, and be able to address them with empathy based on humanistic principles and universal values, as eloquently summarized in late Toni Morrison’s advice to her students? “When you get these jobs that you have been so brilliantly trained for, just remember that your real job is that if you are free, you need to free somebody else. If you have some power, then your job is to empower somebody else.” Understanding and addressing the global crises at a global and local level requires the combination of different perspectives, scientific formulations, technologies and skills. However, the push towards increasing the “productivity” and immediate employability of young graduates is pushing higher education towards extreme specialization, and scientific fields towards over-fragmentation. On the other hand, the rapid pace of new knowledge production combined with the expected impact of automation on cognitive jobs, dictates that student training prioritizes foundational knowledge, critical thinking, creativity and global perspective, so that young graduates can work in multi-disciplinary and multicultural settings, critically absorb new knowledge, and adapt to the rapid change of scientific disciplines. Incorporating adequately these aspects in the training of university students is a challenge that needs to overcome a variety of cultural, methodological, practical, administrative and regulatory obstacles. How can we understand the true nature of these obstacles, identify ways to address them and develop meaningful multi-disciplinary experiences? Modern research universities often assemble formidable resources and operate as integrated platforms of knowledge creation (through research), knowledge dissemination (through education) and innovation (through technology transfer and startups). Their “services” are typically offered to audiences with specific demographic characteristics that comply to particular selection standards. However, the ageing of western societies means that the traditional target groups for university education are shrinking, while migration, displacement and the disruption of jobs creates a pressing need to expand education to more diverse groups of people. Integration of different groups under the same platform can bring significant benefits but also raises important challenges having to do with selection, preparation, misalignment of values, realignment of norms, etc. Equally challenging is the collaboration of “academic platforms” across nations and continents, which requires the establishment of sustainable networks of collaboration and trust between universities from different regions. There are notable efforts undergoing around the world in these directions, but there is also ample space for expanding and deepening these efforts so that they have a wider impact, and for further analysis and dissemination of best practices. How can we identify and adopt best practices of relevance in a timely manner, and put them at work to cater for demographically and socially diverse groups of people, including refugees and displaced persons? To pursue these questions in practice, institutions need to mobilize significant resources and undertake a bold experimentation that may go against deeply rooted administrative, regulatory and cultural routines. And, all that requires sustained funding which might not bring any tangible economic benefit or direct results in the short term. So, how can universities persuade policy makers and funders to provide the sustained funding necessary for them to address these problems through concrete actions?"

ver since childhood I have loved to pretend that I like to read. Some of my earliest memories include sitting cross-legged, flipping through pages of books I could not read, and looking at odd photos I didn't really understand. At that age of infinite curiosity and infant awareness, comic books were a godsend gift. They were colourful. They had plenty of pictures. They had lots of action. Plus, they made literal sense. My comic books providing gods vaguely resembled my older cousins. They were huge “Raj Comics” fans. Raj Comics is the company that introduced India’s first two superheroes. My brothers had a sizeable collection of both “Nagraj” and ‘Super Commando Dhruva”. Their loyalties however tilted more towards Dhruva. Being the most gullible member of the lot, I converted to the cult of “Dhruvism” without resistance. Clad in bright yellow and electric blue, Super Commando Dhruva has been a groundbreaking superhero in the Indian pantheon of comic book heroes. A superhero sans superpowers, Dhruva relies on his wits and impressive physical prowess to beat the evil. He started as a teenager, who guards the fictional city of “Rajnagar”. His only super skill is his ability to communicate with animals and birds. He has a fantastic array of gadgets that come in handy. He also has a knack to use his environment in any given situation to his advantage. He is supported by “Commando Force”: a bunch of three friends he has trained. Rarely intimidating, unerringly effective and ever so peppy Dhruva charmed my childhood in a big way. In fact, I learned to read through comic books. My fandom grew with age, and arduous realities of India in the 90s gave it a slightly romantic touch. The thing is, enduring inconveniences and pronounced pleasure live at the heart of pure adulation. I used to look forward to long and tiresome bus journeys. It meant laying my hands on the latest comic books at bus stations’ bookshops. I grew up in a small village in Konkan, Maharashtra. I saved my prize money to send “money order” to Delhi, and ordered new comic books directly from Raj Comics. Owing to the 2000 miles’ transit and the bureaucracy of the Indian Post, my wait used to last for roughly two months. But the damned trouble was worth it. The thing is, enduring inconveniences and exaggerated pleasure live at the heart of pure adulation. However after a point, growing up messes up with unadulterated devotion. Even if you don’t grow out of something, you still gain exposure to wider realities and gain a somewhat rational perspective. And the thing is, rationality results in the convolution of devotion. … I
never grew out of comic books, but I widened my range. I was a Batman fan since childhood too, but it was after growing up that I started reading his comic books. As I expanded my DC horizons, my devotion to Dhruva began to crack. Anupam Sinha, the creator of Dhruva, has admitted that the character is deeply inspired by Batman and Robin. That is an understatement. The backstory of Dhruva goes like this: Dhruva is son of Radha and Shyam — acrobats at the “Jupiter” circus. The prodigious child is deeply loved by everyone at the circus. Various performers train him in their crafts such as communicating with birds and animals, martial arts and acrobatics. A rival promotion attacks Jupiter circus and burns the whole place down. 14 years old Dhruva loses everything including his parents. The distraught boy sets on a mission to avenge this loss. It is at this juncture he meets assistant police commissioner of Rajnagar, Rajan Mehra. Rajan Mehra not only saves the boy from going to the dark side, but he also adopts him. The Mehra household consisting of Rajan Mehra, Rajani Mehra and their daughter Shweta thus becomes the new home of Dhruva. Shweta is a tech genius. She builds numerous gadgets including the utility belt for Dhruva. In her pursuit to protect her superhero brother, Shweta herself goes on to become a vigilante superhero called “Chandika”. In Batman terms, it can be summed up like this: Dick Grayson (the first Robin, who later becomes “Nightwing”), the youngest son of circus acrobats — Graysons, has the abilities of Bruce Wayne (Batman). Dick is adopted by commissioner Jim Gordon. Barbara Gordon (the Batgirl and later on “the Oracle”) the tech genius daughter of Jim Gordon, becomes his adopted sister. Reality often stings like a betrayal. The inspiration does not end here. For every bat-shaped object, there is a star-shaped object. It also is an obvious reference the fact that “Dhruva” means the North Star in Sanskrit. Just like Batman, Dhruva too has a utility belt that carries every useful thing in several universes in roughly 8 small compartments. Dhruva’s archenemy is “Grand Master Robo”. A half man and half robot, he is a combination of “Ras Al Ghul” and “Deathstroke”. His daughter, Natasha, is Dhruva’s enduring love and everlasting torment, (that’s Talia Al Ghul). For the “Riddler”, there is the “Quizmaster”. For the “Catwoman” there is the “Blackcat”. Dhruva’s best friend is Raj, who lives in Mahanagar. He wears glasses and works as a journalist in the day. Off duty, He spews venom as the invulnerable “Nagraj”. This may remind one of a certain Clark Kent from Metropolis. Reality often stings like a betrayal. Realising these “parallels” left a similar impact. I grew out of Dhruva more quickly than I ever imagined I would. And, ironically enough it was through Batman I rediscovered Dhruva. … My
generation has seen the Batman through geniuses of Frank Miller, Jeff Loeb and Grant Morrison to name a few. The Dark Knight version of the Batman has become the most iconic superhero to have ever existed. The character is stunningly multi-dimensional in its exploration of human psyche. Its iconic issues such as “Killing Joke”, “Year One”, “Hush”, “The Long Halloween” or “Dark Knight Returns” are rich in depth and soul that is rarely seen in graphic novels. Post 1987, when Frank Miller’s “Year One” was published, Batman transcended typical superheroes to become a cultural and literary icon. It was going through some of the older Batman issues, published during late 40s to 70s, which reminded me of Dhruva. The campy, zany and over the top fun of older Batman is something alien to the broody Batman of today. The Batman of the yore is bright, chirpy and eccentric. Sounds of explosions and fists in his stories are loud and literal. The content is quite cheesy and at times even sentimental. Traditional American values appear throughout these stories. It is then I realised that while imitating some specific elements of Batman, creators of Dhruva internalised the charm of the older versions of Batman. And in doing so, they ended up creating the first Indian superhero, who embodied the spirit of their India. … T
here is no other character that can encapsulate what India of the late 80s and early 90s must have felt like the way Super Commando Dhruva does. India went through intense social turmoil in the era. On one hand, issues like Mandal Aayog, Shah Bano case, and Ram Janmabhoomi Andolan sparked massive transformation of how India interacted with itself. On the other hand, end of the cold war and liberalisation of the Indian economy altered the way it interacted with the world. When violent protests rampaged on many streets, children from urban (in disposition) families including me were watching “The Jungle Book” and “Batman” on colour television. What it meant to be Indian had never been more fluid than it did then, especially so for the urban India. Individually and socially there was imitation of many things American. Within homes, typical Indian family values still endured. The blend of these contrasting and even conflicting elements is basically the essence of Super Commando Dhruva. He is very much western in terms of how he operates, and he is very much Indian in terms of how he lives. Dhruva is a strong individual who fights the evil on his own. But unlike almost every other superhero, he lives with a happy family. He is his mother’s son, who often eats his dinner on the dinner table. He banters with Shweta just the way a normal older sibling would. Very uniquely, he has no secret identity. He is always aware that his family may be targeted by a villain, but he posits enough trust in himself and his family to deal with it. Dhruva essentially is a good human being without the god complex. He wears his vulnerability on his sleeves and still saves the day. He loves in an understated way, and he handles the loss stoically. He has many friends, and he is kind to the enemy. His tragic past is his inspiration, not his identity. There is a sense of harmony between what he does and what he is underneath, and that’s what defines him. In a nutshell, Dhruva is strong-willed, conscientious and compassionate. India has celebrated these traits in its mythical kings and epochal heroes for a several millennia. Moreover, for all the undeniable imitation, I must admit that Anupam Sinha and Sanjay Gupta of Raj Comics did produce many entertaining stories. Some of the villains are original and enthralling. I have had a gala time reading those outlandish and dramatic comic books. … It
is amazing on this backdrop that Dhruva could never become a phenomenon it could have. He could not become a part of India’s popular culture. I believe it happened for a fundamental reason. The character and its creators played at a very peculiar intersection. Dhruva is a Hindi and urban character. In the heyday of Dhruva in the 90s, most of the Hindi belt (North and Central India) could not identify with a westernised urban character, and the urbanised population of non-Hindi states was not inclined towards Hindi literature. Hence only a narrow section of the population had some exposure to Raj Comics, and the company could not reach out to larger masses. Gradually with the advent of internet and globalised market, the situation got increasingly dire. During its thin years in early 2000s, Dhruva was the constant star for the publication. Just like the world in his stories, he saved the day for the company every year, but now even he is sliding in oblivion. Today Raj Comics is in a very serious trouble. Sales have dwindled drastically over the years. It releases only a handful comic books each year. It is worth noting that Batman had endured multiple lean periods during its first 50 years. It has been a whole different trajectory since 1987. Dhruva in comparison is still only 32 years old. I sincerely hope that life will imitate art, and Dhruva will meet his own Frank Millers and Jeff Loebs, who will reinvent the character, and give India the hero it does not really need, but the hero it deserves."
Medium.com,Society,E-commerce Marketplace’s Action Plan to Upscale in Southeast Asia,World,https://medium.com/keyreply/e-commerce-marketplaces-action-plan-to-upscale-in-southeast-asia-eba7fd8cc2b5?source=topic_page---------541------------------1," Following Alibaba’s record-breaking sales with Singles Day Sale event, marketplaces in Southeast Asia such as Lazada and Shopee have been devoting significant efforts in consolidated sale periods like the recent 99 Sale and the upcoming Single’s Day Sale (11/11). These mega-sales are increasingly popular for good reasons. First, they help marketplaces attain greater market share, especially with the tech-savvy bargain shoppers. Second, frequent mega-sales are useful for merchants to manage inventory balances with enticing deals. Third, products with a heavily reduced price may act as loss leaders to encourage traffic to their store and improve sales across the board. Other independent online retailers which are not listed on marketplaces have also been tapping on such sale period to attract consumers. Frequent discount shifts reference prices and deter future transactions at the usual price. Bargain conscious consumers are primed to accumulate their shopping carts before making their purchases. To combat this undesirable consumer behavior, merchants have to be strategic in the products chosen to be discounted. The culture of mega-sale is becoming the norm for consumers in Southeast Asia. Inevitably, this trend augments the transaction volume and creates a wider gap in demand — decreased transaction in the non-sale period and increased transaction during the sale period. This phenomenon results in operational challenges such as spikes in functional duties related to order processing. With boosted transactions, related activities like merchant queries, quality checks, order fulfilment increase during sale periods. Uneven distribution of demand for operational needs can result in difficulties in human resource allocation. The solution is oftentimes not as simple as hiring and firing additional headcount to meet short-term demand spikes. Businesses still need to provide staff training to these ad-hoc hires in order to meet service standards. Luckily, this problem does not exist without a solution — automation. Automation solutions for specific tasks are ubiquitous in the current day and age. Firms can choose to hire external providers or develop automation solutions in-house to scale. Such solutions will help the firm to scale with ease, regardless of long-term organic growth or seasonal fluctuations. This can be strategically implemented in three stages. Firstly, e-commerce marketplaces can implement automation solutions for its internal team’s usage. This includes managing merchant queries from a customer service viewpoint and streamlining order-fulfilment processes from an operational one. When internal users can utilize automation solutions effectively, the marketplace can proceed to the second stage which is to scale the automation application horizontally. This can be achieved by helping merchants adopt automation; passing the baton on to merchants can become a key differentiating factor for the marketplace to keep merchants in their ecosystem. The small and micro enterprises will benefit from automated processes which could otherwise be uneconomical. Through this, merchants will be able to provide better, and more efficient service to consumers. This will heighten the network effect experienced in the entire marketplace as increased utilization of automation solutions can translate to making more training sets available for machine learning and artificial intelligence. Network effect — a phenomenon whereby increased numbers of people or participants improve the value of a good or service. After the entire ecosystem is on board with the automation processes and tools, marketplaces can continue to expand the capabilities of its AI automation solutions to solve business problems outside of its industry. Any organisation, notwithstanding its domain-specific difficulties, will face a set of core challenges in which low dexterity tasks occupy significant amounts of employees’ day to day work, resulting in a loss of productivity. These challenges that are industry-agnostic can then be solved by the marketplace’s automation solutions which have already been tried, tested and proven internally and by its merchants. On one end, they can develop and rely completely on the AI algorithm to recognize and differentiate application. However, this is still idealistic with the current state of technology. More realistically, merchants and the businesses using such automation tools should be able to customize them at an individual level so each of them can tailor the use case to their industry or business model. The variance in demand is a problem faced by many businesses, not just e-commerce marketplaces discussed in this article. How businesses can differentiate itself to improve operations using automation, and which type of automation should they adopt are highly dependent on the business model itself. T he framework provided here on scaling solutions through network effects could be easily adapted for any industry."

Medium.com,Society,How Idania del Rio Built Cuba’s First Independent Fashion,World,https://magenta.as/how-idania-del-rio-built-cubas-first-independent-fashion-dd469d629bb3?source=topic_page---------543------------------1," The cofounder of Clandestina opens up about her beginnings in graphic design, becoming a businesswoman, and the launch of her first New York store. Rum, cigars, old cars — Cuba is known for a lot of things. Fashion, a capitalistic luxury, isn’t one of them. Which is why Idania del Rio is such a daring standout. In 2015, the graphic designer (along with her partner, Leire Fernandez) launched the nation’s first fashion brand. Called Clandestina, the Havana-based company has not only established a major presence in Cuba — creating an entirely local supply chain — but has expanded into the U.S., with a pop-up shop last summer and the opening of a permanent store in Williamsburg, Brooklyn. Snappy slogans like “Actually, I’m in Havana” and “País en construcción” (“Country under Construction”) adorn Clandestina’s colorful T-shirts — proud statements that reflect a country undergoing changes, while upcycled handbags express a commitment to sustainability, which, for Cubans, is a means of surviving with scarce resources. While all Clandestina products sold in Havana are made locally and printed in store, the T-shirts sold the Stateside are sourced and produced by a supplier in South Carolina. In addition to being the first fashion brand, Clandestina is also the first Cuban brand to have an online store and sell internationally, with the backend operations and customer service still being handled by the Havana shop. The workaround logistics proved to be another Cuban first, paving the way for other Cuban businesses to follow suit. Here, del Rio talks her daily routine, taking her mother’s advice, and Cuba’s growing acceptance of commerce. My working ritual is pretty simple. I wake up at 8 a.m, do some yoga or morning thinking, and then, once I’m at the studio at 11 a.m., I have meetings and follow-ups, etc. My creative work starts again around 3 p.m., when everything is calmer in the office. I leave the office at 5 or 6 p.m., because I have soccer practice. I try not to work in the evening, but my mind is always racing, which is kind of exhausting. I don’t come from an artistic family. My mother was a teacher specializing in sports education, and my father was an economist. My grandfather, however, had studied painting (and then became an audio engineer). When I was a little girl, I spent a lot of time drawing with my grandfather. Later, I tried to study fine arts, but I didn’t get in because the exams were really hard and I was ill-prepared. A few months later. my mother told me, “Hey, don’t be so sad. You can become a designer!” and I was like “No, I want to be a painter!” She said, “No, no, no, you can be a designer. I’m going to take you to the design school. They have an open day, blah, blah, blah.” And I liked what I saw. So I attended the Instituto Superior de Diseño Industrial in Havana, which I left with a degree in graphic design and visual communication. After I graduated, I took a two-year sojourn in Uruguay. When I went there, everything was brand new, easier. I could move around and find milk, toilet paper, butter, Wi-Fi, any time I wanted. But all these came at a price. Many of my Uruguayan friends were working and studying at the same time. Those not from Montevideo had to rent tiny rooms and live there for five years, until they found a job after graduation and buy their own house, and then maybe sell it again while working to save more money and buy something bigger and better. I observed a cyclical type of life, something I see in developed countries, and found myself disconnected from everything. Then my mother got very sick and I had to return to Cuba. Initially, I was, Oh God, this is so hard. I can’t move around because the buses or taxis suck. But then I started feeling connected to everything happening around me. So I opened a small studio for artists and painters. I tried to focus on making money because I had to support my mother. And when the opportunity to open Clandestina arose, I grabbed it. The light in Cuba is extremely bright. Actually, there is no color in Cuba, just a mix of all colors together. It’s kind of crazy if you think about it. People are really open to any color at any time of the year. They are also open to any body type, and, because it’s hot, the fewer layers, the better. In a way, they sabotage the fashion industry. I find all these very interesting. I am particularly inspired by the things I see on the street. I think of them as problems to which I have to give answers. Emotions and feelings and culture influence me, as does humor. In Cuba, we are constantly met with challenges: Some are stupid, little, annoying things; others are deep and historical contradictions — big enough to create a huge void between people. Humor and a strong will inspire me to persist. At the beginning, locals were curious about Clandestina. I remember people asking me and my Spanish partner, Leire Fernandez, “When is the restaurant going to open?” and we said “No! This is not a restaurant; this is a design store.” And they asked what we were designing, and we answered clothing and stuff like that. I would lie if I said the beginning wasn’t a bit hard, because Cubans said or implied, “Oh, you want to be commercial,” but things are completely different now. We have become a kind of a template of what people can do. They see us as creative people that need to make money with their work, something tremendously important for the Cuban economy right now. Our neighborhood in Old Havana certainly helps. Old Habaneros are more easy-going and open. If you don’t mind their business, they won’t mind yours. We have become a kind of a template of what people can do. They see us as creative people that need to make money with their work, something tremendously important for the Cuban economy right now. In Havana, you are stuck in time. You have to want to move fast to work and, generally, survive. New York is different. It’s an incredibly dynamic city. It’s much bigger than Havana, and with a different architecture. Yet I find strong similarities between the two cities. There’s something in their energy. They share a similar level of intensity. In Havana, you need to move fast to overcome that energy of being stuck in the past. In New York, you move fast 24/7 for the exactly opposite reason. For me, this energy, this fast movement in both cities, is a mix of frustration and sense of opportunity. But don’t forget there are thousands of Cubanoamericanos in New York. We are bridging two cultures. I feel like I’m breaking a wall. Magenta is a publication of Huge."
Medium.com,Society,Untitled story,World,https://medium.com/@bruno.cooke/old-china-vs-new-china-50eecbf81f64?source=topic_page---------544------------------1," [Written in 2017] Something clicked recently, a sort of phenomenon which has come to light in my head in the last week or two. It’s about the relationship between the old and new, those who do and those who document, the rugged and the pristine. There is a rift in so many ways — behavioural, habitual, maybe even ideological — and the natural response of the present generation, who perch on the edge of a thousands of years-old series of dynasties and handwritten histories and instead look upwards to the stars through a pixelated lens, is to ogle. Ogle and boggle. Because people doing things with their hands — that’s fascinating. Really, it is, especially if the current vogue is to cover up as much skin as possible so as to avoid getting any darker, play LOL (League of Legends) on your iPhone in order to pass the time, and go to the canteen three times a day for your sustenance. One student of mine said her boyfriend was ugly because he was too dark. They used to call him Blackie. How does one approach that? Old China is ghastly, gaunt and decrepit — it is all the adjectives under the sun (the invisible sun, the elusive sun, the sun hidden by the pollution of the New), and heaves as it breathes. It is drooping eyelids under the weight of its own history. It is playing mahjiang or Chinese chess in hordes of old men, bent over like stray cats, lost in a mist of technology and change, caught in the eye of the storm, finding refuge in nostalgia, routine, traditional, stillness. It is square dancing solemnity, lit incongruously by LED screens blaring ads and silent infomercials. It is being written constantly and literally onto the paving stones of parks, by men and women stooped forming right-angles over brushes, inhabitants of a bygone era, plucking watered words from their pasts and sweeping them in swathes over stone — only to be washed away with the rest. Hosepipes scatter puddles and the slate is cleaned. It is meditative, persistent, never cowing, droning on patiently in the background. It is transient and permanent and clung to and revered. Temples, water, work, rice, sagging, beautiful, real — radiant, sad. Old China underpins the New like a giant slab of concrete, impermeable to change and being blinkered out, stifled by the monster redevelopment project of New China, by social upheaval and hyper-modernity and WeChat. Its song is mellifluous but its fingernails are breaking and its scratches are no longer indelible on the minds of the young — who flaunt the badges of New China like gold stars. The old chime lugubriously as their pasts are stripped away, & collect round each other with sunflower seeds and flasks of tea and chortle like characters from Beckett, half-dead, gripped by laughter and serenity. The New China strides like a juggernaut, indefatigable and unforgiving. It is cement, glass, pragmatism — shiny, rustling faux leather and long puffer jackets, fashion town, colours, blasé, picture-taking paradise, boyfriends and girlfriends and shirking tradition — absence of past, eternal present future beckoning, industrious and lurid and loud and lawless and gloriously all of the above, unabashedly everything and in abundance. It towers over all else and constantly surveys, tacky and deadpan and resplendent and giggling, full of life and in perpetual motion — patterns and patents and discovering yourself — dancing yourself. It is bottled green tea and inflated packets with mock croissants, 8000¥ t-shirts and exhibitions of wealth. It is techtonik dancing in an LED-lit, floodlit, jam-packed shopping reverie, pink hair and profile pictures. It is getting to grips with the ever-changing notions of flux and self and self-hood. It is unabashed and by itself, beside itself, fighting itself, for itself. It is of interest above all, and is only ever boring if that boredom stems from being overstimulated and therefore desensitised. It is WeChat. It is self-procreating, reproducing, simulacra-inducing, churning out versions of its own existence onscreen. It is expectorating chicken ankles between selfies, and whitening its cheeks and teeth to meet the new criteria. [Compiled from articles originally published on brucycle.blogspot.com]"
Medium.com,Society,Saudi policy shift: A rare Trump foreign policy success,World,https://medium.com/the-turbulent-world-of-middle-east-soccer/saudi-policy-shift-a-rare-trump-foreign-policy-success-5e86d0402fb5?source=topic_page---------545------------------1," By James M. Dorsey A podcast version of this story is available on Soundcloud, Itunes, Spotify, Stitcher, TuneIn, Spreaker, Pocket Casts, Tumblr, Podbean and Castbox. By the law of unintended consequences, US President Donald J. Trump’s mix of uncritical and cynical embrace of Saudi Arabia and transactional approach towards relations with the kingdom may be producing results. Saudi Arabia appears to be backing away from its largely disastrous assertive and robust go-it alone foreign and defense policy posture and reverting to a more cautious approach that embraces multilateralism, seeks international backing before acting and emphasizes traditional and public diplomacy. The kingdom’s shift towards a less reckless, more coordinated and deliberate foreign and defense policy does not necessarily mean a change in rhetoric or a greater willingness to seek negotiated solutions. It entails a change in tone and strategy rather than a backing away from key foreign or domestic policy positions, including Saudi Arabia’s deep-seated animosity towards Iran. Saudi state minister for foreign affairs Adel al-Jubeir made that clear, saying that Saudi Arabia had not ruled out a military response to drone and missile attacks that severely damaged two if its key oil installations. Mr. Al-Jubeir reiterated conditions for any successful negotiation that include tough restrictions on and oversight of Iran’s nuclear program and limits to its development of ballistic missile. He further demanded fundamental changes to Iran’s foreign and defense policy. “No nukes, no missiles and no terrorism,” Mr. Al-Jubeir said in language that was likely to appeal to a broad audience but masked the two countries’ core differences. Nicolas Dunais, an economic advisor to Gulf governments who last year was helping Saudi Arabia establish a national risk and resilience unit, got a glimpse of Saudi Arabia’s fundamental attitude before the kingdom’s recent repackaging. Mr. Dunais was taken aback when he suggested opening a backchannel to Yemen’s Iranian-backed Houthi rebels. “Not only was the suggestion ignored, but it also led to questions as to my motivations and interests — as if trying to solve a national risk through dialogue was anathema, given the confidence that military might alone would be enough to crush an army of ragtag rebels fighting with AK47s,” Mr. Dunais recalls. King Salman signalled the policy shift when he told a Cabinet meeting, days after the attacks believed to have at least been enabled by Iran, that they were “not aimed at the vital facilities of Saudi Arabia only, but also threaten the global economy.” King Salman’s statement was as much an effort to capitalize on the attacks to garner international support and step up pressure on Iran as it was the setting of a different foreign policy tone. Unlike the United States that put responsibility for the attacks squarely on the shoulders of Iran, Saudi spokesmen were careful to stop short of holding Iran directly responsible for the attacks. Instead, they asserted that the weapons used in the attacks were Iranian made and therefore bore some degree of responsibility. Similarly, in sharp contrast to the kingdom’s rejection of an international investigation into last year’s killing of journalist Jamal Khashoggi and its tight control of access to war-torn Yemen, Saudi Arabia followed up on King Salman’s statement by inviting the United Nations and others to participate in a forensic investigation of the attacks that would focus on the origin of the weapons employed, and the launching spot of the drones and missiles. Speaking to the New York-based Council of Foreign Relations, Mr. Al-Jubeir said foreign experts had already arrived in the kingdom. Driving the point home, Mr. Al al-Jubeir said earlier that Saudi Arabia was consulting “with friends and allies about the next steps to take.” In a further embrace of multilateralism, Saudi Arabia, days after the attacks, joined a US-led coalition to secure the Middle East’s waterways. Earlier, Britain, Bahrain and Australia pledged to participate in the coalition. The Saudi moves were buffeted by a concerted reaching out to the media rather than relying primarily on expensive public relations and lobbying agencies to ensure that the kingdom’s voice and more cautious approach was heard and noted. The attacks drove home the vulnerability of the kingdom’s oil assets that account for the bulk of its revenues and its international standing and a realization that Saudi Arabia could not count on unquestioned support of the international community and particularly the United States, its long-standing guardian angel. That realization came as Saudi Arabia was working to repair damage to its image as a result of its conduct of the Yemen war; the killing of Mr. Khashoggi; the massive crackdown on activists, critics and businessmen; and its abrupt and undiplomatic response to countries like Sweden and Canada that voiced public criticism of the kingdom’s policies. This week, Saudi ambassador to the UN Abdulaziz Alwasil didn’t mince his words, responding to Australia’s leadership of 24 Western nations in issuing a statement condemning the kingdom for a raft of human rights abuses. Yet, in a sign of the times and in contrast to earlier incidents involving Sweden and Canada, Mr. Alwasil did not threaten disruption of trade and other forms of cooperation with Australia nor did he indicate that the kingdom may expel Australian diplomats. Saudi Arabia’s efforts to come to grips with new realities came as the kingdom was preparing for an initial public offering by its national oil company, Aramco, that has been struggling to ensure that it meets Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman’s target valuation of US$2 trillion. The precarity of the kingdom’s situation was obvious for all to see when Mr. Trump made clear that his inclination was not to launch a risky retaliatory strike against Iran in response to the attacks but to tighten economic sanctions and to continue exploring a possible dialogue with the Islamic republic, Adding insult to injury, Mr. Trump emphasized the fact that the attacks were against Saudi Arabia and not against the United States and that his administration would support a Saudi response or potentially act on its behalf against payment. As a result, Saudi Arabia has been manoeuvring to ensure that the situation does not get out of control and that it is not put in a position in which it risks an all-out war that could prove to be devastating. Saudi Arabia’s shift in policy approach follows in the footsteps of the United Arab Emirates that has in recent months sought to de-escalate tensions in the Gulf by distancing itself from Saudi positions. The UAE has partially withdrawn its forces from Yemen in an effort to prevent further reputational damage, a move that sparked fighting between UAE and Saudi-backed forces in the country. It was careful not to blame Iran for attacks on tankers off the coast of the UAE believed to have been launched by Iran and reached out to the Islamic republic by sending a coast guard delegation to Tehran. Said Rebecca Wasser, a senior policy analyst at RAND Corp., noting that the attacks had made the kingdom realize that it may be playing for stakes that are too high: “I think there has a been a calculation that the costs might be too high.” Mr. Trump can claim some credit for Saudi Arabia’s emerging adoption of a more cautious approach. Higher costs and greater risk perceptions were likely one consequence of his transactional approach towards the kingdom. Dr. James M.

Medium.com,Society,Here’s Why China Is A Growing Hemp Superpower,World,https://medium.com/@ministryofhemp/heres-why-china-is-a-growing-hemp-superpower-4ae4b12ed7bc?source=topic_page---------546------------------1," Ever wondered where your hemp product comes from? More likely than not, it came from China, the world’s largest source of hemp agriculture. While China grows more acres of hemp than any other nation, in some ways their regulations are far more strict than the U.S. For example, China is only just starting to allow hemp’s use in beauty products! Even so, at once time China grew 70% of the world’s hemp, and its the source of most of the imported hemp in the United States. In this article, we’ll take a closer look at where hemp is grown in China and how it’s used there. Chinese people used hemp since before the beginning of recorded history. Hemp was used in medicine, oil, rope, food, paper and clothing. The oldest known example of paper comes from China. It was made from hemp, rags, and other plant materials. Even though hemp was an important part in China’s history, it was affected by the harsh drug restrictions of past governments, especially under Communism. These restrictions saw harsh punishments for drug use, cultivation and transportation, sometimes even resulting in the death penalty. Then, after signing United Nations Convention on Psychotropic Substances in 1985, China banned all cultivation of the cannabis plant. Culturally, this increased the stigma against the cannabis plant with the Chinese people. It’s only since 2010 that China started to loosen its grip on the hemp industry, and companies still have to abide by very strict regulations. But, with the undeniable popularity of hemp products in the United States, Canada and all throughout Europe, China simply couldn’t afford to stay out of this quickly growing industry. With this pressure growing, China is looking into further expanding, hopefully allowing more uses like food and modern medicine. China allows hemp growing in just two regions: Yunnan Province in the south & Heilongjiang Province in the north. Together, these two provinces account for more than half of the world’s total hemp production and 1/3rd of total world hemp sales. Textiles make up about 3/4ths of those sales according to New Frontier data. Other products like cosmetics, CBD, food and supplements make up the rest. The hemp textile industry is large and China’s biggest money-maker so far. Jilin, Yunnan’s neighboring Province is also set to place regulations for hemp production as well. With the favorable success of just two of China’s thirty-four provinces, we can only assume that China will continue to produce the plant in increasing quantities. In the current market, hemp farmers can make up to $300 per acre of hemp. As hemp becomes more solidified within the world economy, that valuation could go up. China has natural advantages for growing hemp. It has a lot of farmland to cultivate the plant on the Eastern coast of the country, where the majority of the population lives. And, while hemp can be grown in almost any climate, China has favorable farming conditions in a majority of its provinces. Not only do they have a climate and terrain that’s perfect for growing hemp, but they have a long history in farming and production. By leveraging their tradition, and production-focused economy, they can really perform well. Long story short, the partnership of hemp and China is a match made in heaven. As China’s creates more finalized products, we’re likely to see a seismic shift in industry power. Chinese firms contain large amounts of capital funding and better production capabilities than most Western firms can afford. U.S. companies should prepare now, as China will inevitably create a major disruption in the industry. At the moment, U.S. companies maintain higher standards in CBD extractions and growing. We always recommend hemp products produced carefully in the U.S. from growing to final production. This is because hemp is a bio accumulator and absorbs and toxins contained in its growing soil. One firm advocating for hemp product expansion in China is the Hanma Investment Group. With a farmland in Yunnan Province under the subsidiary name of Hempsoul that cultivates over 1,600 acres of hemp, Hanma is doubling up with their cultivation of the crop. They not only grow hemp, but they also process it, as Hempsoul is one of a handful of firms that have attained licensing to extract cannabidiol. Other companies such as the Conba Group and Huaren Pharmaceutical are vying for licensing and production in Yunnan Province. In Heilongjiang Province, Chinese firm Shineco plans on building a CBD industrial park. Starting by seeding about 90 acres of field with CBD-rich cannabis seeds, Shineco plans on creating a 3,000–5,000-acre industrial park. The park will accommodate the entire hemp supply-chain, including an extraction plant, growing fields, research center and other buildings for future processing expansion. Much like American firms, Chinese firms work closely with local governments in order to expand and grow their businesses. Even with the high levels of restrictions and remaining stigma, China is still a superpower in our industry. As local and national governments loosen regulations, and production standards improve, China’s influence will only continue to grow."
Medium.com,Society,Iran Regime’s Long Record of Destruction of the Environment,World,https://medium.com/swlh/iran-regimes-long-record-of-destruction-of-the-environment-beeb2ab2e3ef?source=topic_page---------547------------------1," Iranian provinces face a water shortage crisis. During the summer, many of Iran’s southern provinces lacked access to water. What is the origin of this crisis? The destructive policy of the Iranian regime that has pushed the Iranian environment to the edge of destruction. In this article, we will examine the effects of the ongoing destruction of the environment on Iranian society and the consequences, such as the water crisis or the devastating floods that happened earlier this year. The Iranian regime and it’s Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps (IRGC) play a key role in the destruction of the country’s environment, thanks to their institutionalized corruption and destructive policies. State statistics show that the flood in March 2019 affected around 10 million people, directly or indirectly. The flood also damaged 235 cities and more than 4,300 villages in 25 Iranian provinces. As a result, 40,000 residential units in urban and rural areas need complete reconstruction, and 41,000 need maintenance and repairs. The Iranian regime had no program to prevent or control the flood. On the contrary, by destroying the vegetation and half of Iran’s forests, changing the rivers paths, excessive construction of dams, and drying the marshes (such as the “Great Marsh” located at the Iran-Iraq border) to exploit oil reserves, they amplified the destruction of the flash flood by a factor of 10. The Iranian regime continued its destructive policy despite numerous warnings by its own environmental experts and many protests by Iranian citizens. On June 12, 2019, the residents of the Hussain Abad Kalpoush village in Semnan Province protested in front of the regime’s parliament in Tehran against the construction of the Kalpoush dam, which they described as unprofessional. On April 13, 2019, some 115 professors of Ahvaz University in southern Iran wrote an open letter to regime president Hassan Rouhani and urged him to take action to “save the cities and villages of Khuzestan province”, while underlining the need to permanently dewater the “Hour-ol-Azim marsh”. The state-run ILNA news agency quoted them as writing: “We urge you to immediately order the permanent dewatering of the Hour-ol-Azim marsh to prevent human and financial casualties, possible paralyzing of people, groups, institutions and associations and other irreversible environmental damages to the people of Khuzestan. Any economic activity, particularly oil exploitations in Hour-ol-Azim marsh, should be in line with the marsh’s eco-system.” On March 1, 2019, Hadi Kia Daliri, the head of Iran’s Forestry Association, in an interview with the Islamic Azad University’s news agency, said: “According to statistics, each acre of forest holds up to 2,000 square meters of water, therefore the destruction of forests and vegetation could increase the current crisis. Construction of villas and destruction of forests are considered as environmental changes. These situations could turn continued light rains to heavy rainfalls and floods. So this is a threat to the northern provinces. More than 42 percent of the northern forests are devastated and, given this situation, we could say that in a few years’ time, there won’t be any forest left.” Maryam Rajavi, President-elect of the National Council of Resistance of Iran (NCRI), confirmed in her message to the flood victims in March that the casualties are the fault of the plundering policies of the Iranian regime over the past 40 years. She wrote: “This disaster once again proved that the ruling mullahs’ criminal 40-year policy of plunder and pillage has taken a heavy toll on the lives and livelihood of our people in every flood and earthquake. Why did so many of our fellow compatriots die and get injured in Shiraz after just a 10-minute rainfall, with such huge destructions?” She cited that the corrupt mullahs inflicted this catastrophe and others by One Iranian-Arab citizen in Ahvaz described the situation, saying: “Khuzestan’s problem is not water density­ — it is the density of lies, betrayal, and totalitarianism, and when we opposed them we were called anti-revolutionist.” The mullahs’ destruction of the environment is one of the most devastating problems caused by the Regime, which you can see through the excessive construction of dams that served the regime’s economic benefits. The construction of numerous dams in Iran reduces the dams’ external water stream, forcing the agriculturists to dig wells, legally or illegally, to fulfill their need for water from underground sources. This practice in the moors around the Urmia Lake accelerated the drying of this lake, leaving a devastating ecological effect, particularly on Isfahan, Charmahl & Bakhtiari, and Yazd provinces. The fact is, during its 40 years of reign, the mullahs’ regime has not only slaughtered the Iranian people and violated human rights, but continues the destruction of the Iranian environment. So, the answer to the environmental crisis in Iran, as to other social or economic crises, is the downfall of this regime."
Medium.com,Society,Police Detains Mothers Protesting TurCadets’ Anguish in Jail,World,https://medium.com/@abyasun/police-detains-mothers-protesting-turcadets-anguish-in-jail-cd9befc0452e?source=topic_page---------548------------------1," When, several weeks ago, the Turkish government gave a strong endorsement and publicity to a sit-in protest by a group of mothers in front of the regional office of the pro-Kurdish HDP in Diyarbakir to question their sons’ participation on mysterious grounds to PKK, it aimed to arouse a groundswell of public support against the militant organization’s widespread recruitment efforts in the region. The sit-in protest by Kurdish mothers, who claim that their sons were forcefully kidnapped by the PKK to enlist them for its shrinking mountain manpower, has become a national matter, spurring swelling support for the mothers’ cause across the nation. By choosing the HDP’s office as the venue of protest, the ruling party also sought to discredit and vilify the Kurdish party in the eyes of the public by stressing the uncorroborated charge of direct affiliation between the PKK and the HDP. But what the government did not anticipate was the unintended consequence that there were other mothers, who are seeking justice for their missing beloved ones and who demand justice for their sons as well. When they took inspiration from Diyarbakir mothers, they launched similar protests. They went to the offices of the ruling Justice and Development Party (AKP) in Istanbul and Ankara to demand an answer to their plea. But they faced a different kind of treatment at the hands of law enforcement and authorities as their quest exposed the moral hypocrisy of the politicians. On Tuesday, a group of women, mothers of cadets who serve life sentence over the overblown charge of coup involvement, were detained by anti-riot police in Ankara. Main opposition Republican People’s Party (CHP) lawmaker Sezgin Tanrikulu expressed his dismay on Twitter, criticizing the detention of cadets’ mothers. In Diyarbakir, the political implications of the mothers’ protest were conducive to the government’s own interest to undermine the public image of the HDP. But in Istanbul and Ankara, the government was spooked and irritated by mothers’ similar attempt at AKP offices, and tried in vain to differentiate the two cases. Cadets’ situation remains a stain on the public conscience. While the entire people coalesce around the belief that cadets had no leading role and impact on the coup’s major contours, few people come out to publicly protest the life sentences handed to them. Still, many politicians in the opposition and some among the government party admit that their sentence is too harsh and disproportionate. Yet, as Melek Cetinkaya laments, no one attempts to do anything to correct the miscarriage of justice. Their mothers tried everything possible and available in their disposal, to little effect. None of the authorities are swayed. The media blackout is another source of a genuine grudge and understandable resentment among the families. Only Euronews Turkce and Deutsche Welle Turkce occasionally reported their lone struggle, while the majority of media outlets, national or foreign, did little more than a passing mention."

Medium.com,Society,Will Saudi-Arabia collapse?,World,https://medium.com/@bramerius/will-saudi-arabia-collapse-a607c51fa9cd?source=topic_page---------551------------------1," Whoever was responsible for the drone attacks on Saudi oil facilities, they have made the kingdom very nervous and indeed, exposed their growing weaknesses. There is no doubt that the Saudis will struggle to maintain control over their somewhat fragile state, which is held together by a mixture of coercion and money, both of which could easily snap when put under enough pressure. Saudi-Arabia has always been a fabricated kingdom, created by British imperialism and designed to be large, fragmented and weak. It’s ‘legitimacy’ was never derived from popular support, but from its functions as a puppet state, overseeing the world’s largest oil supplies and quashing any form of political dissent in the region, making sure that local people would never gain control over their own political destinies. In the late 1960s and 70s, the Saudis fought tooth and nail against the popular appeal of Egyptian leader Nasser, who had successfully defied his country’s economic stranglehold by the West when he nationalized the Suez Canal in 1956, becoming a hero across the region. His ascendancy sparked upheavals throughout the Middle East, which all demanded greater democratic freedoms and political control over local resources. Of course, this clashed with the interests of the Americans as well as the Western-backed dictatorships in the region, who were committed to keeping both oil prices and political power under careful control of tiny minorities. But as the Saudi regime grew increasingly unpopular with its own population and within the wider region as well, the royal family turned to a dangerous game of divide and conquer, promoting sectarian rivalries by using religion to spread its influence. The Saudis started promoting a particular brand of radical religion: Wahhabism, which they exported, especially to the fringes of the Muslim world, to states torn apart by conflict and poverty, like Afghanistan and Somalia. Spreading Wahhabism would underpin the growth of Saudi influence and its ambitions to become a regional superpower. Up until the conflict in Syria, Saudi money and weapons have been associated with groups like the Taliban, Al-Shabaab, Boko Haram, ISIS and the al-Nusra front, which targeted foreigners or non-Muslims, but also the adherents of another influential denomination within Islam; the Shia. But as is always the case, religion and politics are intimately intertwined. Saudi-Arabia’s biggest rival Iran experienced a popular revolution in 1979, in which the Shah (emperor) was toppled. The Shah had been an unpopular leader, installed by American and British intelligence in 1953 after they plotted to overthrow democratically elected Mossadegh, who had dared to raise the spectre of oil nationalization. Anglo-Iranian oil (present day BP) would have nothing of it and welcomed the strangling of popular democracy in the name of profit. The revolution of 1979 reflected the anger of a population that had been robbed, but it was unable to prevent a group of religious zealots led by Ayatollah Khomeini to assume leadership of the revolution and transform Iran into a Shia theocracy, only able to secure its power by its identification with the aims of the revolution, increasingly articulated in anti-Western rhetoric. Iran formed a threat to Saudi regional leadership, as most countries in the Middle East contain multiple ethnic or religious groups and Shia minorities found themselves voiceless within Saudi Arabia itself, but also in other Gulf monarchies and Iraq, where they are in fact a majority group. When the Iranian theocracy assumed power, Saudi-Iranian rivalry became increasingly framed along sectarian lines, with both sides using religious loyalties to undermine their rival’s influence abroad. Furthermore, as Iran positioned itself as an enemy of the US and the West, Saudi-Arabia and other Gulf dictatorships increasingly aligned themselves to them, in turn encouraging Russia and China to seek the opposite direction. Effectively, the Shia dictatorships of Iran and Syria became Russian (formerly Soviet) and Chinese allies, whilst the Sunni dictatorships of Iraq, Egypt, Saudi-Arabia and the Gulf were courted by the West. This rivalry intensified after the disastrous 2003 US-led intervention in Iraq, a majority Shia nation, which increased Iranian influence in the region, a development the Saudis could only counter by sponsoring proxy forces of radical Sunni Islam. This continued in Syria, a long-standing ally of the Iranians and the survival of Assad only boosted the Iranian position in the region. As the Iranians were able to negotiate their nuclear deal with the Obama administration and the EU, its reach as a regional power was advanced even further, a development the Saudis were keen to match, reflected by the renewed commitment of the new Saudi crown prince Mohamed Bin Salman to intervene abroad. The assault on Yemen’s Houthi brought together a coalition of Sunni dictatorships backed by the West, whilst the Houthi were loosely backed by the Iranians. But the Saudis have overplayed their hand. Their efforts in Yemen have only highlighted the cruelty of the Saudi regime which was amplified by the butchery of journalist Khashoggi in 2017. As Yemeni children starve and are blown to pieces by American and British supplied explosives, opposition is mounting. The Trump administration has firmly committed itself to the Saudis, as have the Israelis, a development which only highlights how estranged the regime in Riyadh has become from ordinary people in the Middle East, who are united in their opposition to Israel and the West. The unilateral decision to annul the Iran-nuclear deal has raised the stakes. Trump is going after Iran, but only half-heartedly, in spite of hawks in Washington and Tel Aviv pressuring him to do more. John Bolton was sacked for insisting on a more aggressive stance. There has been no significant military response to the drone attacks, nor the earlier Iranian provocations against oil tankers in the Persian Gulf. Is Trump letting the Saudis sort it? Has their inaction exposed their incompetence? Are the Saudis losing the war in Yemen? Is Iran perhaps not really behind the alleged provocations after all? Who is? Many questions remain unanswered. But the fragility of Saudi Arabia is a certainty and although the regime’s collapse has been predicted before, its demise could change the geopolitics of the entire region. In a world threatened by devastating climate change, the instability of the world’s largest oil produces might be a blessing the long term. Unfortunately, violent dictatorships never just step aside but no doubt go up in flames. The human cost will be significant."
Medium.com,Society,Are Aid Agencies Abetting ‘Surveillance Humanitarianism’?,World,https://onezero.medium.com/are-aid-agencies-abetting-surveillance-humanitarianism-5bc2b5a78ff6?source=topic_page---------552------------------1," hen a fingerprint scanner senses skin, it glows green. It’s not a natural green but a toxic-colored one; a shade associated with alien slime or dystopian futures. Yet to the United Nations, this green is the color of order amid chaos, a symbol of the organization’s efforts to catalog biometrics wherever it works. The UN’s World Food Programme (WFP) has so far collected 8 million biometric records. In 2018, the WFP started using similar devices in Yemen, a country embroiled in a grinding proxy war between the Saudi-led coalition and the Iranian-aligned Houthi rebels. Against a backdrop of fighting and mass hunger, the WFP began by collecting fingerprints in Aden, an ancient port city and temporary capital of Yemen. The agency has since amassed the fingerprints of 450,000 Yemenis living in areas controlled by the Saudi-backed government. In early August, a new deal was made with the Houthis that will enable the WFP to dramatically expand its biometric database with new permission to register the fingerprints of the 9 million Yemenis living under Houthi jurisdiction. Critics argue the aid sector is charging blindly into new technology, pressured by donors to cut costs and be more innovative. The WFP is not the only aid organization collecting vast amounts of biodata. The UN refugee agency UNHCR holds the fingerprint and iris records of 7.7 million people. The UN’s International Organization for Migration says its database holds almost 800,000 individuals’ biometrics, and U.S.-based NGO Mercy Corps is also experimenting with biometrics in communities and its shelters in Nigeria, with 38,000 people registered so far. Advocates say biometrics are an essential proof of identity in countries where few people have identity documents, enabling humanitarian agencies to verify that the right person is receiving the right aid. “Aid misuse is a huge challenge of global development, and what the WFP is trying to do, to its credit, is to tackle misappropriation and fraud that is so prevalent in the aid sector,” says Sebastian Manhart, COO at Simprints, a nonprofit that builds biometric technology for governments and NGOs. But critics argue the aid sector is charging blindly into new technology, pressured by donors to cut costs and be more innovative. Mark Latonero of the research institute Data & Society refers to the digitization of aid as “surveillance humanitarianism.” For him, the resource-scarce aid sector has been tempted by technology’s solutionism — the idea that any problem can be fixed with the right code or algorithm. “Data storage or data-sharing technology in any environment immediately causes or increases risks around privacy,” he says. “For me, in New York City, the outcome [if my privacy is compromised] might not be as harsh as for people in vulnerable circumstances whose data could be used by a warring faction to target them.” The aid sector itself is divided. Oxfam has been under a self-imposed biometrics ban since 2015. When the nonprofit commissioned a report on the sector’s use of biometrics, its authors found that “the potential risks for humanitarian agencies of holding vast amounts of immutable biometric data… far outweigh the potential benefits in almost all cases.” Those risks include ethical risks — can someone really give informed consent if they are asked for their fingerprints where they are hungry or desperate for medical treatment — and security risks, which were exacerbated when a 2017 internal audit found that the WFP’s data management system needed “major improvement.” That same report also spotlighted the way the WFP shares data with NGO partners, governments, UN agencies, and financial service providers, pointing to how “only a few” of these arrangements were supported by robust data-sharing agreements. “Beneficiary data is held in a secure system, hosted on UN premises, that is subject to regular, independent stress tests and verification,” a WFP spokesperson told OneZero. “WFP has also developed strict privacy policies to guide data sharing with partners.” In Yemen, the new deal ends a two-month dispute over who would control the data collected in Houthi-controlled areas. The Houthis originally blocked the use of biometrics in the city of Sana’a because the data would be controlled by the WFP — an agency that receives funding from their adversaries in the conflict, the Saudis. “Biometric data… are extraordinarily high-stakes data which the Houthis, at least rhetorically, understandably doubt the WFP’s ability to safeguard from organizations that mean them harm,” says Sean McDonald, co-founder of digital governance firm Digital Public. “Ultimately, the situation in Yemen represents a political evolution in beneficiaries’ awareness of the risks.” We are very worried about the bio-data that UNHCR wants to collect (finger prints, iris scans, property documents).” It’s unclear if Houthi complaints were genuine or an attempt to play politics, but their concerns are not unique. In 2018, thousands of Rohingya Muslims set up camp in southern Bangladesh after fleeing a military offensive in their home country Myanmar, described by the UN as a “textbook example of ethnic cleansing.” When UNHCR tried to bring order to Bangladesh’s vast pop-up communities by registering refugees’ biometrics in November, the Rohingya reacted with suspicion and began to protest. “We are very worried about the bio-data that UNHCR wants to collect (finger prints, iris scans, property documents),” said the protesters in a statement. “We believe UNHCR can share this data for repatriation with Myanmar Government and the Myanmar Government can use it to … make trouble for our families.” The UNHCR did not have a data-sharing agreement with the Myanmar government, but its Rohingya refugee data was co-owned with Bangladesh. When the Bangladeshi government started pushing for refugees to return home, rumors began that UNHCR data was transferred to Myanmar. This suspicion was reinforced when a tweet showed a delegation from Myanmar receiving a brown cardboard box containing 25,047 identity records, which appeared to include fingerprints. Mirca Madianou, a researcher at Goldsmiths, University of London, says data-sharing arrangements between aid agencies and governments shouldn’t be surprising. “Humanitarian agencies operate at the invitation of states,” she says. “If a state then asks for data, humanitarian agencies very often have very little room to maneuver. If, let’s say, the Bangladesh government requires data, they have to provide that or they have to leave Bangladesh.” In a July 2019 paper titled “Technocolonialism,” Madianou uses the Bangladesh example to illustrate how biometrics can enable “function creep,” or “the widening use of biometrics beyond the original purpose of registration.” While the UNHCR describes biometrics in Myanmar as a “vital tool for managing a humanitarian response,” Madianou’s paper suggests Bangladesh could use that data for a parallel purpose — “to facilitate a possible repatriation of the Rohingya to Myanmar despite the risk of renewed ethnic violence.” She points to a 2017 comment by Bangladeshi politician Amir Hossain Amu, who said, “The reason behind the biometric process is to keep record of Rohingya. We want them to go back to their own place.” “Rohingya refugees who go through this process [of biometric registration] are asked whether they consent for personal details to be provided by the government of Bangladesh to the government of Myanmar to help secure their right to return to their homes in Myanmar in the future,” says a UNHCR spokesperson, who agreed that refugees had suspicions about their biometric records. But, the spokesperson says, the agency has since held community meetings and produced a video that “spells out how the registration card benefits families in terms of aid delivery and protection as well as establishing their right to return to Myanmar voluntarily when they believe conditions are conducive to do so in safety and dignity.” Data-sharing agreements in the aid sector are often secretive, says McDonald of Digital Public. “Humanitarianism, like diplomacy, sometimes requires calculated opacity in order to create a safe-enough space for parties to agree to an intervention. That said, that’s more exception than rule — and the vast majority of humanitarian contracts probably should be made significantly more transparent.” Back in Yemen, there are few public details about the new arrangement. “The terms of the document we signed with the Sana’a-based authorities last week specify that neither side should provide details,” says a WFP spokesperson. The organization would not comment on whether it had shared biometric data with the Houthis. But this opacity is what makes both privacy experts and aid beneficiaries feel uneasy. “We need to be able to trust the humanitarian sector, and, importantly, the humanitarian sector is dependent on our trust for its resources and its license to operate,” says McDonald. “That trust starts with being explicit about the compromises and partnerships that frame their data-sharing relationships.”"
Medium.com,Society,Most of Ecuador’s Population gets hacked,World,https://medium.com/technicity/most-of-ecuadors-population-gets-hacked-1c6f7f3f8c4c?source=topic_page---------553------------------1," No
matter how much we write about online safety, cybersecurity & privacy issues, the problem keeps getting bigger. This time the target is a small American country of Ecuador with a population of 16.6 million. vpnMentor security researchers Noam Rotem and Ran Locar discovered the compromised database on an Elasticsearch server. The findings were shared with ZDNet. Yet again, the culprit was a misconfigured database. This past summer we saw multiple hacks where data records for most of the citizens of a country were hacked. Back in July, a cyberattack on Bulgaria’s tax agency resulted in a data breach of most adults of a country of 7 million people. The scary part is that hack occurred back in June and they only got to find out about it a month later from the “perpetrator” via an email. More recently, voter records of almost 80% of Chile’s population were left exposed online, as reported by the Wizcase research team. The bigger number of records than the country’s total population in Ecuador’s case is probably accounted for by duplicate records, older entries & records of deceased citizens. The data was spread across different indexes and based on these indexes, the database could be split into two categories based on origin— one gathered from government source & the rest compiled from private servers. The biggest contributor to the database was Ecuadorian government’s civil registry — containing information like full name, dates & place of birth, home addresses, marital status, national ID numbers, Work information, phone numbers, and education levels. The leak was so extensive that ZDNet was even able to find records of the country’s President! Ironically, the database also contained an entry for the infamous whistleblower Julian Assange (founder of WikiLeaks), who was given political asylum in the Ecuadorian embassy in London & issued a national ID number. The scariest part of this data leak was the detailed information available on Family & kids that could be used to reconstruct family trees. 6.77 million entries of children under 18 were detected some of whom were born this spring. This puts the lives & identities of the kids in grave danger as their home addresses were listed too. Two other indexes revealed the financial information of some of the citizens along with a database for car owners in the country. Collectively, 7 million financial records & 2.5 million car owner details were leaked. The source of this leak was tracked down to a data analytics company Novaestrat, both by ZDNet and vpnMentor. Efforts to reach the company via its website or its social media channels for an explanation yielded no results. The database was secured after vpnMentor let the Ecuador CERT (Computer Emergency Response Team) know of the incident. The problem is not these attacks are happening, but not enough protective measures being taken to avoid the situation again. That is why we keep hearing about these hacking incidents ever so often. Not only is the cost of these data breaches high, but it completely erodes people’s trust in these online systems."
Medium.com,Society,China Must Economically Surpass America,World,https://medium.com/datadriveninvestor/china-must-economically-surpass-america-29c7fd9ee2b?source=topic_page---------554------------------1," If our goal is for every person on the planet to live well, we should encourage less developed countries to increase their citizen’s purchasing power. For the longest time, the West has looked at China’s economic development as a threat to the Western way of life. China has 4.3 times more population than the United States of America, so they have the potential to surpass us in the sheer amount of consumption, therefore it is only a question of time before China produces more than the USA. The main concern over this isn’t because China’s economy is growing faster than America’s but because China is led by a “forever-term” socialist political party. We fear a quasi-dictatorial ruler in President Xi Jinping will have way too much influence over the global economy at that stage. I admit this is a concern. But if we set aside political ideologies for a moment, and think of the people living on the planet, most of the world’s population, including the Chinese, have been living in economic starvation compared to Europe and North America. The point is everyone in the world wants to have purchasing power and live well. Why would a family in Shanghai deserve less than a family in Detroit? After all, we are all human. We all need to eat healthy food, to sleep and to feel safe. Ideally, every nation in the world should work towards the same GDP per capita (derived from purchasing power parity (PPP)). This GDP per capita number would show the average value of goods that are produced, on average, by citizens of each country. Thus, if purchasing power is roughly the same everywhere in the world, allowing for international trade, every family should be able to acquire what they need no matter where they live. Related Article: How Long Can the U.S. Bull Market Last? This is an ideological wish. But if an idea makes sense and benefits us all, it is worth building towards. Below is a comparative table of GDP (adjusted for PPP) per capita for a select group of nations as calculated by the International Monetary Fund in 2018: According to a report by the World Economic League, they expect China to surpass the US in raw national GDP power in 2029, the PPP adjusted GDP per capita for China is less than a third of that of the US. This means while the country will surpass the US in economic raw power, the individual Chinese person is still losing out regarding purchasing power in the global market. In fact, both the IMF and the World Bank rate China as the world’s biggest economy, if purchasing power parity (PPP) is taken into account. You can do the math yourself using the table above. Multiply the adjusted GDP per capita with the population to get a total GDP amount and see which country’s number is highest. While this feels scary given China’s and America’s political differences, but China Is climbing the economic rankings because they are investing much more in higher education, infrastructure, and technology than America. China’s economic growth over the past few years was three times higher than America’s. Perhaps having a unified vision and investment strategy has its benefits. The Chinese people are the real winners here and we shouldn’t make moves to hinder this process. Quite to the contrary! Politics notwithstanding, we should encourage nations to strive towards equal purchasing power for all citizens. Countries who are in good positions should help elevate the PPP adjusted GDP of other nations to match their own. Worried about religious fanatism, piracy, and terrorism? Increase the purchasing power of the people in countries where these emerge, and we’ll notice instances of all these drastically diminish. People with a full belly, good education, a proper home, and utilities don’t get themselves blown up in public places! This is true in any nation, for any ethnicity, and for any religious group. I think this is a way of thinking that can help us progress towards a better, more peaceful world. I don’t know about you, but I feel uncomfortable living well here while others who just happened to be born in other countries, still must scrounge for food… in 2019. I don’t think nations should compete to be the top dog in economic stability and wealth. I think nations should cooperate for mutual benefit, lifting each other up for the mutual benefit. The best way we can ensure to have what we need ourselves is to make sure others around the globe have what they need too. Our world has never been more interconnected. We should wise up and act like it is. If in time, we reach a point where most people of the world have similar purchasing power, the United States of America will sit pretty in 3rd position behind China and India. That’s not such a bad position to be in. Originally published at www.datadriveninvestor.com on September 20, 2019."
Medium.com,Society,Middle Eastern Conflicts: Iran’s Economic Dismay,World,https://medium.com/@harryb16725/middle-eastern-conflicts-irans-economic-dismay-aa85618bdc13?source=topic_page---------555------------------1," Trump continues to press sanctions on the Iranian economy as tensions escalate further in the Middle East. Iran are being subjected to what is referred as “economic terrorism”. Tensions in the Middle East have continually escalated in recent months, with the U.S., Saudi Arabia and Iran being central to the conflicts. Upon this stems global concerns regarding an outbreak of potential warfare, creating further uncertainty in today’s volatile economic conditions. Both the U.S. and Iran dedicate a large amount of funding towards their military and national security, hence escalated conflicts could prove catastrophic. Where has this stemmed from? A brief history of Iranian conflicts. Iran’s conflicts with the Western world stem back from the U.K’s involvement in the extraction of Iranian crude oil in 1914. Iran’s thwarted availability of machinery created difficulties in accessing its country’s oil reserves. Anglo-Persian oil (now, British Petroleum) stepped in to assist, but claimed right to 51% of all extracted resources, exploiting their position of power. In addition to claiming Iranian oil, the United Kingdom further assisted Reza Shah Pahlavi, a former Iranian army officer, in establishing a monarchy in 1921. He formed part of the Pahlavi dynasty, known for it’s autocratic nature and focus on westernisation. It’s disregard for religious and democratic measures is what partly drove the Iranian revolution, which I’ll come on to. He was succeeded by his son, Mohammed Reza Pahlavi, in 1941. Come 1951, amid a struggle for power, Mohammed Mosaddegh was appointed premier by Mohammad Reza Pahlavi, following Mosaddegh’s surge in popularity from nationalising the Iranian oil industry. Mr Mosaddegh was very much opposed to the amount of oil being handed over to Western economies. However, what followed was an embargo imposed jointly by the American CIA and British SIS, which severely halted Iranian exports of crude. They further organised a coup d’état to overthrow Mr Mosaddegh, which ultimately succeeded, seeing the PM lose his position of power. Mohammed Reza Pahlavi re-assumed his position of Shah in 1953. Mohammed Reza Pahlavi proceeded to take Iran into a period of strong economic stability. His ‘White Revolution’ (1963) saw drastic increases in schooling standards; industrial expansion and women’s rights. The economy was booming, and oil revenues reached around $20bn. However, extreme conservatives began to rebel against the implementation of these new policies. From 1977-1979, concerns over both wealth equality and democratic authority orchestrated the Iranian Revolution, seeing the Pahlavi dynasty overthrown. It’s important to note that, up until this point, much of the conflicts that had already occurred in Iran in part came down to the involvement of the U.S. and the U.K. From 1980–1988, Iran went to war with Iraq. Notably, the U.S. intervened, assisting Iraq in their endeavours to defeat the Iranian military. There are estimates of over a million casualties throughout the 8 years of conflict. This heightened already existing tensions between Iran and the U.S. To add to the situation, soon after the war finished an Iranian air bus was shot down by an American naval warship in 1988, killing 290 people. The U.S. insisted that it believed the aircraft was an F-14 fighter jet, much to the disbelief of Iranian authorities. Tensions have continued to brew ever since. Bill Clinton placed oil and trade sanctions on Iran in 1995, amidst concerns over uranium enrichment and the development of nuclear weapons. Iran proceeded to halt it’s uranium enrichment programme in 2003, following the crippling of their oil-export-led economy and the need to re-establish revenues sourced from their primary commodity — oil. From 2006–2010, the Bush administration pressed 4 further rounds of sanctions on the Iranian economy, further damaging their economic situation. This was, again, related to the enrichment of uranium. The Iranian economy was suffering, with their currency, the Rial, losing approximately 80% of it’s value in 2012 compared to the dollar. Sanctions previously imposed by the U.S., U.N. and the E.U. ultimately costed Iran more than $160bn in oil revenues from 2012 to 2016 alone. In 2015, president Barack Obama instituted a nuclear deal with Iran, aiming to commence positive relations between the two countries. The deal provided the Iranian economy with over $100bn in assets that had previously been frozen overseas, whilst demanding that the Iranian’s denuclearise their weapons in return. As such, relationships could be built going forwards. With sanctions momentarily waivered, the Iran economy was able to briefly recover. Fast forward to May 8th 2018, and we once again find ourselves taking steps backwards. The Trump administration re-ignited the ongoing feud between Iran and the U.S., pulling out of the 2015 nuclear deal. Mr Trump believed the deal to be insufficient, only limiting Tehran’s ability to enrich uranium until 2025. With all sanctions re-instated at their “highest levels”, several Iranian departments (i.e. trade, scientific research, military etc…) are continuing to struggle. These sanctions have essentially cut Iran out from world oil markets, once again. This has further sparked additional conflicts within the Persian Gulf over the past few months. Key events have included: These are just a select few of the events that have occurred, and it’s likely more conflicts are on the horizon. Iran’s economy is being crippled Recent statistics are highlighting the degree to which Iran is currently struggling. Youth unemployment rates were at 27% at the beginning of Q1 (2019), with rates even higher amongst recent university graduates (40%). This will only worsen as more jobs are disrupted in the aftermath of U.S. sanctions being reinstated. The latest inflation readings indicated that real price levels increased 41.6% in August 2019. However, several economists, including the likes of Professor Steve Hanke (a globally leading economist on inflation) suspects actual levels to be significantly higher. Over the last 12 months; red meat prices are up 57%, milk and eggs are up 37%, and vegetables are up 47%. As a result, the Iranian working class economy is being squeezed from two angles: (a) from a worsening of job opportunities & prospects, and (b) from the rising costs of living. To add salt to the wounds, Iranian oil revenues have fallen over $10bn in the last 12 months. With oil and natural gas resources making up a staggering 82% of the country’s total exports, this statistic is particularly damaging. Is Trump out for war? Further adding to Iranian woes, on Friday 20th of September, Trump announced a new round of additional sanctions on the Iranian Central bank. Former U.S. Treasury official, Elizabeth Rosenberg, has stated that these latest sanctions carry only political ramifications, and the economic effects will be limited. Following both the exit from the nuclear deal and the imposition of the most recent sanctions, additional U.S. military troops have been sent to the Middle East to assist Saudi Arabian forces. Worries of potential warfare between the U.S. and Iran are currently brewing. With the U.S. holding the second largest military in the world, and Iran the 14th, these extreme measures of conflict could be devastating. Following the most recent drone strike in Saudi Arabia, Mr Trump tweet claimed the U.S. were “locked and loaded” — a particularly unsettling statement. However, in saying this, Trump did later claim that war was not what he sought, stating “we would certainly like to avoid it”. War would be detrimental on a global scale, particularly due to the development of nuclear weapons over the previous few decades. With Iran also being closely allied with both Russia and China, it’s uncertain how third parties would react to such events.

Medium.com,Society,Globalists vs. Patriots at the UN: A ‘Great Fracture’ Revealed,World,https://medium.com/@PassBlue2016/globalists-vs-patriots-at-the-un-a-great-fracture-revealed-5262c36de144?source=topic_page---------556------------------1," by Stephanie Fillion. This article originally appealed on PassBlue. After most of the world leaders spent a day teaming up to fight climate change at the Climate Action Summit, the next day strongmen opened the high-level debate of the United Nations General Assembly, showing a growing split between nationalist and globalist leaders. “I fear the possibility of a great fracture,” UN Secretary-General António Guterres said in his speech, the first to speak on Sept. 24. While Guterres was referring to the United States-China divide, the greatest split ended up being between patriots and multilateralists in the debate of dozens of national leaders. President Trump and President Bolsonaro While their attitudes differed — the speech by President Jair Bolsonaro of Brazil was energetic and aggressive while President Trump’s tone was strangely subdued — the two men’s speeches had much in common: they talked about the threat of socialism around the world, appealed to a religious audience (predominately Christian) and attacked nongovernmental organizations and the media. The similarities between the two speeches is probably no coincidence, as Bolsonaro apparently got advice from Steve Bannon, Trump’s former campaign adviser and a nationalist, while Brazil’s foreign minister was visiting Washington, D.C., a few weeks ago, according to Brazilian media reports. Bolsonaro knew what the world wanted to hear from him at the General Assembly: the Amazon. He went straight to the point, reaffirming his intent to develop the world’s largest rainforest and accusing the international community of nations and civil society groups of wanting to keep indigenous people in Brazil as “cavemen.” He also accused international media of lying when reporting on the rainforest. By supporting economic development in Brazil’s portion of the Amazon, Bolsonaro also warned his audience of the dangers of socialism, using Venezuela as an example of a failed socialist state. Bolsonaro’s speech also appealed to Christians in Brazil by referring to God several times, even quoting the New Testament. While Bolsonaro claims that most indigenous people in Brazil agree with his policy of development in the Amazon, an indigenous coalition are bringing a case to the International Criminal Court against him for climate genocide. Trump’s speech echoed similar ideas and passions, as he spoke second, right after Bolsonaro. Trump also talked about the dangers of socialism, a political ideology increasingly popular with certain Democrats in the US, saying that “socialism only works for the ruling class.” He also called Venezuela’s President Nicolás Maduro a “Cuban puppet.” (The US just revoked visas of several diplomats from the Cuban mission to the UN.) Unsurprisingly, Trump told the world that what he cares the most about is his own citizens, adding that other countries should do the same: “The future does not belong to globalists. The future belongs to patriots,” he said. While Trump’s speech tracked his customary nationalistic and patriotic rhetoric that he has been repeating annually at the UN debate, this year’s stood out for the little enthusiasm shown by the Americans sitting in the US seats in the General Assembly, while Trump read on. Images of US Secretary of Commerce Wilbur Ross appeared to reveal him asleep. Meanwhile, photos of a Venezuelan representative sitting in her country’s section showed her reading a book. On Twitter, several people wrote that it was “Bolivar, heroe, genio y pensamiento universal,” or “Bolivar, hero, genius and universal thought.” The Venezuelan diplomat reading during Trump’s speech in the UN General Assembly. The rather refined writing of Trump’s speech also stood out, especially compared to his speeches in the previous two years. He even used a poetic turn, saying, for example, “America’s goal is not to go with these endless wars, wars that never end.” Could Trump’s remarkably subdued tone be explained by the fact that he knew that the House of Representatives would announce an impeachment inquiry against him at the end of the day? But Trump did not leave his electorate base disappointed. His tone on immigration was severe and, like Bolsonaro, he accused nongovernmental organizations of interfering in the internal affairs of the US and promoting human smuggling, especially at the US-Mexican border. He warned: “Do not pay the smugglers, the coyotes, do not put yourself or your children in danger. You will not make it here or be released into our country.” He also maintained his threats toward his current biggest enemy, Iran. While talking about US military power, he added: “Hopefully it will not have to use this power. Others seek conquest and domination, our nation must be strong in wealth, might and spirit.” A topic that did not come up much in his speech? The United Nations. Possibly because the US owes $1.05 billion in dues to the UN regular budget and $2.38 billion to the peacekeeping budget. Turkey in the Middle Recep Tayyip Erdogan, the president of Turkey, stood out for the calm, modest tone of his speech, addressing directly issues that he cares about. While Erdogan does not fit neatly in the globalist or populist camps, his speech fell into the middle. He also attracted attention for his extensive use of illustrations, one showing different maps of Israel from 1948 to today, asking where are the borders of the country. The overarching theme of his speech was injustice and inequality, topics that he has curiously used to compare obesity rates in rich countries with hunger in other parts of the world. Migrants and refugees were at the center of his speech, reminding the audience that Turkey has taken in the highest number of Syrian refugees since the war began there. Erdogan asked the world to find a plan to help them return home and asked for an expanded “safe zone” in northern Syria. He took out a picture of Aylan Kurdi, the Syrian toddler refugee whose photo of him washed ashore on a Mediterranean beach in 2015 triggered a worldwide wave of sympathy. While being a controversial figure at home from having weakened the rule of law after the failed 2016 coup, Erdogan acted as a peacemaker in front of the international leadersat the UN. By doing so, his speech embodied vast contradictions between his domestic and foreign policies. While some people think of him as having dictatorial tendencies and oppressing Kurdish minorities at home, Erdogan preached tolerance abroad. He denounced the Christchurch attacks against a mosque in New Zealand this year but also other attacks against Christians and Jews. Erdogan also warned the world of the dangers of populism, creating what he called the marginalization of minorities, especially Muslims in the Western world, and intolerance toward refugees and migrants. Instead, he asked for more “inclusive and tolerant public rhetoric.” Macron: The New Napoleon Macron, trying to impersonate a Napoleonesque figure on the world scene, has plunged himself into bringing conflicting parties to talk to each other. Stepping up as the world’s defender of multilateralism and the Amazon, Macron seized the spotlight to speak of finding peace through a new type of multilateralism. “I don’t believe in miracles,” he told the General Assembly, “but I believe we need courage to bring peace.” Courage, he said, is required in two areas: making peace and taking responsibility. Macron even directly addressed Trump’s nationalistic speech at the UN, saying, “Go back to what Trump said this morning, I don’t believe the crisis that we are experiencing can be resolved by turning inward.” His wife, Brigitte, attended his speech, and Macron left New York Tuesday evening. France’s foreign minister, Jean-Yves Le Drian, is taking over for the rest of the week, hosting meetings on the Sahel region in West Africa on Sept. 25 and, with Germany, on multilateralism on Sept. 26. UN Insider PassBlue had access to heads of state and government who attended the annual General Assembly luncheon, hosted by Secretary-General Guterres. India’s Narendra Modi was spotted entering the room, mingling and shaking hands, while his Pakistani counterpart, Imran Khan, looked uncomfortable and restrained, sitting at his table quietly. One thing is sure: They did not want to talk to each other. Meanwhile, Trump showed up with Vice President Pence and his new ambassador to the UN, Kelly Knight Craft. Trump sat next to Guterres and not far from Chancellor Merkel. Pence mingled and sat with mostly African leaders, including the president of the General Assembly, Tijjani Muhammad. Trump’s table included Jacinda Ardern of New Zealand, Andrzej Duda of Poland, Sahle-Work Zewde of Ethiopia and Abdel Fattah el-Sisi of Egypt. El-Sisi, for his part, was spending a lot of time talking to Italy’s newly re-appointed prime minister, Giuseppe Conte, at the luncheon. There’s one issue that the two countries definitely both care about: Libya. El-Sisi has asked international actors to stop interfering in the country; while Conte, who talked at the end of the night at the UN General Assembly, asked Trump for help in the country. So Conte and el-Sisi may have discussed Libya. But they could have talked about the great lasagna they had a few days ago. Who knows! This article was updated."

This will be the last article in the chapter; then, we will start discussing the concept of empire through the ages. Story and narrative will begin to figure in here, as well. Moving forward we’ll take on a new approach, one that is more accessible, less dry, and combines information with a more creative style. While maintaining scholarly analysis and sound research practices, I also want to help make the information I present here more tangible and real, by invoking artistry and beauty. First, a quick recap. What have we discussed here so far? We started by questioning the lofty ideals of our modern governments (specifically, the US government). We say we live in a democracy; does that hold up to the light of truth? We haven’t answered that question yet, and it might be awhile before we do, but that’s something we will work our way back to. Then, we zoomed out to look at the concept of government as a whole. What exactly is government, anyway? Where did it come from? I kind of skimmed over the philosophy of government a bit(that’s something else we’ll look at in depth later), but we saw some evidence that the state emerged as a result of social caging and power inequality. It does not appear to have been intentionally devised as a solution to crime or social disorder, despite what many people would tell you today. The first key takeaway is that civilization — and with it enduring, institutionalized government — developed independently in only a few places around the globe — specifically, places where people couldn’t escape from it. It was not a natural solution to worldwide problems of social conflict, because in most places around the globe, populations were so sparse and flexible that most social conflict could be solved simply through further dispersion. Neither was it a linear progression of human development or “evolution”. It was rather, as Michael Mann argues, more or less an accident of ecology. The first key takeaway is that civilization — and with it enduring, institutionalized government — developed independently in only a few places around the globe — specifically, places where people couldn’t escape from it. Furthermore, this ecological-accident-turned-institution relied on power inequality to survive. Like feed to a work animal or gasoline to an engine, power inequality is the food and fuel of civilization and the state. Early humans and modern hunter-gatherers produce(d) little, if any, surplus. Even subsistence farming communities and herdsmen produce(d) food mostly for their families. Their work hours tally accordingly. But once you free up a segment of your population to function as bureaucrats, soldiers and managers, the remaining labor force has to produce enough surplus to keep them fed. Inequality is built into the system. It’s a feature, not a bug. That’s the second key takeaway. Like feed to a work animal or gasoline to an engine, power inequality is the food and fuel of civilization and the state. Inequality is built into the system. That’s the second key takeaway. These takeaways have some implications, which we’ll discuss in the future. But before we move on to our next “chapter”, I want to hit one final subject regarding the emergence of civilization and government: the relationship between the barbarian and the state. Sometime between 4000 and 3000 BCE, the first civilizations came into being. By around 2500, we start to see conquering kings attempting to amass territory and expand their selection of labor and resources. It is here that we stand now, gazing on men like Sargon of Akkad, the first known empire-builder (1). But what happened to those who continued to live in the old ways? What happened to hunter-gatherers, herding nomads and subsistence farmers, people who could not be seduced by the glitzy alluvial cities that were rising up out of the sand? What became of the ones who avoided the social cage, the unprecedented inequality and coercion, and lived on the outskirts of the civilized world? It’s a complicated story, and there isn’t just one answer. Obviously, once civilization emerged, not everyone ran immediately to join the ranks of the city-dwellers. As I’ve discussed earlier, there were many reasons why a “barbarian” would wish to avoid the early city — despite what your history textbooks might have told you. In fact, there is much evidence to the contrary: it seems that urban-dwellers frequently tried to escape the city-state and return to a life of semi-nomadic farming, herding or foraging. There were many “defectors” — as there still are today in places like China, where remaining indigenous populations have been (often forcibly) settled and integrated into the modern world. But today the civilized state has sprawled its tentacles into nearly every corner of the globe. Back then, civilization was still an anomaly, and emerging city-states typically faced an unwieldy frontier of barbarian peoples. The early state looked upon these resistors with suspicion. On a symbolic level, they were relics of an earlier time. The narrative of linear progress was already in motion; barbarians represented an immoral, undeveloped past. On a tangible level, they were a physical threat, as well. Nomads and foragers — not generally bound to raise a surplus for themselves — saw the surpluses of the city and realized they could raid and pillage others’ hard labor for profit. Many of them turned to “raiding and trading” — pillaging a city here, and selling the goods for profit elsewhere — or charging “protection rent” for the safe usage of waterways and other transportation routes. On the other hand, nomads on the outskirts could make great allies and resources for local rulers. They were recruited as defenders and soldiers, paid to provide a buffer zone between a city and outside invaders. They could also make great trading partners. And finally, they could be recruited as seasonal laborers or captured and put to work as slaves. Even though many barbarians resisted the city, some did civilize intentionally, either for economic opportunities or because their foraging land was destroyed by urban encroachment or regional climate changes. So while the relationship between the nomad and the emerging state was stereotypically hostile, the true story is nuanced. Let’s take a look at some examples. The first writing was not literature or history. Writing was developed, first and foremost, as an accounting system for the temples — the managerial, ceremonial and organizational institutions that presaged government. But some of the first recorded epics of literature are creation myths and epics that justify the rulership of a founding king. These epics and creation myths, like any other, provide a framework through which to orient oneself in the surrounding world. They establish pantheons of important gods, explain how the world came to be the way it is, and paint a picture of what is moral and sacred in the universe. Barbarians and nomadic tribes are commonly described as the antithesis of pious living. They are considered races from a time past. The Sumerian Curse of Agade describes a nomadic hill-people, The Gutians, as “a people who know no order/permanent settlement” (2/3). They were raiders, sent down from the mountains by the god Enlil as punishment on the city-dwellers. They were reportedly “made like humans but with the brains of dogs, the shapes of apes” (2). Another translation reads that they have “human feelings/way of thinking but with the instincts of a dog, body shape like that of a monkey” (3). Though they are clearly human to the city-dwellers, they are considered anathema because they refuse to settle down and they let their animal instincts run wild. They invoke aspects of lower beings or a prior evolutionary stage, at least in the eyes of those who have been tamed by civilization. The Amorites are another famous race of nomadic raiders, known and feared as the “Martu” or “Mardu” by the people of Uruk, who described them thus: “The Amorites (MAR.TU) who know no grain…no house nor town, the boors of the mountains. The Amorite who digs up truffles…who does not bend his knees (to cultivate the land), who eats raw meat, who has no house during his lifetime, who is not buried after his death.” (4) These themes — animalistic features, eating raw meat, and lacking burial practices — are particularly common in ancient diatribes against the barbarian nomad. As far forward as the 17th-century, a Chinese text compares the Lahu people of Yunnan — a hunting and gathering tribe — to apes and monkeys, claiming they ate everything raw and did not bury their dead. In Qing China, the general Ortai was even more direct in equating civilization with a general morality: he described the hill people of Yunnan as “barbarian nomads who were the antithesis of civilized ideals” (5). Later on in history, states in Thailand developed a distinctive cultural hierarchy associating elevation with one’s level of civilization; the higher in the hills you lived, the lower your status on the ladder, and the less “civilized” you were considered to be. Linguistics still reflects this hierarchy to this day in Burma, as James C. Scott notes: “Thus to go to the capital city or to school is generally to ‘go up’ or ‘climb’ or ‘rise’ (téq — တက်). Even if one lives on a mountaintop, one still goes ‘up’ to Mandalay. Similarly, when one goes to rural villages or to the hills, one goes ‘down’ or ‘descends’ (s’in — ဆင်း), even if the place in question is thousands of feet above the capital in altitude.” (6) A “civilized” way of life isn’t simply an urban, sedentary one. In the eyes of city-dwelling locals, there is a cultural morality that distinguishes the “raw” human from the “cooked” one (an actual Chinese term for the civilized [6]). According to Richard O’Connor, nomadic peoples trying to take up wet rice cultivation in Thailand find that the “acceptable” way requires an integration with local Thai religious and cultural rituals. In other words, agriculture is tied to morality and ideology in the eyes of locals. In order to be accepted, hill-peoples are expected to give up their own cultural practices in favor of those that are considered to be civilized. Humans love to delineate the moral Self from the abominable Other. The Other is given the qualities of a beast, a half-evolved or defective human, or they symbolize a regression into the underworld. Usually, it’s because we perceive the Other as a threat to our psyche or our way of life. And barbarians frequently stepped onstage to play the roles that had been handed to them. We’re talking specifically about pastoral nomads. William Irons argues that military expertise was a form of “cultural capital” among pastoralists in the ancient Middle East. Livestock, he argues, are easy assets to steal, so raiding one’s neighbors became part of a nomadic herder’s culture. He writes: “This pattern of raiding had the effect of giving the young men of each tribe military training. They all became skilled at planning and executing small-scale military activities. The basic skills of cavalrymen were thus part of growing up among politically independent tribal groups in the arid zone of the Old World. This made it possible for tribal leaders to call on skilled cavalry for military operations for time to time.” (7) This cultural phenomenon of commonplace military training gave pastoralists an advantage over their civilian counterparts. And the city would have made an attractive target. Central, permanent storehouses, navigable rivers, and widely-used trade roads concentrated desirable assets and made them vulnerable to attack. Sir Barry Cunliffe argues that over time, nomads coexisting and competing on the Eurasian steppes created a culture of raiding, warfare and mercenary alliances with local city-states and civilizations. They shifted away from breeding domestic animals like sheep and goats, turning their attention to professional raiding and military contracts. Their new asset and weapon was the horse — an animal that revolutionized warfare, and drastically increased their mobility. In the Curse of Agade, the Gutians weren’t simply scorned as uncivilized relics of the past. They were conquerors, a threat to Sumerian survival and order. They “scoured the land” “like a plague of locusts”, raiding and ruling with violence (2, 3). Peeter Espak believes it’s probable that Uruk and other Sumerian states were forced to pay tribute to the conquering rulers, who thereafter established a dynasty. A victory inscription describes the battle of Urukian king Utu-hegal against the Gutian king Tirigan, who blocked roads and refused to open irrigation canals. This seems to imply that perhaps a tariff or tribute had gone unpaid. The inscription reads: “The hostile forces covered the land.
Tirigan, king of the Gutians,
blocked the openings of the irrigation canals, no-one was opposing him.
On the both sides of the Tigris sat (with his forces).
In southern regions of Sumer, blocked the water for the fields.
In northern regions, blocked the pathways.
The roads of the land grew (only) bush.” According to Espak: “The retaliatory actions of Tirigan might have been triggered, for example, by the fact that Utu-hegal had not fulfilled the demands for some sort of reparation or payment to the Gutians and had decided to break the superimposed vassal status.” We get further confirmation of this in another rebel account of the battle against Tirigan, attributed to Ur-Namma, a military leader or ruler of Ur: “Since I have been touched by [the new] rulership –
there is no more taxing of my huge harvest raising itself high!
My orders in the great fortress of the mountains are joyfully followed (?)
I am pleased with the joy (felt) in my city and in the (whole)territory of Sumer
I (re)released water to canals of Sumer and trees are growing tall on their banks!” The Amorites were another nomadic “periphery” people who posed a threat to the Sumerian state. In fact, one of the world’s first border walls was constructed to keep them out of the city of Uruk. It was first mentioned in the text Lugalbanda and the Anzud Bird, but later was extended and fortified by the king Shu-Sin over a distance of probably about 170 miles (8). In fact, most of the world’s first border walls were built not to keep out citizens of other countries, but to keep out raiding pastoralists. The Great Wall of China, probably the most famous border wall of all time, is one of these: it began as a series of smaller walls constructed during China’s Warring States period; then, in the 200s BCE, the Qin Dynasty began to consolidate them into a single fortified border along the frontier with the Xiongnu nomads of the north. The wall, however, didn’t reach its final form until around the 14th century CE (9). Around 1000 BCE, the Eurasian steppes flourished with federations of highly-organized pastoral nomads. On horseback, they covered huge distances, spreading their culture and uniting tribes into larger groups that eventually became their own empires. Sir Barry Cunliffe explains why the culture of the steppes spread so rapidly, and in such an integrated way: “The very broad similarity of culture over a vast area of steppe, forest-steppe, and semi-desert during the Late Bronze Age was the result of many interacting factors: an increase in population bringing people into more regular contact, a degree of mobility conditioned by a pastoral economy, and complex networks of connectivity allowing copper and copper products to be distributed far and wide. These factors created a zone of cultural interactivity allowing ideas, belief systems, and behaviour patterns to be shared across the western and eastern steppe to a degree never before seen.” Empires and city-states that bordered the steppe regions, from Asia all the way into Europe, found a double-edged sword lurking in the shadow of their neighbors. On the one hand, as we’ve seen, the mobile and combat-ready barbarians posed a threat to the sedentary state, with its centrally-stored resources. Walls and fortifications were built to keep them at bay, and governments sometimes paid them off with tribute offerings. But these sleek, professional warriors also made powerful allies. Governments could hire local horse nomads to raid and pillage their enemies, contracting them as mercenaries. The steppe-dwelling Scythians, for example, allied with the Medes and Babylonians in the 600s to bring down the Assyrian empire (9). Governments also made pacts with nearby tribes of nomads, exchanging goods and services or marrying into one another’s families to maintain peaceful relations. Around the 3rd century BCE in China, the Xiongnu people waged war against the Han empire. After years of brutal conflict, the Han emperor was forced to acknowledge the Xiongnu federation as its own sovereign power. He implemented a policy of diplomatic exchange between the two nations: “The policy had four elements: transfers of Chinese products desired by the nomads; a Han princess given in marriage to the chanyu[the Xiongnu supreme leader]; the ranking of Han and Xiongnu as equal states; and the establishment of the Great Wall as a boundary between the two. In 162 BC a treaty assigned the chanyu rule over the “archers” north of the Great Wall and the Han emperor dominion over the settled people to the south.” (10) Barbarian peoples frequently traded with and between neighboring states. We see evidence of this from the 1200s BCE onward in China, when we start to find chariots, bronze mirrors, curved knives decorated with animal imagery and other tools developed by nomadic horseback peoples entering urban areas. In turn, Chinese-cast bronze helmets began to appear at the burial sites on the steppes, showing that there was a two-way exchange between the nomads and city-dwelling elites (9). The chariot, a nomad invention, revolutionized warfare between city-states and empires. And Greek colonies in the fourth millennium were flourishing trading hubs between the Greek world and the Scythian tribes; Cunliffe tells us the principal exports from the steppes were grain, furs and slaves, while the Greeks exchanged wine, oil, and durables like pottery. William Irons uses a modern tribe, the Yomut, as an example of how ancient barbarians would have interfaced with the cultures around them. The Yomut used their capacity for military organization to raid neighbors and collect tribute; but state officials also hired them to attack enemy states instead of themselves, and agreed to grant them independence in exchange for supplying trained soldiers. Irons writes: “Various Turkmen groups were at times allied with the Khans of Khiva or Bukhara in this way against Persia to their south. There were many permutations on what these tribal groups could do with their military prowess. They could maintain their independence from state control and thus avoid taxation and conscription, raid neighbors, collect tribute and serve in effect as mercenaries.” But the barbarian mercenaries could prove to be fickle allies, in the end, turning around to pillage when they felt it would profit them. Contracting states quickly became suspicious and aggressive towards their nomadic partners. In the 500s BCE King Darius of Egypt campaigned against both the Saka nomads between the Caspian and Aral seas, as well as against the Scythians, annexing their territory and driving them back into the steppes (9). And the various pacts that Chinese rulers made with the Xiongnu usually fell apart, encouraging China to push its frontiers inward and extend the fortifications that would later become the Great Wall. Once the Gutians were defeated, the hymn of Ur-Namma tells us they were “put in bloody chains” and enslaved. Likewise, pre-emptive conquest of the barbarian hinterland was an obvious way to quell the threats that lurked therein, as well as to add more territory to one’s empire. Oppenheim writes: “The most effective remedy against these potentially dangerous elements were projects of internal and frontier colonization which only a powerful king could set afoot. The inscriptions of such kings speak triumphantly of the ingathering (puḫḫuru) of the scattered, the resettling ( ŝūŝubu) of the shiftless on new land, where the king forced them to dig or re-dig canals, build or resettle cities, and till the soil, pay taxes, do corvée work to maintain the irrigation system, and — last but not least — perform military service.” (12) Just like the fully-fledged nationstates of today, the emerging, ancient city-state saw the world in terms of its own preservation and expansion. Conquering the hinterlands meant expanding the total acreage of productive land; conquering the people who lived on it meant appropriating more taxes, surplus and labor. In the eyes of the state, a nomad’s territory is “unused space”, waiting to be mined and irrigated; the nomad themselves is, at worst, a threat, and at best illegible. James C. Scott writes a lot on this subject — namely, how states try to appropriate the ungoverned people (and lands) on their peripheries as productive assets. This is an ancient practice that has continued up to the modern age. According to Scott, raiding the hills for barbarian slaves was one way to turn illegible, “unproductive” people into resources useful to the state institution. He writes of empires in early modern Asia: “The widespread resistance of stateless peoples led directly to what might be called the golden age of slavery along the littoral of the Atlantic and Indian Oceans and in Southeast Asia. From the perspective adopted here, populations were forcibly removed en masse from settings where their production and labor were illegible and inappropriable and were relocated in colonies and plantations where they could be made to grow cash crops (tea, cotton, sugar, indigo, coffee) which might contribute to the profits of landowners and the fiscal power of the state.” Of course, nomad tribes often sold their rivals into slavery, as well. They were well-known wheelers and dealers in slaves. Greeks tell us the Royal Scythians, “the bravest of the Scythian tribe […] look upon other tribes as their slaves” (and we already know they were selling them, too). According to the Shiji, a Chinese history compiled and finished around 94 BCE, the Xiongnu also captured and enslaved their enemies (9). And Strabo, a Greek geographer and historian from the first century BCE, lists the exports around Tanis as “slaves, hides, and ‘other such things as nomads possess’”. So the story is more than a matter of just “barbarians vs. the state”. Which leads us to our last point… The line between “nomad” or “barbarian” and “civilized” was not always a clean one. Some nomads found opportunity settling within the walls of the city-state; some urbanites fled to forge new lives in the hinterlands. Trade, pillaging and intermarriage mingled cultural practices, genes and identities. Exchange and labor opportunities drew nomads towards the civilized core and influenced the true extent of their mobility. The state and nomads began to rely on one another economically. Anne Porter suggests that the rise of the temple state in Uruk was connected to mobile pastoralism, based on the importance of textile manufacture(sheep wool) and the appearance of animal-based art in the temple (along with other hallmarks of herders and nomads). She argues that emerging spiritual ideologies and ritual practices likely served the goals of the emerging state, both supporting the nomadic practices that sustained the local economy and simultaneously keeping nomads within grasp. She writes: “If the economy of the city is predicated on the production of textiles, and that production is accomplished through mobile pastoralism in one form or another and practiced by households, then the city will not only maintain a number of different mechanisms to ensure control of mobile pastoralism and those who practice it, but will also actively support it. The outcome of this support will be highly integrative […] and it will have an impact upon the nature of the city itself as it creates the structures and practices that allow it to offer that support. The power of the temple evident in southern Mesopotamia in the early third millennium, its dependence on textile production and coteries of attached personnel, all may be seen as a result of its role in maintaining the rootedness of mobile groups in their original communities.” With rootedness comes a changing sense of cultural identity. Over time, nomads hovering near the core picked up ritual practices, ideologies and customs of the civilized locals (and vice versa). When Herodotus visited the colony of Olbia (located in modern-day Ukraine) in the mid-fifth century, he wrote about the mixture of Greek and Scythian cultures that happened as the two traded and interfaced. He called the nomadic tribes living on the outskirts of Olbia culturally “Graeco-Scythian” (9). The rhetoric of history books tends to emphasize a sharp line between the nomadic people on the frontiers, and the “civilized” people in the urban centers. It’s exciting. It’s dramatic. And more importantly, it’s what was left behind. The Great Wall of China kept out the Xiongnu. The ancient Sumerians wrote about their dread for the invading Amorites. These clashes and conflicts spurred fortresses and monuments, epic literature accounts and victory stelae. But the reality on the ground was far more fluid: people often moved between the urban sphere and the periphery, adapting to new opportunities, fleeing persecution, or trying their hand at new ways of making a living. The urbanites fled the city, too. In the Akkadian empire there are accounts of the citizenry fleeing involuntary servitude or harsh living and working conditions (2). Just as many slaves were taken from the nomadic tribes and hunter-gatherers of the state’s periphery, slaves and indentured servants from the civilized core often fled to the hills. People ran away from debt. They ran away from civil judgment. Even the Russian Cossacks of the 1700s, a famous and feared group of steppe-dwelling nomads, started as runaway serfs from all over European Russia (6). And just as the state feared the nomad, so were some of history’s first emperor-kings former nomads themselves. Pastoralist warriors, taking control of a city-state in a raid, might establish themselves as the new rulers — just as the Gutians had done in Uruk. Sargon of Akkad supposedly had pastoralist roots. Likewise, Zimri-Lim, a king of Mari, came from a nomadic tribe. While many of his kin were undoubtedly pastoralists, Anne Porter suggests that some of his ancestors might have been involved in the previous administration of the city as well. From their letters and administrative records, it seems that Zimri-Lim and his ruling family had kinship ties to a variety of ethnic groups, some nomadic and others sedentary. Their sense of identity and allegiance reflected this (11). Throughout years of conflict, punctuated by the occasional peace arrangement, the balance of power shifted many times, and arranged marriages such as those between the Xiongnu and the Han mixed bloodlines and interconnected families. Even the government’s ruling style shifted to reflect the cultural influence of pastoral conquerors: as David Priestland points out, the kinship-based, autocratic, warrior ideology of some of the early military empires reflected the tribal organization of raiding nomads. People like to draw strong boundaries on paper between the Self and the Other. They like to portray themselves as moral, their own lifestyles as the correct or “blessed” way of living, and those who oppose them or differ as cursed, evil and backwards. But the realities are usually a lot more nuanced. And so it was with early civilization. There was certainly conflict between the organized state and the ungoverned nomad on its frontiers; stone walls and fortresses that still stand formidably today were erected to separate the two. But despite the fact that they’re still standing, they didn’t succeed. In the end, the lines were a pretension. Symbiosis — and even the conflict itself — wove complex threads of interconnection between the newly-civilized and the people of the hinterlands. The nomad resisted empire, and then it became empire; and vice versa. Nevertheless, the frontier continues to exist today. And, as we’ve seen, it’s a dynamic place to study relationships of culture and power. We’ll keep coming back to these frontiers, and to the nomad and its ilk throughout history; but for now, we’re going to switch gears to focus on the concept of empire."
Medium.com,Society,"The life and outlook of Sigmund Jähn, Germany’s first man in space",World,https://medium.com/@alexking300/the-life-and-outlook-of-sigmund-j%C3%A4hn-germanys-first-man-in-space-e0c1ad2b2895?source=topic_page---------559------------------1," On 26 August, 1978, East Germans woke up to the headline banded across a special edition of Neues Deutschland: “Der erste Deutscher im All” — the first German in space. Travelling alongside Russian Valery Bykovsky as part of the Soviet Union’s Interkosmos programme, Sigmund Jähn the cosmonaut spent almost eight days orbiting the Earth. He took photographs of all countries of the world on an East German Karl Zeiss MKF-6M multispectral camera, pioneering the photographic technique. Transformed into a celebrity overnight, Jähn became a heroic figure for the people of East Germany, for decades overshadowed by the West. The East German government showcased his achievement as evidence of the communist state’s superiority over capitalist West Germany. Upon his return, he was awarded the title Hero of the Soviet Union. One man came to embody the transformation of a small communist state, totemic of Brezhnevite totalitarianism, into a torchbearer of human advance. Jähn’s passing away last weekend seemed to register only moderately in the international press, far from what one would expect for thinks the first countryman into space. One of Yuri Gagarin or Neil Armstrong, and the press the death of those pioneering astronauts would generate — clearly Jähn does not possess this kind of celebrity status. Indeed, for a country which possesses such a healthy Erinnerungskultur (‘culture of remembrance’), Jähn’s lack of position in Germany’s imagination of itself is conspicuous by its near total absence. In the 2003 film Good Bye Lenin! there is a scene where Christiane Kerner, a committed communist ailing from a recently sustained heart attack, makes her way out of her flat in central Berlin into the street, unsupervised by her children who have been shielding her from the reality of the post-Mauerfall world. There, she sees a helicopter dragging an immense status of Vladimir Lenin through the air as it is taken off somewhere, presumably to the scrapheap of history. The scene brilliantly illuminates the bewildering disorientation experienced by those former East Germans whose national heroes were discarded and forgotten forever. That’s apparently what it feels like for Sigmund Jähn as well. “When countries cease to exist,” Jana Hensel wrote in an interview with Jähn for Die Zeit newspaper last year, “it is often their heroes that disappear first. The good ones and the bad ones.” This seems to have affected Jähn in some way, as Hensel observes. There was little yearning for celebrity today. It seems that Jähn came to realise all too well the politics of memory, the ideological contingency of monumentalisation. But this did not deter the former cosmonaut from teaching and nurturing the next generation of German space explorers. Far from retreating from public service after reunification in 1990, Jähn continued to work as a freelance consultant for the German Aerospace Centre and from 1993 also for the European Space Agency (ESA) to prepare for the Euromir missions. He remained a mentor of Alexander Gerst, one of Germany’s most prominent astronauts and geophysicists, for the remainder of his life. Jähn’s ideological openness stemmed from his time in space back in 1978. Originally instructed to take photos of the German Democratic Republic (GDR), Jähn took photos of other countries. There are no countries in space; one’s curiosity and appreciation can peruse beyond borders. Jähn’s position as an intermediary between the former East and West, the bridge-builder, seemed to be borne out of his philosophical dispositions gained from cosmonaut exploration. This outlook is hinted at by Wolfgang Becker in Good Bye Lenin!. Towards the end of the film, Alex Kerner, Christiane’s son, attempts to dupe his ailing mother that Jähn is now head of the GDR and has opened the borders to the West as a way to help his mother come to the terms with the fact that no border exists between the two Germanies. A Jähn-lookalike announces the Wall has fallen. “Socialism does not mean walling oneself in,” he reasons. “Socialism means reaching out to others, to live with others. Not only of dreaming of a better world, but making it true.” The scene is poignant because it materialises as Alex’s ideological idealisation of the GDR, a country he believed could have been ultimately good in its aims but practically unjust. Perhaps this explains why Jähn failed to retain his status as a national hero of Germany. But it is perhaps ironic for a man who first envisioned that very country’s holistic reunification."
Medium.com,Society,International movement for recognition and preservation of indigenous languages,World,https://medium.com/wikitongues/international-movement-for-recognition-and-preservation-of-indigenous-languages-149f269a0042?source=topic_page---------560------------------1," Over the past few decades, Indigenous peoples of the world have made a huge leap in the protection of their individual and collective rights. Persistence of the leaders of the Indigenous peoples movement has allowed to begin to overcome the legacy of colonization and gradually come to recognize the responsibility of the international community for the most vulnerable of its members, who thanks to their proximity to nature and traditional knowledge, have preserved and taken care of the cultural and natural diversity of the planet for many centuries. Today, it is the turn of humanity to help Indigenous communities preserve their identities, health of their languages, and their ways of life. The Charter of the United Nations starts with the words “We the peoples of the United Nations determined…”, acknowledging that all peoples on Earth should be equal. Indigenous peoples over centuries had been put in a disadvantaged position and have become vulnerable. Only recently in history has the international community started to recognize the severe consequences of colonization and assimilation policies. And only recently has it decided to move towards reconciliation with and remedy for indigenous communities around the globe. The United Nations plays an important role in this process. Role of the UN Expert Mechanism on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples The UN mechanism in which I was a part of from 2013 to 2019, The Expert Mechanism on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples (EMRIP), is the youngest mechanism among indigenous-specific mechanisms of the United Nations family, but many Indigenous communities already bind their hopes with this body. EMRIP explicitly owes its birth to the adoption of the United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples in 2007. When the drafting and negotiation process by the Working Group on Indigenous Population successfully finished, states and Indigenous peoples were in need of other types of services. It was a strategic decision by states to establish the Expert Mechanism to assist them in achieving the ends of the Declaration, protection and fulfillment of the rights of indigenous peoples, by providing expertise, and advising through thematic studies and research. Comprised of seven Indigenous experts from different socio-cultural regions and areas of knowledge, EMRIP in collaboration with other sister-mechanisms — the Special Rapporteur on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples and the Permanent Forum on Indigenous Issues — is qualified to advance states’ understanding of their human rights obligations when it comes to Indigenous peoples. EMRIP is not a monitoring body, and its role is not to critique state policies and practices. But given the need for implementation of the rights of Indigenous peoples in a reconciliatory spirit, EMRIP is well placed and equipped to interpret different articles of the Declaration and to provide guidance on how specific rights of Indigenous peoples can be best implemented across different countries. This work enlarges our understanding of the nature of states’ human rights obligations and introduces possible implementation mechanisms. The Declaration, not legally binding by its legal nature, puts in the specific indigenous context existing universal human rights recognized by the majority of states as obligatory. This international instrument introduces a collective aspect of indigenous peoples’ rights as necessary for their survival given traditional ways of life and close special connection to Mother Earth. Therefore, this instrument sets a minimum standard of the rights of indigenous peoples’ human rights, which states committed to strive to. Indigenous languages are a human right One of the first studies of EMRIP was on the role of languages and cultures in the promotion and protection of the rights of Indigenous peoples, a study which five years later became one of the key documents to build grounds for the Action Plan of the 2019 International Year of Indigenous Languages, proclaimed by the UN General Assembly. This study builds on Article 13 of the UN Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples, which states that “Indigenous peoples have the right to revitalize, use, develop and transmit to future generations their histories, languages, oral traditions, philosophies, writing systems and literatures.” EMRIP believes that indigenous cultures and languages are a central and principal feature of Indigenous peoples’ identities as collectivities and as individuals. While defining Indigenous peoples as being primarily responsible for language survival, EMRIP experts also recognize states duties to promote indigenous languages and safeguard them from extinction. This includes providing sufficient funding to support teaching methods, literacy materials, and orthographies in the pupil’s own language. According to the studies, states shall also “enact national law and policy frameworks to support traditional & formal education…with the aim of developing and implementing appropriate programs and activities for and by indigenous peoples.” States must also “obtain indigenous peoples’ free, prior and informed consent when developing and implementing laws and policies related to indigenous peoples’ languages and culture.” A most recent report of EMRIP, “Efforts to implement the United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples: recognition, reparation and reconciliation”, provides that the “recognition of indigenous languages is another key aspect of the recognition of indigenous peoples and is receiving greater attention in the framework of the International Year of Indigenous Languages”. The study also contains several examples of both constitutional and legal recognition of Indigenous peoples’ languages and their relatedness to other rights, such as land rights and education. Understanding significant importance of indigenous languages for peace, reconciliation, and sustainable development, and trying to ensure application of a human rights-based approach for languages, EMRIP joined others in proposing to proclaim the International Year of Indigenous Languages, as “…an opportunity for states and indigenous peoples to remedy injustices in the realm of language rights, including many states’ historic suppression of indigenous languages, and to undertake preservation and revitalization measures, which earlier have seemed impossible or untimely”. Around 40 percent of the 7,000 or so languages spoken around the world are currently under threat. Not only globalization is a reason for this situation, but most of all the legacy of colonization and targeted assimilation policies exercised by colonial powers. Intergenerational trauma caused by these efforts has led to the sense of mistrust between Indigenous communities and authorities, severely damaging the confidence of Indigenous peoples in their languages’ vitality and resilience. In order to reconcile with the historical suppressions, the truth has to be found and recognized, and mutual investments in preservation and development of languages has to be agreed on. EMRIP is confident that states should invest to the revitalization of languages at least as much resources as has been spent to destroy them. One of the most prominent examples of a reconciliation process is the Canadian Truth and Reconciliation Commission, established in 2008 with the purpose of documenting the history and lasting impacts of the Canadian Indian residential school system on Indigenous students and their families. In June 2015, the Commission released an Executive Summary of its findings along with 94 “calls to action” regarding reconciliation between Canadians and Indigenous peoples. The Commission found that children in residential schools were not allowed to speak their native languages or practice their culture, partly to encourage the use of English, but also in an effort by the government to assimilate the children into non-aboriginal society. The calls to action request increased funding for educating children in Indigenous languages and also request that post-secondary institutions provide degrees and diplomas in Indigenous languages. This domestic process in Canada along with the increased international attention to this issue has led to the public apology by the government of Canada and has triggered a process of revision of Indigenous peoples related legislation in the country. In particular, in June 2019 Canadian parliament adopted the new Indigenous Language Act and established the office of the federal indigenous language Ombudsman. Unfortunately, there are still many countries where Indigenous peoples and their languages are not recognized and therefore no targeted indigenous language policies have been put in place. However, the movement towards recognition is going forward in many parts of the world. Most recently, the Cabinet of Japan has approved a law that recognizes the Ainu as Indigenous people, although Ainu representatives claim that the law in itself does not constitute an effort to achieve recognition, reparation, and reconciliation, as there is no reference to past violations. However, this recognition is a good ground for further dialogue where UN human rights experts’ assistance may or may not be requested. In order to foster dialogue and reconciliation around indigenous languages, parties should abandon potentially damaging stereotype-based approaches. First of all, it is very often that states and international organizations treat languages only as part of cultural heritage. Recently renewed UNESCO’s Policy of Engaging with Indigenous Peoples speaks about indigenous languages as “a vehicle of their intangible cultural heritage”. Although it is non-contestable and non-doubtable that languages and cultures are indivisible, they should not be considered only in the context of cultural performances and festivals. Languages are a tool for communication, transmission of knowledge and a human right. Another extreme is to consider languages from a national security perspective and set legislative restriction on the linguistic communities. So called political nation building policies in many countries, in fact, constitute a neocolonial effort to determine on behalf of Indigenous peoples how their languages can be taught and where they can be spoken and used. Over-regulated language related normative framework provides little space and flexibility for Indigenous-led educational systems. These efforts are often articulated as state care of the nation well-being, prevention of segregation, or advancing equality in the society¹. Policies put in place without or with little participation of Indigenous peoples in the drafting process lead to the dysfunction of such policies and eventually cause damage for languages and loss of critical time. Application of the principle of free, prior, and informed consent is the key to the instrumentality of laws, policies, or action plans. For example, the idea proposed by authorities and researchers to invent the unified Karelian language embodied in the Development Plan for the Karelian Language for the period from 2009 to 2020 was never realized because of the lack of support by Karelians. Well-planned policies with full participation of indigenous peoples determine what methods could be most efficient in each case: reclamation, revitalization, maintenance, or promotion. Collaboration of states and Indigenous peoples in a good faith would make languages visible, resilient, and restore prestige to speak those languages. Indigenous peoples have the knowledge how to preserve their languages, and states have resources to assist and encourage them to do so, including by building capacity of linguistic communities and individual language activists. Efforts to revitalize languages Many Indigenous languages are recognized by the UNESCO’s Atlas of the World’s Languages in Danger as severely or critically endangered. These cases demand urgent measures of revitalization. One of the most effective ones — a pre-school full immersion method of language nest — was born in an indigenous Maori community in Aotearoa / New Zealand, and expanded to Hawaii, the Nordic Countries, and Russia. Language nests facilitate bilingual education and recreates native speakers in a relatively short period of time. The one existing Karelian language nest, Kielipezä (‘Language Nest’), is run by the House of the Karelian Language. The nest is similar to a regular kindergarten, except that the language of instruction is Karelian, with no translation into Russian. The staff helps the children learn the language, using nest-specific teaching methods. The nest group is small, which allows individual work with each child. The next challenge will be to maintain the Karelian-language skill throughout a Russian-language school period. With this in mind, the House of the Karelian Language carries out informational and educational work, encouraging the parents and the local community to improve their language knowledge and speak to language-nest graduates in Karelian. While language nests are useful for settled communities, nomadic Indigenous communities would need other culturally appropriate models. Understanding the negative experience of boarding schools, the Russian government has introduced a mobile (nomadic) school method, which ensures access to education without taking children from their families, and without harm to their physical and mental health. This method also allows for the preservation of native languages and cultures via traditional occupations. This educational practice might be appropriate for indigenous peoples living in the conditions of the Arctic and developing reindeer husbandry in tundra. Although formal educational programs run by authorities or communities are very important and provide stability in language teaching, many indigenous language activists also significantly contribute to the language preservation and development. Moreover, community-led language activism is a pillar for linguistic sustainability and development. It is a modern environment that encourages speaking and learning the native languages through educational and social activities: producing handicrafts, cooking, singing in a village chorus, or performing in a local amateur theatre. For example, in the House of the Karelian language, Karelian is the official working language. The project is a response to the emerging needs to revive the traditional knowledge, which almost faded away together with the senior generation of Karelians, keep the regional history, strengthen the Karelian identity, and test new forms of social interaction. These trends find more and more support in the local community and drive the interest to the House in guests and tourists. Projects like this ensure balance and cooperation between formal education and informal, community-based activism. It is important for indigenous languages’ survival and development that they are used in the education system, public administration, and the media. In the modern life they should be also represented in cyberspace. While some languages still don’t have own scripts and writing systems, others have been actively used on the Internet and in technology. The Centre for Innovative Language Technologies of the Republic of Komi in Russia has contributed to the digitalization and documentation of many indigenous languages of Russia. Another example is the Language Recourse Media Centre of the Karelians, Vepsians, and Finns in the Republic of Karelia in Russia. Built on a publishing house, the Centre unites journalists, researchers, and activists to support indigenous literatures, media, digital language technologies, and language modernization efforts. Capacity building and empowerment of communities is one of the priorities of the 2019 International Year of Indigenous Languages. Seven indigenous non-governmental organizations in the Baltic Sea region have established a Civil Society Network for preserving and revitalizing indigenous languages “SANA 2019”. The team of SANA 2019 believes that neither school, nor NGOs shall be held solely responsible; a successful revival of an endangered language can only be achieved through a coordinated work of policy-makers, educators, and civil society. This position has been formulated and transferred into a set of specific recommendations by participants of Language Activism Forum, organized by SANA 2019. The recommendations have outlined how to promote language activism and how to ensure its interrelation with the agenda of formal educational institutions, cultural establishments, state bodies, and other stakeholders. The preservation of indigenous languages would be impossible without optimism on the local level — in indigenous peoples’ habitual lands. The Network has contributed to increasing local optimism by providing training and financial small-scale support for indigenous languages activists and organizations and by promoting their advanced practices internationally allowing for cooperation with like-minded across the globe. The added value of the International Year of Indigenous Languages Preliminary results of the International Year of Indigenous Languages show the potential for recognition and reconciliation around Indigenous languages. National steering committees and task forces are being formed in different countries; national and local action plans are being agreed on and implemented. Communities around the globe started to cooperate with each other and state authorities in search for best ways of safeguarding of critically endangered, although still vital, languages. More resources have been allocated to the instruction of indigenous languages and building the capacity of communities. In some countries there have been moves towards expanding language policies and negotiating new, more effective language safeguarding strategies, with the participation of indigenous experts and decision-makers. The crucial work being done by language grassroots activists has been supported and acknowledged. The International Year has mobilized international community’s attention to the need for preserving indigenous languages. Hundreds of international, regional, national and local events are held in all continents, where indigenous and expert community articulates calls to action and tries to find ways on how to keep going after the Year is over. At the high-level event of the UN General Assembly to mark the opening of the International Year, President Evo Morales of Bolivia stated that indigenous languages are very important for the modern democracy. Victoria and Yuelu Proclamations — outcomes of the regional meetings in Asia, North America and the Arctic — contain calls to shift the paradigm and recognize at all levels the human right nature of languages, which includes full respect to the right to free, prior and informed consent of indigenous peoples, and potentially the need for a legally binding international instrument to protect languages. As proposed by the Expert Mechanism on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples, the UN Human Rights Council held in its 42th session a half-day panel discussion on promotion and preservation of indigenous languages. The International Year’s calendar still has a lot of events, but it is rapidly approaching its conclusion. Is it enough for us to pay attention only for twelve months? Do we have time to conclude all we have in mind? Shall we use the momentum and prolong our efforts building on the results and dynamics of this year? On the World’s Indigenous Peoples’ Day, all four UN indigenous-specific mechanisms, jointly called on states to proclaim an International Decade of Indigenous Languages. This would give a little bit more time for all of us to support indigenous languages, and therefore give them more chance for longevity."
Medium.com,Society,When the exchange rate defies the government,World,https://medium.com/@tinashemurapata/when-the-exchange-rate-defies-the-government-96599ee55177?source=topic_page---------561------------------1," In 2007, at the height of Zimbabwe’s crisis, a woman named Rotina Mavhunga a traditional healer and spirit medium was inspired by a Shona ancestor Changamire Dombo to claim to the nation she had found a solution to the fuel crisis. Rotina, with the strike of her rod on rock, could harness diesel out of thin air. The gushing diesel would be enough to satiate the nation’s demand for fuel. Rotina, sold her dummy to the cabinet and her exploits were so valuable the country promised her a farm and more in appreciation. Her demonstration was broadcast on national television and state broadsheets. The incredulous was greeted with marvel. This story is instructive in understanding how Zanu PF cabinet thinks of supply and demand. They believe in bottomless wells as supply-side economics. The central bank Governor is the present day Rotina. Whenever GOZ desires foreign currency, Rotina passes a credit journal in RTGS. The numbers are bewildering. In August 2013, When the Zanu PF government took over, money supply was $3.8bn, by end of August 2019 it is projected to be $18bn. An almost five times increase in money in six years. Money simply gushes out of RBZ keyboards. Doubling by the year. In a senseless world the weird, mystical and hysterical become normalised. This invariably enters the world of economics. All economic data is suspended as the nation relies solely on cabinet pronouncements. The exchange rate is one such good that is difficult to track and predict. Yet it’s the only price in our markets that is closer to the truth and not easily manipulated. The purpose of this essay is to remind us that the government of Zimbabwe over the last forty years has systematically misinformed and stopped collection of economic data. The strategy is that in the absence of data- propaganda thrives. Traveling across Africa is stark contrasted to traveling across Europe or Asia. In Africa a thriving black market for currency exists while in Europe most trades happen in the formal market. In a land where post colonial discourse is basically about sovereignty, sovereignty itself substitutes bread and butter. It is Sovereignty that feeds the nation, while, actual bread and butter is in short supply. The country’s money takes this tower of babel significance as a symbol of that sovereignty. The nation is fed on that propaganda. The most quoted reason why Zimbabwe should have its own currency has simply been “a country must manage its own affairs”, “it will make us competitive” and “which country doesn’t have its own currency”. All this is meaningless in the world of economics. But it’s rather curious that politicians are always at the forefront of telling the masses the “true value “ of their currency. Value derived from the sovereignty propaganda. Data that proves otherwise is ignored before stopping its productionZ. Cocaine is bad for society. Bibles are good for society. Both are governed by the same laws of economics. Both derive a price based on market dynamics no matter our personal views. The law can ban and restrict, the church can forbid, but cocaine will trade. Independent of society’s morality, cocaine will find a price. This is true of everything in society. This is an indubitable law of supply and demand. And so it is with the foreign currency market. It derives it’s price from supply and demand. When an individual goes to Mbare Musika to buy vegetables they need not be a farmer to understand the whole farming process to “fairly” estimate the “real” value of tomatoes. What concerns them the most is the price of tomatoes in Mbare compared to elsewhere. This remains true when the same individual buys groceries, bricks, lunch, drinks and everything else in-between. They never need to concern themselves with the intimate details nor real worth of the products they consume. Nor do they need to consult an expert on bananas to determine the true value. They benefit most when they are numerous suppliers of the product they desire. Their faith is in the laws of supply and demand. The price of a good, is purely determined by supply and demand. Depending on how desperate a customer is, the same product can have numerous prices. The is true of an airline seat. The same seat depending on the customers desperation is priced differently. Put differently the same seat on the same flight has varying values to many customers. This does not mean the price system has failed, rather that value is a subjective matter. The buyer of cucumber cannot tell the sellers what the true and real value of the cucumber is. It is not their portion to lecture cucumber growers nor set price controls based on their warped understanding of “real” price for cucumber. The going rate, is the correct price. If tomorrow morning a man desires $100m USD, in Zimbabwe, provided they have a bottomless Well of RTGS they will get it. Depending on how bottomless their well is, it becomes a question of hours as compared to weeks, to gather it all. Lets suppose, instead of a Well, all they need is to strike a rock and RTGS gushes out by the dozens. This miracle will see the man competing away everyone and acquiring $6–7bn USD available in the Zimbabwean market. This is an important point. It is a huge lie that business or change money agents drive the rate. None can compete with the Government that can print without any limitation. Doubling the money supply every year. All the corporates combined do not have enough cash to compete with the printing press. Many are shocked that economics is premised on laws, since all they are accustomed to are trained economists head butting each other and never agreeing. They quickly take this cue, and assume nothing in economics is true. Zimbabwe suffers from this latter day scourge of believing it can come up with its own economic laws and truths. To our embarrassment. Fixation with Rotina, must give way to Economists. The French Economist, Richard Cantillion’s principles were etched in the nature of things. That everything is determined by supply and demand no matter the intrinsic value of the product or service. Everything, is determined by supply and demand. Just because the Ministry of Finance alleges the real exchange rate is 6, does not make it so. Infact, it goes against Cantillion’s principles. 400 year old truths. The going rate of foreign currency in Zimbabwe is the correct rate. It is supply and demand. As long as government prints money with abandon, the rate will move to reflect the relative price of US dollars to Zim dollars. The central bank, does not have a mind of their own. It’s governor is a civil servant taking orders from a political authority. In a country without much economic data, the exchange rate is the only data point that gives the pulse of the nation. It relays the correct inflation rate, level of production, unemployment, industry capacity and money printing. Put differently, our politicians in systematically stopping the production of economic data over the last 40 years have singularly brought to prominence the exchange rate as the go to data point to determine the economic state of affairs. By reverting to mysticism of the printing press, logic has ended. Its Rotina, that keeps them in power."
Medium.com,Society,The Age of the Drone?,World,https://medium.com/swlh/the-age-of-the-drone-b2981bdc7f29?source=topic_page---------562------------------1," Use of the small, unmanned aircraft in Saudi Arabia is raising new questions The recent attack on Saudi Arabian oil facilities by not only missiles but also drones is focusing attention on these small, unmanned aircraft. As senior government officials debate whether it was Iran or Yemen that launched the drones, the effectiveness of the technology itself causes deep unease. “In the history of modern warfare, ‘own the skies, win the war’ has been a constant maxim,” wrote The Guardian’s Middle East correspondent, Martin Chulov, this week. And the countries with the biggest military budgets owned the biggest patch of sky. “Tiny, cheap, unmanned aircraft have changed that, especially over the battlefields of the Middle East.” Chulov continued, “In the past three months alone, drones have made quite an impact in Iraq, Syria, Lebanon and possibly now Saudi Arabia, where half the country’s oil production — and up to 7 percent of the world’s global supply — has been taken offline by a blitz that caused no air raid sirens and seems to have eluded the region’s most advanced air warning systems.” The question now becomes: Will drone attacks remain confined to the Middle East? One of America’s experts on drones dove deep into the topic at a seminar sponsored by the Terrorism Center, affiliated with John Jay College of the City University of New York. His insights are well worth disseminating. Researcher and lecturer Michael J. Boyle, Associate Professor of Political Science at La Salle University in Philadelphia and a Senior Fellow with the Foreign Policy Research Institute, said the “uncontrolled” market in toy or hobbyist drones makes their future use in a domestic terrorist attack “likely.” But, he emphasized, it requires sophisticated technical skills to deploy them effectively. “It’s not quite as easy to launch a terrorist drone attack as the breathless media suggests,” Boyle told the seminar audience last year. But “given the increasing availability of drones, it is likely that there will be a terrorist drone attack in the developed world.” Boyle estimated that 200,000 drones are sold globally each month on a “toy drone market that is completely uncontrolled.” Even the cheapest drones can be rendered harmful with DIY adaptations. Meanwhile, concerns about the use of weaponized drones in domestic terrorism have fueled a boom in anti-drone technology development, with estimates that this has already become a $1.6 billion industry, said Boyle. “As it is now, you can buy a drone on Amazon and it goes out there,” he said. Interdiction strategies range from using radio frequencies and acoustic signatures to the Dutch government’s training hawks to go after drones in the sky. Geo-fencing is effective in stopping drones, particularly at airports, but “you can hack it,” he said. In the U.S. so far, the dark side of drones has been confined to “routine criminal activity,” such as dropping drugs and other contraband into prisons. Boyle suggested there have most probably been “disrupted attacks” already in the U.S., the United Kingdom, or other Western countries. He noted, however, that “aborted attacks are not on the public record.” Drone manufacturing has been dominated by the U.S., Israel, and China, but other countries are jumping in, and now more than a dozen nations produce them. So far, drone attacks have occurred in the Middle East, primarily Iraq and Syria. In January 2018, a swarm of armed miniature drones was launched at a Russian military base in Syria, with ISIS believed to be behind an incident sending 13 drones packed with explosives into action, possibly backed by Turkey. In 2019 the drone attacks have intensified. Boyle said that while some terrorism experts could be guilty of “threat inflation,” there is no denying that when it comes to dealing with drones that could be used in attacks, “we are in the Wild West.” One of the biggest challenges to turning a drone into a weapon is the fact that current models on the market are able to fly only 20 or 30 minutes. Drones are also unstable, can’t carry substantial payloads, are resistant to chemicals being added, and are vulnerable to weather conditions, especially wind. And, Boyle noted, it is very hard to conduct a dry-run drone attack. Boyle, who has studied the use of terrorist drones in the Middle East, said the groups that have shown the most success are those who are highly organized and most closely resemble a military command structure. That would include Hamas, Hezbollah, ISIS, Russian separatists in the Ukraine, and Mexican cartels. “Iran is big on drones,” Boyle said last year, adding that when it comes to ISIS, the drones tend to be retro-fitted commercial models, based on analysis of wreckage. One concern is that with ISIS in retreat in parts of the Middle East, foreign fighters with battlefield expertise will return to their native countries, ready to purchase, weaponize, and launch drones. Nonetheless, “It’s much harder to carry out an attack in a well policed city in the Western world than in a battlefield in Syria or Iraq,” Boyle said. “It’s unlikely that terrorist drone attacks will be a regular event due to technical limits.” When it comes to homegrown terrorists, Boyle said his research shows that far-right violent groups steer clear of drones because they are paranoid of the machines’ ability to conduct surveillance and gather information for the government. As for someone acting on his own, it’s “just not that easy for a lone wolf to do,” he concluded."
Medium.com,Society,Hong Kong: The Forefront Of The US-China Trade War,World,https://medium.com/@conn7799/hong-kong-the-forefront-of-the-us-china-trade-war-9709eca877ff?source=topic_page---------563------------------1," Hong Kong’s summer of discontent has already lasted for sixteen consecutive weeks. Protests were triggered in early June by a widely repudiated Extradition Bill, which would have allowed criminal suspects in Hong Kong to be tried in China. What began in peaceful demonstrations have escalated into violence and urban guerrillas over the past months. The bill was finally withdrawn several weeks ago, but tabling it is only one of the five demands laid out by the people, including an investigation into police brutality, amnesty of all arrested protesters, retracting the characterization of the protests as “riots” and the implementation of universal suffrage in the Chief Executive and Legislative Council elections. Despite the regional government’s belated attempt to quell the havoc, the unrest, which has now evolved into a greater movement calling for democracy and autonomy, shows no sign of stopping. The withdrawal does not guarantee a victory for the Hongkongers, as the once safest city in Asia is turning into a terrifying police state. Arbitrary attacks on civilians, mass arrests, alleged collusion with gangsters, sexual assault, torturing and unrestricted use of lethal weapons have spurred public fury. Amnesty International Hong Kong has issued reports on police brutality while calling for an investigation into unrestrained policing. What’s even more worrying, there is evidence showing the local law enforcement has been infiltrated by Chinese paramilitary personnel, fueling fears over the penetration of the mainland authority in local affairs. The protesters are also calling for democracy. Although guaranteed by the Basic Law, the region’s constitution, popular elections have never been implemented due to disapproval from Beijing since the transfer of sovereignty from Britain to China in 1997. In the eyes of Hongkongers, the lack of democracy makes the territory extremely vulnerable under Chinese dictatorship as they see their civil liberties and autonomy being gradually chipped away by Beijing-anointed ruling elites. After breaking the standstill by having the bill shelved, Hong Kong still shudders in the turbulence of international politics while tensions arise amid the trade war between the United States and China The smoke spiraling up from the streets in Hong Kong overshadows the ongoing US-China trade negotiations. It is fair to say that the city’s struggle for freedom has been positioned in the wrestle of the two superpowers. Hong Kong’s situation has become more precarious than ever. It has become a bipartisan consensus that Hong Kong will be a top priority for the US when the Congress resumes after a recess next week, whereas diametrically opposed US leaders have expressed support for the city’s pro-democracy movement. The Hong Kong Human Rights and Democracy Act, proposed by Republican Senator Marco Rubio and Democratic Senator Ben Cardin, will allow the US to impose sanctions on Chinese and Hong Kong officials who took part in the brutal suppression of the pro-democracy movement. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi also expressed concerns over China’s actions in Hong Kong in a statement and hoped to swiftly advance the bipartisan act “to reaffirm the U.S. commitment to democracy, human rights and the rule of law in the face of Beijing’s crackdown.” In contrast, Trump is taking a more “hands-off” approach towards the issue. “If it’s another Tiananmen Square, it’s — I think it’s a very hard thing to do if there’s violence,” he said on 18th August, after calling protests “riots”, adopting the Chinese government’s’ rhetoric. He also suggested a more “humane” resolution for Hong Kong before reaching a trade deal with China. Hong Kong appears to be a bargaining chip amid the trade negotiations. In fact, the semi-autonomous region has always been at the forefront of the US-China struggle. By introducing the horrendous Extradition Bill and constantly sabotaging Hong Kong’s freedom in the past decades, China has turned the free port into a Trojan Horse that weakens foreign, especially American, interests in the Indo-Pacific. Chinese businesses, be they private- or state-owned, can bypass tariffs, sanctions and export control imposed upon China by exploiting Hong Kong’s special status as a separate customs territory and an independent shipping registry. China has smuggled military equipment and technologies from the West via the free port before. Hong Kong’s membership in a handful of international organizations (ie. WTO) also serves Chinese interests by offering the sovereign state an additional vote. As well, Hong Kong is key to China’s economic growth in terms of foreign trade and finance; the city is the largest offshore RMB clearing center and the largest source of FDI into China, accounting for 54% of the country’s total. Under the “One Country, Two Systems” arrangement, the city is still a major financial hub for foreign investors who do business with China and wish to settle in a more secure and free environment. China has been unwilling to fulfill its promise to give Hong Kong the autonomy and democracy it deserves while squeezing the most out of the city’s institutions and advantages. Now China has to deal with the following conundrum: if Chairman Xi decides to roll in the tanks and to put a quick end to the protests, he will simultaneously strangle his own country’s economic prosperity. Another tactic is to rely on local law enforcement and let the movement die out by attrition. Either way, concessions from China are doomed impossible. Only the US is able to change the game since Hong Kong’s special status is guaranteed by China as well as the countries that recognize the institutional differences between the city and the rest of China, among which the US is the most influential. The US-Hong Kong Policy Act (992) recognizes the territory as a nonsovereign political entity distinct from China, giving Hong Kong a most-favored-nation status, and indicates support for democratization in Hong Kong. Undoubtedly, the US has a stake in Hong Kong. The harbor accounts for America’s most profitable bilateral trade-in-goods surplus in 2018, at $31.1 billion, while housing the headquarters of 290 U.S. businesses and one of the largest American Chambers of Commerce in the world since 1841. Hong Kong will become nothing but another Chinese city once its freedoms perish. The US must not let this happen because Hong Kong is not only an irreplaceable business partner but also a beacon of liberty in Asia, critical in resisting the encroachment of authoritarianism. Hong Kong shares common economic interests but utterly no common values with China and its defiance towards authoritarian rule show that its people treasure the values to which the rest of the free world adheres. Losing Hong Kong means a setback for democracy and a huge loss for America’s economic interest in the Indo-pacific. Hong Kong will remain valuable to both of the great powers only if China stops undermining the city’s autonomy; if the city-state were fully subsumed under Chinese rule, the US would be entitled to terminate its differential treatments. For Hong Kong is pivotal to China’s grand strategy in asserting dominance in the globe, the US leaders should seize the chance and tackle CCP on the Hong Kong issue. The US holds all the aces to punish China for its infringements of human rights: for instance, the legislation of the Hong Kong Human Rights and Democracy Act, using the Global Magnitsky Act to sanction Chinese and Hong Kong officials and to expose their overseas properties. Some might be skeptical towards US interventionism, but Hong Kong’s recent struggle has exemplified that Chinese hegemony is no alternative to a US-dominated world. Hong Kong and the rest of Asia may only continue to prosper should we strike a balance between both sides of the pacific. Smaller nations always seem vulnerable on the geopolitical chessboard dominated by superpowers. Whether or not Hong Kong will succeed in preserving its freedoms still remains unsettled, but one thing is clear, Hong Kong people have shown courage to speak out against tyranny. The free world must acknowledge that and help to defend the city already fragile autonomy. - References https://www.euronews.com/2019/09/05/hong-kong-a-priority-for-us-senate-democrats-leader-says?fbclid=IwAR13yQpf1QHmL-D1B3jc4kg9Eiy9TzYYEPTyPdcuVZesQWdb0kR6ys8VdiY https://thediplomat.com/2019/05/hong-kong-and-the-us-china-new-cold-war/"
Medium.com,Society,Why Nuclear Weapons Risks Are Increasing,World,https://medium.com/henley-partners/why-nuclear-weapons-risks-are-increasing-21295524af6d?source=topic_page---------564------------------1," Dr. Patricia Lewis, Research Director: International Security Chatham House, UK A reversal in progress on arms control and disarmament as well as a volatile international scene have renewed fears that nuclear weapons may be used. The risks are significant and should be taken seriously. Risk is defined as the product of the probability and the consequence of an event occurring. The high risks associated with nuclear weapons have always been dominated by the ‘consequences’ component of the risk equation. When impacts are overwhelming, risks are high, no matter how small the likelihood of an event as long as it is not zero. During the Cold War, there were several near-accidents and near-deliberate detonations of nuclear weapons. Thanks primarily to good luck and the good judgment of some key individuals, we avoided the worst dangers of the nuclear stand-off between the USA and the Soviet Union. Could such good luck and judgment still hold today? Amidst growing concerns about nuclear weapons, Ireland introduced a UN General Assembly resolution that resulted in the 1968 nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT). The NPT was a grand bargain in which the states that did not possess nuclear weapons promised never to develop or acquire them, to only develop peaceful forms of nuclear energy, and to subject themselves to safeguarding inspections by the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA). In return, states that possessed nuclear weapons promised to negotiate nuclear disarmament in good faith, along with disarmament in other weapons categories, and not to transfer or assist with nuclear weapons technologies. All states party to the NPT could then share in safeguarded nuclear technologies for peaceful uses. The NPT was originally given a lifespan of 25 years. In retrospect, this decision betrays a touching faith in commitments to disarmament. In 1995, the treaty was extended indefinitely as part of a suite of commitments to: a) completely eliminate nuclear weapons; b) strengthen the NPT review process; and c) progress towards a Middle East zone free of weapons of mass destruction. Nearly 25 years later, there has been no substantial advancement on any of those commitments. In the run-up to its 50th anniversary in 2020,1 the NPT is in trouble again. In part, nuclear proliferation in states both outside and inside the NPT has caused this turbulence. Outside, following their nuclear tests in 1998, both India and Pakistan have cemented their nuclear-armed status, with India having been granted special status for peaceful-use technologies through the Nuclear Suppliers Group and Section 123 of the USA Atomic Energy Act. Israel’s nuclear weapons capability is unspoken and rarely challenged by other states that possess nuclear weapons, although this capability is of considerable concern in the Middle East. None of these countries is likely to ever join the NPT. Although more intrusive IAEA inspections has made it far harder for states inside the treaty to use a peaceful nuclear program to hide the development of a clandestine military capability, that has not stopped proliferation: North Korea announced its withdrawal from the NPT in 2003, while concerns about Iran’s program led to the 2015 Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA). Lack of progress in the step-by-step process of multilateral and bilateral nuclear arms control and disarmament also destabilizes the NPT. Since the USA Senate rejected the Comprehensive Nuclear Test Ban Treaty in 1999,2 things have gone badly for multilateral processes, except in the humanitarian domain. Efforts to control landmines, small arms and light weapons, cluster munitions, and the arms trade have been the only progress on conventional forces. These humanitarian efforts, rather than traditional disarmament, have led to more than 120 countries negotiating the 2017 Treaty on the Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons;3 they have done so with a sense of purpose and urgency not seen since the NPT days of the 1960s. In contrast, since the USA withdrew from the Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty in 2002, bilateral nuclear controls and regional conventional arms control involving Russia and the USA — including the latter’s withdrawal from the Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces Treaty announced in February of 2019 — have all but halted. This is despite the USA and Russia agreeing New START, a new nuclear arms reduction treaty, in 2010. It is now uncertain whether they will extend it when it expires in early 2021. This sorry state has formed the backdrop to nuclear weapons being prominent in military doctrines in Russia and the USA. Both countries have started to develop new nuclear weapons programs. This increases the chances of proliferation and even of nuclear weapons’ use. Throughout the Cold War, nuclear weapons were the ‘weapons that could not be used’ — they were for deterrence only. Their innate terrifying effects were the foundation of this view. In recent years, this consensus against use has weakened. More than 70 years having passed since the USA used nuclear weapons on the Japanese cities of Hiroshima and Nagasaki, so decision-makers may not be as aware of the devastating immediate and long-term effects of nuclear weapons. For example, during the 2016 presidential election campaign in the USA, Donald Trump asked why a president would not consider the use of nuclear weapons; in the same year, former UK prime minister Theresa May stated her resolve to use nuclear weapons; and Russian President Vladimir Putin has frequently made clear his readiness to use them. In 2018, threats from the leaders of both North Korea (Kim Jong-un) and the USA (Donald Trump) made the possible use of nuclear weapons all too real. Hawaii reinstated missile alert drills, while authorities even broadcast a ‘real’ alert by mistake in January 2019, leading to 40 minutes of panic and uncertainty.4 People readily believed that mistaken alert because of the increasingly hostile way that the USA and North Korea are talking. Although the Trump–Kim Summits introduced some optimism into the situation, it is hard to gauge their chances of success. Since the 2019 Hanoi Summit, their chances seem low. With leaders using social and broadcast media to trade insults and threats, military exercises could be misinterpreted and rhetoric could escalate to missile attack. Similar tensions in the Middle East also raise the stakes. Unless Europe and Iran find a way through, the USA’s withdrawal from the JCPOA could renew the risk of Iran developing a nuclear capability, and thus of an Israeli or Saudi pre-emptive military response. In this multipolar and increasingly turbulent world, the ‘probability’ component of the nuclear risk equation has grown in significance. Although there were near-accidents and near-misses throughout the Cold War, military planners and politicians shared beliefs in deterrence, assuming that nuclear weapons would not be used, however fraught a situation might be. With new players in the mix; increased regional instabilities; command, control, and communication technologies subject to daily cyberthreats; and leaders preferring to use social media rather than quiet diplomacy, we can no longer assume non-use. Nuclear war may only be “one tiny tantrum away”, as Beatrice Fihn, director of the International Campaign to Abolish Nuclear Weapons, warned when she received the 2017 Nobel Peace Prize.

Medium.com,Society,"A Fork in the Road: What lies ahead for religious minorities in Sri Lanka, India and South Asia?",World,https://medium.com/@cswforbinfull/a-fork-in-the-road-what-lies-ahead-for-religious-minorities-in-sri-lanka-india-and-south-asia-6fea9084e410?source=topic_page---------565------------------1," Sri Lanka and India are facing pivotal moments, both for their future, and the future of South Asia as a whole. Both countries’ drives towards religious hegemony have left little place for Christians and Muslims, a factor which will certainly lead to more instability and intolerance in the region. Sri Lanka was the site of the 2019 Easter Sunday bombings, in which over 250 people were killed when terrorists targeted a number of churches and hotels across the country. In the aftermath of the bombings, there were reports of violent attacks against Muslims and an increase in anti-Muslim prejudice. Some reprisals against the Muslim population have been carried out by Christians, in contrast to the previous relative harmony between the two communities as they both battled intolerance from sections of the Sinhalese Buddhist population. Furthermore, Buddhist nationalist groups such as the Bodu Bala Sena (BBS), who have been portraying Islam as a threat to both Buddhism and Sri Lanka for years, consider their stance vindicated by the bombings. Sinhalese Buddhist nationalists have long feared losing their position of supremacy; Sri Lankan anthropologist Stanley Tambiah describes the group as ‘a majority with a minority complex.’ Now, in their eyes, the Muslim threat has now been made real. Intolerant and hateful rhetoric towards religious minorities has already represented a serious threat to peace and stability in Sri Lanka. 2018 saw major anti-Muslim riots in Ampara and Kandy, in the Eastern and Central provinces of Sri Lanka, echoing similar riots which rocked Aluthgama, in the south-west of the island, in 2014. In the aftermath of both the 2018 riots and 2019 retaliatory attacks following the Easter Sunday bombings, social media was blocked to prevent the spread of hate speech. In May 2019 a nationwide curfew was placed over the island for two days, extended to four days in the North-Western province, where a wave of violence had spread from village to village. Hettipola in the North Western province, for example, saw more than 80 Muslim-owned shops, houses and buildings damaged, as well as the village’s central Mosque, Masjid Al Huda. In India, Modi and the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) have embraced the concept of Hindutva which seeks to preserve and defend the cultural hegemony of Hinduism at the expense of minority religions. In his first election campaign Modi focused on promises to fix the economy; this time round, with the economy still struggling he embarked on a divisive campaign in which he capitalised on religious nationalism and sought to portray himself as a strongman and protector of the nation. Modi’s rhetoric has emboldened right wing groups such as the Rashtriya Swayamsevek Sangh (RSS), and there has been a sharp rise in incidents of cow vigilantism since the BJP entered power in 2014. The BJP’s rule has also seen more states such as Jharkhand and Uttarakhand introduce anti-conversion laws. In April this year a Christian from the Adivasi tribe was killed after he and three other Christians were severely beaten, after helping to skin an ox that had died of natural causes. On 22 June various news agencies reported on a viral video which showed a Muslim man, bound and bleeding, being lynched. In both cases the mobs shouted ‘ Jai Sri Ram, Jai Hanuman’ (long live/glory to Sri Ram and long live/glory to Hanuman) in honour of the Hindu deities. Regionally, rising levels of violence against religious minorities will cause problems beyond humanitarian concerns. India and Sri Lanka are neighboured by three Muslim majority countries: Bangladesh, the Maldives and Pakistan. Bangladesh’s economic ties with India make it unlikely that the government will speak out in public, and the Maldives’ relationship with the country also appears to be improving. Pakistan, a country with its own chronic FoRB violations, already has a chequered history with its Hindu majority neighbour. With growing communal tensions based on religious rhetoric, the upending of the special status of Kashmir in August risks further bilateral breakdown between the two nuclear-armed powers. Since midnight on 4 August, India has placed severe restrictions on press freedom and freedom of movement, with widespread detentions. The people of the Kashmir Valley are feeling frustrated with majoritarian politics from the ruling BJP, and with no clear signs of international mediation or intervention, their fate remains uncertain. Hostility towards Indian Muslims is likely to be further inflamed, while in Pakistan increasing discrimination towards the Hindu community including more instances of forced conversion of Hindu girls could worsen as infuriated Islamists step up their campaign of conversion. Many lower caste Hindus converted to Christianity during British colonial rule, to escape caste discrimination. The legacy of the caste system means that Christians and Hindus in Pakistan are treated as second-class citizens. They have faced severe discrimination including violent attacks from the Muslim majority, which at various times in history has led to an exodus of Hindus to India and Christians to countries like Thailand and Malaysia. The treatment of, and rhetoric used against Muslims in India is likely to exacerbate the relationship with Pakistan, further polarising the two countries. Pakistan’s Prime Minister Imran Khan has already tweeted about his vision of ‘Naya Pakistan’where minority citizens would be treated equally “unlike what is happening in India.” This came a week after he stated that he would show “how we treat the minorities in Pakistan in stark comparison to the minorities’ status in India.” While pledges to uphold the rights of religious minorities are welcome in principle, this sort of verbal baiting only serves to fan the flames of ethno-religious tensions between the two nations. A further deterioration of the relationship between Pakistan and India, two countries with strong military powers, is a concern for the region. If Sri Lanka continues down its current path, it will only be a matter of time before there are serious deteriorations in its own relations with Pakistan. The factor which could cause the most instability is the emergence of emboldened Islamic paramilitary groups. If attacks like the Easter Sunday Bombings become more frequent, attitudes towards Muslims will continue to harden, not only in India and Sri Lanka, but also in Nepal and Bhutan, which are Hindu and Buddhist majority nations respectively. This is turn could create a cycle of tit for tat reprisals, causing the region to descend into instability and violence for all religious minorities. There is a risk that South Asia could descend into a region of violence and instability for all religious minorities. By CSW’s Advocacy and Projects Officer"
Medium.com,Society,Big power rivalry in the Gulf requires a US strategy rethink,World,https://medium.com/the-turbulent-world-of-middle-east-soccer/big-power-rivalry-in-the-gulf-requires-a-us-strategy-rethink-804e10889b95?source=topic_page---------566------------------1," By James M. Dorsey A podcast version of this story is available on Soundcloud, Itunes, Spotify, Stitcher, TuneIn, Spreaker, Pocket Casts, Tumblr, Podbean and Castbox. As French, Pakistani and other leaders seek to engineer a meeting between the US and Iranian presidents on the sidelines of the United Nations General Assembly, big power rivalry could rack up tension in the waters of the Gulf and the Indian Ocean. With prospects for a face-to-face encounter between presidents Donald J. Trump and Hassan Rouhani slim at best, attention is likely to focus on beefing up the security of key Saudi oil facilities after drone and missile attacks, blamed by the kingdom and the United States on Iran, and identifying an appropriate response that minimizes the risk of a full-fledged military confrontation. Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates, days after the attacks severely damaged oil installations, joined a US-led coalition to secure the Middle East’s waterways. Earlier, Britain, Bahrain and Australia pledged to participate in the coalition. Japan declined to join but said it was considering sending its Maritime Self-Defense Force (SDF) on information-gathering missions in the region. It said it would coordinate with the US-led coalition and would include the Strait of Hormuz in its operations if Iran agreed. Japan has unsuccessfully sought to mediate between the United States and Iran. The US Defense Department, meanwhile, in response to a request from Saudi Arabia and the UAE and in an effort to reassure Gulf allies said last week that it was sending an unspecified number of troops and equipment to the two countries to bolster their defences. Iranian Brigadier General Ghadir Nezami, head of international and diplomatic affairs of his country’s armed forces, raised the stakes by saying that the Iranian navy would be holding joint exercises with Russia and China in the Indian Ocean and the Sea of Oman. General Nezami, who is believed to have recently accompanied chairman of the Iranian Joint Chiefs of Staff Major General Mohammad Baqeri on a visit to China, gave no date for the exercises. Chinese and Russian media have yet to report the planned exercise while spokesmen in the two countries declined to confirm or deny the Iranian announcement. Iranian Navy Commander Rear Admiral Hossein Khanzadi said in July that the Russian and Iranian navies would be conducting a joint exercise within a matter of months to boost military cooperation. Russian and Chinese hesitancy to confirm the exercise may be designed to avoid hiking tensions as efforts at the United Nations to mediate between the United States and Iran proceed. Moreover, Russian president Vladimir Putin is likely to want to avoid a shadow being cast over his planned visit to Saudi Arabia in October. Mr. Putin has urged the kingdom to proceed with the acquisition of Russia’s S-400 anti-missile system that was agreed in principle two years ago. Russian foreign minister Sergey Lavrov met this week with his Saudi counterpart Ibrahim Assaf at the United Nations to discuss the visit. Russia and China may also not want to undermine a Chinese-backed Russian proposal for a collective security agreement in the Gulf that would replace the US defence umbrella at a time that Saudi Arabia, uncertain about American reliability, may reach out to other countries for support in protecting its oil assets. South Korea’s Yonhap news agency last week reported that Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman had requested South Korean assistance in the strengthening of the kingdom’s air defense system. Gulf concern about US reliability, dating back to US president Barak Obama’s negotiation of an international nuclear agreement with Iran and reinforced by Mr. Trump’s transactional response to the recent attacks on Saudi oil fields, leaves the Saudis and the Americans with no good choices. Middle East scholar and former advisor to the US Defence Department Bilal Y. Saab argues, against the backdrop of a widespread feeling in Gulf states that the United States is gradually reducing its commitment to their defense as Washington focuses on Asia and the Indo-Pacific, that the United States in particular is caught in a Catch-22. Its options of reducing commitment without surrendering its umbilical defense cord and making way for America’s rivals are limited. Mr. Saab believes that the United States should focus its security cooperation less single-mindedly on arms sales and more on building the Gulf states’ institutional national defense infrastructure. Failure to do so, would risk regional tensions repeatedly spiralling out of control and ultimately prevent a gradual US drawdown. The problem is, in Mr. Saab’s words, that what the United States should be doing to “responsibly reduce its security burden and footprint in the region” while safeguarding opportunities for lucrative arms sales would likely reinforce perceptions of America as unreliable and willing to sacrifice its friends — a perception that dates from the 2011 popular Arab revolts when Washington ultimately backed the toppling of Egyptian president and US ally Hosni Mubarak. Mr. Saad is the first person to admit that his proposition may be pie in the sky. “It would mean building and empowering institutions that have the guns, and thus the ability, to conduct coups. Only a foolish Arab autocrat would be interested in that. It would also mean liberalizing or professionalizing national-security ministries and intelligence agencies. Few Arab leaders would voluntarily undermine the favourable clientelistic networks that are run by their governments. In short, defense reform requires political reform,” he says. Moreover, institution building would bring the different threat perceptions of the Gulf states and the US into sharp relief and force Gulf states to rethink their arms acquisition policies and grant the United States access to their jealousy guarded most secret data and programs. Said Mr. Saab: “There is no shortage of problems on the US end or on its partners’ end when it comes to security cooperation. But it will be impossible to address any of those without making a total switch on how the United States thinks about security cooperation.” That would require a US president who thinks in strategic rather than transactional terms.

Medium.com,Society,Lessons Hong Kong Has Taught Us about Colonialism and Identity Politics,World,https://medium.com/@iscyang/lessons-hong-kong-has-taught-us-about-colonialism-and-identity-politics-fd177900c9e8?source=topic_page---------567------------------1," Since the publishing of my first article on Hong Kong, I have received mostly positive feedback. However, a few from young Hongkongers were provocative at best and abusive at worst. They all brought up widely spread misconceptions that I had already rebutted in the original article, such as that the mainland judicial system is wholly untrustworthy, and that the Hong Kong Police have used more violence than the police of any civilised country (which, in many Hong Kong youth’s eyes, means the likes of Britain and America) would have in similar circumstances. And invariably and unsurprisingly, instead of engaging in rational and factual discussions, they all ended with an ugly personal attack explicitly or implicitly along the lines of ‘You are brainwashed by the Chinese state and totally uncredible because you are from mainland China’. Sounds familiar? Donald Trump kicked off his presidential bid more than a year ago with harsh words for Mexico. “They are not our friend, believe me,” he said, before disparaging Mexican immigrants: “They’re bringing drugs. They’re bringing crime. They’re rapists. And some, I assume, are good people.” And more concerningly, The doctrine of racism asserts that blood determines national-ethnic identity. Within a racist framework, the value of a human being is not determined by his or her individuality, but instead by membership in a so-called “racial collective nation.” … Racism, including racial antisemitism (prejudice against or hatred of Jews based on false biological theories), was always an integral part of German National Socialism (Nazism). This brings us to one of the most important points I hope to make about the protests: it is an identity politics movement characterised by nativism and sinophobia in a postcolonial, neoliberal setting more than anything else that it purports to be. Jewish Self-hatred Loosely speaking, the term ‘Self-hating Jew’ refers to a Jewish person who holds certain types of antisemitic views. The phenomenon of auto-antisemitism started in 18th and 19th centuries Germany. When Jews became accepted in German society as fellow citizens after centuries’ oppression and discrimination, some Jews pursued further integration and social recognition by adopting the Gentile lifestyle, which, for some, meant conversion from Judaism to Christianity, receiving a German education, speaking German instead of Yiddish, etc. For them, Germanness and Jewishness became two opposing identities: modern versus ancient, good and bad, civilised versus backward. Later in the 19th and 20th centuries, some Jewish progressives started criticising their own people. Some took it to extremes and expressed views that would be considered antisemitic today. Some of these critiques were not genuine self-reflection, but rather blind internalisation of European society’s long-held prejudice and discrimination against Jews. This phenomenon has been explained in modern social psychology with the theory of internalised oppression. For example, Kenneth Levin, a psychiatrist and historian at Harvard University, attributed the Jewish self-hatred to the following causes Segments of populations under chronic siege commonly embrace the indictments of the besiegers, however bigoted and outrageous. They hope that by doing so and reforming accordingly they can assuage the hostility of their tormenters and win relief. This has been an element of the Jewish response to anti-Semitism throughout the history of the Diaspora. The paradigm on the level of individual psychology is the psychodynamics of abused children, who almost invariably blame themselves for their predicament, ascribe it to their being “bad,” and nurture fantasies that by becoming “good” they can mollify their abusers and end their torment. Racism in British Hong Kong A parallel can be drawn between Jews in pre-Nazi Germany and local Chinese in British Hong Kong to a large degree. British Sinophobia traces all the way back to Shakespeare’s days and is well documented in history. There is a wealth of literature that can be drawn upon. It could be seen all across the British Empire, in America, Australia, and undoubtedly, Hong Kong. Similar to Jews in 18th century Germany, Hong Kong Chinese were seen as backward and therefore treated as second-class citizens for the most part of the colonial era. A Concise History of Hong Kong written by Prof John M. Carroll, a leading historian in Hong Kong history and my former lecturer, provides a fantastic account of colonial rule. Sources do not reveal much about how the Chinese viewed the Europeans, but Europeans often complained about the smells and sounds from the Chinese community: open-air markets and incense, musical instruments and firecrackers from religious ceremonies, and the cries of hawkers and peddlers. European residents also frequently criticized the government for allowing Chinese residents to run “houses of disreputable women” in or near European neighborhoods and to profane the Christian Sabbath by holding theatrical performances on Sunday. Both European residents and colonial officials often complained that the Chinese built flimsy wood structures that were too close together, increasing the risk of fire and the spread of disease. This contact between Chinese and British led to racism on both sides, but it particularly made many Europeans think of themselves as members of a special community. Even after the emergence of a new class of Hong Kong Chinese who had become wealthy through business endeavours in the late 1800s and early 1900s, local Chinese continued to face prejudice and discrimination. Despite their status and wealth, the members of the Chinese bourgeoisie, like all Chinese in Hong Kong, continued to face racial discrimination at every turn. Racial segregation was enforced both legally and informally. In 1901 a group of Europeans petitioned the colonial government for a separate school for Europeans, arguing that integrated education harmed the morality and character of European children. Although one Chinese resident complained in the local press that “to exclude Chinese from certain schools means to go against the law of nature and to aggravate the hatred between Chinese and foreigners”9 and Secretary for the Colonies Chamberlain condemned the proposal, it enjoyed great support among European parents and the colonial government. Ironically, the new school, the Kowloon British School, had originally been built and presented to the colonial government by the Eurasian Robert Ho Tung as a school for all races. Ho Tung now reluctantly agreed, regretting a decision “so opposed to the spirit which prompted my offer of the school to the Colony.” Chinese were barred from the Hong Kong Club and the Hong Kong Jockey Club, and in some hotels Chinese guests could stay only in certain rooms or could not stay overnight. Victoria Peak, one of Hong Kong’s most iconic scenic spots today, was reserved as an exclusive residential area for non-Chinese between 1904 and 1930 under the Peak Reservation Ordinance. According to Hong Kong’s constitution, laid out in the Letters Patent of April 5, 1843, Hong Kong would be run by a governor appointed by the British Crown. The governor would administer the colony with help from a lieutenant governor, a colonial secretary, an Executive Council, and a Legislative Council. The two councils were each to have both official and nonofficial members appointed by the governor. Often described as the governor’s cabinet, the Executive Council was mainly an advisory body with members drawn primarily from the British business elite. Its members, however, sometimes disagreed with the governor and served to restrain his power. Until the 1880s, members of the Legislative Council were almost all non-Chinese. Although this basic constitutional framework saw minor modifications over the years, it experienced no significant changes until the early 1980s. In face of racial discrimination, local Chinese elite and Eurasians responded by adopting Western social activities and establishing their own exclusive social spaces similar to those of the Europeans. As in the British clubs, the Chinese Recreation Club’s screening process was rigorous, and membership fees were high. Club rules were strict, and proper cricket and tennis whites were required. The club’s directors and members were some of the best-known Chinese and Eurasian men of the colony. Emergence of A Local Identity Up until the 1967 riots launched by local factory workers against exploitation, ‘Hong Kong had operated under the typical colonial marriage of authoritative government and a small but powerful community of businessmen and industrialists’. The riots eventually prompted the colonial government to invest in public infrastructure and social welfare and increase representation of local Chinese in the government. Meanwhile, the government implemented a number of policies to cultivate a Hong Kong identity. After the suppression of the rioting, the British continued to be wary of the revolutionary zeal still raging in China at the time of the Cultural Revolution. It was, consequently, important, for thesake of eff ective governance, to nurture a sense of Hong Kong identity to counter the Chinese threat. Using various measures, such as cultural and recreational activities, the government started a long-term campaign to promote Hong Kong as a modern, orderly,
international city, in contrast to China, which it portrayed as chaotic,
poor, and backward. Since the Communist Party took over the mainland in 1940s, there had been huge contrasts between Hong Kong and mainland China: stability versus chaos, capitalism versus communism, Western versus Chinese, free versus unfree, wealthy versus poor, developed versus backward. These contrasts were especially pronounced during a series of tragedies that happened on the mainland, such as the Great Famine and the Cultural Revolution. As China opened up itself to the outside world and industrialised rapidly, Hong Kong has become a lot less special. However, a sense of specialness endured among mang Hong Kong people, especially the young. Post-handover, the old colonial system with which the British governed is still very much in place. The difference is, local business tycoons have replaced their old British partners as the new overlords of Hong Kong. The continuation of this system has led to appalling levels of income disparity and social segregation along economic and cultural lines. China becomes an easy target for ordinary people to direct their anger at. Anti-China sentiments in Western media were quickly picked up by local youth and taken to extremes. Mainstream local media have been full of negative coverage of China, from misbehaving mainland tourists, to product quality scandals. On the other hand, by glorifying the colonial history, even the ordinary people can maintain a sense of moral and cultural superiority to their mainland counterparts. All colonial legacies, regardless of their impact on Hong Kong, have become cherished. For example, English, the former ruler’s language, remains one of the two official languages of Hong Kong and is widely used as the business and academic language. A high proficiency is necessary for young people to enter ‘high-end professions’, such as finance, law, medicine and academia. Wealthy Hongkongers tend to send their children to ridiculously expensive English-speaking international schools and eventually English-speaking countries for university education. The insistence on English in elite industries has constituted a barrier for those who are not fortunate enough to receive an English-language education. Nonetheless, Hong Kong people take great pride in their ability to speak (some) English, a symbol of their mixed heritage, despite the noticeable decline of English proficiency since the handover. My alma mater, the University of Hong Kong, as the oldest university in the territory, is a prime example of such deeply engrained racial and cultural hierarchy in Hong Kong society. It brands itself as a Western-style university with English as the main instruction medium while most non-academic activities are dominated by local students and conducted in Cantonese. Non-local students who do not look Western enough (read ‘Caucasian’) routinely face isolation at best, hostility at worst, from local students. Juwon Park, a recent graduate, wrote a brilliant article on this issue. Another colonial legacy that has yet to be repealed is the lassez faire economic policy. With free flow of capital, little government intervention and low taxes, Hong Kong has become a capitalist heaven, constantly ranked as one of the best places to do business in the world. Neoliberalism is more pronounced in Hong Kong than in the US or the UK and has caused serious social problems, such as wholly unaffordable property prices. However, Hong Kong has yet to see a socialist movement akin to those that have taken shape in the West in recent years, exemplified by Jeremy Corbyn and Bernie Sanders. Sinophobia in Postcolonial Hong Kong Negative sentiments against mainland Chinese are certainly justified in certain cases, given China’s mixed international reputation and a flux of mainland tourists who grew up in Mao’s China or its destructive legacies. However, such innocent grievances can easily lead to an us-versus-them nativism, especially when combined with often grossly exaggerated coverage by local media, Hong Kong’s declining economic superiority and cultural influence, deeply engrained colonial hierarchy, and widening wealth gaps. With 92% of its population being ethnic Han-Chinese, Hong Kong is Chinese. The proportion in other Han-majority jurisdictions: mainland China (91.51%), Taiwan (95%), Macau (95%) and Singapore (76.2%). Legally speaking, the vast majority of Hong Kong’s permanent residents are PRC citizens and hold the HKSAR passport, a type of PRC passport specially designed for Hong Kong residents of Chinese nationality. Some Hongkongers who were born prior to the 1997 handover also hold the British National (Overseas) passport and thereby are British nationals. However, they are not British citizens and the ‘British’ passport does not grant them the right of abode in the UK. The supposed British nationality is also unrecognised by the EU. Despite their cultural heritage being predominantly Chinese with Western influences and their legal status as PRC citizens, many protesters have hurled anti-Chinese racial slurs this year while branding themselves as ‘Hongkongers’, a distinct and, inferrably, superior category from ‘Chinese’. On 21st July, thousands of anti-government protesters vandalised Beijing’s Liason Office in Hong Kong and spray-painted ‘fk Chee-na’ on the walls. The use of the term ‘Chee-na’ by young localist activists in Hong Kong dates years back. Successful in the 2016 Legislative Council election, Sixtus Leung and Yau Wai-ching, two pro-independence activitists who had participated in the Umbrella Revolution in 2014, pronounced ‘China’ as ‘Chee-na’ during the oathtaking ceremony. Yau also inserted the f-word in her oath. Both were subsequently disqualified. Jan Kiely, a professor of Chinese studies at the Chinese University of Hong Kong, said in an email that “strong feelings” were stirred in Chinese people when the Japanese Empire used the word to refer to China during its incursions into Chinese territory, from the 1894–95 Sino-Japanese War through World War II. For many Chinese today, Professor Kiely said, Chee-na recalls the sufferings of the occupation and references a Japanese imperial sense that the Chinese were inherently inferior. Using the same term as used by Japanese imperialists who inflicted decades of inhuman atrocities upon millions in China who they deemed inferior is a clear demonstration of the nativist nature of at least a considerable part of the current movement. It bears striking resemblance with the alt-right movement in America. Therefore, it should not have come as surprise that protesters marched to the US consulate in Hong Kong calling for Donald Trump to ‘liberate Hong Kong’. The ‘pro-democracy’ movement may not be as noble as it sounds. There is nothing wrong with fighting for democracy with legitimate means. However, the use of racist language goes against the very spirit of liberal democracy. One of the values often cited by protesters is the freedom of political expression. Even in Western political discourse, this freedom, like many other freedoms, is not without limits. Hate speech on racial grounds is legally prohibited in many Western countries. There is no doubt that some among the protesters are genuinely fighting for democracy for its own sake. For others, given the strong Sinophobic rhetoric used, one could not help but wonder if demanding a Western-style democratic system is yet another way for them to distinguish themselves from the backward Chinese that the colonialists looked down upon for centuries."

Dressed smartly in her ripped blue jeans and long yellow coat, her hair pulled back, and sporting a lip piercing, Shahidi stands out in the sea of modestly dressed Afghan men and women, some covered in traditional long, flowing blue burqas. Her unique ensemble is only a part of her extraordinary personality as the first female tattoo artist of Afghanistan. At great personal risk, Shahidi offers her services in a safe, nonjudgmental space to Afghan men and women who are defying social norms to etch their skin with delicate art, sentimental symbols, lines from Persian poetry, or simply the names of loved ones. “I always wanted to be a beauty artist, and since there are no such [female] tattoo artists in Afghanistan, that motivated me to be the first one in this country,” Shahidi says in an interview with Zora in a tiny borrowed studio built in an annex above a men’s hair salon. Many Afghan women are opting to get their bodies inked, not just for aesthetics but also as a form of silent rebellion and empowerment."
Medium.com,Society,Trump’s Ukraine Scandal Shows Why Leaks Are Vital to Democracy,World,https://gen.medium.com/trumps-ukraine-scandal-shows-why-leaks-are-vital-to-democracy-193048b251f7?source=topic_page---------569------------------1," onald Trump is now closer than ever to being impeached by the House. Speaker Nancy Pelosi has finally opened the door to bringing charges after Trump was caught pressuring a foreign country to help him win the 2020 election and trying to stifle a whistleblower complaint. And if impeachment indeed happens, we’ll have not only that whistleblower to thank, but also leaks to the press. As everyone now knows — and has been confirmed by a rough transcript released by the White House itself — Trump tried to push Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelenskiy to investigate Democratic presidential hopeful Joe Biden’s son, Hunter. Trump even offered up the Justice Department’s services to Zelenskiy in any potential criminal investigation he wished to conduct into the younger Biden. Up until a week ago, though, the public and Congress weren’t aware of any of these facts. We knew only that an unnamed intelligence official had filed a Trump-related complaint with the Director of National Intelligence (DNI), and the DNI had refused to hand over the whistleblower report to Congress, despite being required to by law. While that initial controversy did get some media coverage, it wouldn’t have been anything close to the scandal it is today if not for some dogged reporting by several news outlets. Newspapers like the Washington Post and the New York Times soon started publishing bits of information allegedly contained within the whistleblower complaint. First we learned that the complaint involved President Trump. Then we learned that it centered on a call with a foreign leader. Finally, we learned that it involved a call with the Ukrainian president and Trump’s alleged attempts to pressure Ukraine to help investigate Hunter Biden. All of this information (which has since been made public by Trump himself) was almost certainly classified. The person or people who leaked it to the Washington Post and other newspapers were breaking the law. Leaks to the press — which the Justice Department considers highly illegal — have always been vital to democracy. The Pentagon Papers leak in the 1970s sparked the Watergate scandal and, eventually, Nixon’s resignation. George W. Bush’s illegal warrantless wiretapping program and torture regime were exposed only because of those willing to break the law to tell journalists. We wouldn’t know anything about drone strikes or unprecedented cyberattacks under the Obama administration without leaks. And long before this scandal, classified leaks stopped some of Trump’s worst impulses. Lawmakers should commend not only the initial whistleblower’s bravery, but also those who had the guts to do the right thing and go to the press when the official process was being stifled. Yet members of the national security establishment constantly condemn leaks as “damaging” to national security without considering the massive public benefit they have on accountability. Intelligence agencies have always claimed whistleblowers should only go through the internal whistleblower channels, which have always been badly broken and have left many whistleblowers retaliated against, fired, or worse. Many have now laid claim that this Trump case shows that the “proper channels” work. In fact, the opposite is true. While the whistleblower did not leak anything themselves, a primary reason this is the biggest story in the country right now is because of the person (or people) who continued to give classified details about the whistleblower complaint to the press. The leaks pushed the story forward, rocketed it to the front pages of every major newspaper in the country, and led Democrats of all stripes to make the most forceful calls for impeachment yet — all of this before anyone even saw the rough phone transcript Trump released on Wednesday. While the DNI was purposefully withholding the complaint from Congress, now, thanks to all the pressure, the office officially submitted it on Wednesday. Thanks to massive public pressure, the whistleblower will likely be heard by Congress. And when that person does go before the intelligence committee, the lawmakers assembled should commend not only the initial whistleblower’s bravery, but also those who had the guts to do the right thing and go to the press when the official process was being stifled."

Medium.com,Society,Taiwan is Restricting Chinese Video Apps Like TikTok for Fear of Disinformation,World,https://ffwd.medium.com/taiwan-is-restricting-chinese-video-apps-like-tiktok-for-fear-of-disinformation-cc0a46f62af0?source=topic_page---------571------------------1," F
or years, it has been widely known that Chinese social media platforms such as WeChat and Weibo are heavily censored and subject to direct control by the state. But as relatively few used those platforms outside of China’s Great Firewall, they were not considered a threat to global discourse. Then came TikTok. ByteDance’s video streaming app has become of one the first Chinese platform to go global. Alongside other Chinese streaming apps including Tencent’s DouYu or Baidu’s iQiyi, Chinese tech companies are, finally, innovating instead of imitating and tapping into the growing global mobile video market. It’s not just the United States — India, Turkey, Russia, and Mexico are seeing Chinese apps gain millions of users. With this growth, through, comes concerns about the role of the Chinese government. The lines between China’s tech giants and the state or the ruling Communist Party are blurry. And as The Guardian reported today, ByteDance appears to limit the reach of videos on TikTok that contain information deemed sensitive to Chinese interests. “The Chinese government controls the business model and platform operation platforms of these private tech companies very tightly,” said Titus Chen, associate professor at the National Sun Yat-Sen University’s Institute of Political Science in Taiwan. “This control… gives the Chinese government power that any dictator or leader dreams about.” Moreover, China is not shy about its ambitions to control media narratives globally. “The Communist Party seeks control over key nodes of information, increasingly outside of China,” said Sarah Cook, senior research analyst for China, Hong Kong, and Taiwan at Freedom House. “At some point it will be in their interest to shift the public debate in a certain direction. Governments should be aware of that, and should be paying attention.” There is evidence this might already be happening. Hong Kong has seen consistent agitation since the introduction of a controversial extradition bill in June, and video platforms have become a battlefield between pro-democracy protesters and the Chinese state. But there is evidence that TikTok is showing users a distorted version of the protests. “Platforms are playing by different rules, and are specifically designed for broadcasting the Chinese government message” The hashtag #HongKong shows nothing of the protests, and even more specific search terms, such as 反送中, #HKProtests, #AntiELAB, pull up just a few protest videos with relatively few views. The Washington Post found similar results in their own recent investigation. Contrast this with what is happening on Twitter, Facebook, and YouTube, all of which are seeing active debate, engagement, and attempts to spread disinformation. Last month, networks of bots and fake accounts promoting Chinese propaganda were discovered and shut down by Facebook and Twitter. Twitter took an additional step to clamp down on rampant ad spending by Chinese state media, promoting their interpretations of the protests, mostly through news clips. YouTube followed with a similar move, disabling 210 channels that were spreading disinformation. Would TikTok, even under pressure, shut down a pro-China bot network, or limit the spread of state-backed media on its platform? Requests for comment from ByteDance went unanswered, though in a statement to The Guardian they said that while initially they did have some form of censorship, they “recognized that this was not the correct approach, and began working to empower local teams that have a nuanced understanding of each market.” So how can foreign governments respond to Chinese platforms being a tool for disinformation? Taiwan took possibly the harshest step earlier this year. The island nation, which has long dealt with China, which considers it a “renegade province,” announced that it would be restricting iQiyi and DouYu streaming platforms from getting business licenses in the country. When asked about the move, Taiwan’s deputy minister for mainland affairs, Chiu Chui-Cheng, clearly stated: “If Tencent’s streaming video service is trying to enter the Taiwanese market, it’s very likely that it’s a part of Beijing’s propaganda campaign.” “It was the right move,” said Caleb Chen, a Taiwanese-American privacy advocate and contributor to Privacy News Online. “Those platforms are playing by different rules, and are specifically designed for broadcasting the Chinese government message.” India took a different route ahead of its own elections earlier this year, after finding evidence that TikTok was being used by domestic actors to spread disinformation and political messaging through the campaign period. A court order forced the app to be blocked from being downloaded for about a week. In the end, TikTok removed over six million videos, added a public service announcement around political content, and even joined a state-led effort to limit fake news around the campaign period. Legislation is still being considered that would further the ability of India to control content on video streaming and chat apps. “TikTok’s growth is a legitimate concern, not only for Taiwan, but countries around the world” “I think it’s reasonable for Taiwan to approach Chinese technology with heavy suspicion,” said Nick Monaco, research director at Institute for the Future’s Digital Intelligence Lab and an expert on disinformation around elections. “This is an ever-evolving problem, and new platforms represent new vectors of disinformation.” Taiwan is the focal point due to Presidential elections in January, which are spurring active efforts to limit the impact of Chinese disinformation. Later next year are, of course, the 2020 US presidential elections, just four years after disinformation on social media platforms, most notably Facebook, played a potentially key role. What role will video streaming play in coming elections? One thing is certain. TikTok isn’t going anywhere. There was a strong Chinese presence at VidCon 2019, with the app widely considered the star of the event, gathering some of the biggest influencers at their headline party. There was little talk there about its potential political use, but as America’s own recent history, and Hong Kong, Taiwan, and India show, it might be only a matter of time before a platform considered playful and harmless becomes host to disinformation. “TikTok’s growth is a legitimate concern, not only for Taiwan, but countries around the world,” said Monaco. “The thing about online disinformation is that it’s an ever-evolving problem and for people who are working on solving the problem, it’s a moving target as well. It’s up to governments and citizens to make their level of concern aware.”"
Medium.com,Society,Corrupt Trump and Unlawful Johnson,World,https://medium.com/@stevensankey2/corrupt-trump-and-unlawful-johnson-2dd2e505e235?source=topic_page---------572------------------1," The U.S. and U.K. leaders found themselves in troubling waters on Tuesday. Here is your brief rundown. T
uesday was a monumental day for both sides of the pond in the U.K. and in the U.S. as the leaders of both countries have found themselves in rather deep waters. On the same day, the U.K. Supreme Court ruled that Prime Minister Johnson’s proroguing of Parliament was unlawful, and U.S. House of Representatives Speaker Nancy Pelosi announced a formal impeachment inquiry of President Trump after Ukrainian corruption scandal. And it’s a particularly heinous one at that. U.S. President Donald Trump has this week been embroiled in yet another scandal but this time it’s not going away. Last month an intelligence community whistleblower filed a complaint regarding a phone call between U.S. President Trump and the Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky on July 25 of this year. The complaint was not shared with Congress by the acting director of national intelligence, Joseph Maguire, even though an inspector general who handled the complaint deemed it “credible” and “urgent”. The complaint detailed a phone call with a foreigner leader and some sort of “promise” but the details of the complaint have not been publicly released. It is now believed that President Trump may have promised something to the Ukrainian President for their aid in an investigation into former Vice President and 2020 Presidential candidate Joe Biden and his son, Hunter Biden. Democratic Presidential Candidate Joe Biden is polling as Trump’s biggest rival so far in the upcoming 2020 Presidential election. It was later released that almost $400 million in aid funding was temporarily withheld from Ukraine by the White House in the summer. It is thought that this could have been used to coerce the Ukrainian President into complying with Trump’s alleged request for corruption investigations into Joe and Hunter Biden. Trump has since made multiple varying statements as to why this aid was temporarily withheld. If such events were true then Trump could be found guilty of enlisting a foreigner agency for the purposes of meddling in a presidential election. An allegation which rings eerily familiar to the Robert Mueller investigation between the Russian interference of the 2016 U.S. Presidential election and then Presidential candidate Donald Trump. This also comes after allegations of obstruction of justice following said Mueller report, and profiting off of the presidency after Vice President Mike Pence stayed at a Trump hotel in Ireland nearly 200 miles away from Dublin, where he was set to visit. As of late, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-CA 12th District) has been famously wary of the prospect of impeaching President Trump, amid fears that it would alienate voters. However, on Tuesday Pelosi announced that the House will begin a formal impeachment inquiry of President Trump amid a rise in calls to do so from one hundred and eighty Democrats (out of the 235-member caucus). Some have even gone as far as calling for drafting of articles of impeachment. It seems that this newest Ukrainian scandal has worn thin the Democrat’s patience and forced Pelosi’s hand. “The actions of the Trump presidency have revealed the dishonourable fact of the president’s betrayal of his oath of office, betrayal of our national security and betrayal of the integrity of our elections. Therefore, today, I am announcing the House of Representatives is moving forward with an official impeachment inquiry.” — House Speaker Nancy Pelosi Meanwhile, President Trump authorised the release of the “complete” and “unredacted” transcript of his July 25 phone call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky. And no, we’re not talking about your Snapchat. Following the U.K. Prime Minister Boris Johnson’s controversial move to prorogue Parliament for five weeks, until October 14, the U.K. Supreme Court heard evidence last week for two appeals: one against the London High Court ruling that this was not a matter for the courts to decide; and another against the Scottish appeals court ruling the prorogation to be unlawful. Proroguing, or suspending, Parliament is a rather usual thing to do for a new government, so it can outline its policies in a Queen’s speech at the end of the prorogation. However, due to the timing and unusual length of Johnson’s prorogation in the lead up to the October 31 Brexit deadline, many believed he was attempting to stop Parliamentary scrutiny of his Brexit strategy. As is normal, Parliament does not vote on its prorogation, that prerogative rests with the Monarch, on the advice of the Privy Council and the current Prime Minister. On Tuesday, the U.K. Supreme Court ruled unanimously that PM Johnson’s prorogation was “unlawful” and that his advice to Her Majesty was “unlawful, void and of no effect”. “The decision to advise Her Majesty to prorogue Parliament was unlawful because it had the effect of frustrating or preventing the ability of Parliament to carry out its constitutional functions without reasonable justification.” — Supreme Court president Lady Hale Speaking from New York, Prime Minister Johnson said on Tuesday that he “strongly disagree[s] with what the justices have found” and that he doesn’t think that “it’s right” but would “respect it”. He went on to say that there is “a good case for getting on with a Queen’s speech anyway” and that the most important thing is that “we get on and deliver Brexit”. “I do think there is a good case for getting on with a Queen’s speech anyway, and we’ll do that. But I think the most important thing is we get on and deliver Brexit on October 31” — U.K. Prime Minister Boris Johnson Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn, amongst others, have called for Johnson’s resignation but as of yet PM Johnson has not commented on whether he is intending to resign following the Supreme Court ruling."
Medium.com,Society,Today Was Trump’s Best Day in the Ukraine Scandal,World,https://medium.com/p/89a1b58617d3?source=topic_page---------573------------------1," ovies and television have conditioned us to believe that political schemes are concocted in secret, smoky rooms by political geniuses and corporate lobbyists. We’ve been told there is a devious, intelligent craft to their designs. But what if they’re just a bunch of dumb, greedy goons who think they’re shaking down a flower shop owner? That’s the lesson to take away from the official notes from the July 25, 2019, Trump-Zelensky call. The notes represent the most damning, clear-cut evidence in a political scandal since then-Cincinnati Mayor Jerry Springer paid for sex with a check. Every relevant piece of evidence we need is right there in the notes of this “perfect call,” as President Donald Trump called it. Yes, it is perfect. It is clear and it is overt. The corruption winds itself through the entire conversation in ways that seem too obvious to imagine any politician — let alone the titular Leader of the Free World — ever speaking aloud. “I would like you to do us a favor… ” That is how Trump starts out a long section of the conversation wherein he sought help to undermine special counsel Robert Mueller and spark an investigation into former vice president and 2020 presidential candidate Joe Biden. And he explicitly directed Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky to talk to Trump’s personal attorney and the U.S. attorney general to carry out this scheme. The political world spent weeks earlier this year parsing whether Trump had “directed” or “instructed” Michael Cohen to lie to Congress, a rhetorical trick that squelched the one real spasm of impeachment momentum. The GOP’s long-standing, if-you-squint-maybe-it’s-not-so-bad defenses of Trump are no longer operable. Are they willing to flush their own good names down the toilet for a ham-fisted goon who doesn’t even know to not say the quiet part out loud on a recorded call with a head of state? We may not see this play out publicly for days or even weeks, but the politics of this scandal changed dramatically with the release of this transcript. No longer will Republicans be able to wave this away. The facts are right there — and each and every member of the Republican Senate Conference will now have to put their names down in the history books. Each GOP member now knows that their personal legacy is bound up in Trump. They will have to proactively choose whether to sanction this gross, bumbling, clear-cut corruption… or not. They are now playing to history. The essential facts of this scandal are already written. There’s no avoiding it anymore, and no way to muddy up the waters after “I would like you to do us a favor.” Each of those senators has built an entire life and career without the help of Trump. They are accomplished and powerful — and, like most accomplished and powerful people, they are incredibly vain. Are they willing to flush their own good names down the toilet for a ham-fisted goon who doesn’t even know to not say the quiet part out loud on a recorded call with a head of state? And are they even sure we’ve seen the worst of it? We still have the whistleblower report to come. We still have subpoenas of communications between the Department of Justice and Rudy Giuliani (and the State Department and Rudy Giuliani, and Secretary of Treasury Steve Mnuchin and Rudy Giuliani, and acting White House chief of staff Mick Mulvaney and Rudy Giuliani, and on and on). Today was the highpoint of this scandal for Trump — a controlled release of a document only the White House and its allies got to see before the public. Nothing else from this moment on is within Trump’s control. Republicans would be wise to look past this frenetic news cycle and decide whether they want to give Trump complete control over the first line of their obituaries. On behalf of his party, Sen.

Medium.com,Society,The Colossal Scale Of China’s Military Buildup,World,https://medium.com/@joshuafkon/the-colossal-scale-of-chinas-military-buildup-3cea10106c7c?source=topic_page---------577------------------1," If you’re an avid China watcher you probably already know that the military balance of power in Asia has shifted significantly over the last two decades. However, if you’re just now starting to take a closer look at the region given the heightened US-China tensions with the ongoing trade war, then you may not fully grasp the scale of China’s recent military buildup. Based on current trends, respected analysts predict that China could achieve military parity with the United States in less than fifteen years. We must be wary of extrapolating too far into the future from trends which may not continue. There are a host of challenges currently facing Beijing. China has an approaching demographic cliff, an asset bubble worse than Japan’s in the 1990s, and worries about capital flight if the yuan continues to devalue. COMPARING US AND CHINA’S MILITARY SPENDING Regardless, China’s astounding economic growth over the last few decades has already resulted in a dramatic shift in military power on the ground. Although The US military still surpasses China’s, in many realistic conflict scenarios China already now holds the advantage. You may be surprised that China is closing the gap with the US militarily if you have heard the often repeated statistic that the US spends more on defense than “the next eight nations combined.” While this statistic is technically true, It is grossly misleading. A classic example of lies, damn lies, and statistics. While the US still outspends China by a wide margin this gap is far less significant than it first appears. When comparing the military expenditures of different nations there are key adjustments that must be made for the comparison to be meaningful. Firstly, there is the issue of purchasing power parity. In today’s world of free-floating currencies, it is common for countries to manipulate the currency exchanges to boost their own exports (For the mechanics of how this works see: Why Did China Just Devalue the Yuan). What this means is that the prices of currencies themselves can be manipulated. Currencies can be undervalued or overvalued relative to each other. One might logically suppose that when six Turkish Lira can be exchanged for one American dollar, the actual purchasing power of one dollar would be roughly the same as six Turkish Lira. In other words, if a cheeseburger cost $5 in the United States, when you exchange currency you may get ¥500 yen, but a cheeseburger in Japan should then cost roughly ¥500 yen. But this is not the case. Many nations manipulate the currency exchanges to undervalue the purchasing power parity (PPP) of their own currencies. Making everything priced in their currency cheaper for buyers from foreign countries. Because of this, a direct comparison of military spending in dollar terms without adjusting for the purchasing power parity (PPP) drastically underestimates other nations’ military expenditures — especially when produced domestically. Looking at a comparison of US and China’s military spending adjusted for PPP makes a dramatic difference. Additionally, While China has been focusing on building a modern navy and hypersonic missile technology, the United States has spent a great deal of its military budget over the last few decades fighting hugely expensive wars in Iraq and Afghanistan. If you take the direct costs of the conflicts out of the U.S. Defense budget, the situation becomes even more realistic, and it becomes clear how China has been able to catch up to the U.S. militarily. However, even adjusting for PPP and the Mid-East wars does not fully capture how much the US spends on personal costs and benefits compared to the Chinese (almost 40% of US defense spending goes directly to personal salaries and benefits). That’s why when Bloomberg looked at this same issue in “China Outspends the U.S. on Defense? Here’s the Math”, they went even further in their analysis of the two countries military spending. They attempted to take into account the substantially higher salary costs of the all-volunteer US military and concluded that China likely already outspends the US on defense when the pay and benefits are taken into account. Bonus Graph: Current Chinese Military Capabilities The massive increase in Chinese military spending, as we have seen, is already near parity with US spending in realistic terms (and arguably surpasses if you account for personal costs). Naturally, the massive increase in military spending has significantly improved Chinese military capabilities. Again, even more than simply looking at even the adjusted numbers would suggest, as Chinese resources are concentrated in Asia while the United States has resources dispersed around the globe. According to the 2018 annual report of congressional commission — U.S.-China Economic and Security Review, the decades of modernization and buildup of the PLA has: …already resulted in a force capable of contesting U.S. operations in the region, presenting challenges to the U.S. military’s longstanding assumption of enjoying ground, air, maritime, and information dominance in a conflict in the post-Cold War era. In war games simulating great-power conflicts held by RAND Corporation, China now consistently comes out on top. In a report on the wargames, Breaking Defense quotes RAND analyst David Ochmanek who says that “In our games, when we fight Russia and China,” “blue [the color traditionally representing the US in the games] gets its ass handed to it.” This is because the massive increase in military spending has transformed China’s military — particularly their navy. According to a recent Reuters special report on the modernization of the Chinese navy: In just over two decades, the People’s Liberation Army (PLA), the Chinese military, has mustered one of the mightiest navies in the world. This increased Chinese firepower at sea — complemented by a missile force that in some areas now outclasses America’s — has changed the game in the Pacific. The expanding naval force is central to President Xi Jinping’s bold bid to make China the preeminent military power in the region. In raw numbers, the PLA navy now has the world’s biggest fleet. It is also growing faster than any other major navy. While the U.S. navy still surpasses China in quality and tonnage if not in number of ships, this gap is quickly closing. Moreover, some have argued that the PLA’s missile force could neutralize much of the US’s current advantages. Reuters reports that (A result of the INF Missile treaty tying the US’s hands in Asia) the Chinese have an edge over the United States in missile capability: With the Pentagon distracted by almost two decades of costly war in the Middle East and Afghanistan, the Chinese military, the People’s Liberation Army (PLA), has exploited a period of sustained budget increases and rapid technical improvement to build and deploy an arsenal of advanced missiles. Many of these missiles are specifically designed to attack the aircraft carriers and bases that form the backbone of U.S. military dominance in the region and which for decades have protected allies including Japan, South Korea and Taiwan. Even China’s nuclear capabilities have made significant improvements. According to analysis from the RAND corporation: Nuclear exchange modeling suggests that, as late as 2003, only a handful of Chinese systems might have survived a U.S. first strike — and even this outcome would have depended largely on China deploying its single, unreliable Xia class SSBN (ballistic missile submarine) prior to an attack. In the 2010 and 2017 cases, more Chinese warheads survive, and no foreign leader could contemplate a disarming first-strike against China with any degree of confidence. Tactical vs Strategic Victory Despite China’s massive military buildup, China has natural geographic disadvantages. China is boxed in — surrounded by historic enemies, many of whom are US allies. Moreover, even if China was to achieve military success — in the strategic sense it would likely be a pyrrhic victory. China is dependent on the global economy in a way the US is not. Trade makes up almost 40% of China’s GDP — much of it with the US and its allies. China is also the world’s largest oil importer. China might be close to being able to achieve a military victory, but it has quite a bit to go before the country could best US and achieve a strategic success. Key Takeaways The real struggle between China and the United States is likely to continue to remain in the economic realm — making it important to understand Why Did China Just Devalue The Yuan?

Medium.com,Society,The End of the American Century,World,https://medium.com/@drillbitnews/the-end-of-the-american-century-9f59bfc84454?source=topic_page---------580------------------1," America no longer wants to lead the World, and both our enemies and allies have noticed. The American Century is over. The country no longer wants to be tied down by the principles and laws of international relations that we helped create. America is tired of managing the system of global governance created after the allied victory in World War II. Most importantly, America has given up on being the leader of the world that it worked so hard to make free. Like other great empires of history, the cost of maintaining control of the over the international system has proven to be too much. Unlike those empires, it has been the cultural and political rather than economic costs that have led to the end of the American Century. Foundations In February 1941 Henry Luce, the creator of Time magazine, published an article entitled “The American Century.” In it he argued that America was facing a great decision: should the country lead the war against fascism despite not being directly threatened by it? It was a turning point in the history of American foreign-policy because in one succinct argument Luce explained why the United States had to give up its historical attachment to isolationism and instead embrace its destiny as the leader of the free world. This was a moment that the United States had begun preparing for three decades earlier. The foundations of a New World Order were created at the end of the First World War by American president Woodrow Wilson and his new liberal internationalism. His “Fourteen Points” speech established principles such as the promotion of diplomacy, respect for international law, and the right of self-determination over the realpolitik of European states that had led to the “war to end all wars.” Victory in World War II convinced America and the world of the righteousness of these principles leading to the creation of a system of international organizations to protect and promote them. American leadership of this new system meant including the additional ideals of democracy, free trade, and respect for human rights. And there was no greater symbol of American leadership or the new system than creation of the United Nations. It was through the UN, from the Security Council and International Court of Justice to UNICEF and the WTO, that the entire world would benefit from the new American Century. It was a unique time in human history, but not because of the country’s astounding economic growth or its prominent role in the defeat of Hitler and fascism. It was the American Century because the country had committed itself to helping the rest of the world fashion their own versions of the American dream. The Unipolar Moment At the end of World War II the United States was the most powerful country the world had ever seen. We possessed conventional military power that rivaled all except the Soviet Union, and with the invention of the atom bomb the country was able to surpass even Stalin’s military might. There may have been a growing threat of international communism, but most of the world would soon be free from the grips of colonialism and imperialism. And so, the United States set about creating a system that would offer the newly liberated opportunities for democracy and prosperity. Despite those efforts a new and potentially more destructive Cold War broke out. Within five years of America’s rise to dominance the Soviet Union tested their own nuclear weapon and China, the most populous country on earth and an ally of the United States throughout WW II, was taken over by a communist regime. America’s leadership of the postwar world would not come without challenge. But as has often been the case in American history, victory in conflict reinforces the guiding principles that cause Americans to want to fight and lead in the first place. Just as the defeat of Nazism became the genesis of America’s desire to lead the world, the eventual defeat of the Soviets in the Cold War justified that leadership. No leader is perfect, and the mark of a great leader is to never forget that. America made some truly terrible mistakes during the Cold War. From the Vietnam War to supporting coups against unfriendly regimes around the world, US leadership was often as flawed by ideology and miscalculation as the Soviets. The difference between the two was America’s goal of promoting liberty and economic opportunity for all the world’s citizens. It was the allure of American idealism combined with its cultural, economic, and political vibrance that convinced most observers that the end justified the means. And when victory in the Cold War did come America was ready to celebrate by enjoying the peace dividend that so many had worked and died for. It was not just that the country would be able to transition billions of dollars from military to social programs creating room for new intellectual and technological growth. People around the world believed that the end of the Cold War marked a new age of democracy, free trade, and global peace. All of this would be accomplished through American leadership and vision using the international system of governance which had continued to evolve throughout the Cold War. The pinnacle achievement of America’s leadership of the new system of multilateralism was the 1991 Gulf War and liberation of Kuwait. It represented a coming together of American power, the fruits of its leadership of the free world, and a global commitment to do things differently than the past. Instead of war prone alliances or a world divided by the US-Soviet rivalry, global peace would be pursued through ‘coalitions of the willing’ committed to stopping aggression and despotism. The consistent reliance on UN resolutions indicated to many that a renewed emphasis on international law would be used by the strong to protect the weak. Cooperation from countries across the political spectrum was a key symbol of the new political order and international relations. And most importantly, US leadership of the effort gave the concept of collective security legitimacy over previous attempts to establish lasting global peace. When considered in relation to America’s dominance of the new technological battlefield and the decisive victory it had produced, there seemed no doubt that a new age of peace and prosperity were on the horizon. Unfortunately, America and the rest of the world had each begun to question whether the New World Order was best for their individual self-interests. And the rise of these new divisions, combined with the development of international terrorism and religious extremism, helped accelerate the decline and fall of American leadership we are witnessing today. The Decline Academics argue that empires decline and fall through some combination of three causes: increasing costs of maintaining territory/control, cultural decline, and political fragmentation. Compared to previous empires like the Romans and the British, the United States developed a uniquely different relationship with the system it came to dominate. Rather than physically controlling other states or collections of territories, the United States developed an interrelated system of political and economic organizations through which it sought to influence rather than force compliance. The result was that US leadership was not resisted by other states in the same way that empires of antiquity were. American hegemony was further strengthened by its geographic isolation and its abundance of natural resources. This allowed the United States to adopt a policy of selective engagement, getting involved in international affairs only when it related to American national interests. And the entire system seemed to be working as long as America’s national interests continued to coincide with those of the global community. But even before victory in the Persian Gulf there were dark clouds obscuring the peace and prosperity that many were hoping was just over the horizon. The First Gulf War was the shining example of how US leadership and the new system it had built would work to promote world peace. If the US was willing to intervene against aggression and inhumanity through cooperative efforts such as UN peacekeeping the potential of the New World Order could be realized. Unfortunately, events such as the Bosnian War and the failed peacekeeping operation in Somalia all but eliminated public support for the type of direct US leadership of collective security that had made the Persian Gulf War such an overwhelming victory. During the 1990s the UN became the focal point of more aggressive efforts to engage global problems in the areas of human rights, environmentalism, and economic inequality. Many of these efforts were the direct result of a post-Cold War US focus on the promotion of democracy, respect for human rights and international law, and protection of free trade. During the same time however, American voters started becoming more conservative, especially as it related to international relations. There were increasingly loud voices in domestic politics that questioned the international economic system, the existence of global warming, and even the need for the United Nations itself. Combined with latent attachments to isolationism and increasing self-sufficiency the United States was growing less concerned with ‘being the world’s policeman’. And then the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001 changed everything. The Fall Initially the US response to the 9/11 attacks seemed to be a catalyst for reinvigorating its role of international leadership. But it quickly became apparent that the America was going to ignore and potentially even overturn many of the principles that had become the foundation of international relations. The country was willing to violate key tenets of human rights and international law if it meant being able to extract revenge from Al Qaeda and its supporters. The ‘extraordinary renditions program’, waterboarding, and the illegal surveillance of its own citizens were proof to many that the United States was ignoring the rules that it had for decades compelled the rest of the international community to adhere to. While the success of the First Gulf War had been evidence of the power and promise of US leadership, the 2003 invasion of Iraq was proof that America had forsaken multilateralism for self-interested unilateralism. More ominously, the country had adopted a Manichaean “you’re either with us, or against us” approach to international relations that saw security as the primary issue of focus for the global community. On the one hand the United States and its close allies were fully committed to confronting the new aggression of religious extremism. On the other, the humanitarian and legal pillars of the system the United States had worked so hard to build were now being undermined by its own policies and behaviors. America was growing less concerned with environmentalism, more willing to work with rogues and pariahs using the ‘enemy of my enemy is my friend’ philosophy, all the while ignoring the rise of humanitarian issues around the world. And as the War on Terror now nears the end of its second decade even America’s will to continue a proactive and comprehensive fight against extremist terrorism seems to be waning. Donald Trump is not responsible for the end of the American Century. He has however overseen an acceleration towards the finish line by exaggerating aspects of cultural decline and political fragmentation within the country. He did not create the long-standing culture of isolationism within the United States. But his abuse of xenophobic and nationalistic rhetoric has reawakened the notion for many Americans that the rest of the world needs us much more than we need them. Divisions between conservatives and liberals, Democrats and Republicans, and even different ethnic groups have existed in the country since its birth. But as the most important political figure in the United States and the leader of the free world President Trump has gone out of his way to widen these political divides. The result is that the country has chosen a path of ‘America first’ which from a variety of different international perspectives is increasingly being interpreted as ‘only America’. Across every component of the international system US leadership or participation has been withdrawn from key agreements and treaties. More alarmingly, many of these reversals have yet to be replaced by alternatives of any kind. So, while some in the country celebrated the US withdrawal from the Trans-Pacific Partnership, the reality is that the organization has since moved forward opening the door for China to become the primary economic power in Southeast Asia. Similarly, the president’s constant bickering with NATO may be the final impetus needed for Europe to begin developing their own independent security infrastructure. Despite attacks against previous nonproliferation efforts towards both Iran and North Korea, there continues to be little real progress in developing new frameworks for disarmament in either case. Early administration promises notwithstanding, the overall situation in the Middle East continues to deteriorate as wars in Yemen and Syria continue to drag on, all as the recent attack in Saudi Arabia indicates an emboldened Iran. There are clear indications that rather than being defeated, religious extremism has fragmented and metastasized across both the African and South Asian regions. And yet American public support for globalism and management of the international system in general has declined so dramatically that there seems to be little concern about any of these issues as long as they are taking place anywhere else but the United States. President Ronald Reagan once spoke of America as “a shining city upon a hill whose beacon light guides freedom loving people everywhere.” The power of the sentiment was that not only did it highlight the American belief in its own ideals, it captured the world’s acceptance of American leadership as recognition of the righteousness of those ideals. As the American Century ends, we must now consider that the shining city has been replaced by a towering fortress intended to protect rather than project the beacon of American nobility. Moving forward America will continue to be confronted by a global need for direction and leadership. And if we continue to abdicate that role it is inevitable that another country will eventually try to take it for themselves."
Medium.com,Society,The Conservative party has a selective outrage problem,World,https://medium.com/@liambarrett1996/the-conservative-party-has-a-selective-outrage-problem-f7aaa68a8e27?source=topic_page---------581------------------1," When explaining the selective outrage that pervades across the Tory leadership and its rank-and-file members, the term hypocrisy comes to mind. However, all politician across the wide-ranging spectrum have been accused of hypocrisy throughout their careers. With conservatives anxiously scrambling to retain power in parliament and Downing Street, their blatant hypocritical manoeuvres are doing worse damage. The rise of Boris Johnson to the prime ministerial position has seen the Tory party delve into a proxy Brexit war. To silence his critics with a sheer abomination of democracy, Johnson decided to prorogue parliament for the unnerving period of 5 weeks. Although prorogation is an absolute calamity in itself, recently demanded unlawful and now considered null and void by the Supreme Court, one can only imagine immense outrage if the opposition did the same. Jeremy Corbyn, disavowed by many of his right-wing counterparts as a communist and “loony leftie”, would face utter excoriation if he took the proroguing step. Conservatives would be frothing at the mouth if prorogation happened whilst they were on the opposition benches. Corbyn would be vilified for pushing the country towards a Soviet-style reckoning intent on demolishing democracy for his own socialist alignment. The right-wing would be mightily unified to thwart a socialist government under Corbyn and his cronies. Instead, when they are the ones who prorogue, only 21 are willing to stand and counter-argue the dangers of suspension in delivering Brexit. Only 21 are willing to sacrifice their positions in a party moving full speed ahead towards the far right. Furthermore, now Boris Johnson is at the helm of a new unelected government, he stills holds on to a 15-point lead over Labour in a general election poll. The suspension of parliament and its dire ramifications are not the sole example of selective outrage in politics right now. With a surge in racism across the landscape, both the Labour and Conservative parties have had their fair share of racist incidents taking place amongst their membership. The issue of antisemitism and Labour’s handling of it has caused widespread condemnation from the mainstream media and the Tories. The suspension, re-introduction and then permanent expulsion of former Labour MP, Chris Williamson, has attracted vast news coverage in contrast to the revolting Islamophobia that is seeping from conservative ranks. Yes, Chris Williamson was tone deaf to an ongoing scandal when he remarked that Labour were “too apologetic” towards their antisemitic accusations. His brief reinstatement as parliamentarian received more revulsion than the 15 Conservative party members who were allowed to return to the party after gross allegations of anti-Islam social media posts were made against them. Also, in a recent poll of Tory members, around 56% were surveyed to have said that Islam was a genuine threat to the British way of life. No prominent conservative politician or cabinet member rebuked the result of the poll, but why would they when the party’s elected leader has compared Muslim women in full-face veils as “bank robbers”? To say Corbyn has been mute on allegations of anti-Semitism would be intellectually dishonest. He has deplored the disgusting antisemitic smears as an affront to his party’s anti-racist stance. He has formally adopted the International Holocaust Remembrance Alliance’s clear definitions for antisemitism. The same can’t be said for the Conservative party in regards to their increasing Islamophobic rhetoric. Every politician has been tarnished with the hypocrite brush before. The Tories go one step further by brandishing a Corbyn-led Labour party as chaotic and entirely unelectable whilst governing a warring and fractured party that has just lost its last holding majority in parliament. To attack your opponents is natural, but to nit-pick and strategically choose what you abhor enters a dangerous territory in the political quest for power."
Medium.com,Society,Has the Belt and Road Initiative become a political liability for China?,World,https://medium.com/@1556865737385/has-the-belt-and-road-initiative-become-a-political-liability-for-china-3939b33542c9?source=topic_page---------582------------------1," Alicia Garcia Herrero, Natixis Asia Pacific Chief Economist, Bruegel Senior Fellow; Since President Xi Jingping announced the Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) in late 2013, shortly after his arrival to power, China has invested some $300 billion in it, mainly in connectivity among neighboring countries. While the project is only five years old, President Xi Jingping’s grand plan for China’s global expansion has elicited strong reactions from the rest of the world, both from countries that will benefit from the BRI as well as other major players, such as the United States and the European Union. Over the five years since its announcement, the BRI has evolved in terms of its objectives: from its initial economic focus related to trade connectivity — and a way for China to export its excess capacity — to much more of a soft-power tool. A large number of the BRI’s infrastructure projects now appear to be strategic rather than economic in nature. This change in tone is associated with the increasingly negative view of BRI in the West. The EU has expressed concerns about China’s strategic ambition at the annual EU-China summit in April 2019. Nonetheless, this has not stopped Italy from becoming the first G7 country to formally join the BRI. There also has been backlash in the developing world where recipients of BRI’s infrastructure projects are in desperate need of funding to pay off their borrowing. A recent analysis that we conducted confirmed that sentiment toward the Belt and Road has indeed worsened in many countries. Our report, which drew data from the Global Database of Events, Language, Tone (GDELT) that covers broadcast, online and printed news from 132 countries in over 100 languages, shows a sharp move away from an average positive image before 2018 to a negative one thereafter. The only exceptions are the Middle East and North Africa. The worsening image of BRI is a wake-up call for China as it seeks to increase its soft power globally. Our analysis offers some insights into the reasons for the worsening image of BRI. The first and foremost is trade. Countries appear increasingly wary of excessive dependence on Chinese imports and an imbalanced trade pattern. For investment, while our study shows that it is not generally as negatively perceived as trade, there are a number of salient issues which are closely related to investment, i.e. debt dynamics for the recipient country, environmental issues. More generally, China may have been piling up too many objectives under the guise of the BRI, some of which could be inconsistent with one another. In particular, China tries to replicate its internal way of doing business in overseas markets: using China’s resources and materials with a clear flavor of state capitalism. While keeping state-owned companies busy with BRI projects may be appealing from an economic perspective, it only exacerbates foreign concerns, weakening China’s international image. Most of the recipient countries welcome infrastructure financing from China, but also expect transparency and fair competition. The latter is at odds with China’s existing strategy. The fact that the BRI’s image is suffering is also demonstrated by the announcement of alternative proposals from both the U.S., through its Indo-Pacific strategy with Australia, India and Japan, and the EU with its EU-Asia connectivity plan. Some argue that the BRI may have been the tipping point for the U.S. administration to move from engagement to containing China, which has contributed to the current trade war between the two. While painful, this is not a completely negative outcome for China, as it is clearly learning how difficult it is to acquire soft power, no matter a country’s economic size. In fact, such a backlash offers China an opportunity to explore a more sustainable strategy. China is realizing that aggressive expansion will trigger a confrontation with the U.S., and it is definitely not a winning strategy for China in spite of its economic benefits. Given the diminishing returns on investment at home, China needs to expand in overseas markets, but it should not do so by excluding other investors from benefiting from such projects. Against this backdrop, the next path for China’s Belt and Road needs to be a more flexible and open route to building its soft-power image. To that end, China has recently made a number of strategic changes regarding the BRI, which have largely remained unnoticed, given the lower-key approach. First, China has sharply increased the number of countries signing MOUs from the original 63 to 131. The key is to make the Belt and Road less targeted, so as to limit the West’s geopolitical concerns about this project. Secondly, China is trying to use a more multilateral framework to push the BRI, and especially by involving the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank. Such a multilateral framework retains Chinese characteristics, thereby allowing China to keep the ultimate control of key projects, but it also offers room for other developed countries to get involved, especially Europe and South Korea. That said, China may be also willing to make some compromises in the way it shares the benefits of the BRI, but multilateralizing the strategy does not equate to a full retreat to the Western model. No matter how bitter it is to the existing order, the emergence of China with its unique system is reshaping the word, and the BRI is an important part of the process. The increasingly negative world response should not be regarded as the end of the project, but rather as wake-up call for China and, thus, a push to reshape the strategy towards a more open and multilateral one. Still, China is bound to remain at the center and maintain the husband-spoke approach to the BRI but with more market-based international cooperation. *This article was presented at the following conference taking place in Shanghai on September 20th,2019.

Medium.com,Society,Four Fallacies at the Heart of Brexit,World,https://medium.com/@frankparker/four-fallacies-at-the-heart-of-brexit-bf2eacdb5a20?source=topic_page---------583------------------1," This is predicated on the fact that we buy more goods from the other 27 member states than they collectively do from us. Hardly surprising, given that there are more of them. But that, like the assertion, misses the point of the Single Market which is what it says it is — a geographically large home market. Not “us and them”, just “us”, the 28 member nations. In theory it should be as easy for a business in Liverpool to trade with ones in Berlin and Milan as it is to trade with businesses in Birmingham and Manchester. The only impediments are the distances travelled and the need for currency exchange. This latter, by the way, is one reason why it would be advantageous for the UK to join the Euro. It is also to overlook the way in which modern manufacturing businesses operate. Complex products, such as vehicles and domestic appliances, have parts sourced from various member nations and are assembled in another. Few products can any longer be described as “British made” or, for that matter, “Made in France” or “Made in Germany”. That extends, too, to the ownership of most businesses. Many of the largest companies operating in the UK and across the EU today are owned by enterprises and/or entrepreneurs based in India, China, Japan and elsewhere. A similar situation pertains in the case of food production. On the island of Ireland, a cow born in Northern Ireland can be grown to maturity in the Republic and vice-versa, some times on the same farm! This is one of the reasons the notion of border controls between the two is impossible to contemplate. Where we quite definitely need the EU more than any of the other 27 member nations need us is in trading with non-EU countries. The EU has established special trading arrangements with some 70 such countries, including most recently Japan, Australia and the group of South American nations belonging to the MERCOSUR partnership. Outside of the EU, the UK will need to negotiate its own new relationship with those nations. To evaluate this statement it’s a good idea to examine how democracy works in practice in the UK. Suppose a group of individuals feel they are disadvantaged, either by some existing legislation or by a proposed new regulation. They seek out a sympathetic politician and explain their concerns to him or her. Assuming the politician shares their concern he or she will discuss it with fellow politicians and civil servants and try to come up with an amendment or a new bill to deal with the perceived problem. Of course, this might take years, depending on whether the desired change is consistent with the ideology or general outlook of the party to which the chosen advocate belongs and whether or not that party is governing or in opposition. As the proposed legislation is discussed, both before and after it comes before the relevant authority — Parish council, County Council, devolved Assembly or the Houses of Parliament — others will be asked for their input or will come forward without having been asked, lobbying for alternative points of view to be taken into consideration. Democracy, as operated in this practical way has very little to do with elections or referendums. A problem is highlighted, possible solutions examined and a decision taken whether or not to implement a solution. The result may not command the support of the majority of the electorate who might make their feelings known at a subsequent election, although there is no guarantee that a change of government, even if achieved, will lead to the repeal of the unpopular piece of legislation. There is within this process a number of opportunities for corruption; for some powerful individual or organisation to offer incentives to politicians or their party in order to ensure a particular outcome. There are various safeguards built in to the process in order to prevent this. Now, if this broadly characterises the way local authorities and the national parliament operate in the UK, how does it compare with the way legislation is formed in the EU? Objectively viewed it appears that democracy in the EU operates in much the same way. For “unelected bureaucracy” read civil service (or council officials); for “unrepresentative council” read ministers, elected in their own member countries and operating as a cabinet. For “toothless parliament” read a parliament elected by proportional representation and therefore arguably more representative of the electorate than is the British Parliament. The process by which legislation is proposed, debated and agreed is essentially the same as that which I have described above, except that a greater degree of unanimity is required before any new regulation is passed into law. See above! But also bear in mind that the UK has approved 95% of the EU legislation passed since 1999. Probably the biggest illusion of all, one that, extraordinarily, has been bought into by the majority of politicians and the media whether originally in favour of “leave” or “remain”. ‘The referendum result has to be respected’ is the almost universal mantra. It is incredible to me that even the most respected liberal elements of the media, as well as the usual suspects, and the majority of remain supporting politicians have colluded in this lie for more than three years. Let’s look at the facts: 17.4 million people voted to leave the EU. But 46.5 million people were eligible to vote. Simple arithmetic tells me that 29 million did not vote to leave the EU. Never mind that what kind of relationship, if any, the UK might have with the EU in the future was not on the ballot paper. Never mind that, had the result been mandatory, the process was so flawed it would have been illegal. It is the simple, primary school arithmetic that makes plain the fact that leaving the EU is not and never was the will of the UK public."
Medium.com,Society,Africa Is Building an A.I. Industry That Doesn’t Look Like Silicon Valley,World,https://onezero.medium.com/africa-is-building-an-a-i-industry-that-doesnt-look-like-silicon-valley-72198eba706d?source=topic_page---------584------------------1," late August, under the shade of an arching pepper tree in Nairobi, Kenya, hundreds of A.I. researchers gossiped about their algorithms. Some stood in front of posters, which wound around the tree’s sprawling roots, depicting machine learning systems that promised to predict everything from soil nutrition, to whether a small-scale farmer would repay a loan, to how a self-driving car might navigate the bustling streets of Cairo. Over the last three years, academics and industry researchers from around the African continent have begun sketching the future of their own A.I. industry at a conference called Deep Learning Indaba. The conference brings together hundreds of researchers from more than 40 African countries to present their work, and discuss everything from natural language processing to A.I. ethics. Founded in 2017, Indaba is a direct response to Western academic conferences, which are often difficult for researchers from distant parts of the world to access. Take, for instance, the Conference on Neural Information Processing Systems, the most well-known meeting dedicated to artificial neural networks. NeurIPS — originally referred to as NIPS until the community overwhelmingly asked for a less nipple-oriented acronym — has previously been held in distant and expensive resorts. It doubles as a kind of vacation for researchers who can afford it. In 2006 and 2007, it was at the Westin Resort and Spa, and Hilton Resort and Spa in Whistler, B.C, to allow for “informal discussions, skiing, and other winter sports.” For researchers from Africa, NeurIPS is often just out of reach. In 2016, no papers from African countries were accepted into the conference. In 2018, more than 100 researchers were denied visas to enter Canada for NeurIPS. We need to find a way to build African machine learning in our image. So in 2017, former classmates from South Africa’s University of Witwatersrand and a few close colleagues came together to found Indaba, which they named after a Zulu word meaning “an important conference or gathering.” “How many accepted papers have at least one of its authors from a research institution in Africa? The answer: zero,” Indaba organizers wrote in a blog post. “Two entire continents are missing from the contemporary machine learning landscape.” Organizers expected about 50 people to come to the first Indaba, but nearly 750 applied, and 300 were invited to attend. In its second year, Indaba invited 400 people and expanded into 13 IndabaX conferences. This year the conference nearly doubled in size again, with 700 attendees and 27 IndabaX events. Deep Learning Indaba has become connective tissue for the African A.I. community — not only the space for the community to meet, but a part of the community itself. The conference forges relationships between researchers on the continent with a clear agenda: to build a vibrant, pan-African tech community — not through reinventing existing technologies, but by creating solutions tailored to the challenges facing the region: sprawling traffic, insurance claim payments, and drought patterns. Google, Microsoft, Amazon, and other tech companies underwrite Indaba to a ballpark figure of $300,000, but organizers are still adamant about creating a new, distinct field of research — an industry free from the grip of Silicon Valley. As Vukosi Marivate, an Indaba organizer and chair of data science at the University of Pretoria in South Africa, told me, “We need to find a way to build African machine learning in our image.”"
Medium.com,Society,US Drone Strike Kills 30 Pine Nut Farmers In Afghanistan,World,https://medium.com/citizen-truth/us-drone-strike-kills-30-pine-nut-farmers-in-afghanistan-8f8f81cfe6c3?source=topic_page---------585------------------1," A U.S. drone strike killed 30 farmers and workers in Afghanistan’s Nangarhar province who were resting after harvesting pine nuts late last Wednesday, injuring at least 40 more. The U.S. and Afghani government have confirmed the air strike, saying it was meant to hit ISIS targets. The news comes in the wake of escalated Taliban violence after the collapse of US peace talks, with insurgents vowing to target the Afghan election next week to intimidate voters away from polling stations. “US forces conducted a drone strike against Da’esh [Isis] terrorists in Nangarhar,” said Col Sonny Leggett, a spokesman for U.S. forces in Afghanistan. “We are aware of allegations of the death of non-combatants and are working with local officials to determine the facts.” Taliban and Islamic State fighters have been struggling over Nangarhar’s mineral-rich natural resources, prompting the U.S. and Afghan forces to launch regular air strikes in an effort to retake the now mostly jihadist-controlled territory. “There were IS (fighters) there, but it appears during harvest season the locals cut deals with the IS fighters to act as harvesters,” a senior U.S. official told Reuters a few days later. “We were not privy to this ‘agreement’ that puts them (IS fighters) amongst other harvesters. We are working through it now with the officials.” The Reuters team who first reported the situation found that village elders of the area in question sent a letter to the province’s governor on September 7, urging the US-backed government forces to take measures to protect the farm laborers from air strikes. Reuters reported that the local residents were shocked and infuriated by the attack, which was carried out despite assurance from the Afghan government that they would be protected. “The warring sides had given their consent and contractors were hired to bring in laborers from neighboring provinces … no illegal activity was being pursued, but even then, the U.S. drone killed innocent people,” Sohrab Qadri, a member of the Nangarhar provincial council, told Reuters. “My son and his friends were killed by the Americans,” said Malak Khaiyali Khan, a local village leader whose teenage son and his three friends were among the children killed by the strike. “How could they do this to us?” “Such mistakes cannot be justified. American forces must realize (they) will never win the war by killing innocent civilians,” Javed Mansur, a resident of Jalalabad city, told Reuters. The misfired drone strike came a day before a botched Taliban truck bombing killed 39 medical workers and patients at a hospital in Afghanistan’s Zabul province. The Taliban admitted responsibility for the civilian deaths, saying they failed to hit their intended target, a government intelligence office next to the office. Earlier this month, the percentage of Afghans who described their life situation as “suffering” reached 85%, the highest amount recorded since Gallup began surveying public well-being. Of the respondents, most of whom were 35 or younger, 52% said they felt worry for much of the previous day, an increase from 42% in 2016. Only 36% of respondents said they laughed or smiled the previous day, another record for Gallup. An estimated 16,000 civilians have died in Afghanistan during the last 10 years, according to the United Nations. Civilian deaths hit a record high in 2018, and the Afghan government and U.S. forces killed more civilians than the Taliban in the first six months of 2019. Gallup attributes Afghanistan’s status as the most miserable country in the world to the lack of safety and security and the inability to repair infrastructure that would allow the population to improve their economic well-being. Pine nut harvesting presents a rare economic opportunity for Afghanis, who export up to $800 million worth of the crop to China every year through an air corridor, as per Reuters. ISIS, while diminished in Syria and Iraq, has gained strength in Afghanistan, with an estimated 2,000 fighters in the country. The village elders had received assurance from ISIS leaders as well as the Afghani government that pine nut workers would be safe from the skirmishes. Al-Qaeda similarly holds a formidable presence with nearly 240 fighters in the country, according to the U.N. Security Council. The deteriorating state of the 18-year conflict has motivated 2020 Democratic presidential candidates like Rep. Tulsi Gabbard to say they would reengage peace talks and withdraw American forces. More than 2,400 Americans have lost their lives in Afghanistan since the 2001 invasion, and nearly a trillion in taxpayer dollars has been spent on the war. “We’re pretty close to the day when we will wake up to the news of a casualty in Afghanistan who was not born on 9/11,” said South Bend Mayor Pete Buttigieg, a veteran of Afghanistan, at the CNN presidential debate. The Intercept’s Mehdi Hasan argues that if former President Obama’s 100,000 troop surge in Afghanistan couldn’t defeat the Taliban in 2011, the current deployment of 14,000 US troops has no hope of overcoming the group in the foreseeable future. The Taliban now controls nearly half the country. The Observer’s editorial board, on the other hand, argues that “by invading, occupying and seeking to control Afghanistan, the US made itself responsible for its future,” and that America can not look away at a time when the country’s beleaguered democracy is on the brink of collapse. Since President Trump canceled peace talks earlier this month, the Taliban has been carrying out almost daily attacks to retaliate against the United States and intimidate voters before the presidential election next week. The US cut $160m in direct funding to Afghanistan last week, citing the country’s failure to manage corruption, but some analysts viewed it as retribution for Afghani President Ashraf Ghani’s criticism of Trump’s abrupt withdrawal from peace talks.

Medium.com,Society,People Are Seriously Talking About Invading Brazil to Save the Planet,World,https://gen.medium.com/people-are-seriously-talking-about-invading-brazil-to-save-the-planet-dd94bc5bdf65?source=topic_page---------586------------------1," started as a mere thought experiment, a little what-if: As fires raged in the Amazon basin — many of them intentionally set — Stephen Walt, a professor of international relations at Harvard’s Kennedy School of Government, took to the pages of Foreign Policy to do a little thinking out loud in an essay entitled “Who Will Invade Brazil to Save the Amazon?” The piece begins with a stab at speculative fiction, set six years in the future, in which President Gavin Newsom puts the Brazilians on notice: bring a halt to unchecked deforestation, or face a U.S.-led naval blockade and airstrikes against key government infrastructure. “The above scenario is obviously far-fetched,” Walt quickly assured readers. Which was indeed reassuring, since it seems to presuppose a second term for Donald Trump. Besides which, Brazil is a major U.S. ally and trading partner and is one of the most stable democracies in Latin America. As the angry tweets rolled in — “Come to Brazil with your idiot ideas to wonder[if] we could defend our land! Shut up your shit mouth and Pencil!” one user wrote — Foreign Policy changed the headline to something less incendiary. “Brazil was just an example,” a slightly chastened sounding Walt told GEN in an interview. “I didn’t mean to single out Brazil.” But as the weeks progressed, and day turned prematurely to night in the skies over São Paulo — smoke, it was said, drifting over from the blazing jungle — Walt’s hypothetical began to seem a little less out-there. After all, the Amazon rainforest is not just any old precious tropical biome to be tossed on the scrap heap of market growth like so many others. More than half the size of the U.S., the Amazon basin (two-thirds of which falls within Brazil’s borders) is the most diverse land-based ecosystem on the planet. More important is its role in regulating the climate. A quarter of the carbon dioxide (CO2) scrubbed from the atmosphere by all of the world’s forests is attributable to the region. The burning of the Amazon’s plant life not only emits carbon due to the fires themselves, but it sends heavenward some of the additional 100 billion tons or so of C02 that it’s been storing up for centuries. Scientists fear that a tipping point will soon be reached in which hotter, drier weather will create an unstoppable feedback loop, known as a “dieback,” which will swiftly transform tropical jungle into savannah. As a result, it will begin to exhale CO2 rather than absorbing it — an unthinkable disaster for the planet. One prominent scientist estimates this point could be reached when “20 to 25%” of the area is deforested, and by Brazilian government scientists’ own calculations, 19% is already gone. Adding to the urgency, Brazil’s right-wing populist president Jair Bolsonaro seems hell-bent on finishing the demolition job. Bolsonaro campaigned on a pledge to open the area to further economic development (referring to himself as “Captain Chainsaw”) and began delivering on the promise as soon as he was elected, canceling a global climate meeting, slashing the environmental budget by 24%, slashing aid to nongovernmental organizations, and cutting back on enforcement of existing regulations. Meanwhile, he called the region’s indigenous population “an obstacle to agribusiness” and compared them to “animals in a zoo.” Under Bolsonaro, the fires, which are an annual occurrence, are believed to have increased by 84%. That explains the panicked responses to the fires among world leaders. “Our house is burning. Literally,” French President Emmanuel Macron tweeted just before hosting the G7 summit in Biarritz. “The Amazon rain forest — the lungs which produces 20% of our planet’s oxygen — is on fire.” At the meeting, several member states threatened to block a trade agreement with Brazil over the issue. Others considered economic sanctions, including a ban on the country’s beef exports. International apparel brands like VF Corporation and H&M took notice as well, vowing to boycott Brazilian leather. When Bolsonaro responded by insulting Macron’s wife and then refusing to accept an international pledge of $20 million to help protect the Amazon unless Macron apologized to him, it wasn’t hard to imagine the situation spinning out of control. Maybe the idea of a little green-tinted gunboat diplomacy wasn’t so outlandish after all. “I still regard [military action] as a very far-fetched possibility,” Walt said, “but I guess it was intriguing, the week after I wrote this piece, that suddenly the president of France was putting the issue up in bright lights and saying other countries had a stake and ought to be dealing diplomatically with Brazil to address it.” The threat of military action soon began to catch fire itself, at least among policy types. “The case for territorial incursion in the Amazon is far stronger than the justifications for most war,” Franklin Foer wrote in the Atlantic. Former NATO supreme commander Adm. James Stavridis flashed his saber a week later with an essay entitled “Burning Brazil Threatens America’s Security.” The piece was mostly a reminder that sea-level rise and extreme weather are already posing a serious threat to naval preparedness and that the Republican party’s nihilistic climate policy runs counter to U.S. interests. But pinning the issue squarely on Brazil — that was an eye-catching move from a high-level officer who a decade ago oversaw U.S. Southern Command. “Those rising plumes of smoke over the Amazon are a direct threat to our national security,” he concluded menacingly. The Amazon rainforest is not just any old precious tropical biome to be tossed on the scrap heap of market growth like so many others Democratic Sens. Brian Schatz and Chris Murphy weighed in soon after, arguing in a joint editorial that “we must make clear that the fires in Brazil are a national security crisis and that we are willing to pause aspects of our bilateral relationship” including “a freeze on regular military exercises and exchanges.” Perhaps Walt was on to something. At the moment, of course, that all seems very unlikely. Donald Trump, who pulled the U.S. out of the Paris climate accord and conspicuously skipped the G7 session on climate change altogether, has shown as much contempt for the environment as Bolsonaro. No military action is imminent. At least not in this hemisphere."
Medium.com,Society,Democrats: You Need to Look Across the Pond for Political Lessons,World,https://medium.com/uk-politics-today/democrats-you-need-to-look-across-the-pond-for-political-lessons-8f5f85463cdc?source=topic_page---------587------------------1," A tale of two Democrats. It was the best of times; it was the worst of times. While it’s not exactly the age of wisdom, it doesn’t have to be the age of foolishness, either. This week the Liberal Democrats — the traditional third party of British politics — held their annual conference in Bournemouth, on the south coast of England. Despite only winning 12 seats in the 2017 General Election, they have since experienced growth, with six new MPs joining their ranks in as many months. Albeit from defection rather than election. But nonetheless, headline grabbers, include the once-tipped Labour saviour, Chuka Umunna, the generally well-liked ex-Labour MP, Luciana Berger, Sarah Wollaston, ex-Conservative MP and current Chair of the influential Health Select Committee, and Sam Gyimah, who was running for Conservative leadership this summer. Most dramatically, ex-Conservative MP, Philip Lee who literally crossed the floor of the House of Commons to physically take Boris Johnson’s majority away from him. It is a scene most becoming of Britain’s arcane obscurity. They have a new leader too, which helps. Jo Swinson, who, at 37 years younger than her predecessor, is breathing new life into the party. But the real catalyst behind their upward swing is their stance on Brexit. Not necessarily their position; they have been pro-Remain since before the referendum. But their willingness to go so bold. If the Liberal Democrats win a Parliamentary majority at a General Election, they will, they say, revoke Article 50 on day one. That is as unequivocal as it gets. It’s effectively the equivalent to out-and-out impeachment in terms of political posturing. Passionate, resolute, unapologetic. It is the Remain antidote to both Boris Johnson’s Leave Government and Jeremy Corbyn’s bizarre and uncharacteristic neutrality on a major issue. Apart from the obvious lessons around coalition building that comes from expanding your parliamentary party by 50% in a few months, there are other lessons that can be learned as long as colleagues from across the pond are willing to listen."
Medium.com,Society,How to ensure all women have access to the health services they need,World,https://medium.com/@WomenAndNCDs/https-medium-com-womenandncds-how-to-ensure-all-women-have-access-to-the-health-services-they-need-1d24de0f01ce?source=topic_page---------588------------------1," Many women living in low- and middle-income countries don’t receive timely diagnoses for breast and other cancers. This is the result of limited health infrastructure and human resource capacity; many countries in sub-Saharan Africa average less than one pathologist per 1 million people. The stigma attached to women-specific conditions can also act as a barrier to detection and treatment. Stage one cancers can rapidly progress to a later stage before being identified, increasing the likelihood of largely preventable, premature death. And it’s not just cancers; noncommunicable diseases have been the leading cause of death among women around the world for at least 30 years. It’s time for the global health community to wake up and recognize this reality. While significant gains have been made in reducing maternal mortality, the NCD epidemic poses a serious burden on women’s health, threatening the most vulnerable girls and women who are left exposed through persistent social, gender, and economic inequalities. Too many women lack access to the life-saving treatment they need. On September 23, the world’s leaders will gather in New York and commit to accelerating progress towards universal health coverage. Leaders should not waste this opportunity, and ensure that the declaration they sign recognizes the right of all women to access affordable, quality health care at every stage of their lives. We demand concrete, actionable measures, and accountability mechanisms to ensure that women are not left behind. These are the three key commitments that we, the Taskforce on Women and NCDs, are calling for. To ensure UHC investments are aligned to needs, women must be involved as decision-makers in every step of the design and delivery of health services. Women are uniquely impacted by NCDs — as patients, mothers, and caregivers — and can be change agents in increasing the equity of health systems. Community-led groups that empower women to self-manage conditions such as breast cancer or type 1 diabetes can be powerful mechanisms in supporting women living with NCDs at home and in the community. Efforts to invest in female leadership in clinical and policy spheres can also be effective. In Rwanda, for example, steps are being taken to increase the enrollment of women in medical school and the government is intentional about promoting gender equity at all levels of leadership. Nongovernmental organization-led initiatives such as NCD Alliance’s Our Views, Our Voices project to amplify the voice of people living with NCDs, and Women in Global Health’s Heroines of Health awards to recognize women who are the leaders and drivers of health in their communities are also critical to transforming a more equitable system. All women must have access to high-quality sexual and reproductive health services, as a fundamental requirement for gender equality and women’s empowerment. In addition, NCD services should be integrated into existing programs for girls and women, such as maternal and child health services. For example, Jhpiego has been working with health ministries throughout sub-Saharan Africa and Asia in partnership with Gavi, the Vaccine Alliance to increase access to human papillomavirus vaccination and cervical cancer screening and treatment by integrating services into family planning, HIV/AIDS, maternal health, school health and routine immunization programs. Likewise, providers with Partners In Health in the central plateau of Haiti have been working to integrate services across women’s health and NCD clinics to ensure that pregnant women and those of childbearing age at risk of possible complications of cardiomyopathy, high blood pressure, diabetes, or other chronic diseases receive quality follow-up care and have access to community education and screening in poor and vulnerable communities. This will help to build a better understanding of gender differences and intersecting disadvantages in risk factors, treatment, and outcomes. Only then can we design effective, targeted, age-appropriate interventions and measure progress in reaching all groups — particularly those most often left behind such as women. To take heart disease as one example, we know that diabetes increases the risk of heart failure in women more than in men; that there is evidence that women are under-treated for heart disease; and that female patients of male cardiac physicians have been found to have worse outcomes than their male counterparts. If we are to protect the hard-won health and development successes achieved over the past decades, we must make the High-Level Meeting on UHC count. Governments must commit to providing effective, gender-sensitive health services; addressing all barriers to care, including a lack of health information; and prioritizing the needs of the most marginalized women and girls. We have an opportunity to prevent millions more women from suffering needlessly like Dageto. We cannot afford to waste it. Nigist Dageto is a 35-year-old mother from the Wolayta District of Ethiopia who was diagnosed with breast cancer a few years ago. She was told she needed surgery to have her breast removed; an operation that would cost her $200, well beyond her means. Eventually, Dageto managed to raise the money through her church community, and — with no cancer services available nearby — left her family and travelled the 400km journey to Addis Ababa for treatment. When she arrived, she discovered that there was no care available. Dageto’s story is perhaps only unusual in that she received a diagnosis."
Medium.com,Society,Obstacles per se,World,https://medium.com/swlh/obstacles-per-se-194ebc3a5c8f?source=topic_page---------589------------------1," W
hat can be “obstacles” under the European Open Banking regulation PSD2? The Regulatory Technical Standards (RTS) on Strong Customer Authentication (SCA) & Common and Secure Communication (CSC), which detail much of the Open Banking PSD2 legislation in Europe have become effective on 14th September 2019. However, the heated discussions about different interpretations of its stipulations have not ended and will certainly continue for another while. One of the open points, and maybe the most important one, is the definition of an “obstacle” in the sense of RTS Art 32(3). The RTS stipulates a number of API processes and functionalities explicitly, but it cannot define everything in all detail and this “catch-all obstacles article” ensures that nothing can fall through the cracks. It actually lists some examples of obstacles, including the thorny issue of “redirection”, but these became rather unclear since the European Banking Authority (EBA) stated that “redirection is not an obstacle per se”. We heard that many times by now and there is a growing number of problems, which are supposedly not an obstacle per se. This made me wonder what an “obstacle per se” could be and if such thing exists at all? Let’s illustrate it with an example: say the channel tunnel was closed today. Would that be an obstacle per se? Or an obstacle at all? Well, not for me, as I am not there today, nor for most other people here in Europe, let alone the rest of the world. Some Brits may even celebrate it, but if you asked the poor guys stranded in the Eurostar terminals, they would tell you what a big f* obstacle it is to them. Obstacles are quite clearly relating to specific people in specific situations. There are no obstacles per se, and what is an obstacle to me, must not be an obstacle to you. So how can we then clarify or define the term “obstacle” in the RTS? A closer look may help: it says that APIs shall “not create obstacles to the provision of payment initiation and account information services.” To judge what could or could not be an obstacle to that, we must realise a couple of things: Firstly, we must understand what such services are and the key to that lies in the word “service” itself, because we are not talking about a simple payment initiation or account information retrieval for which I could just call the bank myself. How is a Payment Initiation Service (PIS) or Account Information Service (AIS) defined and by whom? Some have existed in the market for over a decade and have matured over time into very complex and sophisticated services. I think it is fair to assume that there cannot be any single definition, but the minimum we can expect is that we are not talking less than the scope of services existing already. For example, one of the main PIS “service elements” is the real-time success message provided to an online retailer, without knowing if and when the payment will actually be executed in the overnight batch process most banks are still using. Customers do not want to wait, but the mitigation of this “non-execution risk” requires a lot of account data to be analysed and this has to happen before the payment is initiated, because a good PIS will not initiate any payments, which risk to fail and leave the merchant without money in the end. Similarly, many AIS are very clever services and not just a simple account balance alert. Secondly, we must understand why APIs could create obstacles at all and for doing what? Up to now, most PIS and AIS (together called Third-Party Providers, TPPs) have used the bank’s end-customer-facing “user interfaces” to provide their services. Now they shall use the bank’s APIs and for that they have to re-program their software accordingly. But what if the API does not provide the same availability or functionality as the user interfaces? Could these be the obstacles we have been looking for? Depends. If my AIS is just a light and easy service, even a slim API may provide enough functionality for that. Same for an easy cash management PIS maybe. However, if I have to migrate a real-time e-commerce PIS over to an API, then this will require quite a broad range of functionalities supported by that API, including those for the non-execution risk mitigation explained above. So, any given API may or may not create obstacles depending on whether it allows a given TPP to migrate their services onto it or not. Hence, APIs must be scoped not just for the least demanding, but the most demanding TPP services around. To tell banks what is needed for that and therefore for their compliance, the European Commission’s API Evaluation Group worked out and recommended the required functionalities. Some of them are explicitly stipulated in the RTS, some others would create obstacles if absent. Important to note that both are legally required and that the EC has warned banks many times that they would ignore the latter ones at their own risk. Unfortunately, most banks have done just that and they may now not be compliant, because whilst their API may not be a problem for some TPPs, it may well create obstacles for others, if they could not migrate their existing services without losing some or much of their purpose and thereby lead to customer detriments. One may argue that designing APIs for the most sophisticated TPP services would be overkill, but the opposite is true, because the promise of PSD2 is to get more innovation and more competition, and not just reproducing the best services already available today with another technology. But where is the limit then? Can we force all banks to provide the broadest possible APIs for free? No, and that’s not what I am saying. PSD2 forces banks to unlock their customers’ payments data and let them share what is “made available” to them with licensed TPPs. That is what their customers already paid for and cannot be charged again, neither to themselves nor to any TPP accessing it on their behalf. However, anything not made available to their users, e.g. a payment guarantee, and many other things banks do in the background, could be offered as a premium service, and that is where commercial activities beyond PSD2, like the SEPA API Access Scheme, come into play and may lead to much broader APIs still. I reckon most real-time PIS would rather pay a premium for a payment guarantee than operating and maintaining their own non-execution risk mitigation. My search for a plausible definition of the term “obstacle” in this context comes to the conclusion that there are no “obstacles per se” and what does create an obstacle depends very much on the TPP and their existing or future services. If any given API does not support the functionality needed to migrate such services, then this TPP, and only this one, can claim to face an obstacle in the sense of RTS Art 32(3). If the TPP’s regulator recognises that, they must be allowed access via the bank’s user interfaces until that API is sufficiently improved — even if it was granted an exemption by the bank’s regulator, maybe because no other TPP had problems with it so far. Such obstacles will disappear (by definition), if and when a bank brings their API really at par with its user interfaces and then I am looking forward to even bigger and better premium APIs that go beyond that PSD2-stipulated baseline."
Medium.com,Society,The FBI arrests more than 200 hackers in different countries,World,https://medium.com/@iics/the-fbi-arrests-more-than-200-hackers-in-different-countries-d81239d23f6e?source=topic_page---------590------------------1," Cybercrime has been punched in the face. Ethical hacking specialists report that the FBI has commanded an international operation that led to the arrest of more than 200 persons involved in a scam via emails that have spawned large economic losses for the victims. According to experts in ethical hacking, a few months ago the FBI’s Internet Crime Complaint Center (IC3) disclosed that the attempted email fraud, a practice known as Business Email Compromise (BEC), increased 100% over the past year, as well as economic losses arising from this activity. Through Operation reWired, authorities managed to arrest a total of 281 suspects; 167 of these arrests occurred in Nigeria, which for years has become a kind of hub for such campaigns. In addition, 74 of these arrests occurred in the U.S., 18 in Turkey, 15 in Ghana, and a few others in Japan, the United Kingdom, Italy, France and Malaysia. Ethical hacking specialists claim that, despite being widely known, such scams continue to generate profits for the operators of malicious campaigns. “Although there are multiple variables to exploit, in most cases attackers try to deceive employees of the target company, posing as suppliers or government agencies to get money transfers,” the experts said. At the conclusion of the operation, the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) described the development of one of these campaigns. Two of the people arrested in the U.S., Brittney Stokes and Kenneth Ninalowo, were charged with scamming staff in a community college in Illinois for more than $3M USD. Three years ago, the university had to cover a payment to a construction company, so it received an email, allegedly sent from the Minneapolis-based construction company. The message asked the university to update its information in the Automated Clearing House electronic payment system. After doing so, the company sent the agreed payment to a new account operated by the criminals, from where the payment was divided into checks of less than $10k USD that were sent to multiple companies. However, Bank of America detected this activity, froze the criminals’ bank account, and returned most of the money to the university. The bank detected that one of the checks was sent to Steno Logistics, a company created just a few days before the university began receiving these emails, which helped authorities arrest the suspects. Those arrested have also been charged with fraud against an electrical power supplier, whose name was not disclosed by the DOJ, in December 2017. An important element in preventing such attacks is attention to detail. International Institute of Cyber Security (IICS) ethical hacking specialists recommend verifying the legitimacy of a website or email address, making phone calls to confirm electronic transactions, and implementing email spam filters to prevent such scams."

Medium.com,Society,Weaponisation of Ideas 1: Mass-Murdering Monks to Mass Shootings — AI as a cost-effective way to…,World,https://medium.com/@MattKeyes/weaponisation-of-ideas-1-mass-murdering-monks-to-mass-shootings-ai-as-a-cost-effective-way-to-5a67e06864dd?source=topic_page---------592------------------1," On March 20, 1995, Aum Shinrikyō released sarin gas into two crowded trains in the Tokyo subway system. The sarin, ten times deadlier than cyanide, killed 12 and crippled or injured thousands. This was significant for two reasons: 1. It was the first successful deployment of a weapon of mass destruction by a terrorist group and 2. It was done by Buddhists espousing a doctrine of non-violence. As interesting as how they manufactured chemical weapons is how they forged the traditionally peaceful teachings of Buddhism into weapons of murder in their own right and — in the age of ISIS, al Qaeda, and white nationalism — how we can leverage technology to confront the weaponisation of ideas before they result in bullets or bombs. The Surprisingly Easy Journey from Karma to Killing Aum is an excellent case study in how otherwise harmless ideas can be weaponised. From 1990 to 1995 they actually staged 14 biological & chemical weapons attacks killing over 40 people in total. These ranged from comical failures — like the time they released botulinum toxin near Parliament but the strain they manufactured was unstable and died on contact with air rendering their deadly assault a minor stink bomb, or the time they left a KGB briefcase with a hidden aerosol delivery mechanism for chemical weapons in the subway system but forgot to load it so it harmlessly blew air on peoples’ calves — to much scarier scenarios— they acquired a Soviet MI-17 helicopter capable of spraying large amounts of sarin over Tokyo. Karma, the idea that good or bad actions carry good or bad consequences, is a core tenet of Buddhism appreciated by the Dalai Lama, Richard Gere, and many of you alike. Another tradition is that those with good karma can save others by taking their bad karma on themselves. For example, adherents of Mahāyāna Buddhism (the majority of modern Buddhists) pray to buddhas like Amitābha and bodhistavas like Avalokiteśvara (Guanyin/Kuan Yin in Chinese, Kannon in Japanese) for salvation from their bad karma. In Tibetan Buddhism this idea is taken further with the idea of poa (phowa in Tibetan) in which a guru takes the bad karma from a disciple onto himself at the disciple’s death in order to provide a better re-birth. How does this justify mass murder? Aum came to the logical conclusion that karma, if it can be transferred, is contagious. In traditional Buddhism, karma is transferred benevolently to help others. In Aum, you can inadvertently pick up the karma of others so it becomes a threat like a contagious disease. When I visited sect facilities they had three towels in every bathroom: one for the leaders, one for advanced followers, and one for everyone else. This was because they believed that even by sharing a towel I could cause a harmful transfer of karma. This mattered in the gas attacks for several reasons. First, the perpetrators saw it as self defence. The bad karma of the sinful masses of Tokyo was actually an existential threat to them from a religious perspective and thus justified an extreme & existential response. Second, the euphemism Aum used for all of its murders was in fact “poa.” Not only did they believe they were defending themselves, they believed that by killing these “sinful” victims they were at the same time guaranteeing them a better re-birth. Thus with a change that is slight, subtle, and logical, karma — the Golden Rule of the East — became an ideological weapon of mass destruction. (Here is the in-depth look at the ideologies behind Aum’s attack from my thesis at the University of Washington.) Ideas Matter The point I’m trying to make is that in preventing terrorism ideas matter as much as bullets and in the age of the internet we can use AI to deal with that directly. Creating a doctrinal means of justifying mass murder was as important as figuring out how to manufacture sarin or fly airplanes in Tokyo or 9/11. How The Internet Spreads Ideas and How AI Can Fight Back In the analog world before the 90s extremist ideas were transferred slowly. You had to attend one of Asahara’s lectures or find one of his books to join Aum. Your village priest had to exhort you to join the next crusade. Osama bin Laden studied business at a secular school, supported Arsenal, and played centre forward before he had to get physical copies of Sayyid Qutb and others’ writings to become radicalised. All that changed as the internet allows groups that share small specialised interests of all sorts to network with each other. ISIS recruits heavily online. Foreign Affairs called it “the first terrorist group to hold both physical and digital territory.” More than 175 people have died in white nationalist attacks in recent years. A Canadian boy who killed 6 and injured 18 participated in white supremacist groups online. As did the man who killed 11 at the Tree of Life Synagogue in Pittsburgh. As did the young man who killed 9 at Emanuel African Methodist Episcopal Church in Charleston, South Carolina. As did the young man who killed 49 at mosques in Christchurch New Zealand. As did the anti-immigrant man who killed 22 at a Walmart in El Paso this year. The benefit of the internet is that this is largely done in the public sphere where the spread of ideas can be monitored and understood. However with more than 5 million videos posted a day and ISIS actively trying to hide or disguise its videos as other content how do we pick out extremism in the tidal wave of content? The UK Home Office in conjunction with Faculty uses artificial intelligence to automatically identify 97% of ISIS videos posted no matter how disguised they are. This would reduce the task of reviewing 5 million videos down to 250. These can then be investigated or even taken down before they are posted where it is appropriate and legally permitted. On a smaller scale this same methodology can be used to quickly scan the content of suspected terrorists’ phones and laptops at places like airports. Then Home Secretary Amber Rudd said “The purpose of these videos is to incite violence in our communities, recruit people to their cause, and attempt to spread fear in our society… We know that automatic technology like this can heavily disrupt the terrorists’ actions, as well as prevent people from ever being exploited to these horrific images.” Since 9/11 the US has spent $2.8 trillion on counter-terrorism according to the Stimson Center. Jared Cohen at Foreign Affairs wrote: “Although the military battle against ISIS is undeniably a top priority, the importance of the digital front should not be underestimated. The group has relied extensively on the Internet to market its poisonous ideology and recruit would-be terrorists… the territory controlled by ISIS now ranks as the place with the highest number of foreign fighters since Afghanistan in the 1980s … nearly 4,000 of whom hail from Western countries. Many of these recruits made initial contact with ISIS and its ideology via the Internet. Other followers, meanwhile, are inspired by the group’s online propaganda to carry out terrorist attacks without traveling to the Middle East.” The combination of AI and the internet allows us to address the leading indicators of terrorism — radicalisation, rather than the lagging indicators — attacks & casualties. We can prevent those 4,000 fighters from joining ISIS in the first place, rather than having to fight them in Syria. We can prevent white supremacists from being radicalised in the first place, rather than having to treat people on the scene of an attack. Prevention is always more cost effective than a cure. The cost of software, analysts, and preventive law enforcement are dwarfed by the cost of reacting to even one attack. More importantly no matter how much we spend, we cannot bring victims back to their families. Leveraging AI we can confront the weaponisation of ideas before they result in bullets or bombs. Although we can’t save lives in past attacks, we can save lives from future attacks."
Medium.com,Society,Is Free Speech Under Assault in Japan?,World,https://medium.com/@unseenjapan/is-free-speech-under-assault-in-japan-5557acfa5dd1?source=topic_page---------594------------------1," By Alyssa Pearl Fusek Amidst rising anti-Korean discourse in Japan thanks to worsening trade relations, another issue is taking headlines — freedom of speech. Article 21 of the Japanese Constitution guarantees freedom of speech and expression. But lately, its parameters have been by vaguely totalitarian actions. It all started back on July 15 during the upper house election period. Bystanders jeered Prime Minister Abe as he spoke in front of the JR Sapporo Station in Hokkaido. One man repeatedly yelled “安倍辞めろ” — “Abe, resign!” while another woman cried “増税反対” — “No tax increase!”Nearby policemen in suits promptly removed both of them from the crowd. One of the half-assed explanations given were along the lines of “罪じゃないけど、迷惑でしょ” — “It’s not a crime, but it’s annoying.” Officers even escorted an elderly woman holding a placard off the premises. It seems that this service is provided, without reason, to anyone who jeers or uses anti-Abe rhetoric. Sound totalitarian to anyone? The incident has been nitpicked by the media ever since, spawning a debate on the moralities of removing hecklers from political activities (ヤジ排除問題; yaji haijo mondai, lit. “ yaji exclusion problem”). Yaji (ヤジ) or yajiru (やじる), means to heckle or jeer. Lawyers have come forth stating that the police’s move was an infringement on freedom of speech. Leading newspaper Asahi Shinbun requested the Hokkaido police to release their internal inquiries on the incident; yet once the documents were released, a lot of key information had been blacked out for privacy reasons. More than two months since the initial incident, the police have yet to offer a concrete explanation. Yamagishi Naoto,head of the Hokkaido Police Department, released a statement on September 13 confirming that police were still investigating the matter. The pot was stirred again when then-Minister of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Shibayama Masahiko, cited the event at a rally speech and stated his belief that speaking out isn’t a guaranteed right. His remarks polarized the nation, with many saying that removing hecklers was infringing upon their constitutional rights. Others called the hecklers annoying and disruptive. Senshu University professor Yamada Kenta stated that yaji is a “primitive expression” and that removing hecklers from an audience will narrow the definition of freedom of expression. (JP) Link: Why Can’t We Heckle Politicians? This narrow interpretation has also impacted the art world. Organizers of the 75-day art festival Aichi Triennale shut down their exhibit “After ‘Freedom of Expression?’” after receiving threats over the display of a comfort woman statue. The organizers of the exhibit said this was a serious case of censorship. Given the thorny comfort women issue that’s soured relations between South Korea and Japan, the closure, while regrettable, isn’t a surprise. With the heckling incident and the art show, many are asking: is freedom of speech still a reality in Japan?

Medium.com,Society,Education in Africa: A Story,World,https://medium.com/swlh/education-in-africa-a-story-d0a87ab61d10?source=topic_page---------595------------------1," S
omewhere in the small West African country of Togo, there’s a village. In this village, hails a very wealthy self-made entrepreneur and I’ll call him The Man. He is a multimillionaire in US dollars. People who have some knowledge about the business circles in the country (and beyond) know who this man is; at least they’ve heard or read about him. He’s not a farmer nor a trader as one would immediately imagine. He has built his wealth in a capital-intensive industry. Very frequently, he leaves the capital city to visit his village where he built a large residence. During these occasions, he receives many visitors, some of whom are village elders. Given his influence in the country, naturally he’s very much involved with village politics and his opinion is sought after. Some of his other visitors are mostly young men who come to see him to help them secure jobs in the capital city, Lomé. Times are tough, the young men lament. “Even our brothers in the city cannot find jobs after completing school”. Sometimes, some of the young men, troubled by their situation, ask The Man to help them with money so that they can buy equipment and seeds to start farming because there’s no job in the city and the government doesn’t appear to be bothered by their situation. The Man listens to each young man carefully and he invariably provides them with identical solutions. First, he buys them a farm machete and a bicycle — a machete so they can begin clearing the land they plan to farm on and a bicycle so they can get to their farms regardless of the distance. He then tells them this: it’s true that the economy is bad and a job is difficult to get these days, but go to school anyways and acquire the skills you need for your career interests. Eventually, the opportunity will knock and when it does, you want to make sure you’re prepared to seize it. It’s better to be prepared now than later. Of course, the young men grumble after they depart his residence and he’s labeled as “stingy” in the village. The Man’s response to the young men has given me a bit to reflect on. First, on the bicycle and the machete. The reason why he offers the young men these tools is to teach them that succeeding at anything in life is challenging, especially if one is fighting against poverty all the while striving to achieve ambitious goals. His tactic here is debatable. In my view, people don’t have to struggle like we did in order to succeed. Instead, I believe it’s worthwhile to “smooth the path” for others so they quickly find success and pay it forward by helping others do the same. But, I understand why The Man provides machetes and bicycles to young people who want to farm. It’s worth noting that he seriously toiled to become a multimillionaire. The Man was a high school dropout and eventually became a laborer for many years. Brick by brick, he mastered his skills and he grew his business piecemeal until it became his small empire. So, in his own way he believes he’s preparing the youth to deal with a callous world by helping them to begin their farming venture with the bare minimum that he never had. Second, concerning his perspective on education, I tend to agree. Although unemployment is a major obstacle to the youth in Africa, young people should still have a desire to get educated. Why? All else being equal, an educated person is more likely to secure a job than a dropout. And bringing this into the context of the youth pleading with The Man for a job, as the job market gradually improves in Africa, educated people are in a better position to seize employment opportunities. education is a solution that could solve the problematic of unemployment Beyond the argument for securing a job though, education is a solution that could solve the problematic of unemployment in a very fundamental way. Education enables the youth to better assess the ecosystem that they live in (leaders, norms, events, etc.) and through this exercise, they can formulate adequate solutions to solve the problems in their communities. There’s an empirical evidence for that argument. You would notice that in Africa, the stronghold of the opposition is often in the capital cities. One of the reasons for this is that by far, in Africa, the most educated people reside within the capital cities. Compared to their fellow citizens living in the countryside, the city people are more educated, more in-tune with the rest of the world, and more demanding of their governments. Generally, they’re not easily manipulated by a T-shirt and a bag of rice during political campaigns. This is precisely why education is so important, not merely because it enables us to secure a job. A highly educated population is generally a participant in the country’s governing while an uneducated population is largely an observer. Perhaps this explains why some hostile governments aren’t really interested in improving the education system in their countries. The archaic curriculum of most schools on the continent is just the tip of the iceberg. Another important reason why the African youth should still get educated despite a bleak job market is that entrepreneurship (the other route) is even more challenging than they can imagine, and the majority of a population cannot be made up of entrepreneurs. Most of them will end up being employees of a firm or part-time entrepreneurs at best. They must seize the long-term opportunities that education offers them and use it as a catalyst to self-education and development. Finally, I dare say that in extreme hypothetical circumstances, there’s more hope for an unemployed, but educated youth than an uneducated and unemployed youth."
Medium.com,Society,"In Post-Coup Turkey, Diplomacy Suffers Decay: Purged Diplomats (I)",World,https://medium.com/discourse/in-post-coup-turkey-diplomacy-suffers-decay-purged-diplomats-i-e3eabda97b48?source=topic_page---------596------------------1," The Decline of Global Diplomacy A
ll around the world, the decline of diplomacy and its institutions’ influence in policymaking has emerged as an alarming pattern, prompting soul-searching among scholars and former denizens of foreign policy to determine what went wrong. The feebleness of diplomacy coincides with the general demise of truth in political conduct, the contemptuous treatment of facts, disdain for science and climate warming, the ascendancy of right-wing populism and a palpable decadence in politics across the globe. And it should be borne in mind that this emerging situation is not only limited to authoritarian regimes and like-minded governments, but it also takes places in the West, especially in the U.S., as well. The U.S. administration, after Donald J. Trump’s unexpected ascent to the White House, has yet to assign new ambassadors to empty posts in dozens of embassies abroad, including the countries vital to the U.S. geopolitical interests in Asia and the Middle East. The predicament that engulfs Washington is certainly more complicated and multifaceted than a bulk of vacant ambassadorial posts. The problem is rooted in the mindset of the new president who despises the conduct of diplomacy itself and who views foreign policy as a mere given-and-take business affair where the U.S. is, given its superpower status, destined to take more. With the zero-sum war-like business approach, Trump’s transactional foreign policy was more like a roller coaster that upended decades-old conventions and practices than a deliberate policy course shaped by rational planning, realistic assessment and minutely detailed (real-time) intelligence information, something that is unique to the U.S. when considering its vast pool of intelligence sources. In Russia, it is mostly spooks who guide Vladimir Putin’s decisions in foreign policy. The critical moves of Russian diplomacy over the past decade were mostly driven by Putin’s most trusted intelligence chiefs rather than diplomats and its foreign ministry. And, not surprisingly, as a Foreign Policy article lucidly demonstrates, many of the moves, be it in Crimea or eastern Ukraine, were ill-judged, costly and were nothing less than follies. When it comes to Turkey, the situation was certainly no less gloomy. It was, considering the recent turn of events, even more challenging for traditional Turkish diplomacy, which is enfeebled by a sweeping purge in the aftermath of a fateful coup in 2016. Turkey’s recent foreign policy is being shaped as much by chaotic and daunting regional challenges as by its ever-evolving domestic politics beset by a violent coup, a subsequent debilitating purge, the breakdown of the institutional integrity of many government departments and the collapse of rule of law. Nothing could better illustrate the near-complete decay of Turkey’s once-revered statist tradition and its normally venerated diplomatic elite culture than the brutal treatment of purged diplomats in police custody in late May. The credible allegations of torture in Ankara Police Department, as one dismissed diplomat succinctly puts, represents a new low in Turkey’s post-coup crackdown. It points to a level where reason and logic dwindle into insignificance, where all common sense stops to exist. In early May, prosecutors in Ankara secured arrest warrants from courts for 249 former Foreign Ministry personnel on spurious legal grounds. At least 78 of them were detained by police. What they endured in police custody was well documented by the Ankara Bar Association. The aftermath was as much disheartening as the mistreatment itself during detention. Three months after the outbreak of the scandal, however, no legislative or judicial action has been taken to thoroughly investigate torture claims. If torture is a stain on public conscience, the official stance to dodge the public demand for a comprehensive probe is no less so. To make matters worse, Ankara Chief Public Prosecutor’s Office launched a new probe into the Ankara Bar Association for releasing a report on the claims of torture in police custody, but not into the police officers who allegedly involved in torturing diplomats. Separately, neither former EU Minister Volkan Bozkir nor former Foreign Minister and Prime Minister Ahmet Davutoglu came out to defend their former personnel. They did not even bother to feign a modicum of care for their former colleagues. Their silence still ensues."
Medium.com,Society,Huawei’s Mate 30 Will Be a Disaster Outside China. Here’s Why That Doesn’t Matter.,World,https://onezero.medium.com/huaweis-mate-30-will-be-a-disaster-outside-china-here-s-why-that-doesn-t-matter-4b9ce34c1795?source=topic_page---------597------------------1," he smartphone revolution, now 12 years old, has seen some clunkers in its time. But the newest one is very different from its predecessors. The Huawei Mate 30 launched this month with all the media fanfare that a multibillion-dollar company can achieve. On the surface, the device should be a hot competitor to Samsung in the premium segment. It’s a flagship phone that’s got great cameras, a fast processor, a big display, a fingerprint reader under that display, and 5G connectivity. “Embrace the future with new possibilities,” reads the Huawei marketing blurb. The problem is, outside the borders of China, the Mate 30 doesn’t have any possibilities — only limitations. The U.S. security ban, which prevents American companies from doing business with Huawei on national security grounds, means that the Mate 30 doesn’t come with Google services onboard. It can’t run Google apps, doesn’t run and can’t get the Google Play app store, and can’t even use Google’s “Android” trademark. Many other apps won’t run either, including Netflix. That doesn’t matter inside China, because no “Android” phone there is sold with Google services, to begin with; they all use the open-source version of Android, Android Open Source Project (AOSP) and stick their own skin on top. They then have their own app stores, though the essential app is WeChat, a platform in its own right. Huawei will eventually move its devices to a proprietary HarmonyOS, which faces its own challenges. Richard Yu, CEO of Huawei’s consumer business group, sought to put a brave face on the situation, suggesting that customers could run Facebook and Instagram and WhatsApp, downloading them either from Huawei’s app store or from third-party stores. That’s all well and good, but maybe we could get an app or two that’s not owned by Facebook? The reality, though, is that people won’t download any third-party apps. The security implications of using third-party Android app stores are horrendous: malware abounds, and it’s a multistep process to even get to the stage where you can access the apps you’d usually want. U.S. carriers have never sold Huawei phones, but distributors in Europe have sold them in the past. That’s unlikely to continue. Imagine all the support calls from users who can’t get basic Android apps, which they would get from every single person who buys the phone, save the tiny number of geeks who want to brag about how they’ve sideloaded Google Play. Huawei would like developers to write apps for its platform, of course. It’s setting aside $1.5 billion over the next five years for developers “all over the world.” Part of that would involve major mobile app developers rewriting their apps to work on Huawei’s HMS (Huawei Mobile Services) core. Yu hopes a more appealing revenue share for developers — allowing them to take home 85% rather than the 70% offered by Google Play and iOS — will help. It’s a vain hope. Microsoft tried the same game in 2013 with Windows Phone, offering $100 per app for up to 10 apps per developer if they would please, please, please write them for Windows Phone. It didn’t work; Windows Phone’s market share (and user base) was so small, and its users so unwilling to spend money, that it was always fifth in line for developers, behind iPhones, Android phones, iPads, and Android tablets. Six years later, the story will be the same, but even more so: Huawei will be the fifth in line because its user base of customers outside the U.S. needing those apps will be tiny. Yu asserts that the company can sell 20 million Mate 30s. But pretty much all of those will be in China. Launching a clunker could turn out, over time, to be the incentive that gives China an emphatic lead in the next generation of mobile technology. The outcome is that Huawei’s handset business will shrink outside China, although its networking business will keep pushing outside it. But Huawei, which also makes 5G telecoms networking gear, will have tight integration between handsets and networks running 5G, and most of it will happen inside China. I’m skeptical about the benefits of 5G (above a certain speed, a faster connection just means machines spending more time waiting while humans dither). But if there are marvels to come from its introduction, China will realize them first. The rest of the world, and especially the U.S., will see these putative marvels much later. The Mate 30 could well be one of those phones which will begin to show off the benefits of 5G through its combination of capability, camera quality, and speed. It might seem like a perverse outcome: Launching a phone that’s a clunker in the West could turn out, over time, to give China an emphatic lead in the next generation of mobile technology. But clunkers have always provided lessons for the mobile world. BlackBerry discovered that it couldn’t resist Android, though not before it dropped billions of dollars developing BB10 in a futile last stand against it. Firefox OS, which didn’t do apps, only the web, demonstrated that web apps aren’t good enough, and never will be. Amazon’s Fire Phone showed the company that it didn’t belong in mobile and that it should focus on the home — which led to the Echo and Alexa. And now the Mate 30, which has a galaxy of shining specs, and none of the apps people demand. If that sentence were reversed, it would sell. In that sense, this new phone has already shown us that apps and not specs remain the reason for smartphones. Whether it does become the driver for China’s 5G revolution, only time will tell. Such an outcome would be a spectacular irony from U.S. intelligence suspicions about this Chinese company. But history has a habit of giving us odd outcomes lately. Perhaps you’ve noticed."

Medium.com,Society,The Strategic Implications of the Attacks on Saudi Arabia’s Oil facilities,World,https://medium.com/goods-services/the-strategic-implications-of-the-attacks-on-saudi-arabias-oil-facilities-99d4b27326fa?source=topic_page---------600------------------1," Image Credit: The Print One of Saudi Arabia’s major concerns became a reality on September 14th. A barrage of cruise missiles and drone strikes damaged the Abqaiq and Khurais crude processing facilities belonging to Saudi Arabia (Saudi Aramco). The 7 million barrels per day Abqaiq oil and gas processing complex is the most critical oil and natural gas infrastructure in Saudi Arabia. The attack initially cut off a massive 7% of the global daily oil supply, causing oil prices to spike. The incident shows Riyadh’s susceptibility to attacks on its energy infrastructure, and how rapidly conflicts in the Middle East can disrupt global oil exports. Source: Stratfor Although Houthi rebels in Yemen initially claimed responsibility for the attack, the U.S. and Saudi officials have since stated that they believe that Iran carried out the attack. This is the third alleged attack by Iran against Saudi oil infrastructure year. On May 14th two East-West pipeline pumping stations in Dawadmi and Afif Governorates in Riyadh were targeted in drone attacks. Also on August 17th, explosive-laden drones caused a fire at Saudi Aramco’s Shaybah oil field’s processing complex. In response to the extraordinary sanctions on its oil and gas sector, Iran is mounting attacks on oil and energy assets in the Persian Gulf. This strategy aims to force the United States to break the current cycle of heavy oil sanctions and economic pressure. Other Iranian actions apart from attacks against Riyadh include the tit-for-tat seizure of British oil tankers, harassment of maritime traffic at the Strait of Hormuz, and the downing of a U.S. drone in June. Tehran was to end to the United States’ maximum pressure campaign even if that means angering the United States. The calculation is that these actions will ultimately facilitate the removal of sanctions. For many years Iran has threatened that if they are unable to export crude oil due to U.S. sanctions, then no one else would either. Iran’s economy, highly reliant on oil exports, have almost collapsed due to massive U.S. sanctions. Inflation was 42% in August, Dollar reserves have diminished, and necessary supplies such as medicine are running scarce. Saudi Arabia is reluctant to strike back against Iran, which could initiate a significant and direct military conflict with Iran in the region. However, Riyadh may reach out to Iran through a third party to negotiate something to limits future attacks. Also, it could convince the United States to ease sanctions on Iran as a path toward de-escalation. The United States, as well, wants to avoid striking Iran militarily in the run-up to the 2020 U.S. presidential election. Instead, President Trump on September 20th announced new sanctions on Iran’s Central Bank. Targeting the Central Bank of Iran will hinder Tehran’s ability to pay for imported humanitarian goods, which are exempt from sanctions. Central Processing Facilities Export Terminals Refineries and Petrochemical plants Source: Stratfor After an initial increase in Brent Price from $61.25 per barrel to $68.42 per barrel on September 16th, the price eventually settled to $64.25 per barrel on September 19th. Prices plunged after Saudi Arabia announced it will maintain export levels by drawing from its inventories. As of the end of July 2019, Saudi Arabia held over 180 million barrels of crude oil in inventories. Thus, Saudi Aramco, which pumped about 9.8 million barrels a day in August, will be able to keep customers supplied for 20 days by drawing on its global storage network. The storage facilities are located in the country, plus three strategic locations around the world: Sidi Kerir on the Mediterranean coast of Egypt, Rotterdam in the Netherlands, and Okinawa in Japan. Aramco has informed refiners in India, South Korea, Thailand, China, and Taiwan that it will supply full volumes of crude oil in October. Luckily, the attack came as global oil stockpiles are higher than usual. The U.S. commercial crude oil inventories (excluding those in the Strategic Petroleum Reserve) stood at 417.1 million barrels as at beginning of September. Also, its Strategic Petroleum Reserve, end of August, was 645 million barrels. Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) members have nearly 2.9 billion barrels in stockpiles as at end of September. the volume was enough to cover 61 days of members’ liquid fuels consumption. The attacks have destroyed Saudi Aramco’s image as a resilient company that survived the tanker wars of the 1980s and the First Gulf war. If Riyadh proves incapable of defending its energy infrastructure from attacks, investors may be justifiably worried about investing in Aramco via planned IPO launch in November. The United States and Saudi Arabia face tough choices in responding to the attack without igniting a broader conflict. In the event of a war between Iran and the U.S. & Saudi Arabia, expect colossal damage on the region’s infrastructure, energy, tourism, financial, tourism, shipping, and logistics sectors. President Trump, at the moment, is not willing to risk an all-out war in the Persian Gulf as his 2020 presidential campaign kicks off. Besides, Washington’s attention is on deploying military resources to the Western Pacific to deal with the growing power of China in the Indo-Pacific region. Iran is playing a risky game with both the United States and its allies in the Gulf. If it continually attacks Saudi oil infrastructure, President Trump may decide enough is enough and order a military strike against Iran. In the short term, the main priority for the United States and its Gulf partners will be to secure energy facilities and supply routes effectively."
Medium.com,Society,Caring for Stray Animals in Besieged Gaza,World,https://medium.com/tenderlymag/caring-for-stray-animals-in-besieged-gaza-26f23d268cf1?source=topic_page---------601------------------1," T
he Gaza Strip is in crisis, and has been for a long time. In large part due to the blockade imposed on it by Israel and Egypt in 2007, the UN predicts that come next year, the besieged enclave will no longer be “a liveable place” without “herculean efforts” to improve access to safe drinking water, high-quality healthcare and education, and affordable, reliable electricity. Of course, the UN’s estimations are concerned solely with human needs, but animals — and especially domesticated animals — require clean drinking water too. And with human healthcare in crisis, the outlook for veterinary care is also bleak. Amid such human hardship, you’d naturally expect the lot of animals to be passed over, indefinitely consigned to the “we’ll get to that one later” box. But in Gaza, hope for animals exists in the form of the Sulala Society for the Care of Stray Animals, which puts heart and soul into looking after the Strip’s many homeless cats and dogs. Palestine’s strays, who are thought to be largely abandoned, escaped, or otherwise released pets and working animals, are so numerous that they constitute one of the greatest animal welfare issues there. And while Sulala (the word means, simply, “breed” in Arabic) has their hands full with this crisis, their efforts extend to countless other species of animals. An educational day for orphaned children saw them work with snakes and birds, and they’ve also been known to provide care to the occasional working donkey. Sulala is staffed by a small but committed team of volunteers under the leadership of director and founder Saeed Al-Err. At 48 years old, Al-Err is a retired Palestinian Authority employee with nine children, who has cared for vulnerable animals since childhood. After a nine-month-long dog training course in Russia, Al-Err launched Sulala in 2006, and most of his family now work alongside him in caring for animals. The society arranges veterinary care, provides food, and finds shelter and adoption opportunities for the animals they work with, all while raising public consciousness of animal welfare through their example. But the immense challenges they face are clear from the almost daily appeals for donations on their Facebook and Twitter pages. Al-Err’s project is severely hampered by “a lack of proper funding from local and international foundations,” he told me. “In the beginning, I was [Sulala’s] sole financer, and that’s somewhat true even today. We now receive a limited amount of donations from a small number of individuals, both within and outside Gaza.” In fact, by 2016, Al-Err had already given $20,000 of his own money to the cause, according to the media site Al-Monitor. And after selling his car to finance the society, he was forced to permanently close the animal shelter they had rented and operated out of for three years. With their dedicated workspace gone, the team had to focus on providing for stray animals’ basic needs directly on the streets and bringing a few lucky animals into volunteers’ homes to be cared for. But what money the group does have has been used well. Al-Err is proud of the fact that they have “saved a great many animals,” and his success stories make this incredibly difficult endeavor worthwhile. First up is Max, a 10-year-old stray dog. Al-Err reckons he’s part “baladi,” (an Arabic word for “street dog”), part wolfdog, and he says that the team have been caring for him over the past four years. Max, along with his friends, Sasha and Jane, are regular beneficiaries of Sulala’s “feeding rounds” for stray cats and dogs. Al-Err also spoke exceedingly fondly of Kitty, an adorable cat who he rescued and nursed back to health at his house after she fell four stories and seriously damaged her hind legs. After her accident, she could hardly walk, but thanks to Al-Err’s care and attention she now has much of her mobility and independence back and spends her time looking after an equally adorable litter. In the absence of a permanent shelter, Al-Err and many of the other Sulala volunteers take stray animals into their homes, despite a widespread (but by no means universal) belief among Muslims that dogs are ritually impure and thus should not be kept indoors. “It is [indeed] popular to think that dogs are impure… however, many people’s stance is that we mustn’t kill or abuse them,” Al-Err informed me. But his view is that our duty to be kind to animals extends to taking them into our homes: “Religious scholars differ in opinion on this matter,” he told me. There are sheikhs who raise dogs themselves.” He later sent me a video of a Gazan sheikh defending dogs against the charge of impurity. This is not the only way in which Sulala goes against the grain. Palestine’s other major animal organization, the West Bank-based Palestinian Animal League, flatly refuses to collaborate with Israelis as a statement against the illegal occupation of their land. But Sulala has worked with Israeli groups in the past, including to facilitate the treatment of a cat who had sustained horrific injuries in a car accident. Living under tight import restrictions, the Gazan vets who work with Sulala do not always have access to the drugs and medical equipment necessary to treat certain injuries and ailments. Although it undoubtedly saved the cat’s life, sending her to Israel was a controversial decision, something that could be seen as normalizing the tilted power relations that exist between Israelis and Palestinians, and allowing for a narrative that Palestinian animal activists need “saviors” to help them fight against an allegedly backwards society. This is a debate with strong adherents on both sides within the Palestinian animal movement. Al-Err’s view is that his primary duty is to the animals: “We are a charitable association. We do our duty towards poor animals who are shot, poisoned, and subjected to deadly violence. As such, we do all we can to help them. The cat was given to an Israeli organization for treatment because of her complicated healthcare situation.” Asked about Sulala’s aspirations for the future, Al-Err had some extremely ambitious answers. In addition to reopening the society’s animal shelter, he dreams of a veterinary hospital complete with animal ambulances, as well as animal welfare education in schools, universities, and beyond. He is also keen to one day see strong animal welfare laws implemented in Palestine, but while he waits for those changes to take place, he’s busy helping Gaza’s neediest dogs and cats, one animal at a time. If you’d like to help the Sulala Society continue and expand upon their work, you can donate here. To stay up to date with their activities, follow them on Facebook and Instagram."

Medium.com,Society,Why you don’t want to be a Venezuelan woman right now,World,https://medium.com/muros-invisibles/why-you-dont-want-to-be-a-venezuelan-woman-right-now-faeec65a2edc?source=topic_page---------603------------------1," From murder to maternal mortality, from forced sex work to being sexually abused in prison, Venezuelan women are paying a particularly high price as the oil-rich South American country continues its long and downward spiral. Venezuela no longer releases homicide data, but NGOs that track violence report a 50 percent increase in female homicides compared to the same time period last year — despite a rapidly shrinking overall population due to the mass exodus since 2015. The Venezuelan government hasn’t released data on infant or maternal mortality rate in years either, but along the Colombian border where hospitals regularly treat fleeing migrants, maternal mortality was up 80 percent in 2018 from the previous year. Health officials in Colombia attribute this increase to the millions of fleeing Venezuelans — many of whom often suffer from extreme medical neglect. Maria Borjas, 19, fled to the border city of Cúcuta, Colombia to give birth, crossing the frontier on foot when seven months pregnant. “The hospitals in Venezuela are a death sentence,” she told The New Humanitarian, citing not just a lack of medicines, but also of basic disinfectants. She fled from Merida in western Venezuela, where the electricity grid only functions three to four hours a day. Venezuela has the highest rate of teenage pregnancy in South America. Birth control is expensive and difficult to obtain, with some cities in the west, such as Maracaibo, lacking any stocks of contraception. This has caused pregnancies and HIV rates to skyrocket. Those crossing the frontier do so through the largely lawless border regions of Venezuela, which are controlled by armed criminals. Reports of violence, sexual assault, forced recruitment by guerrilla groups, and disappearances are commonplace. Women and children are most at risk. Wilfredo Cañizares, director of Fundación Progresar, a local human rights group that provides information about the Venezuelan border to Colombian officials, journalists, and immigrants, told TNH that his organisation had received requests from family members to find 900 Venezuelans who have disappeared crossing the border near Cúcuta this year alone. Officials estimate that more than four million people have fled Venezuela since 2015, and the flow of refugees has recently increased. Since Ecuador closed its borders to Venezuelans without visas on 25 August, Colombia is the last remaining legal refuge for the majority of those trying to start new lives. Venezuelans are often forced to take illegal jobs with business owners who pay them rock-bottom rates, but even those jobs are becoming more difficult to find. Due to stereotyping and desperation in destination countries, Venezuelan women often resort to, or are forced into, sex work to survive. “Women migrants are often sexualised based on cultural stereotypes that have no logical basis,” said Marina Navarro, president of Amnesty International in Peru, another main destination country for Venezuelans, where tougher rules have forced immigrants underground. Paola, 23, is a Venezuelan escort in Santa Marta, on the northern Colombian coast. She arrived in Colombia two years ago. At first she worked on the street, but she almost immediately experienced a severe beating at the hands of a customer. Now, she screens her clients through a website and rents a room near the tourist district. Paola, who only wanted to give her first name, told TNH she doesn’t mind her job, but is sad she hasn’t seen her child since she arrived. She is saving money for a Venezuelan passport. Officially, a passport costs between $80-$100 from abroad, but several immigrants told TNH that bribes of an additional $200-$300 are required to ensure it actually arrives. Furthermore, since Venezuela and Colombia no longer have diplomatic ties, immigrants must return home or travel to a third country to apply. Once Paola has a passport, she plans to send for her son, aged five, and move to Spain. “There’s too much xenophobia here,” she said. “The Colombians think we’re all thieves and prostitutes. So I guess I’m a stereotype. But it’s not like I had a choice. If I could open a business I would. But the only job a veneca (slang for a Venezuelan-Colombian) can get here is for less than [the] minimum wage in a shop or restaurant.” Paola said she feels better now after almost two years in Colombia, but there are still details of the story she refuses to elaborate on for fear of being plunged back into depression. “It was very hard to overcome the sensation that at any moment I could lose everything again. That someone would snatch me off the street. It made no sense, but that was my life.” Survival in a new country poses difficulties. It takes months of navigating a complicated process in Colombia to obtain the legal right to work and, as they wait, Venezuelan women are at elevated risk. “Vulnerable groups are much more likely to become victims of both violent and sexual crimes,” said Wilfredo Grajales Rosas, director of IDIPRON, a government-funded organisation in the capital, Bogotá, that helps to integrate marginalised groups. “So we treat everyone as Colombian. We want to avoid that classification as ‘outsider’.” In Colombia, as of the end of August, 27 Venezuelan women had already been killed violently this year — the vast majority of the cases involving sexual violence. “Julia”, whose name has been changed for this article, is one of thousands of female political prisoners who experienced grave human rights violations at the hands of the Venezuelan government. But she is also one of the untold number of Venezuelan women facing increased risk of violence, harassment, and xenophobia in the countries to which they have fled. In 2017, amid brutal government repression of government protests, Julia watched security forces detain, and attack, demonstrators from her apartment window in Caracas. She called to some of those in the streets to take refuge in her apartment. Her kindness was not rewarded. One of her neighbours called Venezuelan intelligence, who came and arrested her on “terrorism” charges. With the help of bribes, Julia was eventually freed. She was never formally charged with a crime and now lives with her daughter in the Colombian port city of Cartagena. She has spent two years designing a line of clothing she hopes to launch soon. “Maybe one day I can return,” she said. “But in the meantime, I have to build a life.” jc/ag Originally published at https://www.thenewhumanitarian.org on September 17, 2019."
Medium.com,Society,Stalling the UN Report on Dag Hammarskjold’s Death Is Regrettable,World,https://medium.com/@PassBlue2016/stalling-the-un-report-on-dag-hammarskjolds-death-is-regrettable-5e18a1d92f4c?source=topic_page---------604------------------1," by Maurin Picard. This article originally appeared on Passblue. Fifty-eight years ago, Dag Hammarskjold, the United Nations secretary-general at the time, set off on a perilous journey across the African heartland. Taking off at 4:51 P.M. from Léopoldville, in the capital of the newly independent Congo, he was due to meet the leader of the secessionist Katanga province. The venue chosen was Ndola, a mining town in North Rhodesian territory, bordering Katanga. His aim was to negotiate a cease-fire between UN peacekeepers and Katangese white mercenaries and possibly even a peace agreement for the entire Congo. The next day, after a harrowing night flight, the four-engine DC-6 Albertina reached its destination around midnight, local time, only to crash during its final approach. All 16 crew members and passengers, including Hammarskjold, were killed. In 1962, UN investigators concluded that they could not reach a final verdict as to whether the crash was the result of an aerial attack or an accident. The case was therefore closed, pending new revelations. Thus began one of the greatest continuous mysteries of the Cold War. In 2016, the presentation of previously neglected archives and testimonies allowed UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon at the time to recommend that the case be reopened. Chosen as the Eminent Person for this matter, Tanzanian judge Mohamed Chande Othman handed over his latest report to the current secretary-general, António Guterres, on July 31, 2019. Moreover, in its Resolution 72/252, of Dec. 24, 2017, the General Assembly requested that the secretary-general “report to the Assembly before the end of its seventy-third session on any further progress made.” That deadline expired Sept. 16. The Othman report was not released on time due to a “delay in document processing,” according to Stéphane Dujarric, the UN spokesperson. Stuck in the notorious document “pipeline” that always precedes a new General Assembly session, the report will be made public “rather sooner than later,” he added, but probably not before October. That delay is highly significant. By October, the annual opening session of the General Assembly with world leaders will be over, and the global media spotlight will have shifted elsewhere. It is also highly regrettable, both historically and politically. Historically, because for the UN, Sept. 17, the date of Hammarskjold’s death, is as resonant as Aug. 19, the date of the 2003 bombing of the Canal Hotel in Baghdad, which killed at least 22 people, including the UN special representative in Iraq, Sérgio Vieira de Mello. Politically, because the UN’s failure to release the report within the time set out by the General Assembly appears to indicate that the investigation into Hammarskjold’s death is not considered a priority. It also calls into question the “continuing commitment of the Secretary-General to the search for the truth in this regard,” as the Assembly resolution states. Over the last three years, Judge Mohamed Chande Othman has established the plausibility of an external attack or threat against Hammarskjold’s plane, explaining the resulting “momentary distraction” of the pilots. Almost six decades later, the UN has never been closer to the truth. A key detail is now corroborated: there was a second plane in the air that night. Having tirelessly investigated all leads, the Tanzanian investigator has uncovered an array of new witnesses, sensitive archives, information about previously unknown Western mercenaries, the presence of rogue aircraft in Katangese and Rhodesian skies and a plot by French elite officers to assassinate UN leaders in the Congo. Yet despite these findings, the Othman investigation has repeatedly hit a wall. Several UN member states have consistently expressed an extreme reluctance, if not outright refusal, to declassify still-secret material. Belgium, Britain, France, Germany, South Africa and the United States may well be wary of revealing the details of events from the colonial era, however ancient they may be. Even Hammarskjold’s own country, Sweden, has refused to declassify some documents related to the Ndola tragedy, invoking “national security” considerations. As Richard Goldstone, a former South African chief prosecutor of the International Criminal Tribunals for Yugoslavia and Rwanda, has noted: political embarrassment can be a powerful leverage. Unrelenting pressure on Berlin, Brussels, London, Paris, Pretoria and Washington, D.C., has achieved partial and limited success: government officials have been appointed to take a closer look at long-buried archives, though not all countries complied. These efforts are to be commended, but they must be further pursued, so that some of these former colonial powers can begin to explain their involvement in the events surrounding Hammarskjold’s death. In 2002, Belgium showed the way by apologizing for its responsibility in the murder of the first Congolese prime minister, Patrice Lumumba, on Jan. 17, 1961. The outstanding questions are well known. Belgium must share all details about a few rogue mercenary pilots. France must clarify the whereabouts of a military outfit led by a paratroop officer, Roger Faulques. Germany must explain the delivery of a Dornier 28 plane, weeks before the crash, to the Katangese secessionist government, as well as the whereabouts of a former Nazi night-fighter pilot named Heinrich Schaefer. South Africa must recover what it calls “lost” apartheid papers regarding a certain Operation Celeste, apparently designed to kill Hammarskjold. Britain must explain why senior diplomats in charge at Ndola refused to acknowledge the sudden disappearance of the Albertina and turned off the airport lights. It must also explain what Intelligence Service assets were doing that night in the vicinity of the airport. The US must provide clarity regarding the confessions of two now-deceased National Security Agency employees who, from their listening stations, overheard an air attack unfold against the Albertina and reported it back to the White House. It seems that a trove of “lost” or “inaccessible” documents have been duly identified, yet are mysteriously barred from immediate declassification by an everlasting raison d’état. Most of the witnesses are now gone. But the archives can still tell us exactly what happened in Ndola on that moonlit night in 1961, and why Dag Hammarskjold was killed “right when he was on the point of getting something done,” as former US President Harry Truman famously declared. As the General Assembly itself notes in Resolution 72/252, the community of nations has “a shared responsibility to pursue the full truth.” And sooner, rather than later.

Medium.com,Society,The New Pivot Point: Iran Wants Peace but is Ready to Embrace War to Survive,World,https://medium.com/p/7d9f53fc947c?source=topic_page---------606------------------1," With claims now surfacing that Iran contributed, at least in part, to the attack last week on Saudi Arabia’s Aramco facilities — an attack that led to a significant spike in oil prices and consequently triggered fears that markets could tank under such strain — geopolitical tensions in the Gulf region have reached a new peak. On the heels of U.S. President Donald Trump’s comments on Twitter that all was in fact “locked and loaded,” a flurry of experts and other media professionals began discussing what seems to be an inevitable confrontation between the United States of America and Iran’s Islamic Republic. Comments this Tuesday by Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, Iran’s Supreme Leader, that the country was in no way, shape or form interested in talks only added a layer of complication to an otherwise problematic political impasse … that and, of course, Trump’s decision to slap additional sanctions against the regime. Boxed in both politically and economically, Iran has been left with little incentive toward peace. Amid such a storm, it appears many are missing the bigger picture. The real point of contention has little to do with Iran’s innocence, or for that matter, perceived belligerence — let’s not forget that the Houthis of Yemen did, in fact, claim full responsibility for the oil attack through all manners of great details — but rather Iran’s designs for the regions in the face of economic disintegration. Allow me to roll back the clock a few months, July 4th to be precise, when Britain decided, at the insistence of its U.S. ally to seize one of Iran’s oil tankers, the Grace I, on the basis that its load, earmarked for Syria, was in contravention of E.U. sanctions on Syria. While Britain and its allies were keen to describe the move as legally sound and thus necessary to the good policing of our international waters, Iran very much understood such “aggression” as yet another swipe at its sovereignty, yet another attempt by western powers to impose their diktat over those they deem “unfit.” It is actually this very narrative that has allowed Tehran to weather more than a few storms over the decade. While many Iranians may not agree with the ideological foundations of Iran’s system of governance — the Governance of the Jurist — an overwhelming majority of them are more than willing to back the regime to the bitter end if it means defending their nation’s territorial integrity and sovereignty. Sovereignty and nationalism are values Iranians take very seriously indeed and few will dare hold it against them, especially if we consider that for most nations those values are in fact virtues. President Donald Trump did, after all, made it the very center of his presidential rhetoric. Under punishing sanctions, Iran is undoubtedly feeling the strain. Unable to rejoin the world energy market, cut off from all main financial forums, its products shun, Iran is suffocating. This is not to say that Iran cannot withstand the pressure, only that doing so will come at a great cost — such a cost, the regime understands, may be too much to ask of regular Iranians. If Iran has long been an adept of what it refers to as a “resistance economy,” a system based on the mastery of economic self-sufficiency, the Islamic Republic is running out of both space and oxygen. That said, it will serve us well to remember that Iran’s resistance economy allowed the country since 1979 to successfully sustain growth and reduce poverty, a feat that should not be discounted. Iran knows and can dig its heels if it needs to; it can also lash out if it feels cornered. If the U.S. aims to drive Iran’s oil exports to zero, it may not be fully realized yet — the month of July saw exports plunge almost 80% year-on-year — their lowest levels since the Iraq-Iran War that ended in 1988, a drop which has been felt throughout the country, all sectors and social circles compounded. Iran is now exporting approximately 400,000 barrels of oil per day (BPD), down from a peak of nearly 2.5 million BPD in April 2018, which led to a crunching fall in revenues. Oil revenues account for about 40 percent of Iran’s national income. While Washington may argue that such pressures are designed to force Tehran back to the negotiating table — a logic that is clearly falling on deaf ears, Iran is arguing economic terrorism, a move designed to rally public opinion behind its leadership, come what may. Although the effect of America’s economic squeeze has been resounding on the Iranian economy, which is forecasted by the World Bank to shrink approximately 5 percent this year, it has also sharpened the teeth of the most docile of politicians as violence is being weighed as a better alternative to a slow, but sure, economic death. With fears that any further economic hardship will tip Iran’s socio-political balance, the state is fast hardening its resolve to a full-blown conflict to avoid a popular insurrection. In other words, Iran’s recent belligerence needs to be looked at not as political posturing but the expression of a nation’s will to survive — an act of self-defense against forces that seek its demise. Iran’s answer to Britain’s aggression, let’s remember, was to seize one of its own, and thus defy the military status quo. Further skirmishes in the Strait of Hormuz and other acts of defiance fall within the same rationale of self-defense. As Barbra Slavin puts it in the American Conservative: “Since the US revoked waivers for even modest imports of Iranian oil, half a dozen tankers have been sabotaged or seized in the Persian Gulf, and America and Iran nearly went to war after Iran shot down an expensive American drone in June.” Hardly the softening of tone Washington wanted to force Tehran to conform to. Then the attack on Saudi Arabia … In all truth, Iran’s guilt matters little here; what we need to concentrate on are both the drive behind Tehran’s foreign policy and the regional geopolitical alliances which are being formed as a result of America’s uber neoconism and Saudi Arabia hyperbolic paranoia. With its back firmly pressed against the wall, Iran will sooner or later lash out … likely at its neighbors, might it be the Emirates or Saudi Arabia who will stand first in the firing line. Another point worth considering is Iran’s regional weight as well as the friends it keeps: Russia and China. At such a time when the United States is engaged in a power struggle with both Russia and China, Iran may just have enough geopolitical “juice” to not only defy Washington, but manifest a new regional reality — one backed by those capitals which now look to Tehran as the new regional powerhouse, mainly Lebanon, Syria, Iraq and Yemen. That, of course, leaves Saudi Arabia to suffer the cold air of America’s disinterest. For all his promises of actions and great warnings, President Trump is unlikely to tempt fate by shattering the ever thin ice financial markets are sitting on amid talks of a broad economic slowdown just to honor Riyadh’s calls for help.

Medium.com,Society,"Russia, China and Central Asian Nations Hold First Ever Joint Military Exercise",World,https://medium.com/citizen-truth/russia-china-and-central-asian-nations-hold-first-ever-joint-military-exercise-179b9f768437?source=topic_page---------607------------------1," Despite being engaged in an ongoing struggle for influence in Central Asia, Russia joined China and a handful of other Asian nations (Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan, Uzbekistan and archrivals India and Pakistan) in kicking off a series of large-scale military drills on Monday. The drill, known as “Tsentr-2019,” began in Orenburg, south of the Urals in Russia which is near Kazakhstan. According to UPI, troops from several Central Asian states, India and Pakistan (which have been involved in tensions over the disputed Kashmir region), will train in Astrakhan Oblast, the North Caucasus region of the Russian republic of Dagestan, Chelyabinsk Oblast, the Siberian Altai and Kemerovo. Russia’s Ministry of Defense reported the six-day exercise will involve 15 warships, 600 military aircraft and around 130,000 soldiers with 20,000 military devices. Only Kazakhstan has participated in a previous joint multilateral exercise with Russia; Tsentr 2015 involved 95,000 troops and fewer than 10,000 units of the military equipment. This years drill is also noteworthy for the joint participation of Pakistan and India, traditionally bitter rivals who are currently engaged in heightened tensions over the long-standing Kashmir dispute. The joint-exercise aims to boost cooperation to tackle international terrorism and prevent Islamic extremists from entering Russia through Central Asia, Moscow said. The drill will consist of two stages: phase one will focus on upgrading the control and command of troops and taking measures to counter airstrikes and defensive operations, while the second stage will see how the participating countries will launch an attack against an imaginary terrorist, as Moneycontrol reported. Russia-China cooperation has strengthened in the past few years as both countries have found each other on the same side recently when it comes to dealing with the U.S. However, they still see each other as rivals, given they are trying to boost their dominance in the Asia Pacific region. Before the Tsentr drill, China and Tajikistan held a joint military exercise in early August for eight days, as South China Morning Post (SCMP) reported. The training took place in the Gorno-Badakhshan autonomous region, bordering China’s volatile Xinjiang province and Afghanistan. Such a drill hinted at China’s growing influence in Central Asia’s backyard, once viewed as under Russia’s influence during the Cold War (when Russia was known as the Soviet Union). Some observers have said that Moscow is not comfortable watching Beijing’s more significant power in Tajikistan. “Russia has traditionally considered Central Asia, including Tajikistan, as its sphere of political-military influence,” Artyom Lukin, an international politics professor at Vladivostok’s Far Eastern Federal University, told SCMP. Tajikistan is politically and geographically vital to China. First, the Central Asia nation borders with Xinjiang, the predominantly-Muslim region where Beijing has been slammed for human rights violation against Ughiur Muslims. Second, Tajikistan’s strategic location along a key trade route is seen as an opportunity for Beijing to widen its influence through infrastructure development, investment and trade under its ambitious One Belt One Road (OBOR) scheme. An independent research body, the International Crisis Group, reported China’s military intensified its military presence in Tajikistan by deploying troops amid concern that militant groups based in Afghanistan could infilitrate West China, as DAWN reported in March of 2018. China has also repeatedly warned that Ughiur militants leaving their hometowns in West China might be joining militant groups such as the Turkistan Islamic Party, a Ughiur-dominated party with bases in Syria and Afghanistan and affiliated with the Taliban and Al-Qaeda. China has been Tajikistan’s largest investor, outside of Russia. In 2016, China’s investment in Tajikistan contributed to 30 percent of the latter’s total investment, as SCMP quoted from Xinhua. When the Soviet Union collapsed, China relied heavily on the technology of former Soviet states now known as Central Asia. As an example, in 1998, China bought 40 units of Shkval torpedoes from Kazakhstan. However, things have changed rapidly since then. China’s innovation in building its own military technology has lured the interest and dollars of Central Asian nations, while Russia is now left to catch up and boost innovation in its defense sector. As Yau Tsz Yan wrote for The Diplomat, “The close to nonexistent manufacturing sector for military parts in Russia continues to give China an upper hand in producing traditional components as well as new military-use telecommunication components. In 2015, 186 types of Russian military equipment needed components from manufacturers in Ukraine. On top of all this, huge debt in the Russian military industry will only make cheaper Chinese alternatives more and more attractive.” Cleverly, as Yau Tsz Yan points out, China’s military tech has purposefully developed armaments that fit existing Soviet weaponry already in the hands of Central Asian countries, making such technology especially attractive. China’s growing military presence coupled with its ambitious Belt and Road Initiative suggests China’s sphere of influence in Central Asia will continue to grow at impressive rates. The question is whether the cooperation seen between China and Russia at Tsentr-2019 is a sign that Russia will welcome and work with China’s growing influence in Central Asia.

Medium.com,Society,UN Criticized for Abandoning Iran 1988 Massacre Case,World,https://medium.com/@Masoud_Dalvand/un-criticized-for-abandoning-iran-1988-massacre-case-e3859a5b38c4?source=topic_page---------608------------------1," In a conference held at the United Nations headquarters in Geneva on Friday, international human rights experts called for an end to the impunity enjoyed by Iranian regime officials in regard to atrocious human rights conditions in Iran, most specifically those involved in the summer 1988 massacre. Over 30,000 political prisoners, mostly members and supporters of the Iranian opposition group People’s Mojahedin Organization of Iran (PMOI, Mujahedin-e Khalq or MEK), were sent to the gallows in the summer of 1988 in a matter of a few months. “Why should there now be a tribunal on the crime against humanity committed in 1988? First, because lawyers have examined evidence and know beyond doubt that a crime was committed. If Iran disputes that, we have a process for that,” said Kirsty Brimelow, QC, international human rights lawyer, in her opening remarks. In July 1988, Iran’s then supreme leader, Ruhollah Khomeini, issued a fatwa against members and sympathizers of MEK held in tens of thousands in the state prisons. There were no trials. There were two-minute hearings. There was no investigation. A series of questions were asked designed to determine whether the person was loyal to Khomeini. If loyalty was not enough, the person would be hanged or sent to the death squad. In 2017, the late Asma Jahangir, then UN special rapporteur on Iran, reported on the mass executions to the General Assembly. She detailed the massacre of 1988 as extrajudicial killing. The new special rapporteur has not followed through with the work of his predecessor. “The UN lacks consistency in addressing human rights issues. On the 1988 massacre, impunity has been dropped between two special rapporteurs. This allows Iran to continue committing crimes. I call on member states to discuss the 1988 massacre with the Special Rapporteur to make sure it’s not dropped again. Failure to investigate is also a crime,” affirmed Alejo Vial Quadras, President of the international committee In Search of Justice (ISJ). The Iranian regime refuses to declare the fate of the victims, which causes more suffering for their families. “I am here not only as an NCRI member but also as a witness. I escaped Khomeini’s prison; else I would have been one of the victims of the 1988 massacre. I was sentenced to eight years in prison. After the execution of my sister, I managed to escape prison after three years. My father was sent to prison in my place,” said Behzad Naziri, a member of the Iranian opposition coalition National Council of Resistance of Iran (NCRI). “From 2016 to 2019, great work has been done. For 30 years, this event has been kept silent. But the question has been brought to the surface, thanks to the great work of activists, jurists, politicians, parliamentarians and other personalities. We have managed to force the UN to move on this issue, which has been kept silent” he further added. “The crime is there; the laws are there. The UN has set a framework for investigating these crimes. Hard evidence is here. The civil society, the Iranian civil society has also widely reported the massacre. The UN Special Rapporteur has also compiled a report on this issue. Ms. Jahangir had the courage to file this report,” affirmed Tahar Boumedra, former Director of the Human Rights Office in UNAMI and an expert on the death penalty. “The current Special Rapporteur who dropped this issue from his report might have been under some kind of pressure to drop this from his agenda. Why has he abandoned the issue of the 1988 massacre? He must reply to the families of the victims, as well as the massacre survivors. I would like to remind the families of the victims that they need to report and write massively. He will have to be accountable and bring this in his report. We also need the families to inform the whole system of the UN,” he added. “30,000 human beings are only the tip of the iceberg. 120,000 of the MEK members have been killed. Back then Maurice Copithorne dropped the issue of the massacres because he thought it had already been dealt with by his predecessors,” said Alfred-Maurice de Zayas, former UN expert on the promotion of a democratic and equitable international order. “The High Commissioner for Human Rights and the Human Rights Council must investigate this crime against humanity. The Special Rapporteur on truth and justice, as well as the rapporteur on torture and arbitrary detention, must also look into this. This is a matter for the Human Rights Council and the UPR,” he added. The campaign is supposed to pave the way for further general investigation into the mullahs’ regime human rights record. Former Italian Foreign Minister Giulio Terzi was the guest speaker. “Yesterday, the European Parliament condemned the Iranian regime’s human rights violations. The heart and voice of Europe are expressed by human rights. Human rights must be a priority between EU institutions and the outside world. The EU has a fundamental role to promote freedom, rule of law, and protect freedoms,” he said. “The [UN] Human Rights Council must discuss this. When we look at the geopolitical situation in the Gulf, there is no doubt that we must focus much more on human rights when we negotiate with Iran. Human rights and fundamental freedoms must come back to the center of this playing field,” he added. Three women, all victims of the regime’s atrocities in prisons and who had lost several family members to the extrajudicial executions testified during the conference. Sima Mirzaee, a family member of 14 individuals executed by the Iranian regime, Massoumeh Joushaghani, a former political prisoner in Iran and Azadeh Alemi of the Women’s Human Rights International Association gave firsthand testimonies of the horror they had endured. “We are witnessing progress in seeing the perpetrators of this crime being brought before a court. Since launching the campaign for justice for the victims of 1988 massacre, many of the perpetrators have been exposed and the crime has been documented,” said Swiss MP Laurence Fellman Rielle. Amnesty International has also rallied to expose this crime. It has underlined that if the perpetrators are not held to account before a tribunal, more crimes and massacres will take place. Amnesty called it a crime against humanity. Amnesty has also gathered testimonies from hundreds of witnesses. Originally published at http://freedomstarblog.wordpress.com on September 22, 2019."
Medium.com,Society,The UK’s role in the Japan 2020 Global Nutrition Summit,World,https://medium.com/@LaylaMoccia/the-uks-role-in-the-japan-2020-global-nutrition-summit-def5c189ac0c?source=topic_page---------609------------------1," Originally published for RESULTS UK. I was aware of global hunger, but had assumed it to be an unfortunate phenomenon that was at least headed towards a decline. But it is not. The UN’S 2019 report, ‘The State of Food Security and Nutrition in the World’, found hunger had actually risen between 2015 and 2018. Through a recent publication by RESULTS, I learnt that the UN in fact expects us to ‘largely miss’ the goal to end malnutrition by 2030, as part of the Sustainable Development Goals established in 2015. Although aware of periods of difficulty in the global food supply chain (for example the East African Drought Appeal of 2017), I did not think that 1 in 9 people would be hungry in 2019. Recent past initiatives The first Nutrition for Growth summit was held in London in 2013 to address malnutrition (a lack of proper nutrition caused by not having enough to eat, not eating enough of the right things, or being unable to use the food that one does eat). 26 governments, 27 business and science organisations, as well as 41 other stakeholders, in total pledged US $24 billion to improving nutrition-specific and nutrition-sensitive programs (those that deliver on nutrition objectives whilst also helping to achieve other goals, e.g. crop education for farmers). The investments were to be delivered over the course of 7 years. According to the ‘Follow the Funding Nutrition Report’ by the ACTION Global Health Advocacy Partnership, the UK is on track to meet its pledge of US $4.5 billion by 2020. Its nutrition programs having reached 42.1 million people between 2015 and 2018. But despite the progress, (the summit alone having caused a 33% uplift in global nutrition spending), 821 million people remain hungry and 150 million children globally are stunted (prevented from growing or developing properly). A number of reasons have contributed to a strained food system in developing countries. 80% of the food consumed in the developing world comes from small, and mostly rainfed farms, but variable rain patterns have become increasingly common due to climate change. This has been compounded by a severe lack of crop diversity in the farmers’ fields — this is 75% less than in the 1900s. Mismanagement and several conflicts in already poor nations have further made hunger a reality for millions. Why is it in our interest to renew pledges? The global cost of malnutrition, excluding obesity, is estimated at up to US $3 trillion. Malnutrition is responsible for more ill health than any other cause; preventing vaccines from working and compromising immune systems. In an ever more interconnected world, it is in our collective interest that the world population is sufficiently nourished to enable people to be productive global citizens. Put simply, healthy people drive healthy economies, and this has positive repercussions whichever side of the world one resides. Reducing the stunting of children by 40% by 2025 for instance, would result in more than $80 billion of additional GDP growth in 15 sub-Saharan African countries alone. At present Africa accounts for a third of all stunted children. Allowing women farmers the same access to resources as men would result in 150 million fewer hungry people worldwide. It is these sorts of programmes, amongst many others, that nutrition-sensitive campaigns by DFID tackle and it is this work that must be protected as we come to the expiration of the 2013 Nutrition for Growth pledges and look ahead to the 2020 summit in Japan. What is it that you can do as an informed and concerned citizen? The seminal World Bank Investment Framework published in 2017 calculated that US $7 billion is needed each year to deliver nutrition services that will help achieve global targets for stunting, anaemia and breastfeeding by 2025 and to enable the scale-up of treatment for wasting. Finding the money for action on nutrition is a massive challenge that can only be achieved as part of concerted global efforts comprising of both public and private partnerships. As the leading donor to the Nutrition for Growth 2013 Summit, the UK has the opportunity to galvanize other donors and governments to renew their pledges at the 2020 Japan Summit, as well as building on their own commitments to realise the vision for a ‘Global Britain’. It is important that your local representative is aware of how his or her constituents think about this — which is where you come in. Were it not for the collective campaigns run by organisations such as RESULTS and with the will of the public made expressively clear through such activities as engaging with local politicians, the UK would perhaps not have passed a bill in 2014 to enshrine in law its commitment to spend 0.7% of Gross National Income (GNI) on aid every year. It is also important to remember that change is possible. The number of people living in extreme poverty for example, has fallen from 35% in 1987 to 10% in 2015. Between 2000 and 2018, the number of stunted children under 5 worldwide declined by 25%. There are many reasons for wanting to eradicate global hunger. Undoubtedly there are economic costs associated with malnutrition that halt development in poorer countries and in doing so create ripple effects for the entire global economy. But essentially our best reason should be that it is simply the right thing to do. Food is available. It is a question of systems and of access to education and technology for developing countries. Work carried by DFID (which has consistently been shown to be the most efficient and accountable spender of the UK aid budget) facilitates this, and in doing so facilitates a more prosperous world for us all. As a concerned global citizen, you can be a part of the next round of global efforts against poverty. Writing to your MP is a great way of raising your concern about nutrition. You can find the contact details for your local MP here, or you can email your MP from the RESULTS website."
Medium.com,Society,The US Just Killed 30 Innocent People in Afghanistan. Let’s Pretend It Was London.,World,https://medium.com/@ChrChristensen/the-us-just-killed-30-innocent-people-in-afghanistan-lets-pretend-it-was-london-7c55a6d203de?source=topic_page---------610------------------1," A US official in the UK has indicated that he is “working with local authorities” and “examining the intelligence” that led to a drone strike late last week that took the lives of 30 customers at a restaurant in central London. It appears that the intended target of the strike was a gathering of IS leaders, and that the group attacked — at an Italian restaurant celebrating the 70th birthday of one of the confirmed dead — was mistaken for the IS cell. In addition to the dead were over 40 wounded, many with life-threatening injuries. A number of children were among the 70 casualties. While the US government has so far refused to confirm responsibility for the strike, a State Department spokesperson has said that, should in transpire that the US is responsible for the deaths, “collateral damage, while extremely rare, is a regrettable consequence of the ongoing efforts of the US to combat international terrorism,” and that, “citizens of London should be well aware by now that there are certain areas in the city that should be avoided.” The State Department spokesperson also noted that all strikes are conducted with the “utmost care,” and that it is not unusual for civilian death tolls to be “significantly exaggerated” by authorities in the UK. Residents of the UK have been active on social media condemning the attack, noting that the international media show little or no interest in reporting on mass civilian casualties of US drone strikes in predominantly Christian nations. “Basically, the media might report that some people were killed in an attack and that’s it. No follow-up. No discussion of guilt. It’s like the lives of white Christian bankers in London count for less than nothing,” said UKJames on Twitter. Another Twitter user asked, “How can it be that the US is allowed to attack who and where they want in England, killing civilians, without any consequences? These were innocent people eating dinner. Where’s the outrage?” Many of the posts on Facebook and Twitter also pointed out the how the “War on Terror” deaths of wealthier Christians in Europe are ignored by the media, while poorer Muslims, killed in places like Afghanistan and Yemen, get disproportionate coverage and attention from major news outlets. Not all comments on social media, however, were sympathetic to the victims in London. “If these people in don’t want to get killed, why do they even live in England? Move somewhere else. Just not here!” tweeted EagleUSA1990. Others were quick to note that there was no evidence that those killed in the restaurant were not, in fact, members of IS, and that, “If you take your children out at night in a place like London it’s your fault of they get killed. What kind of people are these? They shouldn’t even have kids.” London Mayor Sadiq Khan has expressed outrage over the deaths, saying that a full investigation into the attack must take place, including criminal charges of negligent homicide against those responsible — this, despite the fact that the US has indicated it will not recognize any legal decision made outside of a US court. Khan noted that this is the fourth US drone attack in the UK in recent months: attacks that have claimed over 1,000 innocent lives in the UK in the last decade. One of these included a strike in July of this year that hit a wedding on the outskirts of the city of Manchester killing 44 participants, including the bride and her entire family. As the wedding took place in an “area of interest” to the US government, however, an internal investigation resulted in a finding of “no culpability” on the part of the United States. Despite the US government refusal to claim responsibility, families of the Manchester victims were nevertheless offered $500 compensation each by US authorities, “in memory of the dead, and as a sign of goodwill on the part of the United States of America.” (US drone strike intended for Isis hideout kills 30 pine nut workers in Afghanistan)"

Medium.com,Society,Why India’s push for electric vehicles alone won’t solve its air pollution crisis,World,https://medium.com/rethinking-public-policy/why-indias-push-for-electric-vehicles-alone-won-t-solve-its-air-pollution-crisis-770ce9dff094?source=topic_page---------612------------------1," India’s recent economic slowdown appears to have taken an unexpected victim — the Indian government’s electric vehicle (EV) ambitions. Faced with weak exports, declining car sales and widespread layoffs in the automotive sector, the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) government appears to have backtracked on its EV agenda. Road Transport & Highways Minister Nitin Gadkari confirmed this by stating that the national government was not setting a specific timeline for the switch to EVs, and would let market forces determine the speed of the transition. The NITI Aayog (government think-tank) had previously drafted an ambitious proposal to ban the sale of non-electric three-wheelers and smaller motorcycles by 2023 and 2025, respectively, and permit the sale of only EVs from 2030. Although environmentalists may be disheartened by Gadkari’s latest statement, it isn’t necessarily a setback to India’s air pollution battle. The NITI Aayog’s plan, which made EVs the centrepiece of the air pollution strategy, is unlikely to succeed. According to reports, the NITI Aayog plans to order Ola and Uber to electrify 40 per cent of their fleet by 2026. The BJP supported this target by only providing fiscal incentives under Phase II of the Faster Adoption and Manufacturing of Hybrid and Electric Vehicles (FAME-II) scheme in the four-wheeler segment for commercial taxis and ride-hailing fleets. In theory, the government’s strategy makes sense. Individual consumers are unlikely to be early EV adopters due to higher costs and range anxiety. In contrast, taxi drivers could benefit from higher fuel savings and low operating costs accrued through longer daily driving distances. Besides, as ride-hailing cabs operate in densely-congested cities, it could lower vehicular emissions. In reality, however, the BJP’s strategy is flawed, since it continues to prioritise personal mobility over public transport. Under FAME-II, incentives are designed to support 10 lakh electric two-wheelers, five lakh three-wheelers, 55,000 four-wheelers, but only 7,000 e-buses. This is worrying since the usage of public transport in urban India has been consistently falling from a high of 60–80 per cent in 1994 to an estimated 25–35 per cent in 2018, mainly due to the lack of adequate city bus infrastructure. The total number of buses has remained flat in the last five years, while the number of two and four-wheelers has been constantly rising, leading to increased congestion. The FAME-II scheme is likely to further this trend by incentivising consumers to opt for EVs in shared mobility fleets, rather than switching to public transport. This is concerning, since a study found that ride-hailing firms are adding more vehicles to the roads in urban areas, increasing traffic congestion and air pollution. This is acutely felt in India’s densely-congested cities, where ride-hailing firms often compensate for the lack of quality public transport. Although ride-hailing apps are designed to promote ‘shared mobility’, statistics show that only 25 per cent of riders in India opt for UberPool. The majority of riders take individual rides, contributing to traffic congestion. This also has a knock-on effect on economic productivity, with India’s four major cities losing $22 billion annually due to time lost in traffic — a broader challenge that can’t be addressed by the electrification of shared mobility fleets. Instead, the BJP must pursue policies that prioritise public transport, such as congestion pricing, improved bus quality, technological innovation and multi-modal transport integration. As Gustavo Petro, the mayor of Bogota, Colombia, once said: “A developed country is not a place where the poor have cars. It’s where the rich use public transportation.” There is a common misconception that EVs are zero-emission vehicles. Although they don’t have any tail-pipe emissions, they still contribute PM emissions through brake and tyre wear and the re-suspension of road dust. A study found that from 2002–2011, non-exhaust sources (e.g. road dust, brake wear and tyre wear) were responsible for 66–86 per cent of total PM10 emissions from vehicles in Delhi. Separately, a study in the UK found that EVs tend to be 24 per cent heavier than equivalent internal combustion engine (ICE) vehicles (due to large batteries), which could necessitate harder braking, and consequently, higher PM emissions. Although there are few EV models to verify this claim in India, it should be noted that the kerb weight of the Mahindra Verito is 1,140kg, while its electric equivalent, the Mahindra eVerito, is significantly heavier at 1,265kg. Many will argue that EVs can still significantly reduce exhaust emissions from ICE vehicles. That would be true prior to April 2020, the date when all vehicles in India must comply with the stringent BS-VI standards (equivalent to Euro-VI standards). Under the proposed standards, vehicle manufacturers must install filters that significantly reduce nitrogen oxide, carbon monoxide, hydrocarbons and PM emissions. After India’s vehicle fleet transitions to BS-VI standards, non-exhaust sources of emissions are likely to assume greater importance. Therefore, rather than increasing the number of ‘zero tail-pipe emission’ vehicles, reducing the number of vehicles in urban areas must be the government’s focus to curb urban air pollution. This can be achieved by prioritising public transport and increasing designated cycling and walking paths in cities. Air pollution in India comes from several sources, many of which vary across different cities. A study by IIT-Kanpur found that road and construction dust was the largest contributor (35 per cent) to PM emissions in Delhi. In contrast, vehicles and jeeps only caused 10 per cent of the total pollution. Despite this, the Centre and the state government’s action has primarily targeted vehicular emissions. The seasonal spike in air pollution across northern Indian cities is a consequence of stubble burning in rural farms, transcending the rural-urban divide. The WHO’s air quality database (as of 2018) showed that all 126 Indian cities exceeded the prescribed guidelines for PM emissions. Although aggressive EV targets help demonstrate the BJP’s commitment towards tackling air pollution, a holistic approach is required to curb emissions from non-transport sources. The main reason successive governments have prioritised tackling transport emissions is that they can pass on the costs of compliance onto vehicle manufacturers and ‘wealthier’ consumers. In contrast to this strong EV push, the BJP has reportedly diluted nitrogen oxide emission norms for thermal power plants, after delaying their implementation by five years. This demonstrates that the government is unwilling to shoulder the burden of reducing emissions from highly polluting state-owned coal power plants. These are located away from urban centres and don’t generate public outrage. Similarly, the National Clean Air Programme (NCAP) targets a 20–30 per cent reduction in PM emissions, but doesn’t offer any concrete solutions or adequate funding (only Rs 300 crore) to achieve the proposed targets. EVs can certainly play an important role in reducing transport emissions, but they mustn’t represent a one-size-fits-all solution in India’s air pollution battle. Especially in densely-congested cities, high-quality public transport holds the key to a cleaner future.

Medium.com,Society,I miss the days when voting “Conservative” didn’t mark someone as dangerous,World,https://medium.com/@katelaing15/i-miss-the-days-when-voting-conservative-didnt-mark-someone-as-dangerous-e9089145c9ad?source=topic_page---------613------------------1," I’m what most people would call an upper-middle-class white woman, living in a 1st world country with publically funded education and health care. Most would say that I have it pretty damn good, and they’d be mostly right. But I’m also a bisexual woman in a heterosexual marriage to an Asian man with a biracial child. So — I’ve got a bit of skin in the game when it comes to the way that the current political climate of North America is headed. As a child of the 80’s and 90’s, I remember when being a Progressive Conservative, or a “Tory” — or a Republican for that matter, meant that you were fiscally conservative, believed that the free-market would sort itself out, and that family values were something to be upheld. Granted, that generally meant “white, Christian family values” and a lot of the racist, xenophobic behaviour that we’re seeing out in the open now was just happening behind closed doors, but at least it was socially unacceptable to be a bigot. I miss those days. I walk around my neighbourhood right now, in advance of the October 21st Canadian federal election, and I see a multitude of PC Party signs on lawns in my predominantly white, agriculture-based community. And it’s hard not to mark those people as unsafe. It’s possible they’re just voting for the incumbent. It’s possible they don’t understand the consequences for people who don’t look like them. It’s possible they’re not unsafe people at all, for me and my family. But it doesn’t feel that way. Because right now, the “Progressive” Conservative party is synonymous with people who think that my family shouldn’t exist. People who think that I’m not really bisexual because I married a man, or that all I need was a man to “turn me straight”. People who think that my biracial child shouldn’t exist. People who think that my husband needs to “go home” even though he was born in freaking Scarborough. People who think that they should be able to tell me what to do with my body as someone who has a uterus. Andrew Scheer, the leader of the Progressive Conservative party of Canada is on record saying he doesn’t believe in gay marriage. He’s been tied to Faith Goldy, the Yellow Vest Movement, and has a campaign manager that comes straight from Rebel Media, an alt-right publication. He has endorsed people like the Ontario premier, Doug Ford who has actively disenfranchised vulnerable groups like youth — both in terms of education and health, those with autism, the poor and the mentally ill, as well as the addicted. A premier who clearly doesn’t take racism seriously as he failed to host a mandatory anti-racism conference since taking office. A premier that is actively trying to privatize healthcare which would cost my family tens of thousands of dollars per year. So to all the people in my life who are considering voting Conservative in the election and tell me “not to take politics so personally”, and that we have to “agree to disagree” — with all due respect: NO. Agreeing to disagree is for things like whether or not pineapple belongs on pizza (absolutely not, by the way), or whether or not Beyonce deserves the title of Queen Bey (obviously). Agreeing to disagree is not meant for issues pertaining to values, to ideologies, or thought processes that will actively harm an entire class or group of people. You don’t get to vote for a person, or party, that disagrees with my rights and freedoms as a person and tell me “not to take it personally”. Because it is personal. They’re coming for me, and my family. They’re trying to marginalize us even further — to take away the things that keep us whole, and healthy. They’re trying to make it harder for my son to fit into the world — to find a place for himself where he is accepted and valued, where he can learn all there is to learn regardless of his financial circumstances; where he can be healthy and happy regardless of his financial circumstances. So yes — politics is personal right now. Because being a Conservative is no longer just about being fiscally conservative and having wholesome family values. It’s about supporting a racist, homophobic, xenophobic and classist party and the candidate in your riding that, by definition, supports those very same values. This party makes for a Canada that I don’t even recognize anymore. Voting Conservative means that, for you, the things they’ve done and said — all of which I’ve referenced above — is not a deal-breaker for you. And that marks you unsafe for me and my family. I take that personally. Very personally, indeed."

Medium.com,Society,Will Pedro Sanchez be punished for an unnecessary election?,World,https://medium.com/the-caucus/will-pedro-sanchez-be-punished-for-an-unnecessary-election-43bdf75e22d2?source=topic_page---------615------------------1," On November 10th, Spanish voters will go to the polls for the fourth time in as many years. One thing all four of the elections have had in common is that the Socialist candidate is Pedro Sanchez. After failing to win in the 2015 and 2016 elections, Sanchez had more luck in the April 2019 election where he led PSOE to their best result since 2008 and was in the driving seat to become Prime Minister, however a failure to create a sufficient coalition in the months since means that Spaniards will go back to the polls and raises the question of whether Sanchez will be punished for causing an unnecessary election? How did we get here? In June 2018, Pedro Sanchez orchestrated a successful no-confidence vote in the then-Prime Minister, Mariano Rajoy, after he had been caught up in a corruption scandal related to the Gürtel case, that has implicated many within the People’s Party. However, even though the successful no-confidence motion meant that Sanchez was to become Prime Minister, it meant he would have the weakest government in the history of post-Francoist Spain and lacked a parliamentary majority. Sanchez promised that elections would soon followed, but this only happened nearly a year later after his budget proposal failed to get passed in the Congress of Deputies. The April 2019 election led to an even more fractured and fragmented Congress of Deputies, with five parties securing over 10 per cent of the vote, but gave Sanchez a clear mandate to attempt to form a government. His initial plan to was to try and form a coalition government with the left-wing, social democratic and populist, Podemos (We Can) party — however this failed to materialise due to a few factors including the Podemos leadership accusing Sanchez of not giving them enough in terms of cabinet posts, as well as Podemos’s own internal feuds. The only main issue with a PSOE-Podemos alliance was that it would still fail to achieve a majority in the Congress of Deputies, putting Sanchez at the mercy of Catalan and Basque nationalist parties that would have demanded a referendum on the issue of independence, something that Sanchez would never accept. The other feasible government that could have been formed in the wake of the April 2019 ballot was a PSOE coalition with the centre-right, pro-business Ciudadanos (Citizens) party headed by Albert Rivera. However, this failed to materialise also as there is personal animosity between Sanchez and Rivera, as well as the fact Ciudadanos have shifted ideologically to the right over recent years, away from their centrist roots. The main positive that a PSOE-Ciudadanos coalition would have had is that it would be a majority in the Congress of Deputies, as well as pushing populist parties such as Podemos and Vox firmly into opposition. Which issues will define the election? The election will be defined by the need to form a strong government, something that Spain has lacked since December 2015 and end the political paralysis that has been going on for some time. If Sanchez presses ahead with this message, it could benefit him and lead to him increasing PSOE’s vote share — something that seemed incredibly unlikely only a matter of months ago after the party lost control of the important southern region of Andalusia in regional elections. If Sanchez sees his vote share go up by a considerable margin, it might prove difficult for either Podemos or Ciudadanos to refuse to go into coalition with him or even just a confidence and supply agreement. Another issue that will define the issue is Catalonian Independence. If the election returns a result similar to the April poll, then Sanchez will likely have to lean on the support for secessionists to return a majority and the question then is — what will the price be for backing Sanchez? — it will likely either be more powers returned to those regions, Catalonia and the Basque country, or even possibly a referendum on the issue (something that is currently supported by Podemos) The other main issue that might still happen is the effect of a no-deal Brexit. If Britain leaves the European Union on October 31st without a deal, then there is likely to be an economic turndown in continental Europe that could easily affect Spain. The other consequence of a no-deal Brexit for Spain is in relation to Gibraltar. Even though Spanish voters would not feel the effects of a no-deal like Britain would, it could still prove to be a tricky issue in the dying days of an election campaign. Punished for an unnecessary election? It did not have to come to this — if Sanchez had given a better deal to Podemos or reassured Ciudadanos more, then there could have been a functioning government in Spain and the idea of an election would still be years away. Spanish voters are likely to be fatigued, they’ve had four general elections in as many years, as well as many Mayoral, Regional elections this year — that were accompanied by European elections. It is likely that many in Spain will suffer voter fatigue and possibly abstain or at least be more apathetic. This election could also be framed as Sanchez being indulgent — he already had his election, he won it, but it was not good enough for him and he could easily be punished by the voters for making them go and vote again. There’s a track record in recent years of politicians calling unnecessary elections being punished for it — two examples that spring to mind are Theresa May and her self-indulgent snap election in 2017 and Matteo Renzi’s constitutional reform referendum in 2016. Closing thoughts If Sanchez can frame this election as others, such as Podemos and Ciudadanos, preventing him from bringing stability back to Spanish politics then he could benefit immensely and become the strongest social democratic voice in the whole of Western Europe. However, if his opponents frame the vote as Sanchez being self-indulgent and merely an attempt to strengthen his hand, then he could easily be punished by the voters. The key in this election will be the framing behind why it is happening in the first place, whoever wins that battle will likely be successful come the evening of November 10th."

Medium.com,Society,The British Government is on course to rewrite the Good Friday Agreement,World,https://medium.com/@ecklewchuk/the-british-government-is-on-course-to-rewrite-the-good-friday-agreement-597fb123b667?source=topic_page---------617------------------1," The British Home Office has enlisted one of the most advanced constitutional lawyers in the UK to prepare a legal case that declares me, and all the people of Northern Ireland as British. I am in-fact an Irish national, Irish by birth, by law and by virtue of the Good Friday Agreement.



The right to identify and be accepted as Irish or British or both is a central tenet of the Agreement itself – a lynchpin of equality in Northern Ireland. If successful, the British Government will nullify that equality and rewrite the purpose and intent of the ‘birthright’ provisions. Tearing up a compromise that ended decades of violence and conflict.



The British Government has stated that the people of Northern Ireland remain British citizens, even if they identify as Irish and are using this policy as a way to restrict and remove the EU rights and entitlements of Northern Ireland born Irish citizens.



For four years the Home Office, on behalf of the British Government, has pursued a legal challenge against me and my US husband. It began as a simple immigration case when we applied for an EEA residence card, and has morphed into a constitutional test of the Good Friday Agreement. One that the Government is keeping tightly under wraps.



The basis of the appeal against us is the Home Office assertion that I am in-fact a British citizen. I have never held a British passport, or claimed British citizenship, as is my right under the Belfast Good Friday Agreement. Words cannot accurately describe the feeling of having your lifelong identity brought in to question by a Government department. Being Irish was neither a choice or decision I made, it is simply who I am.



To be accepted as Irish, the Home Office has suggested I renounce British citizenship and reiterated that point in court last week. A process that requires an individual to accept that they are British, prove that they are British, declare themselves as British and pay a hefty fee to do so. A policy that is only required of one community in Northern Ireland – those who identify as Irish, raising questions over Government interference into some of our most basic human rights.



The Immigration Tribunals ruled in our favour, citing the birthright provisions of the Good Friday Agreement – a decision the Home Office deems a “fundamental and egregious error of law”, a decision the Home Office has spent two years trying to overturn. At a hearing in the Upper Tribunal last week Tony McGleenan QC, who is taking directions from the Secretary of State for the Home Department herself, argued that I am not nor was I ever an “EEA national”. This is before Brexit.



Their argument is two-fold; first the Government seeks to create a distinction between identity and citizenship under the Good Friday Agreement, claiming that in 1998 people voted for a non binding recognition that they can identify as they please, not that they can choose their citizenship. There are many that will disagree with this erroneous interpretation. Second, is that even if the birthright provisions were to mean a choice of citizenship, that right does not exist in domestic UK law – sound the alarm bells. The British Government is once again showing its aversion to international law and obligations, claiming that “A treaty HMG is party of does not alter the laws of the United Kingdom.” An argument that further cements the need for a legally operable backstop.



A failure of the UK Government to give domestic legal effect to a provision of a treaty does not absolve the Government of its obligations under international law. Identity in Northern Ireland cuts across religion, political expression and national identity and what we’re dealing with here is a Government willfully ignoring the delicate identity balance that exists in NI. A government that is tone deaf to the sensitivities and historical significance of the region. A Government that is on course to rewrite a fundamental provision of the Good Friday Agreement without the consent of the people of this island.



We were represented by Ronan Lavery QC, who added that were we to imagine that the Germans had won the second world war and imposed German citizenship on all British people. He asked: “Wouldn’t Britons find it offensive to have to go through a process of renouncing German citizenship?”



The Home Office was represented by an experienced Crown Solicitor, junior counsel & one of the most advanced constitutional lawyers in the UK with a further three Home Office officials. This speaks volumes as to how keen the British Government are to minimize the reading and impact of the Good Friday Agreement and to what end?



What is it about UK policy that would require a government to foist citizenship upon people who do not want it? Imposing citizenship hardens identities, for two decades, thanks to the blanket of EU law and the Good Friday Agreement we’ve had an open space to soften identity lines in Northern Ireland.



If the Government is successful in this legal challenge, one which they’ve stated they will continue to pursue, people will be forced to make a choice. A choice based on access to rights, a choice that will stoke tensions and create divides between the two communities of Northern Ireland. A choice, that the Good Friday Agreement is designed to prevent."
Medium.com,Society,Reframing the Climate Crisis,World,https://medium.com/@nancyyoung_33269/reframing-the-climate-crisis-9c77f2d81b17?source=topic_page---------618------------------1," The young environmental world leaders from Cité Soleil, Haiti you have not heard about…yet. By Nancy Young There is an increasingly common climate crisis story structure that starts something like this: Scientists have made the dire prediction that BAD THING — rising temperatures, ocean levels, fires, species and plant die-offs — will happen in 12 (11, 10, 9) years if we don’t do anything (and, of course, we are not doing anything). Well, folks, the FUTURE IS NOW! This is one of those stories — because the future is now in Haiti. But this is not one of those apocalyptic indicators in nature — like how in some places we are already seeing a two-degree or higher increase in temperature. This is a story about an unnaturally occurring climate crisis phenomena: a gas shortage in Haiti that has shut down the country. So as I write this on a #FridayfortheFuture, where thousands of young people around the globe are on strike from school to force leaders to act on the climate crisis, kids in Port-au-Prince are home from school because they literally can’t get there because of the gas shortage as well as the explosion of anger about its causes (government mismanagement, corruption, the usual suspects). Streets are barricaded with burning tires and a general strike has been called so you go out at your own risk. This is all happening under a hot, bright sun that Haiti never has any shortage of and which could be its dominant source of power. In another, easily imagined and yet seemingly impossible world, the people of Haiti, upon hearing the news that there is a gas shortage could be saying, “That’s ok, we don’t need it. Who even uses gas anymore?” But just because the children of Haiti might not be striking from school today because they can’t get there to walk out, doesn’t mean they aren’t leading an environmental movement and battling the climate crisis all the same. Welcome to SAKALA. When I am in Haiti, I stay at the SAKALA community center in Cité Soleil. SAKALA was founded in 2006 by people who grew up in the neighborhood and wanted to give kids growing up there alternatives to joining gangs. So they started with peace-through-sports programs, which were also a way to get kids in school or even to get them a meal they otherwise might not have had and which alone could be the difference between feeling like you have to join a gang just to survive. Even though it has never had nearly enough resources, somehow SAKALA has grown to include educational, agricultural, and entrepreneurial training programs. It is home to Jaden Tap Tap, Haiti’s largest urban garden, built on the site of an old dump that was adjacent to their soccer field. One of its leaders and co-founders, Daniel Tillias, was recently named a CNN Hero for 2019. SAKALA is a place where the seeds planted grow under what can be incredibly harsh conditions and yet yield something more beautiful and impressive than I have seen anywhere else in the world. And when I say this I don’t mean, good for a poor place, or good for Haiti, I mean objectively better in quality and spirit than anything I’ve seen anywhere else. It is also a place that is constantly under siege. Sometime literally — it has been the site of massacres perpetrated by people in power who perceive a threat in Cité Soleil. Daniel can recall in the years before SAKALA was founded hearing leaders on the radio discussing the pros and cons of bombing Cité Soleil. SAKALA was started in part to battle the idea that there are any “pros” to bombing children who just want to play and go to school and dream big dreams like the rest of us. But sometimes the siege, the danger, is more subtle. During my morning run in the garden the other day I noticed small, well-worn pieces of glass pushing up through the soil. I am almost certain they are not new, but years old — remnants from the time this garden was a dump and that this dump could reclaim this beautiful place if we are not vigilant. Isn’t this supposed to be a climate crisis and gas shortage story, Nancy? It is. Let’s start with the garden. SAKALA does not have enough water. This is a problem that has been getting worse over time. The rainy season is not as rainy as it used to be, sometimes it is bone dry drought. And while we don’t have resources to test it, this, combined with its location near the ocean, probably means salt is getting more concentrated in the soil, making it tougher to grow things. And when it does rain it is more likely to be crazy downpours that carry away the soil rather than be absorbed by it. A 10-minute rain can flood the streets and homes, especially in Cité Soleil, where drainage canals cut through the neighborhoods that are home to 300,000 to 500,000 people, most extremely poor. Drainage canals should be a good thing, but I actually had to search my mind just now for what they are supposed to be, because the word “drainage” is so far from the reality, I normally call them trash canals. They are typically stuffed many feet deep with trash that not only does not prevent flooding but exacerbates it and leaves people having to clean up not only water damage on a regular basis but the trash that comes with it. One other thing about the water. They have lots of kids coming to play and learn at SAKALA. These days at least a couple of hundred or more children come every day as the economic and political situation in Haiti bottoms out. The people of Haiti are constantly finding that you should never think bottom has been reached because there is always someplace lower. These hundreds of kids need water and we try to supply it, buying countless 5-gallon refillable bottles. There is no clean, running water from the tap here — and in most places — no running water at all. What they normally do is gather up all the empty five-gallon bottles at once, put them in a trailer pulled by a motorcycle and go get them refilled. But, no gas now. Or only super expensive gas now — $5 to $10 per gallon (or more). And even with the super expensive gas there is no guarantee on quality. You can get that same good price-gauging money with gas doctored with water — in fact you make a better profit if you do that. Oh, and the no-gas thing? Hurts trash pickup too — always spotty in Port-au-Prince — and so the waste is piling up everywhere, even in neighborhoods with money who normally can get it carted away. This last is less an issue for Cité Soleil as the trash trucks don’t go there anyway. I’ve learned in my years talking about Haiti and SAKALA and Cité Soleil that if I go on too long — or even at all — about the problems, people tune out. They get bummed, feel hopeless. It is a weird part of human nature — that I have too of course — that you could be drinking your pumpkin spice latte that costs more than the daily minimum wage in Haiti and still be made more hopeless and inert by just hearing about the problems than the people who actually have to deal with them with no pumpkin spice comfort at all. So let me get back to the beauty of this place. And we will start with the trash. Earlier this year, SAKALA started an environmental art program called FatraKa (Haitian Creole for Trash Can). When Daniel Tillias first explained it to me, he said that they would use recycled objects they found in the trash and turn it into treasure. I thought it was a nice idea — and it was symbolic too of SAKALA’s increasing focus on the environment. And I expected that when I saw what was produced I would of course love it because I love these kids and would happily put up on the refrigerator their pictures even if no one else in the world would see the value in it. But then I saw the first pieces — frames mostly — and they were not just nice, they were a revelation. Distinctive and beautiful and cool and funky in a way I had never seen before. And they transformed me from someone who is the most reluctant saleswoman ever (as a child selling boxes of oranges door-to-door for a school fundraiser my pitch was, “You don’t want to buy any oranges, do you?” ) Suddenly I couldn’t wait to show these to the world, to lug my suitcases filled with SAKALA frames, annoying people on the NYC subway by taking up more than my share of space, pushing the limits of what I could carry and how far I could carry it. Thankful to yoga for giving me a back that did not snap too easily. You know how I was saying earlier that what I have seen at SAKALA, the spirit there, the creativity, was the best I have seen anywhere, well these frames were a way to bring that to people who were never going to visit SAKALA, never going to visit Haiti, because maybe they were scared or just not interested. This was a way for me to carry this excellence, this spirit back with me. These frames became a symbol for me of how we could take anything that was thrown at us and transform it into something ingenious, artistic, useful — whatever the occasion we had to rise to, we could. And yes, even the climate crisis, because, yes, this is about the climate crisis too. We could say suck it, climate crisis, suck it injustice and greed, you’re not going to beat us. We shall overcome. And so, yes, I became an evangelist for these frames (a very low-key evangelist, I am still the little girl who says “you don’t want to buy oranges, do you?). And in the beginning I watched closely for people’s reactions, I waited for them to feign politeness, to think the frames were nice because I’m nice and it must be fun for the kids to make these and that was nice. We’re all nice people. And that sometimes happened. But, mostly, the genuine reaction I got was, “Wow!” To which I would I say, “I know, right?” And words I never thought I would say, “I’m going to start an Etsy shop.” And so today at this time, I should be writing this with a slightly sore back after lugging a big suitcase filled with frames, through airports, subways, and bus stations. But I’m not. Just a carry-on filled with clothes and a laptop. Because there is a gas shortage in Haiti. And people can’t go anywhere — or have to spend the day getting a gallon or two of a maybe gas/water combination that will damage your engine. This situation went on for the past couple of weeks when on Sunday there was a spontaneous enough-is-enough furor in the air and barricades and burning tires went up in the streets because if I can’t go anywhere, you can’t go anywhere. If I can’t make a living, neither can you. So on Sunday, when I was staying at SAKALA, and while the streets were still relatively clear, we thought maybe it would be better to go to a place nearer the airport, where, if worse came to worse, I could always walk to make my Tuesday flight. So in a rush, I packed just what was needed, thinking I would be able to come back for the frames Tuesday morning before my flight because SAKALA is only about three miles from the airport. But by Tuesday morning it was clear nothing was getting through, that the situation was worsening, not easing. Daniel tried to bring in his car the one frame he had with him, one that he had made for a customer with a special request, but the main road and bridge between where he lives and the airport was blocked and no cars were allowed through. So he went back home. Ditched his car and tried to get to the airport on the moto taxi. I walked to the airport and I checked my carry-on and waited until the last minute to go through security in case he could get there. But he couldn’t. He and the moto driver breathed in a lot of smoke from burning tires looking for a path through, but there wasn’t one and they had to turn back It might seem crazy to risk that, to drive into chaos, for a thing, for a frame. But it was not just a thing, it was not just a frame Daniel was carrying, it was hope and excellence and beauty, which we need here as much as there. Because we are in a climate crisis. You may not feel it like they do in Haiti yet, where the future is now. And to fight it, to transform it into something better and transcend it, we need all the hope and excellence and beauty we can get. And who better to learn from than the youths growing up now in Cité Soleil, city of the sun."
Medium.com,Society,Long read: The forgotten faces and hidden history of Pakistan’s blasphemy laws,World,https://medium.com/@cswforbinfull/long-read-the-forgotten-faces-and-hidden-history-of-pakistans-blasphemy-laws-23ae3c9235ad?source=topic_page---------619------------------1," The criminalisation of blasphemy has become synonymous with Pakistan. No case highlights the fervour and frustration associated with blasphemy more than that of Asia Noreen (better known as Asia Bibi), the Pakistani Christian woman who was falsely accused of blasphemy and sentenced to death in 2010. Throughout Bibi’s protracted legal case, the worst instincts of certain sections of Pakistani society were brought to the fore and played out in national and international media as Islamist groups staged violent demonstrations calling for her execution on multiple occasions, even after her conviction was overturned by the Supreme Court in 2018. Following a nine-year ordeal, Asia Bibi and her family were eventually taken to Canada to start a new life, but for many other victims their fate is less hopeful, and they are left languishing under long jail sentences, prolonged when cases are adjourned without hearing. Pakistan’s blasphemy legislation is crude in its application and consequence. The laws were first introduced to British administered India in 1860 to prevent religious communalism and intra-religious conflict. They were codified within the Indian Penal Code (IPC) to protect places of worship and sacred objects from defilement (Section 295); religious assemblies from disturbance (Section 296); funeral remains and burial sites from malicious trespass (Section 297); and religious feelings of any person from deliberate insult (Section 298). Pakistan inherited the laws after Partition, which separated the Indian sub-continent to create India and Pakistan in 1947. In 1980, the blasphemy laws were expanded to criminalise making derogatory remarks against Islamic personages. In 1982, Section 295-B was added, criminalising the desecration of the Qur’an. Section 295-C was added in 1986, which made derogatory remarks against the Prophet Muhammad a criminal offence punishable by death or life imprisonment. From the introduction of the laws in 1927 until 1986, fourteen blasphemy cases were reported, but by 2017 the number had increased to over 1,500. The National Commission for Justice and Peace (NCJP), a human rights organisation based in Pakistan, found that a total of 776 Muslims, 505 Ahmadis, 229 Christians and 30 Hindus were accused under the blasphemy laws between 1987 and 2018. What is clear is that the blasphemy laws are not a deterrent. They have become a weapon of revenge used indiscriminately against Muslims and non-Muslims in situations that arise due to petty grievances, jealousy and business rivalry, under the guise of preventing insults to religion. The former Governor of Punjab, Salman Taseer, was a vocal critic of the blasphemy laws. In 2011 he said: “The blasphemy law is not a God-made law. It’s a man-made law… it’s a law which gives an excuse to extremists and reactionaries to target weak people and minorities.” Taseer was killed by his bodyguard, Mumtaz Qadri, in 2011. During Qadri’s trial for Taseer’s murder, the Supreme Court noted that “The majority of blasphemy cases are based on false accusations stemming from property issues or other personal or family vendettas rather than genuine instances of blasphemy, and they inevitably lead to mob violence against the entire community.” A few months after Taseer’s murder, Shahbaz Bhatti, Federal Minister for Minorities, who advocated for reform of the blasphemy laws was assassinated in an attack claimed by the Taliban. The impact of a false accusation is like a death knell with far reaching consequences for the accused and their families. In recent decades there have been numerous cases of accusations, assassinations, lynching, intimidation and censorship. In response to accusations, and due to the emotive and sensitive nature of blasphemy, violent mobs blinded by vigilante justice have forced individuals into hiding, attacked communities and burned down homes. In 2013 Sawan Masih, a Christian from Joseph Colony in Punjab, was accused by a Muslim friend of insulting the Prophet Mohammed during a conversation. A local mosque broadcasted the accusation, prompting a 3000-strong mob to attack the Christian neighbourhood of Joseph Colony. Almost 200 homes were torched and hundreds of families were displaced. Sawan Masih was sentenced to death in 2014, he is still in prison. During his seventh appeal which took place on 17 September 2019 in the Lahore High Court, Mr Masih’s lawyer informed CSW that the judge, Justice Mazhar Ali Akbar Naqvi referred the case to the Anti-Terrorism court (ATC). During proceedings his lawyer argued that the case had been referred to the ATC once before, where the presiding judge had flatly refused to it hear the case and reverted it to the high court. Justice Navqi insisted the case would have to go to the ATC and that he would only hear a high court appeal if the ATC judge again decides not to hear the case. Many blasphemy cases like Sawan Masih’s suffer delays where proceedings are repeatedly postponed or referred to the ATC and become stuck in the legal system, causing additional trauma and delaying justice for victims. In some cases the mob is so stirred up that targets of blasphemy accusations are killed before allegations are even investigated. Shama and Shezad Masih were a Christian couple who worked as bonded labourers in a brick kiln outside of Lahore. In November 2014 Shama Masih was falsely accused of burning pages of the Qur’an, which led to the horrific lynching of her and her husband by a violent mob before any investigation took place. In April 2017, Mashal Khan, a student at Abdul Wali Khan University in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, was brutally beaten and killed by a mob including fellow students and staff on his university campus. He had been falsely accused of posting blasphemous content online, and was murdered before the allegation was investigated. Though his death shocked the nation and reignited the debate to amend the blasphemy laws, there was no change to the legislation. For numerous victims who are imprisoned, the judicial process can take years while they await trial. In July 2013 Shagufta Kausar and Shafqat Masih, a Christian couple from Gojra, were sentenced to death under Section 295-C for sending blasphemous text messages to local cleric Muhammad Hussein. The couple are illiterate and unable to text in English; they have always maintained their innocence. Shagufta is being held in Multan’s Central Jail, where Asia Bibi was kept, while Shafqat, who is paralysed and confined to a wheelchair, is 150 miles away in the Faisalabad District Jail. Their case has suffered repeated postponements as they await an appeal in the Lahore High Court. Such delays occur because of the palpable fear surrounding hearings. Many lawyers and judges are reluctant to take on cases due to threats, attacks, and reprisals against their families, and even targeted killings. In 2013 Junaid Hafeez, a lecturer at Multan University, was charged with posting blasphemous material on Facebook. His first lawyer quit after threats from conservative colleagues. His second lawyer, human rights activist Rashid Rehman, was threatened during a hearing to drop the case by opposing lawyers. Despite Mr Rehman’s complaints to the police and the district bar association, nothing was done. He was shot dead in his office in May 2014. Mr Hafeez’s current lawyer, Asad Jamal, admits that his case has been severely hampered by repeated delays. The increasing politicisation of the laws has normalised their misuse and stalled attempts to amend legislation. Playing blasphemy politics has been a useful tool for former and present governments, whose support of the laws remain unwavering. Many perceive the blasphemy laws as brutal and highly divisive, often used to victimise religious minorities and human rights activists. Online space provides a refuge where activists can voice concerns about human rights violations and hold the government and military to account; however that space has become increasingly contested, with growing restrictions on freedom of expression and the policing of social media for content which may be deemed blasphemous. In March 2017 former Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif called blasphemy an “unpardonable offence,” directing the government at the time to bring anyone responsible for sharing blasphemous content on social media to justice. This step was seen by civil society as an attempt to silence dissenting voices and compromise freedom of expression. During his 2018 election campaign, current Prime Minister Imran Khan used the issue of blasphemy to capitalise on the vote bank of the religious right. At an address to Muslim leaders in Islamabad he proclaimed: “We are standing with Article 295c and will defend it.” This uneasy relationship between the government and it’s pandering to the religious right further complicates the issue of blasphemy. In a visit to Pakistan in 2012 former UN Special Rapporteur on the Independence of Judges and Lawyers Gabriela Knaul noted: “These laws serve the vested interests of extremist religious groups and are not only contrary to the Constitution of Pakistan, but also to international human rights norms, in particular those relating to non-discrimination and freedom of expression and opinion.” This was demonstrated when Khadim Hussain Rizvi, blasphemy proponent and the leader of the Islamist group, Tehreek-i-Labbaik Pakistan (TLP), instigated protests against the Supreme Court’s decision to overturn Asia Bibi’s death sentence in October 2018. Rizvi called for the judges who acquitted Asia Bibi to be killed, and encouraged the army to rebel. His supporters took to the streets, blocking major roads, causing disruption and millions of pounds worth of damage. The three-day nationwide demonstrations ended when the TLP signed an agreement with the Pakistani government, which included allowing a review petition of the Supreme Court’s judgement and placing Asia Bibi on the Exit Control List, preventing her from leaving the country. The space to debate the blasphemy laws has been so threatened that discussion of the laws have been suppressed. Attempts at reforms by politicians have met with little success. When Sherry Rehman, a member of the Pakistan People’s Party (PPP) submitted an amendment bill in 2011, then prime minister, Yousaf Raza Gilani, said that his government would not touch the legislation: “We are all unanimous that nobody wants to change the law.” Ms Rehman was forced to withdraw her amendments. Pakistan’s Human Rights Commission (HRCP), and the National Human Rights Commission (NHRC) have both proposed procedural amendments to the law, highlighting the incompatibility of the blasphemy laws with international law. In 2018 Pakistan’s Senate Functional Committee on Human Rights discussed ways to stop misuse of the laws, they recommended that anyone who falsely accuses a person of blasphemy should be awarded a similar punishment prescribed for a convict of blasphemy. Repeated calls to amend or repeal the laws by international actors have also fallen on deaf ears. Any political intervention to reform the law risks the ire of the Islamist groups, which no government is willing to do. The mere hint of reform is usually met with violence, as typified by Asia Bibi’s case. International condemnation of the laws from institutions like the UN Human Rights Council and United States Commission on International Religious Freedom (USCIRF), have had negligible impact. Pakistan is signatory to the Universal Declaration of Human Rights (UDHR) and the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR), but continues to violate both agreements through its oppression of minorities. In May 2019, 51 MEPs wrote to Imran Khan asking for an end to the persecution of religious minorities and condemning the use of the blasphemy laws. The letter stated that ongoing violation of the ICCPR Convention could result in the suspension of all EU subsidies and trade preferences to Pakistan under the GSP+ preferences. It is clear that the impetus to change the blasphemy laws must come from within Pakistan. However, the problem goes beyond legislative reform. Even if the State were to amend or repeal discriminatory legislation, years of Islamisation under Zia-ul-Huq has institutionalised intolerance and bred radicalism. Research by Arafat Mazhar, Director of Engage Pakistan, an NGO working on reforming the blasphemy law, makes a critical analysis of what the Islamic texts say about blasphemy in his report ‘ The Untold Truth of Pakistan’s Blasphemy Law’. He examines the Hanafi perspective (one of the major Islamic schools of thought and widely followed by Muslims in Pakistan) and works of classical jurists, muftis, academics and legal experts to highlight factual inaccuracies in the judicial interpretation of the law. During the 1986 debate to amend Section 295-C, only one out of the six parliamentarians, Muhammad Hamza, opposed the inclusion of the death penalty. Hamza called for a comprehensive review of the Islamic sources used to justify the death penalty by religious scholars and experts before any change in the law was passed. The other parliamentarians argued that among the entire Muslim community there was an ‘Ijma, ‘ i.e. consensus, and not a single dissenting opinion on the matter, and therefore no need for further debate. Arafat Mazhar’s research found that every text used by Parliament to support claims of consensus on capital punishment for blasphemy in fact reveals a caveat that non-Muslims should not be killed for insulting the Prophet. Changing the blasphemy laws will not happen overnight. There needs to be a considerable shift in majoritarian thinking and the extremist mind-set in certain sections of society to create a space for discussion and reduce the appetite for the blasphemy laws. This can be achieved by implementing essential reforms to Pakistan’s biased education system which propagates intolerance towards religious minorities; building consensus from the ground through work like that of Arafat Mazhar, all supported by a government with the will and determination to address the issue. We must not forget the plight of those who have been falsely accused of blasphemy, like Sawan Masih, Junaid Hafeez, Shagufta Kasur and Shafqat Masih. The government of Pakistan must be reminded that the blasphemy laws are wholly incompatible with Pakistan’s commitments under international law and Imran Khan’s vision of a ‘Naya Pakistan’ where religious minorities are protected and afforded equal rights under the constitution.

Medium.com,Society,Refighting the Balkan Wars Won’t Lead to a Seat at the Table in Brussels,World,https://medium.com/@hasawatermark/refighting-the-balkan-wars-wont-lead-to-a-seat-at-the-table-in-brussels-85494435780c?source=topic_page---------620------------------1," Historical feuds between Balkan nations are rarely solved once and for all. In most cases, the concerned countries either come up with temporary solutions, such as reaching out for international arbitration or choose to ignore these disputes entirely, sticking to their version of events, as Turkey and Greece do with the Northern Cyprus issue. Some of these disagreements stretch back to more than a century ago, others only as far as the turmoil of the Yugoslav wars during the 1990s. However, in recent years, there has been a big prize that tempts these countries to settle such issues: the prospect of joining the European Union. So far, only Slovenia and Croatia have been successful in their European endeavors, while the other countries that were once a part of Yugoslavia are still very far away from reaching that landmark — as are Turkey and Albania. The EU has been perceived as the “promised land” for many of these small and undeveloped countries, which have struggled to make ends meet after the painful transition to democracy. The appeal of establishing an efficient rule of law and a functioning market economy also serves as the best motivation to put the past where it belongs and to move forward. While historical disputes can often ignite full-blown trade wars, as the world has seen with Japan and South Korea, the small economies in the Balkans do not have that luxury. Instead, they tend to use the leverage of EU membership over each other. If a candidate country seeks to begin accession negotiations with the EU, first it needs a recommendation from the European Commission. If it gets that, then it needs the approval of the European Council. And the European Council needs to have unanimous consent from the EU member states, especially when it comes to matters such as EU membership. During the last couple of years, North Macedonia has probably been the leading example when it comes to resolving historical disputes with its neighbors. Last year, it ended an almost 30-year naming dispute with Greece. After North Macedonia (then called Macedonia) declared its independence in 1991, Greece strongly opposed the use of the term “Macedonia” in the name of its neighbor, since it also had a region named Macedonia. The long-standing dispute finally resulted in the 2018 agreement under which Macedonia changed its name to North Macedonia. A year before that, the country signed a friendship treaty with another one of its neighbors — the much bigger EU member Bulgaria, with whom it differs about various interpretations of each country’s history. Bulgaria often claims that Macedonian historical figures and landmarks are actually Bulgarian. These claims range from medieval to contemporary history. The friendship treaty took more than five years to negotiate. The two agreements were met with excitement in the region, since they symbolized a new approach — one where conflicts weren’t swept under the rug as usual but were dealt with instead. For North Macedonia in particular, the deal represented the much-awaited continuation to its stalled EU and NATO accession processes. (Because of the dispute with Greece, the country could not begin the accession negotiations with the EU, nor could it join NATO for more than a decade.) However, two years after the friendship treaty with Bulgaria was signed, a new dispute has emerged — and it could prove to be a costly one. When the two countries signed the historic deal back in August 2017, they agreed to establish a joint history commission, which would work on problematic issues and arguments regarding important historical events and personalities. It is bizarre that a joint commission is needed to review different interpretations of what was once seen as a common threat that united both nations: their struggle against the Ottoman Empire. Now, the joint commission is stuck on the historical legacy of one famous revolutionary hero who is claimed by both sides. Goce Delcev, born in Kilkis, Greece (then a part of the Ottoman Empire) in the second half of the 19th century, is arguably North Macedonia’s biggest national hero. Delcev was one of the most prominent leaders of the resistance against the Ottoman Empire at the time and had a significant role in the uprising of the Macedonian people against Ottoman rule at the turn of the 20th century. His name is featured in the Macedonian national anthem, and both North Macedonia and Bulgaria have named cities after him. Unlike Bulgaria, which declared its independence in 1908, North Macedonia had to wait until 1991 to gain its full independence. After the Ottoman Empire withdrew from the Balkans, the country became a part of the Kingdom of Serbs, Croats, and Slovenes in 1918, which later became Yugoslavia. While the country stayed in the Yugoslav federation until the beginning of the 1990s, Macedonian nationalism began emerging in the late 19th century. And the Internal Macedonian Revolutionary Organization (IMRO), a national liberation movement that began in 1893 and that Delcev was a part of, played an integral role in this process. However, when it comes to his nationality, there are serious claims that Delcev considered himself to be a Bulgarian. In turn, Bulgaria now insists that the Macedonian side should accept that its famed revolutionary hero is Bulgarian. Sofia has even threatened to dissolve the joint commission if Skopje doesn’t accept this notion as historical truth. The dispute quickly spread in both societies, with high officials from both countries trading blows over Delcev’s nationality. In the Balkans, these notions aren’t novelties. Another example is famed inventor Nikola Tesla, claimed by both Serbia and Croatia. In 1936, Tesla wrote, “I am equally proud of my Serb origin and my Croat homeland.” Unfortuntately, this doesn’t stop Serbia and Croatia from squabbling over Tesla’s origins every chance they get. Delcev, on the other hand, never had the opportunity to clarify his national allegiances. And this ambiguity has been seized upon regularly by politicians in both Bulgaria and North Macedonia. “If we do not reach an agreement on when to jointly celebrate Goce Delcev, Bulgaria will withdraw from further work in the joint commission,” said Bulgarian Foreign Minister Ekaterina Zaharieva in June, doubling down on claims that Delcev is a Bulgarian national hero. North Macedonia, for its part, rejects Bulgaria’s exclusive claim. “It is an undeniable historical truth, even for those with the slightest knowledge of the historical period, that Goce Delcev declared himself as a Bulgarian. But, isn’t it also historically true — 100 percent true — that Goce Delcev fought for an independent Macedonian state?” the president of North Macedonia, Stevo Pendarovski, said shortly after Zaharieva’s statement, “he even asked that his remains be buried in independent Macedonia,” he added. It appears that if a solution isn’t reached soon, then North Macedonia would have to deal with yet another obstacle in the process to join the EU, this time from Bulgaria. According to Atanas Velickov, a journalist based in North Macedonia, Delcev, for all of his historical greatness, does not deserve to be in the middle of a spat like this one. “Delcev is the biggest Macedonian revolutionary hero, celebrated in Bulgaria, too. He is a figure who needs to unite us, a figure who taught us that the struggle for freedom is the highest human goal,” Velickov said. It’s not hard to imagine that Delcev, like Tesla, would have proudly embraced both identities — what is truly unimaginable is how the two nations he fought for are now fighting over his legacy. Back then, their mutual goal was to be liberated from the Ottoman Empire. Delcev epitomized that goal, and wholeheartedly fought and died for the cause. At the beginning of August, Bulgarian Prime Minister Boyko Borisov visited North Macedonia for a joint celebration of another historical event that unites both countries — the anniversary of the Ilinden Uprising against the Ottomans. (Although Delcev was assassinated a few months before the uprising, he played a significant role in the events leading up to it.) Borisov and North Macedonia’s prime minister, Zoran Zaev, both paid their respects to Delcev and agreed to leave this dispute to the historians. Borisov also stated that the joint commission needs to find a solution by October, when North Macedonia expects to get the go-ahead for the accession talks with the EU. “I don’t even want to think that a situation like that one would be possible” Borisov said, when asked whether Bulgaria might block North Macedonia’s EU accession. Delcev himself would probably turn in his grave at the thought that Bulgaria would keep North Macedonia out of the EU. The region has seen such obstructionism before. The most recent example happened a few years ago, between the EU’s youngest member, Croatia, and its nonmember neighbor Serbia — countries that fought a bitter war during Yugoslavia’s breakup. In 2016, Croatia blocked Serbia’s accession talks with the EU on several occasions. First, Croatia demanded that Serbia change its laws on prosecuting war crimes that were committed during the Yugoslav wars in the 1990s. (The Serbian law claimed jurisdiction over war crimes committed on the entire territory of the former Yugoslavia, and Croatia didn’t take this lightly.) For several months, Zagreb refused to allow Belgrade to open key chapters of the accession talks. After the issue was initially resolved, and the EU accepted Croatia’s request that the dispute would be addressed in the negotiation process, the Croatian side blocked Serbia once again. This time, both sides argued over an issue regarding the use of Croatian language in textbooks for the Croatian national minority in Serbia. “Historical disputes in the region are, by and large, thorny issues, as they have been manipulated for decades: they thus require real leadership, which often carries political costs — such as the one paid by Syriza at the Greek parliamentary elections this year,” argued Tena Prelec, a researcher at the London School of Economics. While there are many reasons for the Balkan countries to cooperate and help each other into the EU, some can’t resist bickering instead. The wounds from recent Balkan conflicts are still fresh. Most of the former Yugoslav countries only very recently fought several wars against each other. And this has a major influence on how they perceive and act in response to their history. For instance, each year during August, tensions between Croatia and Serbia rise around the anniversary of Operation Storm — a 1995 military offensive that happened at the height of the war between the two sides. The military operation focused on the then breakaway region of Krajina — a mostly Serb-populated territory within Croatia. As Croatia was pushing for independence at the time, the region of Krajina was central to the Serbian nationalist movement within Yugoslavia and its infamous leader, Slobodan Milosevic. For the Croatian side, Operation Storm was a legitimate military operation that freed occupied parts of the country. For the Serbian side, Operation Storm still represents an act of ethnic cleansing that forced more than 200,000 Serbs to flee their homes. And with each passing year, the divide between the two sides widens, with neither Croatian nor Serbian politicians willing to make amends. There have been some positive developments regarding the joint remembrance of the event, but most have come from nongovernmental organizations in the two countries rather than from political leaders. According to Stefan Cok, a historian based in Trieste, the best way of overcoming such historical conflicts of this magnitude is to approach them calmly and objectively. “When you see a politician or a political body that uses past sufferings to create a new conflict in the present, you know this is the wrong approach,” Cok explained. “When you see a politician or a political body … that supports the freedom of historical research, that gives young generations the possibility to understand the conflicts of the past, and not to renew them, you know it is the correct approach.” For the first half of 2020, Croatia will take over the presidency of the Council of the European Union. This could either be the best thing that has happened to Serbia’s European accession dreams, or the worst, depending on whether yet another historical dispute emerges to divide them. “Ideally, the way to use history to unlock potential in the region is to start changing mindsets: from arguing over whether a certain historical figure is ‘ours’ or ‘theirs’ to taking pride in common heritage — of which there is plenty,” pointed out Prelec, the researcher at the London School of Economics. The burden of having a history of violent confrontations, as Serbia and Croatia do, can make this process much harder. But North Macedonia and Bulgaria are free of that burden, and rather than squabbling over shared heroes, they should be working together toward integrating the region into the EU and paving the way for the others to follow."
Medium.com,Society,"While the Amazon burns, Brazil’s indigenous peoples rise up",World,https://medium.com/@MarinaTMartinez/while-the-amazon-burns-brazils-indigenous-peoples-rise-up-836a5139a626?source=topic_page---------621------------------1," As people around the world pray for Amazonia, indigenous Brazilians are taking action for social and environmental justice. A record outbreak of fires is incinerating the Amazon, the largest remaining tropical rainforest in the world, which is home to at least one in every 10 species of plants and animals on Earth and millions of indigenous people. Rather than working for environmental preservation, Jair Bolsonaro, the recently elected president of Brazil, is committed to opening up the Amazon to business. He has also refused to recognize the rights of indigenous peoples — who are facing a wave of increasing attacks and threats — to their ancestral land. Wealth instead of well-being seems to be Bolsonaro’s priority, which is why many are calling him the “Tropical Trump.” “If you open up and destroy these [rainforest] territories, not only does it spell genocide for the people who live there, but it’s also catastrophic for all of humanity in terms of our fight against climate change,” Survival International senior researcher Sarah Shenker told Earther. “By far, the best way to combat climate change is to protect indigenous territories.” Indigenous Brazilians are now on a mission to remind society that they exist and are battling against the colonial tactics of governments and corporations, which see them — and the rainforest — as obstacles to economic development. “We Indians are like plants. How can we live without our soil, without our land?” asked Marta, from the Guarani tribe, in a report by Survival Brazil. “We exist. I want to tell the world that we are alive and want to be respected as peoples.” There are approximately 800,000 indigenous people in Brazil. Although they make up less than one percent of the Brazilian population, there are 305 ethnic groups and 274 unique languages among them. Most live in the Amazon region, where they have found the resources and conditions needed to sustain their way of life for generations. Some tribes still have no contact with modern society. In April, an estimated 4,000 indigenous people from many different tribes gathered for three days in Brazil’s capital to protest for their rights, demonstrate their traditions and debate with congressional leaders. This nonviolent mobilization, called Free Land Camp, has taken place every year since 2004 and is organized by the Articulation of Indigenous Peoples of Brazil, or APIB — an alliance of indigenous communities and organizations from several regions of the country. This year’s assembly denounced the growing attacks against their peoples and lands, proposed changes to the current government’s anti-indigenous policies and demanded justice. APIB was created to unite, mobilize and strengthen the defense of indigenous peoples and their constitutional rights. Its executive coordinator — Sônia Guajajara, a 44-year-old indigenous woman with a degree in special education — is a key figure in the national indigenous movement. In 2010, she handed a “Golden Chainsaw” award to Kátia Abreu, the former minister of agriculture, to protest amendments to the Brazilian Forest Code that would increase deforestation rates for agribusiness growth. She has already participated in several United Nations climate change conferences and international events, where she denounced threats against the indigenous peoples of Brazil. “We have already advanced a lot. We are showing ourselves, participating, discussing and bringing our voice,” Guajajara said in an interview with the Amazon Environmental Research Institute. “[But] we still need to work on raising awareness of society as a whole to support the process of indigenous lands demarcation because when we have land demarcated and protected, we are preserving a good that is for everyone.” Indigenous youth are also using social media to spread their messages and amplify their voices. Twenty-seven-year-old indigenous Brazilian Erisvan Bone — along with other young indigenous people — created Mídia Índia in 2017. The project uses social networks such as Facebook and Instagram to disseminate content that discusses important issues among indigenous peoples and also educates society at large. At the same time, Mídia Índia works to make indigenous cultural diversity and traditions — usually portrayed in a stereotypical way — better known within and beyond the Brazilian society. “The goal is to give voice to traditional peoples [in Brazil] and visibility to their struggle and resistance, at a time of attacks and loss of rights,” explained Bone in a report by Instituto NET Claro Embratel. “It is to bring facts of reality told by ourselves and show that the indigenous can be protagonists of their history.” Meanwhile, 20-year-old Cristian Wariu, an indigenous Brazilian who grew up outside his family’s tribal territory, has been using YouTube as a weapon against discrimination and ethnocide. He created a channel on the platform two years ago where he talks about his own indigenous culture, differences across indigenous lifestyles and recent demonstrations. The most-watched video on his channel — titled “What it’s like to be indigenous in the 21st century” — has over 40,000 views so far. “Long ago, I realize that people who are not part of our culture have a certain prejudice against indigenous peoples,” Wariu told the BBC. “Whenever I explain things better, they come to respect us more. I saw YouTube as an opportunity to reach more people and explain to them about our [misunderstood] culture.” Since the beginning of this year, illegal mining has exploded in the Yanomami indigenous territory, in the Brazilian Amazon, where tribal leaders have reported the presence of more than 10,000 illegal miners on their land. It is the largest invasion since the land was demarcated in 1992, which the Yanomami people have exclusive use of according to the law. On July 23, several gold miners invaded the Wajãpi community and cruelly stabbed the tribe leader to death. U.N. High Commissioner for Human Rights Michelle Bachelet promptly issued a public statement saying, “The murder of Emrya Wajãpi … is a disturbing symptom of the growing problem of encroachment on indigenous land — especially forests — by miners, loggers and farmers in Brazil.” For a long time Brazil has been one of the world’s most dangerous countries for land and forest defenders — approximately one million people were involved in rural conflicts in the country, many of which happened inside indigenous territories, in 2018 alone. But under Bolsonaro’s administration, land invasions, killings and displacement of indigenous peoples are becoming the rule rather than the exception. “This violence generated against indigenous peoples arose from the lack of recognition of indigenous lands, the extreme degree of discrimination against indigenous peoples and the impunity on what happens over indigenous lands,” explained Brazil’s first indigenous lawyer Joenia Wapichana in an interview with the Indigenous Missionary Council. Last year, Wapichana also became the first indigenous woman ever elected to be a federal deputy, and the second indigenous person to have a seat in the Chamber of Deputies in the history of the country. In her new role, she is working to end violence against indigenous peoples, combat corruption and promote sustainable development. And she is not alone in this quest. There has been an increase in indigenous candidates in national elections over the past five years, including a record 56 percent rise in the number of indigenous candidates last year alone. This year, the indigenous lobby has already shown signs of its strength. It helped block one of Bolsonaro’s first moves after taking power: an attempt to transfer the authority of the National Indian Foundation — that oversees indigenous land issues — to the Ministry of Agriculture, which traditionally favors interests of agribusiness and extractive industries. From 2005 to 2012, deforestation rates in the Brazilian Amazon dropped by about 70 percent, thanks to effective environmental policies and zero-deforestation commitments adopted in the country by the government and corporations. However, these strategies haven’t been maintained and the situation has been worsening in recent years. Deforestation and wildfires in the Brazilian Amazon hit a record high this year and scientists are arguing it is not by accident. The widely respected Brazilian Space Research Institute has detected that over 2,400 square miles of rainforest have been lost in the last 12 months, which is equivalent to an area eight times the size of the city of New York. This represents a 48 percent increase in rainforest loss over the previous year. (President Bolsonaro, who has been called “Captain Chainsaw,” insists that this scientific data is a lie.) These trends, if maintained, will likely pose serious threats to all forms of life on Earth. Now, while many are praying for someone to “save the Amazon,” indigenous peoples are looking to technology to combat forest destruction, land grabs and climate change. The IPAM, a scientific, non-governmental and non-profit organization that works for the sustainable development of the Amazon, recently developed a cell phone app called Alerta Clima Indígena to help indigenous Brazilians find and share alerts about fires, illegal practices in the forest and climate data. “The app is currently being used by indigenous brigades to combat forest fires under the supervision of IBAMA [the Brazilian Institute of Environment and Renewable Natural Resources],” said IPAM Senior Researcher Paulo Moutinho. He also explained that there are important success stories that haven’t been disclosed yet, and that they are now seeking resources to expand this initiative together with indigenous leaders and related public organizations. Although not every indigenous person has a phone or access to the internet, technology is becoming popular particularly among the youth. “Our traditional knowledge of management is no longer enough, we need new tools,” Kayapó tribe member Paxton Metuktire told IPAM. “We need to combine our knowledge with your technology to counteract the impacts and maintain our lands, [which is] fundamental to the survival of our people.”"
Medium.com,Society,Amazon Has a Fundamental Climate Change Problem,World,https://onezero.medium.com/can-amazon-ever-be-truly-climate-friendly-bbe1357ab0f1?source=topic_page---------622------------------1," eff Bezos’ recent announcement that Amazon is pledging to meet the goals of the Paris Climate Accord and achieve annual “net zero” carbon emissions by 2040 looks, on its face, like a victory for climate change activists. The news broke on the eve of what’s being billed as “the biggest day in climate action history” — a global climate strike that thousands of Amazon employees are participating in. The organizing group coordinating Amazon employee activism, the Amazon Employees for Climate Justice (AECJ) immediately took credit for the company announcement, calling it “a huge win” for Amazon workers. As veteran climate activist Bill McKibben told OneZero, “that’s why people organize, to get reactions like this. This crew inside Amazon are heroes.” In a separate tweet, McKibben called the Amazon pledge, which includes putting 100,000 electric delivery trucks on the streets and reaching 80% renewable energy for all its services by 2030 and 100% by 2040, “pretty significant climate actions.” Is Amazon’s most vaunted attribute — extreme convenience at super low prices — at all compatible with going green? There’s certainly more to be done: The AECJ is calling for Amazon to stop deploying cloud-based AWS tools specifically designed for oil and gas companies (a demand that Bezos has explicitly rejected) and to cease funding climate denialism (which Bezos has said Amazon will take a “hard look” at). But there’s an even more fundamental question at stake: Is Amazon’s most vaunted attribute — extreme convenience at super low prices — at all compatible with going green? Numerous reports indicate that there is an environmental cost to expedited shipping, Amazon’s bread and butter. Same-day shipping ends up putting more delivery trucks on the road without allowing for their efficient management. As UPS reported in a sustainability study it released in 2017, “more package volume means more miles and emissions.” A related problem is that extreme convenience inevitably encourages consumers to buy more products. That means more cardboard that doesn’t get recycled and more plastic packaging materials that end up in landfills. Thus the existential quandary: Amazon’s profitability is built on satisfying an addiction to instant gratification. “The more we consume, the more resources overall we require.” Miguel Jaller, a professor of civil and environmental engineering at the University of California at Davis and the co-director of the school’s Sustainable Freight Research Center, told OneZero that Amazon’s actions were “commendable. Going with the 100,000 EVs and increasing the renewable energy sources is very important to mitigate the impacts of their activity.” But Jaller also noted that Amazon’s ongoing efforts to constantly reduce costs and increase inefficiency is bound to increase consumer demand. “Overall, the more efficient the system becomes, the more we will consume. … It doesn’t matter what vehicles we use or how efficient the companies are. The more we consume, the more resources overall we require.” Asking Amazon to be actively less efficient in its logistics management might be a bridge too far, even for the most dedicated climate activists. The long-term solution is probably a carbon tax baked into every service or product, whether provided by Amazon or any other company. If we paid the true cost for the toll that convenience takes on the planet, we might find same-day delivery a little less, uh, convenient. But since a carbon price would inevitably make a services like Amazon Prime more expensive to provide, it’s hard to see Bezos unilaterally taking that kind of step. It’s good to hear Bezos acknowledge that current climate developments are considerably more “dire” than predictions made by climate scientists as recently as five years ago. But it’s still not enough, for Amazon or society at large. As individuals, we need to think about whether we really need those new underpants delivered by drone two hours after we click the “buy” button. As a society, we need to exert the kind of sustained political pressure that results in climate solutions that apply to every corporation and not those just trying to get ahead of a little bad press."
Medium.com,Society,U.S. Claims Saudi Oil Facility Attack Launched from Iran,World,https://medium.com/@subverse/u-s-claims-saudi-oil-facility-attack-launched-from-iran-dbf4d0e66f76?source=topic_page---------623------------------1," By Sean Jackson Early on Saturday, September 14th reports of airstrikes on Saudi Arabia’s Aramco crude oil processing facility surfaced, drawing international attention.The facility that was struck is the world’s largest oil processing plant, located in Abqaiq. The strikes are said to have knocked out the facility’s ability to produce 5.7 million barrels of oil production daily in Saudi Arabia — approximately 5 percent of the world’s daily production. In response to the attack, oil prices spiked on Saturday. Satellite imagery released by the White House showed a total of 17 major impacts from unmanned aerial vehicles, or UAVs or cruise missiles at the facility’s two major installations.U.S. defense officials indicated that the assault on the oil installation likely came from Iranian soil. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo tweeted condemning the Iranians: “Tehran is behind nearly 100 attacks on Saudi Arabia while Rouhani and Zarif pretend to engage in diplomacy. Amid all the calls for de-escalation, Iran has now launched an unprecedented attack on the world’s energy supply. There is no evidence that attacks came from Yemen.” Secretary of Defense Mark Esper also tweeted after speaking with the Crown Prince of Saudi Arabia, Mohammad bin Salman, stating, “The United States military, with our interagency team, is working with our partners to address this unprecedented attack and defend the international rules-based order that is being undermined by Iran.” The U.S. government, while not directly blaming the Iranian government for the attack, suggests that Iran is at least complicit for the act. Iran has denied any involvement with the crippling attack with President Hassan Rouhani stating the attack is an act of retribution from the “Yemeni people.” The Houthi rebels in Yemen, who have aligned themselves with Iran, claimed responsibility. This is not the first time that Saudi Arabia has been attacked via UAVs, as well as cruise and SCUD missiles from Yemen. An attack in 2017 on an airport in Riyadh left U.S. Defense and State officials with no choice but to accuse Iran of exporting ballistic missiles — a violation of UN sanctions against missile exports. While the attack on the Saudi facility has left many pointing the finger at Iran, there has also been criticism towards how Saudi Arabia could have let this happen. Gary Grappo, the former U.S. ambassador to Oman suggests the Saudi government shares the blame, stating, “I think the Saudi leadership has a great deal of explaining to do that a country that ranks third in terms of total defense spending… was not able to defend its most critical, and I can’t underscore that enough, its most critical oil facility from these kinds of attacks.” Bob McNally, founder and president of Rapidan Energy Group stated that he was “disappointed, but not surprised by the attack, saying, “It’s a bit alarming that these folks got through. We looked at those photos that were released by the Trump administration — they were exquisitely precise, they knew exactly what to hit, they hit it perfectly.”"
Medium.com,Society,Trying to smear voices of dissent doesn’t make us go away,World,https://medium.com/@joannehalliwell/trying-to-smear-voices-of-dissent-doesnt-make-us-go-away-fc5b2f1eb370?source=topic_page---------624------------------1," Recently there has been a noticeable trend by mainly MP’s on the right and the media to try and smear people who stand up to power as ‘activists’ as though being an activist and being passionate about a political issue is wrong. This use of ‘activist’ as a smear seems to be particularly applicable to members of the Labour Party. The incident yesterday at Whipps Cross hospital where Omar Salem confronted Boris Johnson about the state of the NHS is a case in point. Omar, whose 7 day old daughter was seriously ill in the hospital, took the opportunity to confront the Prime Minister as he passed and call him out on the failings that his party has inflicted on the NHS over the last 10 years. Laura Kuenssberg, the BBC’s political editor could have chosen to focus on what Omar was saying, the real issues he had faced with his very poorly daughter, instead she went digging into his background and quite gleefully posted a tweet that ‘exposed’ him as a Labour ‘activist’. Locally, the same has happened with our MP, David Morris, who back in February accused a local charity of being subject to political interference. This has upset the hard working volunteers in the Third Sector locally and the issue is still rumbling on. In David Morris’ case, he has form on this issue, he’s long engaged in a vendetta against anyone who disagrees with him politically. He’s had a pop at the local Trussell Trust food bank and teachers at local schools. I’m absolutely sick of this nonsense. I’m a Labour Activist and the Womens Officer for my CLP but that doesn’t mean that’s all I am. I’m an employee, a Mother, a local resident, a student and I’m also a daughter to 2 parents who died 8 years apart, both after long chronic illnesses. I have seen first hand how the service has deteriorated despite the best efforts of the staff. If I’d been on the ward when Boris came bumbling along, I would have definitely have something to say to him and it wouldn’t be because I’m a card carrying Labour ‘trot’. Left wing activists whether they are Labour members, Greens, or of no party but concerned about a specific subject such as fracking; are people who live in the world, we live, laugh and love just like everyone else. We are often right at the heart of community organisations volunteering our time freely. It’s usually the very reason we get involved in organised politics in the first place. We are as entitled to express our opinion as anyone else. We are political but rarely are we paid politicians, even elected councillors don’t get paid, they are volunteers who receive an allowance for out of pocket expenses. This is not about politiking, it’s about shutting down debate and stiffling dissent. It is about perpetuating a narrative that actually all in the garden is rosy, if those pesky lefties would just shut up and stop saying it isn’t. Well, we aren’t going to stop, we are here to call out those paid politicians who are incompetent and corrupt. We are part of and standing up for our communities no matter what and we are going to keep paying our Labour party subscriptions as well. It’s about time we got back to allowing proper debate across the political divide and working together to try and find some common ground whilst respecting that a difference of opinion exists."

emember the quaint days when the biggest political challenge was the country trying to work out how the Conservatives and Liberal Democrats could serve an entire mandate together in a coalition government. The good old days, eh? It was clear after the coalition government that the next election would be a challenging one for the Liberal Democrats. But, I’m not sure anyone knew just how blistering the election would be. Even Sir Nick Clegg, Leader of the Liberal Democrats at the time, couldn’t have expected the devastation that would overthrow his party. Sure, he expected things to be bad… but did he expect to lose his own seat? I can’t imagine he did. I think it’s broadly accepted that the Liberal Democrats suffered for two reasons. First, they supported a severe program of austerity. Second, not only did they renege on signature manifesto pledges like making tertiary education free, they went in the complete opposite direction by tripling them. Like many people, I wondered if the Liberal Democrats could ever recover from something like this. And then, this happened."

After thirty minutes, a dry tap again. I had arrived in my home town of Bukavu in Eastern DRC during the dry season, just days before the Ebola epidemic spread to my province. I travelled from the US, where I live, to prepare my family and community for the imminent threat of Ebola. I had heard about a conflict between the international response to the outbreak and the communities it aims to serve. What I found was an urban community without running water. We know that people who live in poverty are at higher risk of infection with Ebola. We also know that hand washing is a cheap first line means to protect oneself from Ebola and other pathogens. I am a physician, and in our house we had thirty minutes of running water in two days. How could I help protect my family? Mothers in the neighborhood are resourceful, trekking across ravines of an urban jungle to a water point on a steep hillside to fill jugs of water to carry home to protect their families as best they can for cooking, drinking, bathing, and hand washing."
Medium.com,Society,‘An Absented Presence’: Canada’s Hidden History of Blackface Minstrelsy,World,https://medium.com/@laila.elmug/an-absented-presence-canada-s-hidden-history-of-blackface-minstrelsy-6c0607a6b34e?source=topic_page---------629------------------1," The unearthing of Prime Minister Justin Trudeau’s appearances in blackface and brownface has been jarring for many Canadians. Although some want to view these incidents as multiple missteps in judgement, it is important we interpret them in a broader Canadian cultural context. Trudeau’s actions echo a vicious legacy of minstrelsy in which Canadians of all walks and origins indulged. Much of the information here is thanks to Maxime Tam and Margaret Lehman, with whom I spent many hours exploring the archive when I first learned of this legacy. Being Black in Canada is a trip. Being a Black academic is also somehow worse, because you are obliged to cite sources when you say things like ‘Being Black in Canada is a trip”. Since lived experiences are so often dismissed as “anecdotal evidence”, I thought an archival exploration would suffice for a necessary unpacking of this history. This is not everything. This is barely anything. This is one tiny corner of Southwestern Ontario which happened to leave behind some self-incriminating evidence. This doesn’t address the stories of those who suffered, or Canada’s fascination with the Gold Dust Twins, or the generation that craved the mammy caricature. And this is certainly not a defense for Trudeau’s nauseating and inexcusable acts, of which he is a repeat offender. This is a starting point for people like me, who grew up believing anti-Black racism was an “elsewhere” problem. Guelph, Ontario is a city where one might believe Blackness is absent. The city’s sanitized narrative and historical revisionism make it difficult to believe Black people have resided in the area since the founding of the Queen’s Bush Settlement in the early nineteenth century. Guelph boasts the University of Guelph, a gorgeous Arboretum, and a long and hideous relationship with minstrelsy. The Ontario Agricultural College (later consolidated as part of the University of Guelph) also hosted a series of minstrel shows. The March 1912 Minstrel Show is described in the corresponding issue of The OAC Review as taking the audience back to the “Dear Old South.” It included “Southern jokes and songs […] rendered in first class style” and a sketch entitled “Befo’ de War”. The December 1943 OAC Review describes a minstrel show in which the chorus sang “Old Black Joe” and “Darktown Strutters Ball.” They also sang “Dixie,” the unofficial anthem of the Confederacy and the most infamous ballad born of blackface minstrelsy. Yes, that caption is correct. The above photo was taken in 1996. No amount of diversity policies and Black History Month assemblies can erase that this occurred in a high school. What are the implications of Blackface minstrelsy being aided and abetted in an educational setting? How do we begin to atone? Why is acknowledging this history like pulling teeth? I’d like to close with something I think everyone needs to know. In Anthems and Minstrel Shows: The Life and Times of Calixa Lavallée, 1842–1891, Brian Christopher Thompson introduces us to Calixa Lavallée, a French Canadian musician who would gain international recognition. Lavallée is infamously known for leading a travelling blackface minstrel troupe, which performed across Canada and the United States. He is also the composer of our national anthem. This is paradox of Blackness in Canada. It is simultaneously everywhere and nowhere, and we are both accosted by its presence and startled by its absence. We believe Blackness, and subsequently anti-Black racism, is always elsewhere. In actual fact, racism is as Canadian as ‘O Canada’."

Medium.com,Society,The U.S. China Trade War May Cause Multipolarity Instead of Deglobalisation,World,https://medium.com/discourse/the-u-s-china-trade-war-may-cause-multipolarity-instead-of-deglobalisation-b8e108a47965?source=topic_page---------631------------------1," The U.S.- China trade, technology, and possible currency war suggest a continued escalation beyond rhetoric, with negative implications for trade in an already slowing global economy. Following the bout of tit-for-tat tariffs, talks of “deglobalization” have emerged strongly, with falling trade volumes between both countries undoubtedly supporting this narrative. Such claims, I think, are however misplaced as the unintended consequences of the trade war could incentivize, rather than impede, trade amongst other economies in Asia, Europe and beyond. Furthermore, de-globalization is possible only several other countries simultaneously engage in trade wars or a Western-Eastern split emerges more strongly. Nevertheless, the aggressor i.e U.S. is unlikely to impede trade amongst countries over the long-term but the short-term economic costs cannot be understated. Falling PMIs, waning business investment and stock market corrections in both Shanghai and New York suggest the reverberations of the trade war are increasingly palpable. It might seem economic nationalism could present significant headwinds to globalization; absent Brexit, most of the world continues to trade and all indicators suggest Britain will actively pursue independent trade agreements with the rest of the world contingent on the nature and the timing of its exit. Meanwhile, the European Union (EU) has signed a comprehensive trade agreement with Latin America spanning a range of consumer and non-consumer products for both sides. Nevertheless, its adoption and successful passing in the European Commission is contingent on increased environmental awareness by Jair Bolsonaro, who views the Amazon as an economic anchor for the Brazilian economy. Latin America and the EU are countering the deglobalization trend Following the election of U.S. President Donald Trump and the resulting trade war as well as Brexit, the EU has continued to champion free trade, negotiating an independent and comprehensive trading agreement with the Mercosur trading block. The later comprises a group of Latin American countries, namely Brazil, Argentina, Peru, and Uruguay. It is important to emphasize significant levels of trade between both trading blocs; the EU currently exports €45 billion worth of goods and €23 billion worth of services. It is also the biggest investor in Mercosur with a stock of €381 billion and €52 billion from the Mercosur trading area. These numbers are likely to grow significantly with the removal of tariff and non-tariff restrictions over the coming years. Before the recent trade agreement, investors were significantly constrained in Mercosur markets, but the recent agreement removes both tariffs and non-tariff barriers to enable and facilitate trade for smaller SME’s amongst both countries. Contrary to the U.S. decision to exit the Paris climate agreement signed in December 2015, the agreement also strengthens workers’ rights, environmental protection, and food safety standards. This agreement is salient for member countries in Latin America, who are on the verge of an economic transition with a growing population and prospective middle class, which present significant opportunities for EU firms going forward. Whilst countries such as Peru seek to escape the middle-income country trap, Brazil and Argentina might benefit from EU market access as manufactured products comprise a majority of their exports. Furthermore, domestic companies will also benefit from knowledge transfers and/or exchange, which is ultimately transferred as countries become interlinked through trade. Not only will this improve the domestic competitiveness of firms in Latin America, but consumers will also be able to access technologically advanced products such as solar panel, electric vehicles, and climate technology. This is both paramount and indispensable if said countries are to leverage their climate and demographic transition. Although Brexit suggests less open trade with the EU, the United Kingdom is poised to pursue more pragmatic trade policy as its industries will no longer be shielded by comprehensive and wide-reaching EU trade agreements. Related Article: An M&A Love Story (Part 2 of 3) Figure 1: EU — China trade in goods is rising steadily The Trump administration imposed 25% tariffs on 200 billion worth of Chinese products, 10% on another 300 billion worth of Chinese imports into the U.S. and placed Huawei, a Chinese telecom on an entity list in an attempt to disrupt its supply chains and reduce its competitiveness and rapid expansion across the world. While the reasons for the trade war are not completely unjustified, his approach is diplomatically misguided and economically counterproductive for U.S. companies. In spite of the many challenges and value differences that emerge from trading with China — its unfortunate human record, forced technology transfers, subsidies and non-tariff barriers designed to protect domestic incumbent — the EU has opted for a more diplomatic and mutually beneficial approach; one which seeks to enhance the economic benefits of the trading relationship rather than simply mitigate China’s perceived market dominance in some sectors. China and the EU trade significantly, with German cars, European planes, chemicals and equipment’s imported by China to support its trade, manufacturing, and competitiveness. Meanwhile, the EU equally imports clothing & footwear, industrial and consumer goods and machinery and equipment to support more advanced manufacturing in Europe. Labeling China currency manipulator has done all but impede trade with the EU and rightly so. Rather than fret about Huawei and Chinese geostrategic ambitions, it would be forward-looking for any nation looking to trade with China to understand how to prevent it from gaining an unfair advantage. This includes things like creating a lab dedicated to scrutinizing its software like Britain or prevent data collected in the country from being analyzed in specific jurisdictions. Furthermore, EU-China trade in services comprise 10% of total trade in goods and EU export of services make up 19% of EU total exports. The Chinese markets present significant opportunities for climate-technologies (solar panels, wind turbines, and storage technology), financial services, pharmaceutical, agricultural products amongst others; Meanwhile, China can benefit from EU technological advancements, well-developed capital markets and a less hostile investment climate than the U.S. for example. Whilst the EU and other economies around the world grapple with the adoption of Huawei’s 5G technology, it’s important to maintain market access for EU and other firms in China’s consumer-centric market. Figure 2: EU-China trade in services The EU’s trade with China is pragmatic, rather than driven by any set of ironclad values vis-à-vis the Uighur Muslims and recent protest in Hong Kong against an extradition bill. Despite trading significantly with China as illustrated in Figure 1 and 2, the EU designated China a strategic threat; by no means was this a deterrent for trade amongst both continents but rather suggest an understanding of Chinese trade practices and its economic and foreign policy implications. The EU continues to negotiate with China to improve its industrial policies, state subsidies, non-tariff barriers against foreign companies, poor protection and enforcement of intellectual property, strong government intervention in state-owned subsidies. Rather than imposing economically counterproductive tariffs on Chinese products such as phones, technology, and climate technology to protect domestic companies, the EU is using diplomatic means to improve the trading relationship with China. Although social dumping justifies tariff and non-tariff barriers, in international trade, domestic industries who are most shielded from the external competition via tariffs tend to experience more pronounced adjustments when trade barriers are removed. This is a further disincentive for direct trade conflict or tariff war. Admittedly, domestic companies might momentarily benefit from trade restrictions, but the companies in the penalized country will seek new markets and redesign their supply chains to withstand future shocks. This not only stymies innovation and better-priced products for consumers, but demand for intermediate products might also fall between both countries. China, meanwhile, has imposed 5.0% tariffs on U.S. autos and oil imports, due to take effect in September and December 2019 respectively. Furthermore, companies providing intermediate products or software to Chinese technology companies are unlikely to benefit over the near term and they are unlikely to find markets willing or able to match demand from China. UK and Africa also choosing free trade Meanwhile, then Prime Minister Theresa May toured Kenya and Nigeria with business leaders from the UK during her tenure to improve trade ties and support development in the most populous and one of the most technologically advanced countries on the continent i.e Kenya. She also pledged a £4 billion fund to support youth employment, cultivating the industries and markets on whom the U.K will soon depend to sell Irish beef or the City of London’s consultancy and financial services. Although the decision to leave the EU suggests less open trade with the latter, the U.K. is nonetheless trading and will continue to do so, with other countries in the world. Meanwhile, Africa is learning from the EU and recently tabled proposals to create a free trade area that will reduce tariffs on goods amongst countries, encourage trade and spur development. The continent of 1.2 billion has cities with some of the fastest rates of urbanization and will likely be the fastest-growing continent according to the U.N. Not only will a free trade area this facilitate the attainment of the sustainable development goals by standardising trade and labour market practices and knowledge sharing via competition and cross-border supply chains, it will also facilitate trade outside the continents and speed up development. As the above trade agreement suggests, most of the world is becoming integrated and economically interdependent even as the U.S. threatens or imposes tariffs on the rest of the World. i.e from Canada, Mexico, France, Germany, etc. All indicators suggest the world is choosing to stay open and maintain the global rules-based order even as the current U.S. administration seeks to chip away at its legitimacy. A Chinese or U.S. dominated the world is unlikely to become a reality at this point and greater economic interdependence among the rest of the world underpin this point. The United States and China might be embroiled in a trade war for the foreseeable future, resulting in less trade-in both economies. Even as the short-term economic costs cannot be understated, the long-term implication is much more nuanced than current claims of “deglobalization” suggest. However, businesses in both countries will likely find new suppliers in new markets, which suggest a structural shift in global trade, but it is difficult to see how a retrenchment in trade between both economies suggests a broader trend of deglobalisation. U.S. chip, semiconductor and software producers might find new markets in rapidly industrialising countries in Asia and Latin America, while Huawei will continue to expand rapidly in other markets, not only providing phones but also the digital infrastructure which is indispensable for economies such as Brazil, Kenya and India, poised to grow at a much quicker pace than most industrialised nations in the coming decades. Furthermore, the Jury appears to be out on 5G, but chances are, it will underpin the next wave of industrialization. If the U.S. chooses not to adopt 5G, it is almost certain that other countries would. It is easy to see how the current tariff dispute might result in deglobalization of some sort, but this is the case for China and the United States rather than countries around the world. For emerging markets, China remains an invaluable market for commodity exports and more affordable Chinese products will continue to be purchased in other countries in the EU, North America, Latin America, and Africa. Furthermore, a likely result of the trade war is that trade, which was previously invoiced in the dollar will now be cleared in Euros, pound, Renminbi; a boon for the global economy and financial stability over the long run. Rather than focus on deglobalization, the U.S. — China trade dispute will incentivize multi-polarity in trade, investment whilst facilitating much-needed reforms to the multilateral trading system. Figure 3: The world is still trading (%) The dollar remains the dominant currency for global trade invoicing, and 2/3 of security issuances also occur in the greenback. This has left emerging markets exposed to dollar strength and global trade tends to fall when the dollar appreciates. Not only do high levels of dollar-denominated debt leave countries exposed to banking and currency crisis, but it also raises global financial stability risk. As a result of global trade being cleared in other currencies (see chart 3), this will lessen the dollar-induced crisis and bolster resilience amongst emerging markets economies. As debt concerns become increasingly prevalent vis-à-vis dollar strength, a more globalized pool of funding and FX mix for debtor countries will not only reduce financial stability risks, it will likely improve the functioning of monetary policy. A fortunate consequence of the U.S. — China trade war is that global trade will be cleared in a range of other currencies ranging from the Chinese Yuan to the Euro and South African Rand. This trend is already becoming increasingly apparent; as the Federal Reserve began raising interest rates, capital flowed out of emerging markets but was swiftly replaced by the Euro. We are likely to see countries diversify financing sources, more so as market-based financing plays an increasingly important role in funding EM current account deficits and financing needs. The trade war will have grave short-term costs, compounding the slowdown in the global economy, but a more multipolar world will be net-positive for economies around the world by improving funding sources and reducing the risk of a dollar-induced crisis. Companies such as Rosneft, a Russian oil producer have already notified customers that future oil tenders will be conducted in Euros, reinforcing the argument for a more multipolar world in spite of the uncertainty surrounding the U.S. — China trade war. By no means I’m I discounting concerns of deglobalization, I do, however, believe that trade amongst other economies around the world will lessen the risk of a prolonged trade war splitting the world into two halves. Given the size of the U.S economy, its impact on global trade cannot be understated, but the remaining 163 countries in the WTO will continue to trade even if the trade war diminishes the role of the dollar amongst traders. One should, therefore, approach claims of deglobalization with caution."
Medium.com,Society,No politician has the guts to cancel Brexit,World,https://medium.com/discourse/no-politician-has-the-guts-to-cancel-brexit-e946ed6e84de?source=topic_page---------632------------------1," T
he release of the Yellowhammer document provides many excellent reasons to cancel Brexit. Experts have been warning for years that leaving the EU is unnecessary and damaging for the UK, but the people have spoken and they want their sunlit uplands. Thus began a campaign from each of the political parties to appeal to voters of a variety of persuasions, but none of them committed to telling the truth or creating a realistic plan for what happens next. Even the withdrawal agreement created by Theresa May’s government was crafted to appease the different political factions, not to get a deal that actually works. The Conservatives have taken a mostly pro-Brexit stance, and their current iteration favours the most extreme version. Labour has gone for a compromise that tries to appeal to everyone, but can’t be reduced to a handy soundbite. The Lib Dems are staunchly Remain, but their willingness to work with the pro-Brexit Conservatives undermines their credibility, just as it did when they sold out the last time — and we’ve not forgotten that. But what none of the parties are prepared to do is come out and tell the public that we have made a terrible mistake and it would be best to call this Brexit thing off. Those who have gone on record with these views are derided as out-of-touch metropolitan elites, and based on Remainers I know, this is a fair point. A vote for Leave correlated strongly with increasing age, but it also correlated inversely with educational level. Unfortunately, educated Remainers have let this go to their heads and have insulted Leave voters by saying they’re a bunch of thick racists. Older people’s view of Brexit is coloured by their education and what they absorbed from the media they’re most familiar with. Even though alternative sources of information are available, they choose what they know and feel comfortable with, and it’s provided them with opinions that don’t reflect reality, but do give plausible explanations for the things they see wrong with Britain. Their lack of educational opportunities also created a resentment not just for the foreigners they perceive as being the problem, but also for younger generations who envisage a future world that opposes their values. Greater access to higher education has broadened the outlook of younger people, meaning they’re more likely to look outwards to Europe and beyond, rather than inward like the Little Englanders of previous generations. Their education has typically taken them far from where they grew up, unlike their parents’ and grandparents’ generations who stayed in one area. Although younger voters’ stance on Europe has some rational basis; just like older Britons their political leanings are based on what kind of people they think they are, and what type of Britain they want. Politics in the UK is all about hearts and minds, or more precisely, feelings and identities. People don’t vote based on the facts; they vote for the party they feel corresponds closest to their self-image, whether it reflects their actual self or not. It’s one component of the Brexit outcome, as voting to leave was sold as an opportunity for Britain to be great again, just like when we had an empire. Politicians, spokespeople and media figures knew they were telling the public a load of nonsense, but they had votes to win and papers to sell. It turns out their messages worked really well; too well. The public actually believed the vision they were sold of British superiority and European interference, and now we have to deal with the consequences — which we are doing badly. The government’s current tactic, with six weeks until our scheduled exit, is to perpetuate the lie while sticking their fingers in their ears and shouting “la, la, la”. What the government needs to do is stop posturing, stop treating the British people like fools, and tell us the truth about EU membership and why we can’t “just leave”. And that’s going to upset a lot of people who have put their hearts into supporting what they thought was a confirmation of their status as king of the world. Voting Leave was a way of saying we don’t need the EU, because we’re better. But we do need them, and actually we’re pretty mediocre. But admitting that goes against Leave voters’ beliefs and self-image, and would feel like an insult. It would sting as badly as the elite Remainers and experts telling them what a load of dunces they are. And the UK government’s strategy of appealing to the lowest common denominator, and treating everyone like that’s what they are, means that the complex truth is going to be lost on them. The Yellowhammer document was initially kept secret because it “would alarm the public”, yet this is what the government keep telling us we voted for, and it’s what the government plan to deliver. Don’t we have a right to know? Of course, if it had been kept quiet, there would be less reason to avoid a no-deal Brexit; but at the same time, it contradicts the claim that the people are taking back control. The government doesn’t seem like it’s in control of anything right now, but they do have greater power than the public. The government is deciding what’s best for us, and only drip-feeding us information that they think our little, uneducated brains can handle. The leak of the Yellowhammer plans got people thinking, which threatens the government strategy of mollifying the public and controlling them through ignorance. In other European countries, the government leads, and the media is of a higher quality with less bias. Ordinary people don’t feel like they’re being talked down to, because they aren’t. But the UK’s many years of not trusting the public with the truth, and managing the country with their consent — but not their informed consent — means that we cannot talk our way out of this one. As well as telling the nation (well, 17.4m of them) they were wrong and they can’t have their way, we have to tell them they lack the knowledge and skills to even be able to make the decision they did. And that’s going to come across badly. It will feel like the treatment they get from highly educated Remainers who have all the answers but none of the empathy to deliver them. At some point the illusion is going to come crashing down, and hopefully it will be before we’ve enacted this disaster. But who will be the one to do it? Debates in the House of Commons are just theatre, with the real work happening in select committees and quangos. The public don’t really get to see how the country is run — they get a hammed-up, watered-down version with democracy portrayed as taking sides instead of being a collaborative process. Brexit has increased political engagement, but the British people are angry with no means to change things. The government has presented them with oversimplified choices and assumed they would be satisfied with that. Now that we have a situation which threatens the integrity of the state, caused by giving the public a false sense of direct democracy, the government is downplaying the consequences in an attempt to maintain order. But that order will break down; either when we leave the EU and people discover the truth that way, or when some brave politician does the right thing and treats the British people like grown-ups. For too long the UK government has exercised a policy of keeping the people placid, by telling them exactly what they wanted to hear. Instead of leading, it followed their opinions and catered to their whims, even when their wishes were harmful and made no sense. Someone is going to have to say ‘no’ to the British people, and they’re not going to like it. But we exist in a condition where what we thought was true is not, and what we thought was wisdom was in fact bigotry and ignorance. The government is going to have to come clean and admit they lied and treated us like idiots. It will hurt to discover that the beliefs we built our personal values and understandings of the world upon were a smokescreen. We will be crushed when we find out the contempt our leaders held us in. The Remainers and experts will be proved right, and we’ll hate them for it. Our politicians know what’s coming, but even they don’t want to admit it to themselves. Perhaps the public will handle it better if the government takes full responsibility and apologises sincerely. But somehow, I don’t think the people are going to buy it."

ou know a country is on the forefront of environmental action when a café cashier points to the water cups and without provocation exclaims, “Don’t worry, those aren’t plastic! They’re made of maize.” This happened to me at the Louisiana Museum of Modern Art this summer on my 10th trip to Denmark in 25 years. There are more pigs than people in this little country, but according to the German-based search engine for vacation rentals, Holidu, Copenhagen is the sixth best city in Europe for vegans, based on the number of eateries in relation to its population of almost six million. Plant-based eating is on the rise here — from Michelin-recognized New Nordic-inspired restaurants down to the open-faced sandwich (smørrebrød ) spreads marked “vegansk” in the local grocery stores and the date-based truffles available in every 7–11 store. In 2017, Danish politicians even took a public “22-day vegan diet challenge.” It hasn’t always been this way, though. It has long been a challenge for vegan travelers to eat in the country where the national dish is still “stegt flæsk med persille sovs” (fried pork with parsley sauce) and its citizens love their cod, herring, and pølse (bright red boiled pork sausage, sold in street stands). But the new focus on vegetables fits right in with the locally-sourced bio-dynamic precedent set by restaurants such as Noma and the entire country’s commitment to caring for the environment, as seen in the bike-friendly city of Copenhagen and the government’s goal to phase out coal by 2030, replacing it with wind power. Chef René Redzepi took the culinary world by storm when his two-Michelin-star restaurant Noma first topped the list of S. Pellegrino’s 50 Best Restaurants in 2010 (and later again in 2014). The concept of Nordic terroir emphasizes local, natural, and seasonal ingredients, including much of the formerly overlooked produce of Scandinavia. The restaurant was not vegan but revived an interest in little-used indigenous plants such as sea buckthorn, beets, celeriac, lingonberry, and elder flowers, among others."

In 2013 Plaid Cymru, the Welsh nationalist party said: “Could Wales flourish as an independent nation? We think that Wales can. We have recently celebrated the first 10 years of devolution — but we believe that the next ten years will be the real decade of change. Wales and her people are ready and willing to ask the difficult questions — and also to come up with the solutions.” The establishment of Cymru Sovereign in March 2016 should have been an indication to Westminster the Welsh were increasingly favouring an independent Wales. In May 2019, the Welsh capital city saw a march for Welsh independence take shape. Since that first 2019 march, other demonstrations supporting Welsh independence have been seen across the Principality of Wales. When the Welsh nationalist party expressed this view, people weren’t paying much attention because they were focus was on what was happening in Scotland. We had yet to see the drama of a Scottish independence referendum playout. The Scots ultimately voted to remain part of the United Kingdom mainly because leaving would have meant petitioning the European Union for membership. Unlike Scotland and Northern Ireland, Wales voted with England to leave the European Union. Since the Brexit referendum took place in 2016, attitudes towards Westminster and the British government’s handling of Article 50 have been less than cordial. Because of how Brexit is being mishandled, we have seen David Cameron, Theresa May and now Boris Johnson in No 10. Cameron, on Thursday, 23 June 2016, formally announced he would be stepping down as Prime Minister. This announcement came shortly after the electorate voting to leave the EU. Speaking outside No 10, Cameron: “I fought this campaign in the only way I know how which is to say directly and passionately what I think and feel, head, heart and soul. I held nothing back. I was absolutely clear about my belief that Britain is stronger, safer and better off inside the European Union and I made clear the referendum was about this and this alone, not the future of any single politician including myself. But the British people have made a very clear decision to take a different path and as such, I think the country requires fresh leadership to take it in this direction. …” Because Cameron couldn’t face the prospect of ushering in a new political reality for the United Kingdom, he made his exit from No 10. The fresh leadership Cameron spoke of came in the shape of Theresa May. Almost three years after May became the British PM, the on-going mess that is Brexit saw her exit and Boris Johnson take over. The metaphorical British political photograph taken in the mid-to-late 2010s is coming into focus. Because of the disharmony between family members, the family portrait that depicts the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland is most telling. If Westminster doesn’t get its ducks in a row, the shape of the union as we know it will continue to unravel. Britain, as a multi-nation state, will be history."
Medium.com,Society,What Stocks could the Saudi Drone attack boost — Market Mad House,World,https://medium.com/datadriveninvestor/what-stocks-could-the-saudi-drone-attack-boost-market-mad-house-f6557e2008b4?source=topic_page---------640------------------1," A simple drone attack on two Saudi oil facilities has profound consequences for many stocks. To explain, oil prices suffered their worst disruption ever after Yemeni Houthi rebels wrecked the processing plants that produce most of Saudi Arabia’s oil for export. The attacks occurred on Saturday 14 September 2019, when the markets reopened on Monday 16 September 2019 prices rose 10%, The New York Times reports. However, oil prices were falling again on Wednesday, September 18, 2019. Consequently, up to 5% of the global oil supply could off the market for an unknown period. A severe oil crisis is unlikely because there is an oil glut with global stockpiles higher than usual. Moreover, oil production is increasing, US oil production is double what is in 2012, The New York Times estimates. The greatest threat is more drone attacks against Saudi Arabia has no obvious defense. However, the Saudis could quickly end the threat by stopping their war in Yemen and withdrawing support for the Yemeni military. To explain, the Saudis provoked the Houthi attack by providing massive amounts of military aid to the Houthis’ enemies in the Yemeni Civil War. Yemen is a small country next to Saudi Arabia that is embroiled in a complex civil war. The Yemeni Civil War is dangerous because Iran backs the Houthi rebels, while Saudi Arabia and its ally the United States, prop up the Yemeni government. My suspicion is that the amount of destruction on 14 September will inspire more drone attacks because of the amount of destruction achieved at a low cost. Moreover, disruption to oil supplies could force the United States and China to pressure the Saudis to make peace with the Houthis. U. S. President Donald J. Trump (R-New York) has a strong incentive to make peace. Trump faces reelection next year, and the American people are squarely against another Middle Eastern War. I think war is unlikely because Trump understands another war will doom his reelection. Naturally, investors and speculators will ask what stocks could fall or rise because of the “Drone War” in Saudi Arabia? Here are some stocks that could fall because of the Drone War: Lockheed-Martin (NYSE: LMT) -This giant defense contractor has a lot to lose because the Houthis just showed its signature products like warplanes and attack helicopters could be obsolete. To explain, the Houthis brought Saudi Arabia to its knees with drones that could as little as $15,000. That calls the existence of fighter planes like Lockheed-Martin’s $1.2 trillion F-35 Lightning II Joint Strike Fighter into question. Notably, Saudi’s 313 jet fighters could not stop the refinery attacks. I think Mr. Market ridiculously overpriced Lockheed Martin’s stock at $394.71 a share on 18 September 2019. My prediction is Lockheed is heading for a fall because many of its products including helicopters and fighter planes are as obsolete as horse cavalry. Those looking for a stock to short need to take note. Lockheed could collapse totally if the drone attack leads to peace in the Middle East and a US pullout from that region. To clarify, I suspect a massive cutback in American military forces and spending will follow any U.S. pullout from the Middle East. General Dynamics (NYSE: GD) another giant defense contractor is in a similar position to Lockheed Martin. Tellingly, Mr. Market priced General Dynamics shares at $188.65 on 18 September 2019. Notably, Saudi Arabia spends more of its gross domestic product (GDP) on defense than any other country, The Arab Weekly estimates. Much of the $68 billion the Saudis spent on defense in 2018 went to companies like General Dynamics. Yet Saudi Arabia is defenseless against fairly simple drone attacks. My prediction is that companies like General Dynamics will have a far harder time peddling their wares soon. However, General Dynamics could find more customers for the drones from its Unmanned Systems Technology subsidiary. Thus, I advise speculators looking for a short to examine General Dynamics and all defense stocks. I think defense stocks will go up briefly because of war hysteria but fall over time as investors realize how obsolete much of the defense giants’ arsenal is. There are also a few stocks that I think the Drone War will boost. First, electric vehicle makers. The Houthis justified the huge investments some companies are making in electric vehicle technology. To elaborate electric vehicles do not need oil to move. Thus, anything that increases oil prices could raise demands for electric cars and trucks. The biggest electric vehicle player is Volkswagen AG (VWAPY) which reportedly has plans to build 50 million electric cars in the next decade. In particular, Volkswagen is planning a €20,000 ($23,000) electric sedan for the Chinese and European markets. I think Mr. Market underpriced Volkswagen at $17.20 on 18 September 2019. The highest-profile electric car company is Elon Musk’s Tesla Motors (NASDAQ: TSLA). Tesla has the most experience in electrics and the best technology. In addition, I think Mr. Market undervalues Tesla’s Gigafactory battery plants and electric semi-tractor. To elaborate the Gigafactories could sell batteries to other companies. Meanwhile, there is a huge potential market for the electric semi. There are nearly two million semi-tractors on America’s highways, for instance. Finally, Tesla has experience selling large numbers of electric cars. No other carmaker has that experience. However, Mr. Market grossly overpriced Tesla (NASDAQ: TSLA) at $243.53 a share on 18 September 2019. Hence, I think Tesla is headed for a huge fall in the share price. So it could be a stock worth shorting. Yet I believe Tesla could be a value investment if its stock ever gets a realistic price. I believe Tesla will fall because it reported a -$408.33 million net loss on 30 June 2019. Thus, Tesla loses money despite the $921.05 million gross profit it reported on 30 June 2019. Ford (NYSE: F) this historic carmaker makes money and it could market an electric pickup truck as early as 2021, Car & Driver claims. Ford is so confident in its electric vehicles. it posts videos of its electric F-150 pickup performing stunts like pulling freight trains online. In contrast to Tesla, Ford reported a net income of $148 million, a quarterly gross profit of $2.815 billion, and $38.048 billion in cash and short-term investments on 30 June 2019. I believe Mr. Market underpriced Ford at $9.26 on 18 September 2019. Tata Motors Limited (NYSE: TTM) The British-Indian company’s electric Jaguar I-Pace won the 2019 World Car of the Year Award for the World Car Awards. Tata is selling I-Paces to the public now. Like Ford, Mr. Market underpriced Tata at $8.66 a share on 18 September 2019. PACCAR Inc. (NASDAQ: PCAR)the commercial truck maker is planning several electric vehicles including an electric garbage truck, and a small electric semi. I think Mr. Market fairly priced PACCAR at $70.07 on September 18, 2019. In the electric car race, I think Ford is the best bargain. However, there is no visible market appreciation for either Tata or PACCAR. One class of stocks I advise people to avoid now is oil stocks. I think oil stocks are dangerous because nobody knows what will happen in the oil market. In particular, I think Mr. Market overpriced the largest oil company Exxon Mobil (NYSE: XOM) at $72.46 on 18 September 2019. I think they overprice Exxon Mobil because its business model which relies on high oil prices is obsolete in today’s world of gluts and skyrocketing production. In addition, XOM is one of many oil stocks in danger of collapse because of the drone attack. The danger is that the disruption of Saudi oil production could create a brief bubble in oil prices. In detail, the oil prices will remain high only until the Saudis come back online, or other producers increase exports to cash in. Then oil prices and oil stocks will crash fast. Personally, I think the Saudis have the technical expertise to restart production quickly. However, the Houthis and their Iranian allies could have lots of drones. Yet, the Saudis can instantly end the Houthi threat by getting out of Yemen. Therefore, I think any increase in oil prices and oil stocks will be a short bubble. It is a good time for smart investors to stay away from oil. Instead, electric vehicles appear to be the best long term values in energy and transportation in today’s market."
Medium.com,Society,Polyrhythmia: Hong Kong’s Yoga of Defiance,World,https://medium.com/@robinrobinhk/polyrhythmia-hong-kongs-yoga-of-defiance-489529de741?source=topic_page---------641------------------1," Martine, the new yoga teacher, was at the counter ordering something. Great, I thought. Here’s my chance to chat with her. How’re you liking it here, I asked. “Love it,” she said. Her Aussie voice brimmed with energy. “The yoga scene is really huge in Hong Kong, somany people taking their practice seriously.” She flashed a brief, dazzling smile, then frowned. “But the marches and the demonstrations, they take some getting used to.” I nodded. “That’s part of life here. Hong Kong’s the city of demonstrations.” “But why? Do they really think they can make China change its mind?” I mentally wound myself up for a long discussion. “Actually it’s a story that goes back a long way, to the British.” Then I realized she may not be up for the big picture of Hong Kong’s culture of protest. So I took a different tact. “Look at it like yoga,” I said. “Hong Kong is practicing its own kind of yoga. It sits on its mat, going through the poses, sometimes loud, sometimes quiet, letting its body respond to each asana in its own way. This releases some tension. Some poses are held a long time. Sometimes the release reaches deep, into the fascia and tendons. That’s what these marches and all the Lennon Walls do. They release the deep tensions inside the body of Hong Kong.” She nodded, as if she almost got me. “We could even say,” I continued, “that there are a fixed set of asanas in Hong Kong yoga.” I was getting into the theme. “You mean like demonstration asana? Or extradition asana?” She said, smiling. “Yeah, or tear gas-asana,” I added. We both laughed. “But not so funny when you remember people have already died. We’ve already had four suicides,” I said. Awkward silence ensued. She began to fidget with her bag, then picked up her stuff. “Off to my class,” she said, waving goodbye. Not long after I also walked out of the studio. The air, as usual, throbbed with humidity. Another July day in Hong Kong. Wicked hot. Can’t fight it and can’t change it. I walked onto Percival and waited for a streetcar to clank by. Turning the corner I saw the marchers, a surging mass of black moving down Hennessy Road. I moved towards it, then began to weave between the bodies until I too had joined Hong Kong’s yoga of defiance. _________ Let’s move down Hennessy. The sky is painfully bright. The sun bears down with noon-time ferocity. We can keep a steady pace, if we hustle. We pass under the Gooseneck, the concrete underpass filled with life. We see the fortune tellers on their stools. We walk by the park across from Tonnochy, so tiny it barely fits a few old men. At the Cal-Tex station we turn left onto Johnston Road. Sweat trickles down our ribs in tiny rivulets. We inhale, we exhale, together. On the streets the people of Hong Kong breathe breath as one; we inhale the grit and sounds of the streets, the trollies the footsteps the buses. We are one mass pulling down the packed streets, pieces peeling and re-emerging and peeling off constantly. This is a practice, a practice of dissent. In another place, the yoga mat, the yogi also practices. He moves with care. The yogi seeks awareness. Each breath brings refocuses the mind. With each exhale there is a release. Hong Kong, a single body. Today it is a body in pain. It stretches in agony. The yoga of Hong Kong helps her meet the pain, to push through it. ________ The demonstrations are now in their tenth week. The veneer of nonchalance is shattered. It’s not simply a question of wagging fingers at the young. The violence on the streets shocks everyone. Now the middle-aged members of my Anglican congregation are worried. “If it goes on like this, I’m out of here. Who wants to live in a place like this?” But what has changed? The streets still pulse. Every storefront buzzes with activity. The children rush out every Saturday to their tutorials and music classes, pulled along by an anxious mothers. The technicians, the repairmen, the retail workers, the barristers doctors nurses — all rush, rush madly rush to the next task. The fabric of life is intact. Except when we march. And Hong Kong has been marching. _____ Current events this year boiled over on June 6 in opposition to the proposed extradition law. Ill-advised. Asinine. Unnecessary. There’s no end to the invectives we can throw at this move by the Carrie Lam government, from our all-knowing position of hindsight. At the time, the move, the Fugitive Offenders and Mutual Legal Assistance in Criminal Matters Legislation, felt like just another boring announcement. A Hong Kong man, Chan Tong-kai, had escaped arrest in Taiwan. He had probably killed his pregnant girlfriend and left her body in his hotel room. Serving time for a minor offense in Hong Kong, he should be extradited to Taiwan to face the music. But he can’t be — there’s no mechanism for sending people charged with crimes back to Taiwan. Or to most other jurisdictions. Hong Kong has extradition agreements with only a handful of places — the UK, Australia, Canada, the US, Singapore.[1] Not Germany. Not Italy. Not France. Not Brazil. And not even neighboring Macao. And certainly not…. Did I mention China? Sure, the China factor lurks there in the background, always. Let’s be honest — nobody trusts the Chinese legal system. Gui Minhai, the Causeway Books publisher kidnapped in 2015 and rearrested in 2018, and, apparently, still under detention, is a case in point. No one here trusts the Chinese legal system, one that may be subject to the current political campaigns of the month. Apparently, the Carrie Lam government did not consider this fact — or, they thought they could get away with ramming through the new law without considering it. But the marches, the chants, the Lennon Walls are not simply about China. We can list several other elements. Incompetence No one minds the idea of an agreement with Taiwan. Sure, the man who admitted to killing his girlfriend should be sent back. Headmitted to the crime. As for Macao, no one minds much either way. Well, almost no one. Joseph Lau, Chinese Estates Holdings property magnate, has been wanted there for five years. Up till not he has been safe in Hong Kong, protected by the lack of an extradition agreement. Under the Hong Kong system new laws are not summarily announced, as they are under some legal systems. A proposed law must first be read at the Legislative Council, and voted on or amended, before being finalized, approved, and published. There is a procedure, one established long ago by the British colonial regimes. The proposed law is scheduled to be read in the Legislative Council on June 12. It never happens. Marching and Occupying The current spate of protests started June 9, with a large mass protest down Hennessey. This road runs from Victoria Park in Causeway Bay to Central, a distance of some four or five kilometers. Nearly all marches nowadays take this route, which conveniently passes by the large aggregation of government offices near Admiralty, and ends in Central near the Supreme Court building, which is not far from the governor’s mansion (oops, I mean the Chief Executive’s quarters) and, just down from the American Consulate on Garden Road, and the China offices of the Chinese government in Hong Kong. Everything is conveniently close. The June 12 protests were more than a march, however. They were a targeted occupation of Harcourt Road area around the government offices. June 12 stands as the date the anti-extradition protests took a different turn. Hong Kong tried a new asana. And Pepper Spraying It became a pitched battle between protestors and police. The police used pepper spray, tear gas, beanbag shots, and rubber bullets, tools almost never used in Hong Kong protests. The government later labelled the violent actions a “riot,” a charge carrying a sentence of up to 10 years. Amnesty International, observing the events, confirms that the police used excessive force. Net result: the bill is suspended. It is not dead. Quiet protests around Harcourt Road continue. On June 16 there is another mass protest down Hennessy, this one numbering two million. Protests are coordinated by an organization called Civil Human Rights Front 民間人權陣線. The opposition is unified behind five demands publicized everywhere: • Complete withdrawal of the extradition bill • Carrie Lam’s resignation • Release of all those arrested in connection with the protest. • An investigation into the police actions on June 12. • Retraction of the characterization of the protest as a riot None of these seem likely to happen. Yet the government is now visibly under strain from the escalation of street pressure. Carrie Lam, so far silent, holds a press conference on June 18. She apologizes for her inept handling of the bill, but goes no further. Judging from the look on her face, her contrition itself is contrived. No one is mollified. Organization 48 NGOs and political parties established the Civil Human Right Front in 2002. The immediate reason for establishing the group was to coordinate protests against Article 23. That proposed measure resulted in 500,000 people taking to the streets in an emphatic expression of discontent that foreshadowed the current movement. Today the Front is an established NGO; it is affiliated with the United Nations and sits on the Universal Periodic Review Steering Committee.[2] It serves a legitimate functions in Hong Kong’s civil society. For instance, the Front is the organization that organizes the annual July marches, which have become a tradition. But it’s not just the Front that supports these political actions. There are the pro-democratic political parties. Some have been around since Tiananmen in the 1980s.[3] Some have been outlawed as too extreme. And there may be others who don’t make their presence public. All are using the social media platforms ITHK and Telegram, and organizing fluid resistance. “Be Water,” Bruce Lee’s quote, is the phrase that encapsulates their tactical position. Like water, demonstrators should flow in and out of empty spaces, at times sitting calmly, at times crashing like a wave. Clearly this generation of protesters have learned from their experience of Occupy in 2014. The Mothers On June 15 some 6000 barristers and mothers from Chinese University gather in Chater Garden to demand Carrie Lam’s resignation. They gathered a petition signed by 44,000 decrying the Chief Executive’s statements at her press conference on June 14. They came back on July 5. This time the count was 8000 (1500 by police estimates). The numbers are small, the symbolism great. Mothers are the social conscience of society. We have seen mothers make statements in Chile, Argentina, and after Tiananmen. Mothers can call out anyone, including generals and errant officials. The Elderly The mothers were not the only demographic group to spring to life. 9000 (police count 1500) elderly marched on the night of July 17. This action was organized by Rev. Chu Yiu-ming, one of the three original Occupy organizers. The presence of the elderly underlines the fact that this protest wave is not just young people letting off steam. There are plenty of dissenters, and support is broad. Siege Like other government offices, Police Headquarters are near Admiralty. During the next large march held after June 12, on June 21, many of the protesters move to surround the headquarters building itself. They stand all night, scrunched in the streets in front of the shiny high-rise. Some throw eggs. Some shine laser lights into the eyes of officers observing from the building — an action later deemed to be an act of violence. No one from the besieged building can get in or out, including the commissioner of police. 999 calls go unanswered, according to later police statements. Counter-Demo A smallish counter-demonstration to show support for the government is held on the next day, June 22. Teresa Cheng Yeuk-wah, Secretary for Justice, rejects the possibility of not charging those arrested for taking part in the June 12 demonstrations. On August 3 sees another protest, this time in support of the embattled police. The Lennon Walls They are everywhere now, in all the universities, in the main Shatin shopping center, outside MTR stations, on pedestrian overpasses, and of course covering the wall outside Legco, on Harcourt Rd. Lennon walls first started in Prague in 1980 following John Lennon’s murder. During the Prague Spring of 1988 the same wall became a site to record expressions of frustration with the government. Hong Kong’s original Lennon wall started during the Occupy Central movement of 2014. The walls became outlets for the amazing outpouring of artistic expression that accompanied this 79-day passive occupation. Today’s walls are smorgasbords of post-its, newspaper articles, and drawings, expressing refined as well as crude sentiments. They are now a fixture of Hong Kong street politics. G20 A small march delivers a letter to the Hong Kong offices of 19 of the G20 countries. The Chinese representative office is not included. The letter requests the overseas governments to bring up the Hong Kong protests at the upcoming G20 summit in Osaka. The same letter is published in some ten international papers on June 28, after an online funding campaign collected over $600,000.[4] When asked, President Trump mumbles something. Not likely. Nevertheless, another move calculated to make China angry. And A Blank Space at the Top Which is the point, it seems. These manifestations are all about going to the limit, to provoke. There are no kid gloves. The demonstrators seem intent on any measure to get their point across. Yet nothing seems to bear fruit. The government has been deaf. This deafness, interpreted by some as determination, is increasingly seen as plain ineptitude. Nearly all summer there have been few official announcements or speeches. Even the conservative commentators who fill the pages of the South China Morning Postnote that the government has virtually ceased to function. “The government,” notes David Dodwell on Aug. 5, “needs to crawl out of its bunker and show it is not a puppet leader.”[5] “As for a functioning government,” says conservative commentator Alex Lo, “Chief Executive Carrie Lam Cheng Yuet-ngor and her top ministers have taken a leave of absence for weeks now.”[6] Net result: the police have been left to manage on their own. There is, in other words, a void at the top. Or is this appearance of government ineptitude a massive set-up, prelude to an ambush into which the demonstrators walk to their own detriment? Probably not. The blank space at the top has been a fact ever since the handover in 1997. In fact it isthefundamental issue. The chosen leaders have no credibility, and never had any, because they were never chosen from below. The sooner Beijing wakes up to this reality the sooner a deal can be mediated. ______ Join again the marchers on Hennessy. We dance down the street, like dolphins at sea. We are surrounded by other bodies twisting in motion, each one filled with a fierce presence, an uplift. A thousand feet touch the ground at once; we braid into a dynamic whole, serpentine scales soundless, rippling through the air. We are one body in yoga, on one mat, in the asana of defiance. ______ Monday, August 5. The day of the massive strike. The yoga studio is still open. But most MTR lines are halted. Buses don’t run. Hundreds of flights are cancelled as air controllers call in sick. A rally is planned at New Town Plaza in Sha Tin, sight of a very violent confrontation July 14. The Cross Harbour Tunnel will be blocked for the second time. Protesters also occupy major roads around the Wong Tai Sin district. Carrie Lam finally holds a press conference today. She defends her lack of communication, saying she’s actually been in meetings every day for the past two months. And she says she will not resign. “The government,” she says, “will be resolute in maintaining law and order of Hong Kong and restoring confidence….We all love Hong Kong and have made various contributions to its stability and prosperity … it’s time to say no to chaos and violence.” Repeating the same line as always. Nothing new will issue from her lips, it seems. Protests have escalated over the past two weeks. The demonstrators appear to be well-organized and strategic. As Alex Lo notes, perceptively, the protestors use a guerrilla strategy of showing up in one place then moving quickly to another. The centrally-directed riot police, burdened with equipment, cannot keep up. — - Hong Kong’s Polyrhythmia Step back and view all this from a distance. The Hong Kong demonstrations are combustible events, perturbations in the surface of normalcy. They recur every few years — we have seen marches stretching back to the June 4 protests of 1989, the massive march in 2003, and the Occupy movements of 2011 and 2014. A sequence of defiance, they form what the French theorist Henri Lefebvre calls cyclical rhythms that erupt into the everyday. Lefebvre saw rhythm as a window into the everyday. For Lefebvre the spaces of everyday interactions are where great forces engage in combat. The everyday, he wrote, “is simultaneously the site of, the theatre for, and what is at stake in a conflict between great indestructible rhythms and the processes imposed by the socio-economic organization of production, consumption, circulation and habitat.”[7] Organic, recurring cycles are the fabric of life. The quantified time of watches and clocks, in contrast, is imposed by our particular historical moment . For Lefebvre these two rhythms are locked in a “bitter and dark struggle” around the use of time.[8] Ultimately the two are drawn together into a kind of “antagonistic unity.”[9] Lefebvre contrasts dull, repetitive, “measured” time with differentiated rhythm that is not uniform. The easiest way to picture this is the distinction between theideaof a wave, the abstract wave patterns, and the actualwaves of an ocean.[10] In rhythm analysis the researcher hones awareness to the deeper and multitudinous discordances between linear and cyclical. One grasps the perceived object — a leaf, a house — polyrhythmically,“in its place and approximate becoming.”[11] Starting with and rooted in a deep awareness of the multitude of rhythms produced by one’s own internal organs, the individual can conjecturally grasp rhythms that pierce all levels of the universe. “Without knowing it,” says Lefebevre, “the human species draws from the heart of the universe movements that correspond to its own movements.”[12] The rhythmanalysist is always listening out.[13] She not only observes, she also hears (in the double sense of the word: noticing and understanding).[14] “…She separates out through a mental act that which gives itself as linked to a whole: namely rhythms and their associations.”[15] One feels, for instance, the grand cloud of murmur hanging over a crowd. Like waves on a beach, the multiple strands create clashes of cycles, the polyrhythmic. __________ In bhujangasana, cobra pose, the yogi stretches the torso up, allowing the spine to arch to the limit. The Hong Kong demonstrators practice this same move, as a single body. The massive creature stretches, hoods flaring. Electricity courses through the nadhi lines along its sides. Its chest soars high. It breathes in the air of Sheung Shui, its ribs rub the towers of Admiralty, its tailbone presses into Causeway Bay. The eyes bear down on Central, then soften, roll, and melt into sky. The cobra stretches toward a single state, the point of equilibrium, of liberty. _______ For Lefebvre all cycles relate to a cosmic origin, the movement of planets and stars. All cycles connect localized space with the universe. Cyclic rhythms entail perpetual interaction between the whole and every body. Such cycles are measured in duodecimals, twelves, and recur. Linear rhythms, in contrast, are man-made and mechanical. They project away, toward infinity. They are measured in decimals, in tens, in the language of precision and science. The do not recur. The history of cities is the working out of cosmic cycles confronted with the man-made rhythms of empire. The Mediterranean towns, for Lefebvre, always flourished in a state of compromise between political powers.[16] Citing the example of the great maritime city-state of Venice, Lefebvre notes that these city-states could never dominate in the way great empires could. Unless they were in revolt, their nature was apolitical. Yet the well-tuned homeostasis of the city-state always involved an ambiguous compromise with the dominate power. The city-state, in other words, exemplified a polyrhythmic way of life. Such polyrhythmicity is seen in the many rites that express alliances and shared codes, and other rituals, more inward-looking, that express an inward reality. Profane and sacred rituals are held in a delicate balance. All these rituals and representations are visible in the public sphere, the grand theater of intrigue. ________ Hong Kong is China’s Venice. Hong Kong’s streets, from Mongkok to Sheung Shui, beat with intrigue and encoded gestures. Every night market stall, every restaurant and hair parlor is a stage. Everybody is in costume, twirling in constant movement. But Hong Kong does not reflect the cycles of the Mediterranean. Instead, she embodies the rhythms the Southeast China coast, China’s distant and sandy margin. And as Lefebvre concludes about the Mediterranean town, we find in such spaces the perpetual struggle between the rhythms of diversity and homogenization. Here the globalizing domination of the center (capital cities, dominant cultures, empires) attacks the multidimensionality of the periphery. In the city-state on the edge, “all forms of hegemony and homogeneity are refused….”[17] The outcome is not always good. Citing Beirut, Lefebvre concludes that “when rhythms of the other make rhythms of the self impossible, total crisis breaks out…”[18] Hong Kong, this coastal jewel, thrived as a colony. Out of sight of the cosmopolitan capital, it was managed with a light touch. The test of one countries, two systems is whether this balance between the heavy hand of the center and the diversity of the periphery can hold. It may not. Today the state of homeostasis is cracked. Today on the street of Hong Kong bricks are torn up and reused; tear gas and blood fill the stations; cycles are being re-coded. The feet stumble until new rituals form, new truths reassert themselves. The streets invent new rhythms, new asanas, a new yoga."
Medium.com,Society,The distance between Tel Aviv and Copenhagen is 3.200 kilometers.,World,https://medium.com/@ceciliebodker/the-distance-between-tel-aviv-and-copenhagen-is-3-200-kilometers-98640ba90cc8?source=topic_page---------642------------------1," On the door are three red circles with a red line crossing over. One circle contains a drawing of a cigarette, the other a dog, and the third a machine gun. I traveled to Israel and started questioning what normality is. Two men in pastel-colored speedos are lying close to each other in the sand, their bodies glistening in the sun. A moment before, they stood embracing in the waves. I am lying horizontally in the sand, the hangover is banging away somewhere in my forehead. I close my eyes, and hear the sound of wet kisses. “I am from Russia,” he says.
“I am from here,” says the other man.
“Lucky you! I wish I could stay here in Tel Aviv forever.” The sound of several kisses, followed by a quiet moan.
“You are so bad!” The bearded, bald man whispers. After a while, they pack their towels. I make eye contact with one man before they leave and send him a smile. He smiles back happily. Tel Aviv organizes one of the worlds largest Pride festivals. The colorful liberation of the city was one of the things that attracted me to it. I walk along the coast, turning at one of the smaller streets where people are crowded into café corners, busy talking to each other and dipping pita bread into hummus. I keep walking. I notice two young women dressed in military green from head to toe, one of them is wearing a pink backpack, a fluffy keychain is dangling from one of the pockets. They are waiting patiently in the ice cream queue. Two massive black machine guns are hanging from their sides. Among fashionable queers, pierced bohemians, oiled beach lions, LGBT flags waving from balconies, ultra-orthodox black-clad med with tall hats, long curls dangling in front of each ear on the way out of the synagogue, backpackers with hangovers, sunscreen and falafel, there are more machine guns at the same place than I’ve ever seen before. Tel Avis is a bubble that is easy to get absorbed in. The machine guns remind me of what is happening outside this bubble. I just shook her hand, and I sit down next to her on the couch, we’re sitting quite close, with each our beer in our hands. She has long reddish hair, pale skin covered in freckles. She moves uneasy around in the couch next to me, like she never feels completely comfortable with her body’s placement in the room. She tells me that is from The US and has Jewish ancestry, and therefore she can receive military training in Israel, which is something that is offered to all Israeli women and men under the age of 24. She has been in the military for a few months now, but for this weekend she is partying in Tel Aviv. “Oh, you will find this funny!” she exlaims, eagerly pulling out her iPhone from her pocket. She shows me a picture on her Instagram. She is posing in military green with a machine gun that almost looks bigger that her. “Isn’t it cool?” She laughs. I try to smile, but I can feel the muscles in my chin tighening. “Do you ever think about how you are taking part in actually killing people?” I ask. Her grin fades. She become quiet, her eyes is looking at the couch between us. I immediately feel guilty. Here, at a hostel roof filled with backpackers drinking beer, putting on 90’s hits, I am asking her to think about whether she has been a part of killing another human being. “Sorry!” I say quickly. “I can be pretty blunt about things. I really want to understand why you are in the army. I am a pacifist, you see.” She answers, uneasily. “I am just in the air force, but not in the planes. I am just helping with communication…” She starts explaining that the walls sorrounding Israel are so fragile that is it important to fitght to protect it. She tells me that it gives her a sense of meaning in her life to be among those who fights for it. She says she does something good for others. Her gaze starts flickering when she tells me about the officers in the corps, she calls them Emotional Robots. The stories she tells sounds similar to the few military movies I’ve seen. Officers portrayed as emotionless men whose missions are to break down their soldiers, so they can be rebuilt, now hardened and invulnerable, ready to kill. I tell her, that I like the fact that the Israeli military doesn’t make any difference on being a man or a women doing military service. That women in this context is not considered “the weak sex”. But what does it mean in this case to be strong? “Strenght” measured in the capacity to practice physical violence? I take another sip of my beer and think about why she showed exactly that picture on Instagram. I understand why she considers it to be a cool picture. A skinny long-haired girl can take on a classic masculine role as any man. A tomb boy is cooler than being a girly girl, right? Tomb boys are equally bad ass as the guys. She can also smoke two packs of cigarretes a day. She can also drink herself to death. She can also punch someones teeth out. She can kill, too. Why is it cool to take on that part of toxic masculinity: the destructive, the self-destructive? The bottle of beer in my hand is empty now, but I can still taste the guilt from asking her about killing people. But still, I want her to be aware that it’s not just white dots on the screen that the pilots in the fighter jets are watching. I imagine the pilots in the clouds, how easily they erradicate with a single push of a button. Are they aware of that each of the single white dots on the screen has a mother, a father, a best friend? Maybe the white dot has dimples, or gets freckles in the summer. Would the pilots really push the button, if they knew these things? “What do you want to do after military training?” I ask, after getting two new beers, handing one to her. “I don’t really know what my dream is. I just really want to adopt a puppy.” Tel Aviv as a bubble, it feels necessary to stay inside it, it is easy to stay inside it, it is much more enjoyable to stay inside it and forget about what happens outside. The bubble as normality for those who are priviliged enough to choose to be in it."

-“Latinoamérica,” Calle 13 orelia has entire stores dedicated to candy. I’m not talking convenience store-sized, and I’m not talking 7-Eleven’s general junk food. I’m talking whole bodegas, still plain and unpainted, filled to the brim, crawling with sweets. They smell of metal and sugar, the scent so distinct it could be bottled and turned into a perfume or an expensive candle, so strong it clings to your throat even after you’ve left. These places carry traditional handmade candies like coconut-stuffed lime peels, marzipan and piloncillo, dulce de leche, and honeyed peanuts. There’s also that factory, mass-produced candy like “clown popsicles,” La Rosa sweets, and Rockaletas. Rockaletas. My brother loved those as a kid, although I found them too overwhelming. They’re layered popsicles—four layers with a morsel of bubblegum waiting for you at the center. Rockaletas remind me of Morelia, my hometown. The first layer of a Rockaleta is chile—tamarindo, I believe. It’s spicy, with a citrusy aftertaste. The surface is corrugated, glistening with a beautiful, deep red color. Downtown Morelia is like that top layer. It’s in the picture that comes up when you google my hometown. One of the things that Morelia is most famous for is its historic downtown. The place is surreal, at once beautiful and gritty, elegant, and garish. It was built during the Colonial era, back when Morelia’s name was Valladolid and Mexico was part of Spain; it now houses some of the most traditional aspects of Mexican culture. Morelia’s buildings, almost all of them made out of pink quarry, glisten half-gold in the perpetual 75-degree sun, bright enough to leave dancing imprints behind people’s closed lids. The city often houses protests and demonstrations where winding streets between the centuries-old buildings have become awfully unsafe places, and the smell of baked treats mingles with the stench of sewage. Downtown Morelia is like that top layer. It’s in the picture that comes up when you google my hometown. It’s shiny and perfect as a new button if you look at it with your eyes half-squinted and a hand shielding your face from the sun. It’s just testy enough to add flavor. When I was about nine years old I went on a night tour through the area with my parents, in an old rickety tranvía made of red wood. At every location where we stopped, a man who would two years later become my history teacher told us a legend about the place—stories of evil stepmothers and beautiful meek stepdaughters, of haunted specters and deals with the devil gone awry. The stories were sadder than they were spooky—in Mexico, we are not scared of death—but they were mesmerizing above all else. This man used words like a silk thread, weaving the history of my city into something so breathtakingly beautiful, I wanted to wear my culture like a dress. I wanted to walk out onto the pink cobblestones of Morelia’s plaza and dance with its ghosts."
Medium.com,Society,Successful Governments Feed Their People,World,https://medium.com/goods-services/successful-governments-feed-their-people-9542cf6f0660?source=topic_page---------644------------------1," China purchases a lot of U.S. agriculture products, or it did before the trade war started. To inflict the most damage to the United States, China imposed counter-tariffs on U.S. food and agricultural products. The problem is that making food more expensive for Chinese consumers could create serious food security issues. Feeding citizens is arguably the most important job of the government. Starving people overthrow their governments. China has to carefully balance competing factors such as these as it develops and executes its trade war strategy. China wants to look strong and therefore must respond to Trump’s tariffs. Beijing is deploying countermeasures that will inflict the most damage possible in the United States. However, the economies are greatly interconnected, so Beijing must avoid too much collateral damage at home. This is true in manufacturing, where the government wants to keep factories growing and the economy strong, and it’s also true in food where it needs to make sure 1.4 billion Chinese people are fed. Addressing China’s lack of food security is a top priority for China since it is dependent on imports to feed the population. The trade war exemplifies the food security risks associated with importing from other nations. One of the weakest points in China’s food security is soybeans and pork production. China has the largest pig industry in the world. Half of all the pigs in the world are raised in China. These pigs eat soybeans. China doesn’t grow many soybeans. Instead, China is the world’s largest importer of soybeans. Before the trade war, China purchased 40 percent of the soybeans American farmers grew. Now, politics and taxes are preventing Chinese producers from buying American soybeans, leaving them in a bind. The Chinese government is trying to increase agricultural productivity to make China less dependent on trading partners. In the marketing year (MY) 2017/18, China produced 15.2 million metric tons of soybeans. In MY 2018/19, soybean production is expected to grow to 15.7 million metric tons. In MY 2019/20, the USDA expects Chinese production to reach 17.0 million metric tons. This is still a small fraction of the 100+ million metric tons of soybeans that China uses each year, the majority of which is fed to pigs. However, China is also taking steps to reduce soybean demand from 106.3 million metric tons in MY 2017/18 to 103.1 million metric tons in MY 2018/19. In July 2018, the Chinese government put additional tariffs on American soybeans, increasing the price by 25%. The new tax was in response to the United States putting tariffs on Chinese goods because of weak intellectual property protection. This strategic move was aimed at vulnerable farmers that are dependent on Chinese exports. Soybean farmers are dependent on the Chinese market, and they are generally very supportive of Trump. Attacking Trump’s base was an attempt by China to influence future tariff policies. Winning farmers back led Trump to provide agriculture with two trade aid packages. The timing of the counter-tariffs is also significant. They were announced in July 2018, when non-U.S. soybeans were available. Argentina, Brazil and the United States account for 72% of global soybean production. Brazil and Argentina are in the southern hemisphere, where harvest starts in February and ends in April. In July, the majority of the soybeans on the market are from southern hemisphere producers, making it fairly easy for China to purchase Brazilian or Argentine soybeans instead of American ones. If the trade war had ended quickly, Chinese buyers would have purchased from South American suppliers and then resumed purchases of U.S. soybeans in the fall, like normal. However, the trade war didn’t end. Chinese importers bought all of the available South American soybeans, leaving only American soybeans for sale in the fall. At first, the 25% tariff made American soybeans cost-prohibitive for Chinese importers, but as non-U.S. soybeans became harder to find, importers considered paying the tariff. There were two purchase orders for U.S. soybeans toward the end of 2018, but politics prevented those shipments from being accepted. The Chinese government took steps to reduce soybean demand. Soybeans are the primary source of protein in pig food. The government lowered the protein requirement, which ultimately lowered soybean demand. This is part of the reason soybean demand is expected to drop by 3 million metric tons. Changing soybean levels is not unheard of; Chinese farmers regularly adjust the protein levels in hog feed as soy and hog prices rise and fall. Reducing soybean consumption helped a little. Then on December 1, 2018, Trump and Xi met in Argentina and agreed to a three-month trade truce. This meant no new tariffs for three months. The easing of trade tensions gave Beijing cover to purchase U.S. soybeans. It was a win-win. China touted major purchases of U.S. soybeans as a concession to the United States. It got soybeans that it wanted and didn’t have to change domestic intellectual property laws, which it didn’t want to do. Trump also got a major win. He was able to announce that his tariffs pressured China into making the largest soybean purchases ever. China was able to buy the soybean it needed. Then the trade truce broke down in May 2019, at which time South American soybeans were back on the market. China will likely buy all of the available soybeans from South America. Bad weather in Brazil reduced the crop by 5.0 million metric tons, while Argentine production increased by 18.2 million metric tons, escalating the soybean problem until in the fall when these soybeans run out. As if this situation weren’t complicated enough, in August 2018, an African Swine Fever (ASF) outbreak started in China. ASF is a highly contagious and lethal pig disease. It kills pigs within 7–10 days of being infected or roughly two days after a pig shows symptoms. The virus originated in wild boar populations in Africa. It left the continent in the 1950s and was found in Portugal. Since then, it has spread throughout Europe. Now the disease is spreading unchecked in China and Vietnam (another top 10 pork producing country). ASF is not dangerous for people to eat, which is good because it can survive in cooked meat. This is one of the reasons it is so contagious-it’s difficult to kill. This is an epic outbreak. The first case of ASF in China was reported in August 2018. By September 1st, 34,000 hogs were culled to contain the disease. Roadblocks were set up to prevent the transport of live or dead pigs. These containment actions were ineffective. As of April 2019, the virus has been reported in all 32 Chinese provinces and in May 2019 Hong Kong was added to the list. The disease has also spread to Cambodia, Laos, Thailand, and Vietnam. The United Nations’ Food and Agriculture Organization reports that the Chinese herd is 40 million pigs smaller than last year and Vietnam has already culled 2.5 million pigs. Some industry experts think that 50% of all Chinese hogs could be culled in 2019, or roughly 25% of the domesticated pigs globally. However, the total number is unknown because the disease is still spreading unchecked. Fewer pigs will reduce China’s demand for soybeans, which will help address China’s soybean concerns. However, this disease creates a huge pork problem. In China, pork is synonymous with meat. It is a huge part of the culture. Chinese eat 50% of all pork produced in the world. Meaning, that if 100% of the Chinese pigs were culled and China made up the difference by importing every pound of pork produced in the world, there would still be a pork shortage in China. At this point, the outbreak is not impacting global pork or meat markets, but it will eventually. Chinese importers and processors are already looking for new pork sources. Looking at the USDA table below, in 2017 China produced 53.4 million metric tons of pork in 2017, followed by the EU with 23.7 million metric tons and the United States with 11.6 million metric tons. If Chinese production falls to 27 million metric tons, they would have to import almost all of the pork produced in the EU and the United States to make up the shortfall. Italy is not going to stop curing parma hams anytime soon. Not all of the European pork can be diverted to China, but the increased competition for pork will further increase international tensions. In 2013, Shuanghui International Holdings Ltd, the largest Chinese meat processor, bought Smithfield Foods. At the time, there was an outcry over American food security. The fear was that U.S. pork would be diverted to China, leaving Americans with no pork. It is still unlikely, but that is a much larger possibility today than it was six years ago. Chinese pork demand grew with its middle class. Today about 500 million more people have enough disposable income, and the first thing people do with disposable income is spend more money on food. This means switching from a rice-based diet to one with more protein. In China, that protein is pork. The long history of pork consumption and its cultural importance will make it hard for people to switch to either chicken or fish. The disease is not under control yet. As pork supplies drop, the price of pork products will increase. At some point, people will be unable to afford pork and then the government could have a serious food security crisis on its hands. Just like the government revised soybean requirements for pigs, Beijing is trying to influence eating behaviors by encouraging people to eat less pork. Chinese producers can’t meet demand and with the new tariffs, pork from the United States faces a 62% tariff when it enters China. That is a huge price increase but so far, the Chinese industry is willing to pay it. Todd Thruman, an international pig consultant, explained that on a recent trip to China, he was approached by processors that were willing to sign contracts for all available U.S pork for the next three years even with the tariff, and prices skyrocketing and projected to rise further. This will increase the pork available in China, but will likely put it out of reach for many families. Now it is pigs, not soybeans, which could cause Chinese food insecurity, forcing Beijing to change its strategy. As more pigs die, the pressure is growing on the Chinese government. In August, Beijing announced a 10 million metric ton shortage of pork in 2019. This sent pork prices skyrocketing. Shortly after, China announced that it will suspend future tariff increases on U.S. pork and soybean products until after the Chinese holiday and the October trade talks. The trade war reduces the tools available to both governments to manage the volatile agriculture landscape. American farmers can’t sell their soybeans and Chinese producers can’t buy the food they need because of artificially higher prices and politics. Xi needs to make sure his people are fed; Trump needs to make sure farmers don’t go bankrupt, taking down the rural economy. As I’ve said before, this is a competitive game of Chess that requires keeping track of and balancing many moving pieces.

Medium.com,Society,A Brief History of Trump’s Foreign Policy Bluffs,World,https://gen.medium.com/a-brief-history-of-trumps-foreign-policy-bluffs-a64190c429ba?source=topic_page---------645------------------1," For President Trump, it’s bloviate first and blueprint later. From his reaction to the attacks on Saudi Arabia’s oil fields this past weekend to his flip-flops on whether Mexico will pay for the border wall, Trump relishes a confrontation on the world stage with a rival leader. And often enough, it’s only a matter of time before he reneges on whatever threat he’s made — or, in classic Trump fashion, denies he’d ever issued any threat in the first place. (See: His feud with North Korea leader Kim Jong Un.) Trump’s penchant for vacuous saber-rattling is a key feature of his presidency (much to his base’s delight), even if undermines of decades of U.S. policy and endangers his country’s credibility overseas (not to mention the economy, national security, and global stability). Below, five times where Trump backed out on his foreign policy threats. The latest presidential ping-pong came over the weekend, when Trump sent Washington into a panic by saying the U.S. was “locked and loaded” to defend Saudi Arabia. His comments followed an attack on Riyadh’s oil facilities, launched (according to reports) by Iran and its proxies. But just one day after issuing the threat, Trump softened his stance, saying his administration wasn’t even sure Iran was behind the attacks, and denying that he’d ever pledged to protect Saudi Arabia. “I’m somebody that would like not to have war,” he said. The early months of Trump’s presidency were marred by the commander in chief’s squabbles with Kim Jong Un. Trump often insulted and threatened the North Korean dictator, warning that “North Korea best not make any more threats to the United States. […] They will be met with fire and fury like the world has never seen.” But by the spring of 2018, following an invitation to negotiate from Pyongyang, he had started to move away from the litany of insults. The two leaders held a summit in June 2018, in which they came to an agreement on the issue of the Korean Peninsula’s denuclearization, followed by another meeting this summer. Trump now maintains a chummy relationship with Kim — even while North Korea conducts several missile tests in direct violation of international law. “I was really being tough — and so was he. And we would go back and forth,” Trump said at a rally last year. “And then we fell in love, okay? No, really — he wrote me beautiful letters, and they’re great letters.” Among Trump’s central campaign promises in 2016: that Mexico would pay for a concrete wall in the southern border. He said it over and over and over again. And yet, three years later, he’s entirely abandoned the pretense. Of course, as everyone knows, Mexico refuses to pay for Trump’s pet project. By 2019, the president was resorting to some weird mental gymnastics: “Obviously, they’re not going to write a check,” he said emphatically to the press in January. “But they are paying for the wall indirectly, many, many times over, by the really great trade deal we just made.” (The administration can’t explain, and no expert can say, how the potential revenue streams indirectly generated by a trade deal would be allocated for the wall.) Then, in September, his administration directed the Defense Department to cancel $3.6 billion in military construction projects and instead direct those funds toward building the border wall. Last December, Trump announced unprompted (and without consulting some of his top military advisers) that all American troops would be removed from Syria, effective immediately. “Our boys, our young women, our men, they’re all coming back and they’re coming back now. We won,” Trump said in a video posted on Twitter, taking credit for the defeat of the Islamic State. The plan was for all troops to have left the country by April 2019. But the administration partially reversed course and ended up leaving about 200 peacekeeping troops behind. Since then, a report by the Pentagon’s Office of Inspector General found that some of Trump’s policy decisions could be linked to the Islamic State’s slow resurgence in the area. Trump’s calls for tariffs on steel imports and aluminum products in 2018 prompted a good deal of criticism by the European Union, whose leaders said the plan could impose new tariffs on American goods. In response, the president threatened to tax European cars. “If the E.U. wants to further increase their already massive tariffs and barriers on U.S. companies doing business there, we will simply apply a Tax on their Cars which freely pour into the U.S.,” Trump tweeted at the time. “They make it impossible for our cars (and more) to sell there.” In August 2018, he went on to announce a 25% tariff on cars coming from the European Union — but that too never materialized. The Trump administration ended up delaying the decision by six months in May 2019, while trade talks continue."
Medium.com,Society,Saudi oil attacks put US commitments to the test,World,https://medium.com/the-turbulent-world-of-middle-east-soccer/saudi-oil-attacks-put-us-commitments-to-the-test-8544e799d025?source=topic_page---------646------------------1," By James M. Dorsey A podcast version of this story is available on Soundcloud, Itunes, Spotify, Stitcher, TuneIn, Spreaker, Pocket Casts, Tumblr, Podbean and Castbox. Neither Saudi Arabia nor the United States is rushing to retaliate for a brazen, allegedly Iranian attack that severely damaged two of the kingdom’s key oil facilities. That is not to say that Saudi Arabia and/or the United States will not retaliate in what could prove to be a game changer in the geopolitics of the Middle East. Yet, reading the tea leaves of various US and Saudi statements lifts the veil on the constituent elements that could change the region’s dynamics. They also shine a spotlight on the pressures on both countries and shifts in the US-Saudi relationship that could have long lasting consequences. With US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo visiting the kingdom to coordinate what his office described as efforts to combat “Iranian aggression in the region,” Saudi Arabia and the United States will be seeking to resolve multiple issues. These include collecting sufficient evidence to convincingly apportion blame; calibrating a response that would be appropriate but not drag the United States and the Middle East into a war that few want; deciding who takes the lead in any military response and managing the long-term impact of that decision on Saudi-US relations and the US commitment to the region. A careful reading of Saudi and US responses to the attacks so far suggests subtle differences between the two. They mask fundamental issues that have emerged in the aftermath of the attacks. For starters, Mr. Pompeo and President Donald J. Trump have explicitly pointed the finger at Iran as being directly responsible, while Saudi Arabia stopped short of blaming the Islamic republic, saying that its preliminary findings show that Iranian weapons were used in the attack. Iran has denied any involvement. The discrepancy in the initial apportioning of blame raises the question whether Saudi Arabia is seeking to avoid being manoeuvred into a situation in which it would be forced to take the lead in retaliating against the Islamic republic with strikes against targets in Iran rather than Yemen. Political scientist Austin Carson suggests that Saudi Arabia may have an interest in at least partially playing along with Iranian insistence that it was not responsible. “Allowing Iran’s role to remain ambiguous could reduce Saudi leaders’ need to appear strong… The Saudis are reportedly unconvinced by shared US intelligence that attempts to link the attacks to Iran’s territory. Some experts suggest this may reflect a more cautious approach to escalation,” Mr. Carson wrote in The Washington Post. Saudi Arabia’s initial reluctance to unambiguously blame Iran may have a lot to do with Mr. Trump’s America First-driven response to the attacks that appeared to contradict the Carter Doctrine proclaimed in 1980 by President Jimmy Carter. The doctrine, a cornerstone of the Saudi-US relationship, stated that the United States would use military force, if necessary, to defend its national interests in the Gulf. Mr. Trump’s apparent weakening of the United States’ commitment to the defense of the kingdom, encapsuled in the doctrine, risks fundamentally altering the relationship, already troubled by Saudi conduct of the more than four-year long war in Yemen and last year’s killing of journalist Jamal Khashoggi in the Saudi consulate in Istanbul. Signalling a break with the Carter doctrine, Mr. Trump was quick to point out that the attacks were on Saudi Arabia, not on the United States, and suggested that it was for the Saudis to respond. “I haven’t promised Saudis that. We have to sit down with the Saudis and work something out. That was an attack on Saudi Arabia, and that wasn’t an attack on us. But we would certainly help them,” Mr. Trump said without identifying what kind of support the US would be willing to provide. Despite blustering that the United States was “locked and loaded,” Mr. Trump insisted that “we have a lot of options but I’m not looking at options right now.” Mr. Trump’s response to a tweet by US Senator Lindsey Graham, a friend of the president who favours a US military strike against Iran, that “the measured response by President @realDonaldTrump…was clearly seen by the Iranian regime as a sign of weakness” was equally telling. “No Lindsey, it was a sign of strength that some people just don’t understand.” Mr. Trump said. Mr. Trump further called into question the nature of the US-Saudi defense relationship by declaring that “If we decide to do something, they’ll be very much involved, and that includes payment. And they understand that fully.” The Saudi foreign ministry maintained, with the attacks casting doubt on the Saudi military’s ability to defend the kingdom’s oil assets and Mr. Trump seemingly putting the onus of a response on Saudi Arabia, that “the kingdom is capable of defending its land and people and responding forcefully to those attacks.” Only indisputable evidence that the drones were launched from Iranian territory would incontrovertibly point the finger at Iran. So far, the Saudis have stopped short of that while US officials have suggested that the drones were launched either from Iran or by pro-Iranian militias in southern Iraq. Holding Iran responsible for the actions of a militia, whether in Iraq or Yemen, could prove more tricky given long-standing questions about the degree of control that Iran has over various groups that it supports, and particularly regarding the Houthis. The argument could turn out to be a slippery slope given that by the same logic, the United States would be responsible for massive human casualties in the Yemen war resulting from Saudi use of American weaponry. Military retaliation may not be immediate even if the United States and Saudi Arabia can produce convincing evidence that Iran was directly responsible. “No knee jerk reactions to this — it’s very systematic — what happens with patience is it prevents stupid moves,” a US official said. The United States is likely to attempt to first leverage that evidence in meetings on the sidelines of next week’s United Nations General Assembly to convince the international community, and particularly the Europeans, to drop opposition to last year’s US withdrawal from the international nuclear accord with Iran and the harsh economic sanctions that the Trump administration has since imposed on Iran. Both the United States and Saudi Arabia will also want to use the opportunity of the UN gathering to try to ensure that the fallout of any military response is limited and does not escalate into a full-fledged war that could change the geopolitical map of the Middle East. Said foreign policy analyst Steven A. Cook: “How the Trump administration responds will indicate whether U.S. elites still consider energy resources a core national interest and whether the United States truly is on its way out of the Middle East entirely, as so many in the region suspect.” Dr. James M.

Medium.com,Society,Albanian gangs take up cryptocurrencies: ‘We need a new approach’ say police,World,https://cryptocurrencyhub.io/albanian-gangs-take-up-cryptocurrencies-we-need-a-new-approach-say-police-ea4eed8c294?source=topic_page---------647------------------1," Notorious Albanian gangs in the UK have a new trick up their sleeves. They are using cryptocurrencies for money-laundering operations, and it’s making life hard for the police. Albanian gangs have been heavily implicated in the UK’s cocaine market, a business estimated to be worth around £5bn ($6.23bn) annually. The Albanian criminal network is one of the most sophisticated in Europe, with close links to the Colombian drug cartels. The Albanian street dealers, known as the Hellbanianz, are also using social media for flashing their riches and recruiting new members, gaining hundreds of thousands of Instagram followers in the process. Some jailed gang members are even posting and sharing pictures and videos from inside their cells. 1. The Crypto game 2. BABB token sale: what you need to know 3. Aethia, Tamagotchi’s coming to Ethereum! 4. A Crypto that will Pay You Now, Balkan criminals have taken up the use of financial technology to stay one step ahead of the authorities. The head of organized crime for the National Police Chiefs’ Council (NPCC), Peter Goodman, recently reported that intelligence has shown that the Albanians gangs are using “cryptocurrencies and bitcoin cashpoints” for money laundering. Derbyshire’s chief constable further added that the increased use of technologies by organized crime groups means that police authorities now have to come up with a new approach to tackle organized crime. The authorities are also seeking how to improve predictive policing techniques. The relationship between cryptocurrencies and organized crime is complex. Cryptocurrencies have been considered a vulnerability when it comes to tackling money laundering. Criminals are also wary of the lack of regulation surrounding the international cryptocurrency system, exploiting similar issues when it comes to conducting illegal deals. And as these criminal networks become more prominent, they are also eager to explore the different opportunities that technology offers. According to Michael J Oghia, a Balkans-based internet governance consultant, while cryptocurrencies offer a wide range of benefits, they also have the potential to be used for malicious purposes by bad actors. “In the case of cryptocurrencies, they are simply an extension of the ongoing struggle between bad actors and cybersecurity and security authorities that are working to counter online threats,” Oghia tells ZDNet. “One of the biggest differences, though, is that — unlike issues regarding encryption or malware — cryptocurrency is used by organized crime and other nefarious actors in a way that combines illegal offline actions with a technology that was designed to maximize privacy, security, decentralization, and anonymity.” The critical component of using cryptocurrencies for money laundering is that they provide a decentralized mechanism that is difficult to follow. However, tracing it is not impossible, and law-enforcement agencies are significantly expanding their expertise in forensic accounting. “As technology is evolving, so are the ways how transactions can be tracked. For instance, all transactions are recorded on the publicly accessible blockchain ledger,” Oghia explains. “By combining those transaction details with other information and analytical techniques, law-enforcement agencies and cybersecurity experts are finding ways to trace such actors — though it’s still a slow process.”"

Part 1: Homegrown Terror: The Birth of the Japanese Red Army
Part 2: Blood on the Snow: The Horrifying Implosion of Japan’s United Red Army
Part 3: Last Stand: The Hostage Crisis That Crippled Japan’s Red Army Okamoto Kozo sat alone in his room at the Hotel Papillon in Beirut. It was early March of 1972, and at only 24 years old, the young man had never before been abroad. Okamoto found himself overwhelmed by homesickness and apprehension. His orders to leave Japan for the foreign shores of Lebanon had come in quite suddenly, but he had jumped at the opportunity to get out of the stifling political atmosphere of his own country and to finally start making a difference. Now, though, the confines of his room and the unfamiliar noises of the foreign city outside his window only filled him with a sense of pained solitude. Okamoto was jostled from his lonely reverie as his ears were greeted with the snatches of some familiar tune filtering in through his door. Enticed, Okamoto stepped into the hallway, where he could now clearly make out the sounds of Japanese vocals. He followed the trailing music to the door from which it emanated. After a moment’s hesitation, Okamoto knocked on the door. A friendly Japanese face appeared in the entryway. It was a man who looked to be in his late thirties or early forties. Okamato told the stranger that the Japanese music had brought him over, and asked if he could join the man for some time to listen to the music and placate his loneliness. The man assented. Inside, Okamoto sat cross-legged on the hotel room floor while the two engaged in pleasant conversation. His new host explained that he was a photographer who had spent some time in Lebanon and other Arab countries. Okamoto was interested to hear about this, and happily offered some information about himself in return. Okamoto’s interloper listened to his tale, the man’s reactions shifting from bemusement to worry as the story continued. Okamoto told the man about himself: how he was studying agriculture at Kumamoto University, but that he had been called to the Middle East to “to do something big.”Just what this could be, Okamoto could not say, but it would all be for the purpose of world revolution and the defeat of the global imperialists. He hoped to etch his name in the annals of the heroic Japanese, and was expecting to soon be “called to the front.” The photographer had become quite concerned about this young man, and the two began a quiet debate over the value and efficacy of violent revolution. Despite the young man’s seeming naivete, his zeal could not be diluted by the older man’s attempts at reason. Despairing of convincing him of the danger of pushing for revolution in the Middle East by himself, the photographer gave Okamoto a book on Arab culture to at least help him better understand the land and people around him. Then the two bid each other good night. Two days later, the photographer found a note on his door from Okamoto saying that the latter had suddenly been called away, and entreating the photographer not to reveal any of what had been confided. The photographer furrowed his brow, but decided to do as Okamoto had asked. After all, how much trouble could a young Japanese man really get up to in the complex world of the Levant? Soon, when the world resounded with the news of the three Japanese terrorists — armed with machine guns and grenades — who had brutally murdered 26 people in cold blood and injured 80 others at a Tel Aviv airport, the photographer would come to regret his inaction. By the time he reported his interaction with Okamoto Kozo to the authorities, it was already too late to stop one of the most shocking terrorist attacks of its day. Shigenobu Fusako arrived in Lebanon in early 1971, about a year before Okamoto Kozo. A devoted and longtime member of the notoriously violent far-left student group known as the Red Army Faction, she had come to the Middle East fleeing the stagnant atmosphere of the Japanese activist scene following intensified police surveillance meant to prevent destructive political operations — steps which the Japanese police force had taken in part as a reaction to the headline-grabbing actions of the organization to which Shigenobu belonged. Coming to Lebanon fulfilled a variety of goals for Shigenobu. The country represented a safe haven where she and the comrades that would soon join her could train and prepare for revolutionary action, far from the reach of the Japanese police. Better yet, she had made contact with a bona fide revolutionary guerrilla group, the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine, which had offered to provide her cohort with training and to supply them with weaponry they would have been unable to obtain in Japan. All three were prepared to die. Perhaps it should be said that they very much planned to die. Best of all, being in Lebanon and working with the PFLP meant that Shigenobu’s Red Army would be able to take part in real internationalized struggle in a location that had become a global flashpoint. In her mind, the provincial student protests she had left behind in Japan were a fool’s game. The true armed struggle for revolution against imperialism could only be fought in places like Cuba, Vietnam, and Palestine. Shigenobu was soon joined in Beirut by her husband, Okudaira Tsuyoshi, another prolific member of the Red Army. Though both were filled with the same sense of internationalist revolutionary conviction, their marriage was only paper-thin. Shigenobu had suggested the union with Okudaira so that she could take his name, thus obscuring her identity from the Japanese authorities as she made her plans to leave Japan. Once the two were re-united in Lebanon, they were spirited away by PFLP guerillas, disappearing from Lebanese police surveillance and the knowledge of the Japanese embassy. The two were taken to training camps and hideouts in the Syrian-controlled Beqaa Valley, a base from which they could begin to prepare for the terrorist actions that would soon make the Japanese Red Army feared worldwide. Okamoto would be among the first of their recruits. He would be far from their last. Although Shigenobu Fusako would mastermind or be involved in a dramatic series of terroristic actions which would claim dozens of innocent lives, there was nothing about her upbringing or characteristics that seem particularly cruel. Rather, it was her idealism, her strong sense of justice, and the era in which she grew up that seems to have lead her down the pathway to a sort of infamy in modern Japanese society reserved only for the likes of such terrorists as the messianic cult leader Asahara Shoko. Shigenobu Fusako (重信房子) was born on September 28th, 1945, mere weeks after the unconditional surrender of her home country of Japan to the allied forces in World War II. She grew up in a US-occupied Tokyo that had been devastated both structurally and economically by the war. The Japanese society of her youth was seeing cultural shifts unlike anything since the opening of Japan and the Meiji Restoration that had occurred nearly a century earlier. Shigenobu’s father, Sueo, had been a die-hard ultranationalist and a party to the League of Blood Incident (血盟団事件), a mass assassination plot by the iconoclastic Nichiren-Buddhist monk Inoue Nissho against Japanese captains of industry whose greed was seen to sully the honor of the emperor. The young Sueo was excluded from the actual execution of the plot in 1932 (which saw the successful assassination of the former Finance Minister and the Director-General of the powerful Mitsui Holding Company), and thus avoided jail time. He would go on to serve during wartime as a member of the dreaded Kempeitai (憲兵隊), the military police known for strictly enforcing nationalistic thought in all the territories of the Japanese Empire. For a man such as Sueo, whose entire identity revolved around the ideology of the virtue of emperor-centric nationalism, the Japanese defeat in WWII came as a great shock — one from which he never fully recovered. After his discharge from the disbanded imperial military, Shigenobu Sueo became the owner of an eatery of intermittent success (which, of course, he named “The Rising Sun”). His daughter, Fusako, grew up in his shadow in an often-impoverished home. Although Fusako’s eventual far-left politics could not have been farther removed from the far-right bent of her own father, Sueo was still a strange sort of inspiration for her. Although embittered and highly temperamental, her father’s dedication to his ideals — which included helping the poor and defending the inhabitants of Japan (a definition which extended to local Koreans, who he alone allowed to eat at his store out of all the neighborhood eateries) — greatly influenced Fusako. She continued to admire him even as her revolutionary path took her away from the Japan he loved so well. Indeed, one statement of her father’s that Fusako would recall years later seems to succinctly represent the philosophy she inherited from him: “A person’s nobility is determined by his convictions, and he must not be judged either by his authority, knowledge, or ability…A person gains values by being faithful to his convictions.” The conviction Fusako seems to have held the longest is a detestation of poverty and the systems that produce it. An ardent student, she put incredible work into her schooling despite intense feelings of being on the receiving end of prejudice by classmates and teachers for her family’s limited means. Poverty galled Fusako, whether it be her own or that of the disfigured and homeless veterans which filled the alleyways of the Tokyo of her childhood, She would often give her hard-saved change to these beggars, soldiers that society had cheered on their way to war and then pointedly ignored when then returned in defeat. Someone even noticed her charitable actions, and wrote an article about Fusako that was published across Japan. Hundreds of admirers sent her letters to tell her of what an inspiration she was. However, her whole world seemed to come crashing down when she realized that her altruism and good grades lacked all meaning when her parents had not the money to send her to university (now the dreamed-of destination for aspiring students country-wide following educational reforms instituted by the occupation government). It seemed that poverty simply could not be overcome in her society; even one that had recently enshrined a bevy of new freedoms in its new democratic constitution. Fusako took a job at Kikkoman Soy Sauce straight out of high school because it offered a fairly good salary, but soon found herself unfulfilled — the meaningless chatter of her co-workers frustrated her to no end, as did the sexist nature of the workplace, where women were hired based on attractiveness and expected to serve the male employees tea with a smile. Other women would complain of their treatment, but given the chance to challenge the patriarchal system that surrounded them, they would simply demure. Why were none of these people willing to stand up for their beliefs, Fusako wondered? Deciding she needed to continue her education to live a worthwhile life, she started putting herself through night school. The moment of her radicalization now showed itself — when she arrived at Meiji University to pay her dues, she was impressed by a group of students outside the gate who were protesting a planned tuition raise and the expulsion of a member of a radical group from the college. Moved by the ideological fervor of the protesters, she was soon sitting amongst them. Before long, Fusako was firmly enmeshed in the booming student movements of the mid-60s, rallying against draconian security laws, the presence of American military based in Japan, the tacit Japanese support of the then-nascent American war in Vietnam, the red purges being carried out in Japanese universities, and the general injustices of the era that were seeing students take to the streets around the world. These heady ideas filled her days, and organized action soon followed. Fusako left her job at Kikkoman, deciding to work just enough part-time to sustain her political activities and studies. She found that she was good with people; her winning smile, attractive personality and appearance, and strong convictions made her perfect for jobs that involved person-to-person outreach. Sometimes these jobs consisted of canvasing for leftist political candidates; sometimes she worked as a hostess at a nightclub, chatting and flirting with drunken salarymen. (Her concerned mama-san once recommended she find a husband and leave the activist lifestyle — Shigenobu gave an earnest reply of “the Revolution is my lover.”) Later, as a member of the Red Army Faction, she served as the perfect frontman, securing leases for hideout apartments without attracting the least bit of suspicion. Yet Fusako was far from merely a useful human relations specialist. Always willing to jump into the fray, she helped lead the rear guard of a mass demonstration designed to forestall Prime Minister Sato’s journey to the US to visit President Eisenhower (seen as a further tacit connection between army-less Japan and the American war in Vietnam). Thousands of students rushed in formation towards Haneda Airport, felling the kidotai riot police that lay in wait for them using wooden staves. Shigenobu remembered the rush of running past her fellows as they toppled the heavily-armored officers, only to find the student formation surrounded and hemmed in. As blows from police batons fell upon the heads of her comrades and blood spurted from their wounds, she saw her movement crumbling under the violence of what she perceived as capitalist state oppression. Shigenobu found herself drawn more and more to the radicalism of the student New Left movement and away from the centrism of the established Japanese Communist Party. Eventually, her quest for a group that was more willing to take direct action to fight against imperialist injustice lead her to Shiomi Takaya and his Red Army Faction organization. Shiomi was a Trotskyite, and firmly believed in the idea of violent internationalist revolution against imperialism that was to be carried out simultaneously worldwide. Shigenobu was highly attracted to Shiomi’s ideas (and also found herself attracted to one of his disciples, Takamaro Tamiya, a zealous activist from Osaka City College with whom she started a relationship). Shiomi, for his part, would later remember Fusako as highly driven, charismatic, and especially talented at attracting donations and new recruits to his organization. To Israel and the West, the JRA and its leader, Shigenobu Fusako, had just becoming notorious terrorists. By this time, the world of the leftist Japanese student movements had devolved into a series of internecine struggles, as the failure of more than a decade of mass demonstrations and the police crackdown on disruptive and destructive activities by activists led to bitter debates. In such a situation, what was the right path to take into the future? Shiomi’s Red Army Faction was itself the product of one such splintering, as his Osaka and Kyoto-based followers broke off from a more moderate parent organization based in Tokyo. The new Red Army Faction called for violent action against the police and all other agents of capitalistic imperialism, although not before becoming involved in literal battles with rival leftist student groups. In July of 1969, Fusako was disturbed to witness her own radical group beat bloody a former comrade associated with another group at Meiji University. When her crew returned to their base at a dental college to celebrate the successful raid only to have their hideout besieged in turn and its members badly beaten or turned to flight, Fusako began to experience a sense of disillusionment with the direction of the movement. Still, she remained in the Red Army Faction, assisting with the collection of funds for operations. The radical group staged a number of attacks on the police, small bombings of neighborhood police boxes, and a series of brazen bank robberies. The police, training their focus on the group and upping their surveillance, managed to arrest over 50 members at a training camp at Diabosatsu Pass in Yamanashi Prefecture, which Fusako had found ill-planned and attempted to stop. Papers detailing a planned attack on the Prime Minister’s residence were found during the police raid of the training camp, and though Fusako had not been present and had thus avoided arrest, the trail led the police to her mentor, Shiomi. Fusako’s boyfriend, Takamaro Tomiya, was lost in short order as well. He masterminded the Red Army Faction’s boldest action in the group’s history, leading a team of seven co-revolutionaries armed with katanas and pipe bombs in the hijacking and diversion of a Japan Airlines flight to North Korea. It was a journey from which he would never return; the North Korean government was not as receptive to their comrades from the Red Army Faction as had been expected, and kept the hijackers in virtual exile within the borders of the country for the purposes of revolutionary “re-education.”Takamaro would die in 1995 under mysterious circumstances, still in Pyongyang a quarter-century after he engineered Japan’s first airline hijacking incident. Fusako was left emotionally alone in a Japan where the movement she had come to care so much about simply seemed to be falling apart. Worse, de-facto leadership of the Red Army Faction seemed to be slipping into the hands of one Mori Tsuneo, a man whom Fusako detested. To Fusako, Mori’s myopic focus on underground tactics aimed solely for use in Japan seemed to betray the internationalist ideals for which she had joined the group in the first place. Casting about for a way to continue the battle for world communist revolution in a more meaningful way, Fusako remembered the Palestinians activists who had once visited Japan and whom she had helped ferry around Japanese university campuses. Following the Six Day War in 1967, which had seen the complete defeat of the assembled Arab armies by Israel, the Palestinians had begun to take matters into their own hands, waging a series of terrorist attacks and hijackings. If she could make contact with these Palestinian guerrillas, her movement might still be able to achieve an internationalist future, far away from the Japanese police state and the collapse of her native student movement. Pressuring Mori into allowing her to leave for the Palestinian guerrilla training camps in Lebanon while still marinating the Red Army label, Shigenobu — under her new married name, Okudaira — boarded a plane for foreign shores. She left behind the Red Army Faction as it existed in Japan, and just in time — only months later, Mori would merge the harried group with another violent student organization to form the United Red Army. It would soon implode during a horrific purge involving the lynching of fourteen of its own members (including Fusako’s best friend, Toyama Mieko), five survivors of which would then engage in a dramatic and doomed standoff against thousands of police while holed up in a distant mountain lodge. She had escaped the astoundingly brutal implosion of the Red Army Faction, the intense public notoriety of which signaled the death knell of the student movement in Japan. In its place, in faraway Lebanon, Shigenobu would craft her own ideal internationalist revolutionary organization: the Nihon Sekigun (日本赤軍), the Japanese Red Army. Before he was called out to Lebanon for what would become the prologue to the terroristic massacre which would make him infamous, Okamoto Kozo could hardly have been called a true member of the Red Army. A student at a local university in southern, rural Kumamoto, Okamoto had failed to get into a university large enough to have a Red Army chapter. His two older brothers, both students at the prestigious and famously leftist Kyoto University, were another story. Both had become heavily involved in the student movement, and Takeshi, the second brother, had even gone on to participate in the hijacking of the JAL flight to North Korea as part of the Red Army Faction. Kozo deeply admired his brothers, but at such an academic backwater, he had few chances to emulate them. Unable to attend the student meetings where the intricacies of Marxist, Maoist, or Trotskyite doctrine could be discussed in depth, Okamoto’s ideological views lacked the concise knowledge and thought of people like Shigenobu Fusako or Shiomi Takaya. He had a general desire to act to protect humanity from itself, with a special focus on the evils of corporate pollution, which Okamoto linked with imperialism and capitalism. He would attend protests against American military adventurism with fellow students from Kumamoto, but found such exercises to be little more than “masturbation.” This all explains why Okamato jumped at the chance to assist the Red Army the few times they called upon him. The only real chance he had to do so while still in Japan came in the Fall of 1971, around a year after his brother disappeared with the other Red Army hijackers to Korea. The Red Army Faction, who knew of him only via his connection to his brother Takeshi, contacted him with a request to book a room at his university for the showing of their new propaganda film, “Declaration of World War by the Red Army and the PFLP.”(赤軍・PFLP: 世界戦争宣言). He happily did as was requested of him and met with the Red Army Faction delegation that subsequently arrived to screen the film. With them was one Palestinian, a member of the PFLP, whom Okamoto helped show around. His first tenuous connection to the Palestinian cause had been made. The meeting further inspired Okamoto towards finding a path to become a true revolutionary. His chance would arrive soon — in September, a letter came in from the Red Army that informed Okamoto that he would have a chance for military training and to even potentially meet his brother Takeshi again, provided he went to Beirut. Okamoto jumped at the idea (although the implication of a reunion with his brother was likely a lie to entice Okamoto: Takeshi would remain in virtual exile in North Korea for the rest of his life). For some months, Okamoto waited for word that it was time for his departure. Suddenly, things began to move very quickly. The United Red Army standoff at the Asama Sano Lodge had just been watched with horror by a huge percentage of the Japanese population; the days of the Red Army in Japan were numbered. Okamoto was spirited out of Japan just before the bodies of the lynched Red Army members were uncovered in their shallow frozen graves in Gunma. It was 10pm on May 30th, 1972, and the Air France flight from Rome had just arrived to the Israeli city of Tel Aviv. On board had been some Israelis making their way back home from their stays abroad, including the beloved Aharon Katzir, a world-renowned biochemist who hosted a popular radio show and who was an expected candidate for the Israeli presidency. The bulk of the plane seats had been occupied by 120 Baptist and Pentecostal pilgrims hailing from Puerto Rico making the long journey to the Holy Land to walk in the footsteps of their savior. Also among the passengers were a Canadian citizen, and three travelers who hailed from the far-off country of Japan. Suddenly, the murmuring of the crowds was replaced by the ear-shattering firing of three assault rifles. The words of the assembled arrivals changed to screams. Okamamoto Kozo, Shigenobu Fusako’s paper husband Okudaira Tsuyoshi, and a young student named Yasuda Yasuyuki had been waiting for this moment for some time. Here was where their harsh training in the Beqaa Valley would all pay off. All three were prepared to die. Or perhaps it should be said that they very much planned to die. The three bore passports with fake names and birthdates, all chosen with symbolic meanings. Okamoto’s false name had been taken from a would-be assassin of Emperor Hirohito who had been executed before the war. Kozo entered a bathroom in the baggage carousel area, where he ripped out his photo from his fake passport to deter easy identification. His mind turned to Mishima Yukio, the far-right author of international acclaim who only two years earlier had committed seppuku following a failed coup attempt. While Okamoto and Mishima’s politics could not have been farther apart, the young man still idolized the author’s willingness to die for his beliefs. He hoped he would soon be remembered in the same breath as Mishima. Exiting the bathroom, the three men walked amongst the Puerto Rican pilgrims wending their way to the baggage carousel to retrieve their bags. Amidst them was excited chatter, the recent arrivals speaking in Spanish, English, and Hebrew, discussing the various plans that lay ahead of them in the State of Israel. Suddenly, the murmuring of the crowds was replaced by the ear-shattering firing of three assault rifles. The words of the assembled arrivals changed to screams. Okamoto, Okudaira, and Yasuda had removed Czech vz. 58 rifles and grenades from their luggage, and had begun to fire at random into the crowds assembled around the conveyor belts. They only stopped firing when their magazines were emptied, throwing grenades as they switched cartridges. Within a minute, dozens of humans lay bleeding or dying as bullets and shrapnel careened into flesh. Screaming people ran, trying to find cover wherever possible. In the chaos, Yasuda accidently took a bullet from one of his two comrades. Okudaira ran over to the opening of the baggage carousel and began firing at planes on the tarmac. A sudden explosion blasted him backwards; one of his own grenades had killed him. Surviving victims differ as to whether he had purposefully taken the blast, or whether it had been an accident. Israeli police were now firing back at Okamoto, the only surviving member of the terrorist crew. He took a bullet, but still returned fire until his ammunition ran out, and then fled from the passenger area back onto the tarmac. Spotting a parked plane, he threw his remaining grenades at it, hoping to destroy it; when this failed, he ran further, hoping to find another target, and to find a police officer or soldier who would kill him so that he could join his comrades. His dreams of glorious death would not be achieved. An employee of the Israeli flag carrier airline, El Al, ran towards Okamoto and tackled him to the ground, restraining him. Soon he was swarmed by Israeli security, who put him in handcuffs and placed him under arrest. As they dragged him away, he begged them to kill him. Ambulances arrived at the scene, rushing to carrying away the wounded to give them much needed emergency triage. In the end, the attack had killed 24 people, the vast majority of them civilians. Another eighty people had been injured, many of them seriously. The attack had been made with the intention of killing Israelis, but seventeen of the twenty-four murdered had been Puerto Rican pilgrims. Among the eight Israeli dead was Aharon Katzir, whose loss would be keenly felt in both Israel and the scientific world. A single Canadian citizen had also been murdered. The Lod Airport Massacre (テルアビブ空港乱射事件), as the event has now become known, sent shockwaves around Israel and the entire world. That such a gruesome event had been carried out by three young Japanese men was mystifying to the world at large and humiliating to the Japanese government. The Red Army Faction and the United Red Army had both incensed and shocked Japan before, but those had been mostly domestic issues; now, the Japanese Red Army had introduced the idea of Japanese terrorism to the world. When Okamoto Kozo’s father heard that his son had been identified as the surviving perpetuator of such a horrific massacre, and that a second son of his had shamed Japan on the world stage, he immediately wrote the Israeli government, stating, [I am] indescribably appalled, angered and saddened…for forty years I thought I had devoted myself faithfully to the education of our young people. Please punish my son with the death sentence without delay. Okamoto Kozo agreed with his father’s request. Indeed, such was Okamoto’s desire to join his comrades in glorious death that he only assented to providing his Israeli interrogators with information about the planning and motivation for their terrorist action once Major General Rehavam Zeevi promised to give him a gun with a loaded bullet with which to commit suicide. Later, at his trial, Okamoto was to actively flout his own defense in the pursuit of the death penalty for himself. Okamoto would insist the following to the three lieutenant colonels who sat on the bench of the Israeli court which tried him: When I was a child, I was told that when people died they became stars. We three Red Army soldiers wanted to become Orion when we died. And it calms my heart to think that all the people we killed will also become stars in the same heavens. As the revolution goes on, how the stars will multiply! The Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine hailed the Lod Airport Massacre as great success, and Okamoto and his dead comrades had become heroes. The likes of the Foreign Minister of Egypt and the infamous strongman leader of Libya, Muammar Gaddafi, praised the Japanese revolutionaries and took inspiration from their actions (Gaddafi was so impressed that he would soon become a patron of the JRA, and allow them to use his country as a safe haven). Some Palestinian babies born shortly after the attack were even given the names of the martyred Japanese attackers, who had just become heroes in the eyes of the Palestinian movement. To Israel and the West, the JRA and its leader, Shigenobu Fusako, had just becoming notorious terrorists. Israeli Prime Minister Golda Meir expressed great sorrow at the event, placing blame at the feet of Arab countries whom she believed relished in the deaths of innocents in Israel. However, she announced that she did not hold Japan or the Japanese people responsible for what had happened at Lod. The Japanese government, for its part, sent envoys to the Israeli government and to Puerto Rico, had officials visit the surviving victims, and donated millions of dollars to support the recovery of those who had been wounded in the attack. In Puerto Rico there was widespread mourning, with the backlash becoming so great that the Japanese embassy suggested that Japanese nationals leave the territory. The pain of the loss of the seventeen pilgrims remains keenly felt, and in 2006 the Puerto Rican government named May 30th “Lod Remembrance Day.” And yet the JRA’s reign of terror had only begun. While they would never engage in the same degree of sheer indiscriminate bloodshed again, the Lod Airport Massacre simply initiated a period that would last for almost two decades, in which the JRA become one of the world’s most infamous terrorist groups.

Medium.com,Society,How to Win the A.I. Arms Race,World,https://onezero.medium.com/does-china-have-a-structural-advantage-in-the-scientific-race-for-artificial-intelligence-ai-3002b786e087?source=topic_page---------649------------------1," xperts agree that we’re headed toward a future where global leadership in artificial intelligence will translate into economic and military dominance. Unfortunately, authoritarian regimes, such as China, have inherent advantages in research and development. The training of A.I. systems requires data — lots of it. Big data is the oil of the Digital Age and whoever has the most of it — at the highest quality and at the lowest cost — will have a comparative advantage. Assembling and using big data sets in developed countries, however, can be complicated, for privacy and legal reasons. For example, the European Union is considering rules giving each individual the right to control how their facial data can be used in facial recognition technology — which will (probably) slow development. Meanwhile, China is developing its facial recognition software on an unimpeded basis, using a big data set developed from the pictures on hundreds of millions of government-issued ID cards — probably the world’s largest facial ID data set, since everyone in China over the age of 16 must have an ID card. Researchers use health data sets to train A.I. to predict kidney failure, breast cancer, or other health issues. Privacy concerns will almost certainly slow down this research in the developed world. Do you want Google to know if you’re at higher risk of developing cancer? What would Google do with that information, and to whom might it be sold? By contrast, an authoritarian regime such as China isn’t going to be slowed down by human rights and privacy concerns when assembling big data sets in health, language, facial recognition, or anything else. Furthermore, A.I. datasets assembled by private companies in developed countries will likely be treated as proprietary. Assume a U.S.-based A.I. firm successfully builds (at great expense) a data set useful for predicting kidney problems and trains its A.I. to accurately predict kidney failure. The firm will have no monetary incentive to make that proprietary data set available to other firms. But an authoritarian regime could treat data sets as a national resource, to be shared among researchers and entrepreneurs, as directed by the government. As the world’s largest country, by GDP size (on a purchasing power parity basis) and population (about 1.4 billion people), China has a lot of resources. Already, futurist Amy Webb has identified three Chinese corporations among the nine leading the charge into A.I. — the rest are from the United States. And according to research done by the Allen Institute for Artificial Intelligence, China is nearly equal to (and may soon exceed) the United States for quality and quantity of academic A.I. papers. Historically, authoritarian regimes haven’t done well with cutting edge technologies. The United States is currently in a strong position in A.I. and China faces its own unique challenges. In developing A.I., or any technology, retaining and recruiting talent is key. It’s estimated that about 50% of China’s millionaires want to permanently leave China. An even greater weakness is that many of China’s rising generation of scientists also want to leave. In a recent survey, 87% of Chinese students studying in the United States for a PhD said they want to stay after graduation (and, it’s not clear the other 13% intend to return to China). While this might reflect some selection bias since students who wanted out of China are more likely to study in the United States, it does suggest that China is at a disadvantage in the competition for talent. The recent protests in Hong Kong have arguably only increased Chinese researchers’ concerns about freedom of speech and thought. Historically, authoritarian regimes haven’t done well with cutting edge technologies. Researchers usually prefer an atmosphere of political and academic freedom, and dictatorships are bad at resource allocation. Communist Russia lost the technological Cold War and the race to the moon. During World War II, the United States won the race to develop the atomic bomb, and Nazi Germany lost. On the other hand, China seems to have mastered (so far) the art of being an authoritarian regime that fosters technological innovation. It is time for the United States, and its allies, to take seriously a Cold War type technology race around A.I. — perhaps investing in creating shared big data sets, or perhaps investing in recruiting the world’s top A.I. scientists. The West won the original Cold War, with a lot of imported scientific talent. So, for example, if top Chinese A.I. researchers want to come to the United States, they should be made welcome. We have a lot of work to do, but it’s imperative for democracies to retain, and preferably grow, their comparative advantage in A.I. — the alternative would be a world dominated by A.I.-enabled authoritarian states."
Medium.com,Society,Prorogation: What’s next?,World,https://medium.com/326uk/prorogation-whats-next-15529dba482b?source=topic_page---------650------------------1," Just one week after returning from the summer recess MPs and peers were sent home again until 14th October (with the exception of a brief return under the Northern Ireland [Executive Formation] Act). The government has prorogued parliament, the mechanism through which one parliamentary session comes to an end and a new one begins with a Queen’s Speech. Supporters of the decision argue that it is an opportunity to allow the new government to set out its agenda and that it is nothing out of the ordinary to start a new parliamentary session given that the current one has run since 2017. Nonetheless, a prorogation of 34 days is exceptionally long. In the last four decades prorogation has not exceeded three weeks and usually lasts for a week or less. Those against prorogation took legal action in Belfast, Edinburgh and London. Whilst the High Court in England court ruled in favour of the government, the Court of Session in Edinburgh was scathing in its condemnation of the prime minister’s advice to the Queen and his motivation behind the prorogation. In ordinary circumstances such a rebuke would result in the prime minister’s resignation. Whilst a judgment has not be reached in Belfast, the other two cases will be appealed and potentially heard together in the supreme court. If the supreme court rules in the government’s favour, now that an alliance between Labour, the SNP, the Lib Dems and Plaid Cymru has twice defeated the government’s attempts to call an early election the options available to them are limited. He could continue his current policy of attempting to renegotiate the deal or at least continue to present himself as doing so in public up until 31st October. It was doing the latter that resulted in Amber Rudd resigning as work and pensions secretary. Indeed one member of the European Parliament’s Brexit Steering Group described Mr Johnson’s public pronouncements about negotiations as “window dressing”. In a press conference on Monday after meeting Mr Johnson for the first time the Taoiseach, Leo Varadkar, stated that whilst some progress had been made the UK government had not provided any viable alternative to the backstop. Mr Varadkar argued that an agreement before 31st October would be a “herculean task” for the UK Government. For all of Mr Johnson’s past ramping up of no-deal he sounded unusually keen in Dublin to negotiate at the European Council meeting on 17th October. The current speculation about changing the backstop to cover only Northern Ireland rather than the whole UK is unlikely to amount to a deal that can pass through the Commons. The DUP have opposed this concept from the beginning when it was first proposed by the European Commission. Making such an amendment to the Withdrawal Agreement viable would require a significant change in the parliamentary arithmetic after an election or a government U-turn on a People’s Vote. On 31st October Johnson gets into both political and legal deep water. From a political perspective he has staked his entire premiership on delivering Brexit by 31st October with or without a deal, “do or die”. He has declared that “I’d rather be dead in a ditch” than request an extension to Article 50 and repeated his intentions on Monday despite the Commons earlier passing a motion demanding that the government respect the rule of law. Stepping down from such a position would undermine his credibility amongst the European Research Group that was critical in unseating Theresa May. It would also damage his appeal as the leader with the potential to wipe out the Brexit party in a general election. Regardless of his political concerns, legally the prime minister has no choice in the matter. Under the European Union (Withdrawal) (No. 6) Act he is obliged to write to Brussels and request an extension. Much to the alarm of the Criminal Bar Association, Michael Gove and Sajid Javid have both suggested that the government might simply refuse to do so. The former attorney general, Dominic Grieve, stated that this would in all likelihood result in a court case and a potential prison sentence for the prime minister. Lord Sumption, a former supreme court justice, condemned the suggestion that the government could send a letter requesting an extension followed by another one cancelling it. Finally, he could try to save face by balancing both of these political and legal considerations by resigning without extending Article 50 in order to force the opposition to act. Opposition parties would have to scramble in order to form a government that could then ask for an extension. The Liberal Democrats and the Independent Group for Change would have reservations about supporting Jeremy Corbyn as prime minister because of his handling of anti-Semitism within Labour and dubious record on national security issues. It is becoming increasingly clear that a snap general election will take place but these remain uncertain times. A resolution for Brexit is far from sight."

It also came back. The “Eritrea” was a military vessel, launched in 1937, conceived for long range operations in the Italian colonies (it was classified as “colonial ship”). Displacing 2100 tons, it was armed with two twin 120mm gun mountings and was capable of a maximum speed of 19 knots. When the war broke out it was stationed in the harbour of Massaua in Italian East Africa together with other light units, notably the “Leone” and “Nazario Sauro” class destroyers. In February 1941 the situation in East Africa was dire for the Italians: isolated from the motherland, the land forces had been progressively depleted and the few ships available were bombed in port by British planes."
Medium.com,Society,Brexit influence campaign: #BritainIndependence,World,https://medium.com/@northsj/brexit-influence-campaign-britainindependence-9a7631e9bae4?source=topic_page---------653------------------1," The atmosphere in Britain is becoming increasingly heated as October 31st inches ever closer. This is the date when the country will leave the European Union — if all goes to plan for Boris Johnson and the Conservative Party. Right now the political stakes are higher than ever. Parliament has tried to protect the country from the potential catastrophe that may result from leaving without a deal. In the nick of time before prorogation, they passed a last-minute bill into law, designed to compel Johnson to seek an extension, if he can’t reach a suitable deal with the EU by the end of October. Johnson has already lost multiple times in Parliament, despite his efforts to prorogue it for an unusually long time. Last week, a Scottish court ruled that this prorogation was unlawful. This week, the case goes to the English Supreme Court, where it will be challenged. In this highly-charged environment, Twitter has provided a constant source of lively political debate around Brexit. Many issues are bubbling up at present, some more relevant than others, but here I want to explore a particularly interesting hashtag. #BritainIndependence has been popping up a lot lately. The first thing to do is to find out when it was first used, and who first used it. The hashtag came fairly late to the game, on September 9, via a user called ‘Trevor’, whose screen name is stuffed with pro-Brexit hashtags. A quick glance at Trevor’s bio is revealing. First, his bio is a strong indicator of his self-professed identity on Twitter. It contains a lot of words that reflect traditional conservative, nationalist, family-oriented values, such as ‘Christian’, ‘white’, ‘loyal British subject’, and ‘married’. This creates a sense of group identity, designed to give Trevor’s profile immediate appeal to others who identify with similar values – i.e. signalling that he is part of an ingroup. In this case, the ingroup is pro-Brexit Twitter users. The references to popular British football teams (Arsenal and Rangers), is likely designed to portray the account as belonging to a genuine working-class British citizen – another effort at signalling ingroup identity. But the cultural references feel jumbled: Arsenal is an English team, while Rangers is a Scottish team. That plus the random mention of Northern Ireland means this bio doesn’t quite ring true. In fact, it feels like someone playing at being a Brit, perhaps for nefarious reasons. What’s more, ‘neighbor’ is spelled in US English. No genuine speaker of British English would use US spelling; especially a man who seems so deeply committed to British patriotism. Clue, ‘Trevor’ is likely not the grassroots British man that he pretends to be. We could dig much deeper into ‘Trevor’s’ account, especially his past tweet history. His account is devoted to tweeting about Brexit, even though it was created in September 2015, before Brexit existed. It would be interesting to see what ‘Trevor’ was tweeting about between then and June 2016, but that’s a topic for another post... Next up, let’s take a look at how Twitter users have been interacting with the #BritainIndependence hashtag, since ‘Trevor’ coined it on September 9th (coincidentally, just in time for the prorogation of Parliament). All of the most retweeted tweets on the #BritainIndependence hashtag come from users with heavily pro-Brexit screen names (and usernames like @Brexit4me and @Feck_the_EU), suggesting one-topic accounts that exist simply for the purpose of engaging with Brexit-related discussions. Retweets have two main functions, 1) they spread a message across Twitter, 2) they create validation for the message via social proof (i.e. if other people have engaged with this tweet, then it must be worth engaging with). Liking (or favouriting) tweets reinforces the sense of social proof, while also increasing the likelihood of the tweet being seen in other users’ feeds. The below tweets contain strong evidence of typical adversarial narratives, designed to promote a sense of tribalism, i.e. “us vs them”. Examples include: Clearly, the #BritainIndependence hashtag exists to stoke further divides between the two sides in the Brexit debate, while creating the illusion of widespread support for the pro-Leave side. It’s highly likely that the hashtag was initialised for that very purpose, as the nature of ‘Trevor’s’ account suggests. Furthermore, it’s telling that this hashtag coincides with several significant real-life events in the Brexit timeline that could threaten the pro-Brexit side, including the beginning of (unlawful) prorogation and the case going to the Supreme Court. But why are so many of the top posting accounts so similar, with their bios stuffed with tribal keywords ? And why are so many of them blatantly US-centric, or with such obvious cultural errors (such as the spelling of ‘favorite’)? This could indicate an organised social media manipulation campaign aiming to astroturfing support for the pro-Brexit side and create even deeper social and political division at these critical junctures for Britain. As the key Brexit date of October 31 inches closer, the discussion is certain to get even more heated – and we’re sure to see lots of interesting social media activity. I’ll post further analyses here between now and October 31st."
Medium.com,Society,Solar Energy is in Crisis,World,https://medium.com/discourse/solar-energy-is-in-crisis-56cd65f5456c?source=topic_page---------654------------------1," EU rules, kicking in next October, are set to force governments to increase duties on solar panel installations, further crippling an industry which has taken hit after hit in the past few years. Do governments feel that there are better energy alternatives, or is this the beginning of the end for hopes of limiting global warming? From 2015 to 2018, installations in the UK fell by 75%, despite a stronger economy and growing awareness of climate issues. Why? The government phased out subsidies for selling energy back to the National Grid, leading to homeowners estimating the cost to be too high — despite evidence to the contrary. To make things even worse, a mis-selling scandal across the world has left consumers feeling understandably concerned about the prospect of solar energy. It’s no surprise that they’re continuing to opt for purchasing energy, but it is, potentially, a huge problem. First, there’s Trump. He definitely wants to go back on a decade of good energy policy, in pursuit of a brighter future powered by, in the words of the man himself, “beautiful, clean coal”. Thankfully, that same problem doesn’t exist in Europe. We could do without the nutter currently acting as Prime Minister of the UK, but the problem here isn’t so great. EU heads of state are hugely enthusiastic about climate action, so those within the EU itself are too — right? As it turns out, not right. The latest round of regulations, which have made me somewhat thankful for Brexit in a weird sort of way, are, in typical EU fashion, protectionist, pointless, and actively stifling to progress. The UK was one of the last remaining EU countries to have a tax rate of 5% on solar panel installations, but the ruling from the European Commission that the UK must bring its duties to the same level as the rest of the EU, 20%, will destroy government policy entirely on solar panels. What, then, is the problem for EU chiefs? EU policy has been generally positive on climate change for years, so this seems a little unusual. Surely the sensible policy would be to bring all other EU member states’ tax rates down on solar panel installations, to make them more affordable. When you’re deciding whether to shell out thousands on solar panels, £10,000 might tempt you, but £12,000 looks much less attractive. Government inaction on climate change is one thing, but actively going in the wrong direction is unforgivable. The UK Government isn’t without blame, but the EU must consider its policy more carefully in the future, else the climate emergency might become a climate catastrophe."

Medium.com,Society,"In Turkey, Mothers’ Quest For Justice Exposes Political Hypocrisy",World,https://medium.com/@abyasun/in-turkey-mothers-quest-for-justice-exposes-political-hypocrisy-e3e58411962c?source=topic_page---------656------------------1," In Diyarbakir, the heartland of Turkey’s restive Kurdish population, a group of mothers’ weekslong sit-in protest in front of the pro-Kurdish party to demand information regarding whereabouts of their sons believed to be captured by the outlawed PKK has generated an ongoing political controversy. It galvanized the public and whipped up remarkable support for the mothers at the national level. The protest in Diyarbakir is, by nature, of an awkward type from numerous angles, but grasping the rationale of choosing the People’s Democracy Party (HDP) as the responsible actor expected to resolve the riddle of mysterious disappearances of several high school students is the most difficult part of any effort to make sense of the entire drama. Why the HDP? Is the party’s regional headquarters in Diyarbakir an office of finding missing persons? Certainly, the issue is more complicated than it seems. Why does a government minister embarrass herself by shedding tears in front of HDP in supposed solidarity with grieving mothers? If the sons of mothers are captured by the PKK, as the government and its media claim, why does an Interior Minister (Suleyman Soylu) visit a sit-in protest instead of doing his job — trying to locate the missing children? Isn’t it his and his government’s responsibility to find them? To shifting the onus on the HDP, just because it shares some ideological, if not completely organizational and structural, roots with the militant group is entirely misleading. Whatever the public perception may be about the HDP regarding its leading role on the political front within the context of the intractable Kurdish question, the party is not the address where mothers, and a large group of Turkish celebrities and media outlets, can vent their outrage and frustration for the lost children. That said, the whole drama playing out in Diyarbakir is less a tragedy than a farce marked by the most naked display of hypocrisy, public manipulation and political grandstanding. There is ample reason to be suspicious and skeptical about the motives of the government in the Diyarbakir chapter. Does the pro-government media tell the truth about what really happened and who was responsible for this scandal? According to a commentator, the government is launching a psychological campaign against the HDP and seeks to associate it with the PKK in the eyes of the public for a possible move to shut down the party in the months to come. The precursors and signs of such an intention have been in place for some time as authorities removed mayors of three Kurdish cities in August, negating the result of a democratic election held in March. The August removals meant the blatant disregard of the people’s will, which manifested itself by electing the mayors they wanted, registering their disapproval of the outside intervention in the democratic process. Following the 2016 coup, the Turkish government dismissed mayors of more than 100 Kurdish-run municipalities. The majority of mayoral posts were regained by the HDP in the March election. But that electoral victory is now being reversed by authorities in a piecemeal fashion. Unlike previous takeovers in 2016, the August move stirred up a public backlash and the opposition coalesced around the HDP this time. The recent government-backed protest in Diyarbakir, some journalists argue, aims to isolate the HDP and divide up that solidarity among the opposition parties. One month ago, the HDP was a victim, now it is presented (by national media) as a villain. In Istanbul, Mothers’ Call For Justice Is Ignored Apart from political implications, there is a moral dimension to the story as well. The most important aspect of the latest solidarity act with Diyarbakir mothers is the government’s undeniable hypocrisy at play. The sudden political fondness and pompous flattery for mothers become all the more self-contradictory and insincere when someone remembers how anti-riot police violently broke up a peaceful protest of Saturday Mothers (in their 70s and 80s) during International Women’s Day this year. Interior Minister Soylu even insulted them with incendiary rhetoric when Saturday Mothers demanded an answer from authorities about their sons missing for decades. But the stark contrast between the government’s dedicated sponsorship of the Diyarbakir protest and its rebuttal of other cases came to public spotlight once again when a group of mothers, whose sons — Air Force Academy cadets — are currently serving life sentences in prison on the charge of involvement in the 2016 coup, gathered in front of Istanbul AKP headquarters. For them, and for many people of conscience, the aggravated life sentences handed to cadets and soldiers who only followed orders on the coup day were nothing other than a miscarriage of justice. The majority of them had nothing to do with the violent episodes of the putsch as they immediately surrendered themselves to police and the pro-government protesters the moment they realized that there was a coup attempt taking place. The mothers’ plight, although not covered by national media, is not unknown to people on social media. Yet their demand for justice is systematically ignored by media and unheeded by authorities. On Monday, the mothers understandably expressed their dismay over the media’s blind spot on their struggle. If authorities are sincere in their display of sympathy to the cause of the mothers in Diyarbakir, the mothers of cadets insist that they deserve audience and media coverage, too. But, from what we observed in the past three years, it can be said that their sustained struggle only has moved attentive people on social media, while the entire mainstream media remained largely indifferent and unmoved. When families went into AKP (the Justice and Development Party) Istanbul headquarters to demand justice for their sons, the official reaction was completely different. At first, police allowed them to protest, but then demanded their leave when media showed interest in their short-lived gathering. In remarks to Ahval, Ayten Gulesci lamented that none of the authorities pay attention to their plea. “Everybody tells us that “We know that your children are innocent,” but nobody does anything. We want them [authorities] to do something.” Mahmure Dereli was no less indignant and resentful. She is upset by the fact that while many generals managed to get lenient sentences, their sons, as if they planned and orchestrated the coup, bore the brunt of the post-coup punishments. At least 259, including three female, cadets have been sentenced to life in prison. The situation of cadets touched the public’s conscience and aroused significant sympathy on many quarters of the political spectrum. Both the main opposition Republican People’s Party (CHP) chairman Kemal Kilicdaroglu and Good (IYI) Party leader Meral Aksener assert that the young cadets and conscripts had no leading role in the coup and they should be released without further delay. Their call resonates across the society, if not among authorities. As more and more people grow attuned to their protest on social media, the governor’s offices in Istanbul and Ankara imposed a protest ban on Tuesday to render their struggle ineffective. Politicized Celebrities and Selective Form of Solidarity If authorities have no scruples in unabashedly double-dealing of two cases, what about the Turkish celebrity community who, at the behest of Ibrahim Kalin, the presidential spokesman, hustled to the HDP office in Diyarbakir? A makeshift coalition of diverse stars, celebrities, artists and musicians seem to be driven less by a shared cause than an acute sense of opportunism and pragmatism in their craving for the approval of a government whose benevolence and good graces are as important and indispensable as their image to be cherished and respected by the public. In his veiled criticism of the folk singer Yavuz Bingol, HDP lawmaker Veli Sacilik insinuated that the gambling debt would make someone (Bingol) do politics. Bingol, a late Erdogan supporter, lost many friends in Turkey’s music industry and on the left after his (commercially-driven) conversion to Erdogan’s fold. He, like many others in the Diyarbakir sit-in protest, has become a regular presence in many events organized and hosted by the Turkish president. The celebrities of the president’s court are loosely connected to each other as many come from very different quarters of the political and social spectrum. The odd nature of their conviviality and gatherings are defined more by personal interests than a fixed ideological affiliation. A panoramic view of the past several years regarding what kind of celebrities attended Erdogan-led social events attests to this fact. If any of those celebrities have the slightest hint of empathy and genuine care, then, as critics reason, they should display it for purge victims and mothers of cadets as well. But it is most unlikely. According to media and the government, they are not worthy of compassion. It has even become a taboo in the society to talk about the plight of KHK people ( who are dismissed by government decrees during the emergency rule). It is a political minefield that any mindful journalist and politician should pay extra attention not to cross, or face the risk of losing their profession as well as freedom. The government has, for its part, done everything possible to choke the space for civil society, which could otherwise have been an effective organizing ground for a lasting and sustained resistance against rights violations both during the emergency rule and in its aftermath. The fight against the indiscriminate purge and post-coup persecution consequentially became a preserve mostly for the victims while the rights groups, exhausted by the government’s unrelenting crackdown, appear impotent and woefully disorganized. What amplifies the burden of purge victims is the breakdown of social fabric after the coup, as fear and mutual mistrust are woven to the physique of the society. To make matters worse, an entrenched political tribalism and clan mindset in matters of compassion leave victims of post-coup repression to their own fate, mostly devoid of outside help and empathy. The story of mothers of cadets is a moving example of this social isolation. They are working hard to make their voices heard by society, by the government and outside world. Only occasionally, some media outlets accord a passing mention to their lonely but righteous cause. In most cases, a persistent media blackout condemn them into oblivion. In conclusion, there is nothing wrong to pay close attention to the plight of Diyarbakir mothers. In fact, the matter about the PKK’s urban machinations to lure, or even forcefully abduct, young Kurds to enlist them for its (sometimes) shrinking mountain cadres is largely gone understudied and it warrants much more comprehensive scrutiny than the cursory attention the media currently accords to the story. But how media deals with the case gives little hope for the conduct of such a wide-ranging inquiry into historical precedents and current contours of the PKK’s urban recruitment strategies. The problem with the Diyarbakir protest, for this reason, is not whether media adequately examines the PKK’s social reach among the disgruntled Kurdish youth or not, but how much authorities politically exploit the matter to advance their interests. In this context, the Diyarbakir protest lays bare the naked contradictions rooted in the government’s different approaches to mothers’ struggles (for their sons) in Istanbul and Diyarbakir. The ruling party’s own political interests to discredit and vilify the pro-Kurdish party made the Diyarbakir mothers’ case amenable to its constituency and the wider public while the Istanbul mothers’ plea was outright dismissed. One cannot fail to ascertain the existence of a double standard by looking nowhere other than Ankara where police blocked the peaceful protest of Melek Cetinkaya whose son — a young cadet — serves a life sentence in jail. Encouraged by the Diyarbakir mothers’ protest, she appeared in Kizilay at the weekend and on Tuesday to demand her son’s release. But anti-riot police did not allow her to display a banner of his son even for a few minutes and abruptly detained her. When she walked away in front of the attentive gaze of cameramen and journalists, she chided current Defense Minister Hulusi Akar (the commander of the Turkish military during the abortive putsch) for his betrayal of cadets, and lashed out at the apparent legal travesty in post-coup trials. Demanding justice for cadets in Turkey’s repressive environment is off-limits. The fact that they had no active involvement in the coup, the fact that they only followed orders and the fact that they were duped by their commanders on the pretext of a military exercise matter little here. By their political and military leaders, the young cadets have been condemned into a sort of protracted death in prison cells. While they serve their time (a life sentence) in jail, their mothers do the same outside."
Medium.com,Society,Saudi Oil Attack Ignites Fears Of US-Iran Conflict,World,https://medium.com/citizen-truth/saudi-oil-attack-ignites-fears-of-us-iran-conflict-84d6d8797f82?source=topic_page---------657------------------1," Devastating drone strikes on Saudi Arabia’s state-run oil facilities on Saturday have spiked global oil prices and ramped up tensions between the United States and Iran, with the former blaming the latter for the attack, a charge the Islamic Republic steadfastly denies. Iranian-supported Houthi rebels in Yemen took credit for the drone strikes, calling them a retaliation for civilian massacres caused by the U.S.-backed Saudi coalition’s attacks on the famine-plagued country. U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, who is en route to Saudi Arabia to discuss the U.S. response, quickly blamed Iran for the strikes, saying there’s “no evidence the attacks came from Yemen”. U.S. officials released satellite photos of the damaged facility they claim prove the attack must have been launched from Iran and Iraq, and argue that Houthis lack sufficient weaponry to carry out such a damaging attack. “Iran has now launched an unprecedented attack on the world’s energy supply,” Pompeo said. President Trump said the U.S. was “locked and loaded” to retaliate against the culprit and “waiting to hear from the Kingdom as to who they believe was the cause of this attack, and under what terms we would proceed,” prompting condemnation from critics at the president’s deference to the totalitarian state. “Saudi Arabia oil supply was attacked,” Trump tweeted on Sunday. “There is reason to believe that we know the culprit, are locked and loaded depending on verification, but are waiting to hear from the Kingdom as to who they believe was the cause of this attack, and under what terms we would proceed!” On Tuesday Vice-President Mike Pence warned, “The United States of America will take whatever action is necessary to defend our country, our troops, and our allies in the Gulf. You can count on it.” Lawmakers like Rep. Tulsi Gabbard, Rep. Ruben Gallego, and Sen. Bernie Sanders mocked Trump’s tweet and response to the oil facility attacks. “You don’t ask Saudi Arabia about how to proceed,” tweeted Rep. Gallego. “You ask Congress. You do not have the authority to attack any other country on behalf of Saudi Arabia without getting permission first from Congress. (FYI the answer will be no)” “Mr. Trump, the Constitution of the United States is perfectly clear,” tweeted Sen. Sanders. “Only Congress — not the president — can declare war. And Congress will not give you the authority to start another disastrous war in the Middle East just because the brutal Saudi dictatorship told you to.” “Trump awaits instructions from his Saudi masters,” tweeted Rep.Tulsi Gabbard. “Having our country act as Saudi Arabia’s bitch is not ‘America First.’” Saudi Arabia’s reputation was damaged by the savage execution of Washington Post journalist Jamal Khashoggi last year. The bipartisan resolution to end U.S. support for the Saudi coalition in Yemen, which was vetoed by Trump, reflects a broad desire to avoid another Middle Eastern war, especially one at the bidding of Saudi Arabia. Still, U.S.-condoned Israeli airstrikes against Iranian-backed forces in Lebanon, Iraq, and Syria have escalated in the last month, providing a plausible motive for Iranian support of the attack on the Saudi oil facility. Middle East Eye quoted an unnamed senior Iraqi intelligence official claiming that the attack was done by Iranian drones launched from Iraq, retaliating against the Saudi-funded Israeli drone strikes. “The latest attack comes for two reasons: another message from Iran to USA and its allies that as long as its siege on Iran continues no one will have stability in the region. However, the second more direct reason is a strong Iranian revenge for the recent Israeli attacks by drones launched from SDF-controlled areas in Syria against pro-Iranian Hashd bases,” the source told Middle East Eye. Iraq denies the claim. Saudi Arabia invited international experts to investigate the attack on Monday. “There are hawks in Iran and America and in the region who want military conflicts,” a senior Iranian government official, who asked not to be named because of the sensitivity of the topic, told Al Jazeera. “Such attacks will make a military confrontation inevitable and that is what hardliners in Iran and elsewhere want. Such confrontation will harm not only Iran but all the countries in the Persian Gulf.” While analysts have praised the recent firing of Iran hawk John Bolton as a significant factor lowering the likelihood of full-fledged U.S.-Iran conflict, it is unclear how many shocks the volatile region can take before conflicts worsen. “Firing war hawks like John Bolton is a step in the right direction, but if the Trump administration is interested in de-escalation, it needs to stop pursuing hawkish policies and pressure campaigns that ultimately force Iran to choose between submission and confrontation,” Pouya Alimagham, a historian of the modern Middle East at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT), told Al Jazeera. “After all, it is not hard to imagine what path a nation with a modern history of resistance to western intervention would take under such circumstances.” Read the original article and sign up for our newsletter at https://citizentruth.org"
Medium.com,Society,UN General Assembly: The Four Key Global Issues to Watch For,World,https://medium.com/citizen-truth/un-general-assembly-the-four-key-global-issues-to-watch-for-48731191b222?source=topic_page---------658------------------1," Once again, another session of the United Nations General Assembly (UNGA) will commence on September 17 while the high-level general debate will run from September 24 to September 30. Past highlights have included Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez calling George Bush “the devil,” an almost two-hour-long speech by Libyan President Muammar Ghaddafi during which he tore up the UN charter, and last years spectacle when the assembly floor laughed at U.S. President Trump as he boasted of his administration’s achievements. This year’s session, with polarization and international tensions rising, is likely to give rise to more dramatic moments. The UNGA is the largest convergence of heads of state from around the world and each is given 15 minutes to speak on today’s most pressing issues. Nearly 200 participants are already scheduled to deliver their speeches in the General Assembly. Here are four issues likely to dominate the 74th meeting of the UNGA: Pakistan’s Prime Minister Imran Khan has vowed to raise the issue of Kashmir at the UNGA, warning that India’s recent aggressive actions in the region of Jammu and Kashmir has spurred extremism. “Next week, I am going to address the U.N. General Assembly, and I will not disappoint the people of Kashmir. I will stand for the rights of Kashmiris as nobody did it in the past,” the former cricket star said while addressing a gathering in Pakistan-occupied Kashmir’s capital of Muzaffarabad In response, India had harsh criticism for Pakistan’s promise to bring the Kashmir issue to the UNGA floor, calling the country a “hub of terrorism.” Pakistan is attempting “to misuse this forum to spread baseless and deceitful narratives about my country,” Indian diplomat Sandeep Kumar Bayyapu said on Thursday. “The truth is that the delegation represents a geographical space that is now widely known as the hub of terrorism that has jeopardized innocent lives in our region and beyond. “Such attempts have not succeeded earlier and will not succeed now,” he added. Tensions in the disputed region have deteriorated since India lifted Article 370 of India’s constitution on August 5. The provision had granted the regions of Jammu and Kashmir a special status with a degree of autonomy, except for primarily on issues of foreign affairs and defense. As Walter Yeates previously reported for Citizen Truth, Kashmir is a predominantly Muslim area, split by India and Pakistan, which both countries claim as their own. The recent actions of India have drawn the ire of Pakistan, claiming such to be in violation of international law. Pakistan has made appeals to the United Nations Security Council while scolding the Hindu nationalist government of India. Since the revocation of Article 370, the Indian controlled Kashmir region has been under a virtual lockdown with government-imposed curfew-like restrictions. India and Pakistan each control roughly half of the contested region, while China controls a smaller region in the north. After the partition of British India into Pakistan and independent India in 1947, the neighboring countries have engaged in three bloody battles, two of which were sparked over the Kashmir region. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu vowed to annex the Valley of Jordan in the West Bank should he win the Israeli election on September 17, sparked outrage and condemnation worldwide. Palestinian National Authority Prime Minister Mohammad Shtayyeh responded that if Netanyahu followed through on the aggressive move he would be “a prime destroyer of peace in the region.” While Fawzi Barhoum, a Hamas spokesman in Gaza, said, “Such an announcement should be encountered by the Palestinian Authority in Ramallah with cutting off all ties with Israel, mainly the security coordination and halt of all futile peace negotiations with Israel.” Indonesia, one of the current non-permanent members of the U.N. Security Council, suggested the Organization of Islamic Countries (OIC) raise the issue of the annexation of the West Bank at the UNGA and the UNSC. “Indonesia sees a campaign promise made in Israel concerning Israel’s west bank annexation plan as an act of discrediting the international law and a flagrant violation of U.N. resolutions,” Director General for Multilateral Cooperation, Febrian A. Ruddyard, said at on Sunday an emergency meeting of the OIC called in response to Netanyahu’s proclamation. The presence of 57 members of the OIC is expected to push the discussion of the Palestine issue toward a special U.N. session. Besides the West Bank annexation, another Palestine-related key issue is whether the mandate of the United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees in the Near East (UNRWA) will be renewed following U.S. withdrawal of financial aid and support and an internal ethics report that alleged ethical abuses as the agency. In 2018, the U.S. suspended its $300 million in annual financial aid to the UNRWA, calling it an “irredeemably flawed operation.” The Netherlands, Switzerland and Belgium then followed suit, as Aljazeera reported. In late July of 2019, an internal investigation into ethical violations at the UNRWA was made public. AFP, which obtained a copy of the report, said the allegations include “sexual misconduct, nepotism, retaliation, discrimination and other abuses of authority, for personal gain, to suppress legitimate dissent, and to otherwise achieve their personal objectives.” The relief agency is responsible for distributing aid to more than 5 million Palestinian refugees in Jordan, Syria, Lebanon, the West Bank and Gaza. The current UNRWA mandate is still valid until June 30, 2020 but is renewed by the UNGA every three years. While the recent exit of Trump’s hawkish National Security Advisor may bring renewed hope for peace and diplomacy between Iran and the U.S., a meeting between Iranian President Hassan Rouhani and U.S. President Donald Trump at the UNGA has been apparently ruled out. “Neither is such an event (Trump-Rouhani meeting in New York) on our agenda, nor will it happen. Such a meeting will not take place,” Foreign Ministry spokesman Abbas Mousavi said in remarks broadcast by Iranian state TV. Tensions between Iran and the U.S. broke out when the latter abandoned the Iran nuclear deal, also known as the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA), signed under the Obama administration in 2015. Trump slammed the pact for not adequately restricting Iran’s nuclear ambitions, despite repeated reports from the monitoring agency — the International Atomic Energy Agency — that Iran was in compliance with the agreement. Most recently, the disagreement worsened following U.S. accusations that Iran was behind attacks on Saudi Arabian oil facilities on Saturday. Though Houthi rebels in Yemen claimed responsibility for the attacks, the U.S. and Saudi Arabia insist Iran was responsible, claiming the Houthis did not have sufficient weaponry to carry out such an attack. With Trump proclaiming the U.S. was “locked and loaded” to retaliate against the attacks, the tensions between Iran and the U.S. will likely be a subject of intense debate at the UNGA. European nations have condemned the U.S. for pulling out of the Iran Deal and sought ways to salvage the deal, though they have not been able to set up an alternative financial system to help Iran evade U.S. sanctions. U.N. High Commissioner for Human Rights Michele Bachelet issued a warning last week that climate change poses a severe threat to human rights by reducing natural resources and triggering famine, conflict and migration. “The world has never seen a threat to human rights of this scope,” she told the U.N. human rights council in Geneva. “The economies of all nations, the institutional, political, social and cultural fabric of every state, and the rights of all your people, and future generations, will be impacted” by climate change, she warned. Bachelet’s warning comes after a worldwide spotlight in recent weeks landed on fires that are still raging in Brazil’s Amazon rainforest. Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro has been blamed for weakening environmental protections that have lead to a surge of deforestation and fires in the rainforest. The crisis also led to a colorful public feud between French President Emmanuel Macron and Bolsonaro during which Bolsonaro took shots at Macron’s wife. According to a U.N. statement, U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres has made climate change one of his top priorities. Guterres scheduled the opening of the Climate Action Summit for September 23, though prior to the summit’s opening Guterres scheduled a Youth Climate Summit for September 21. With the climate summit, the Portuguese diplomat aims to push countries to solutions in six areas: Besides the aforementioned issues, the U.N. reports the UNGA will also be focused on issues like universal health coverage. On the same day as the climate summit, the U.N. will host its first-ever High-Level Meeting on Universal Health Coverage. In 2015, all 193 member states of the U.N. agreed on a number of Sustainable Development Goals, one of which, SDG3, included a number of health-related goals including achieving universal health coverage. “With at least half of the world’s population lacking access to the essential health services they need, and health costs pushing almost 100 million into extreme poverty each year, the meeting is being billed as the best opportunity to secure political commitment from Heads of State and Government to prioritize and invest in universal health coverage and ensure health for all,” wrote the U.N. Other focuses for the UNGA will include achieving and financing the rest of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, which is divided into 17 goals for sustainable development and ensuring support for developing nation-states.

Medium.com,Society,2019 Media Trends in Japan: How Old Media Stays Relevant,World,https://medium.com/freshtrax-by-btrax/2019-media-trends-in-japan-how-old-media-stays-relevant-f782128008bf?source=topic_page---------659------------------1," Media in Japan is changing as technology and social media advances, but traditional media like radio, newspapers or TV aren’t going anywhere soon. Many Japanese companies are finding ways to stay relevant by leveraging new technologies and incorporating new media into their ecosystems. In this article, we will explore some of traditional media’s creative and innovative survival strategies and how they are working in the Japanese market. In the United States, 93% of U.S. adults listen to the radio every week. On the other hand, according to research conducted by NHK in November 2018, only 32.5% of Japanese listen to the radio on a weekly basis. This number dropped from the previous year by 2.4%, with the radio audience population decreasing since 2008. It may seem counterintuitive with the decrease in listeners but radio is seeing a slight increase in company ad budgets, while ad budgets for the other old media such as TV, magazines, and newspapers have been decreasing, according to Toyokeizai online. Even though the number of listeners continues to decrease, the increased amount spent on radio advertising indicates that companies see audio media as an effective way to interact with audiences, especially younger ones. The main reason for this increase is the prevalence of smartphones and smart speakers and people using services like “radiko” to listen to radio programs on their digital devices. radiko is an Internet protocol, simulcast radio service that enables users to live stream local radio programs through computers, smartphones, smart speakers and other devices connected to the internet. For example, if you are in Tokyo, the free radiko service only allows you to listen to programming that is in the Tokyo area. As of November 2018, programs from 93 Japanese radio stations are available on the radiko platform. radiko allows users to listen to archived radio programs that broadcasted in the past week. Users can listen to these archived programs up to 3 times within a 24 hour time frame, enabling them to listen to programs they missed. Paid members (~$3 USD/month) can listen to radio programs, regardless of location. According to radiko’s media kit, it has 1.2 million to 1.3 million daily unique users and individual users listen to radio programs through radiko for about 130 minutes a day. Currently, 550,000 users are paid members. The average age of radiko users is 44.4 years old, while the average age of a listener of traditional radio is 52.4 years old. Looking at the chart below you can see that radiko has a higher user share among men under 20 years old and women under 30 years old compared to traditional radio. In 2018, radiko started an audio ads program, which enables advertisers to target specific user segments to promote their brand and/or service. radiko has developed and is still improving its DMP (Data Management Platform) to collect, store, analyze and integrate the information they have about users such as favorite programs, radio app usage, premium member user demographics along with third party data like online purchase history for better user targeting. In this way, brands are now able to not only interact with the relatively younger generation more so than traditional radio, but also people have better connections with the brands, which improves marketing efficiency. There is another notable new audio media that emerged recently and is growing rapidly in Japan. Voicy is an online audio content platform that distributes spoken audio episodes. It is very similar to podcasts, but the biggest difference is the program hosts. Only people who are approved by Voicy have their own channels on Voicy, as opposed to podcasts where anyone can create and distribute their own programs. In that sense, programs on Voicy are similar to regular radio programs that maintain certain quality standards. Limiting who can be a host enables Voicy to provide high-quality content for listeners. Hosts on Voicy are influencers or experts in a specific field/industry creating content ranging from news to business, language, technology, and lifestyle. In Japan, 96% of newspapers are directly delivered to subscribers via home delivery networks of newspaper distributors. Aside from the five national newspapers, Yomiuri, Asahi, Mainichi, Nikkei, and Sankei, there are regional newspapers that cover specific areas such as prefectures and specialty newspapers, that cover specific industries or topics. Although the newspaper is still the most significant form of paper media in Japan, it is also seeing a downtrend of newspaper subscribers. As the data shows below, newspaper revenues including circulation, advertising, and other types of revenue are declining. Newspaper circulation volume has been declining every year since 2000. This is because more and more people are browsing news on their mobile devices. While major newspapers have started distributing their content online, they are still losing viewers to news curation services such as Yahoo! News, LINE NEWS, SmartNews, and NewsPicks. It is expected that more than 87 million people will read news using news apps and/or online news sites in 2019. On the other hand, it is worth noting that only 9.4% of newspaper subscribers (including digital editions) read news online. Even though each newspaper publisher has put a lot of effort into digitizing content and promoting reading news online, the majority of subscribers, mostly the older generation, still prefer to read a physical newspaper. In Japan, “newspaper extras”, called “号外 (go-gai)” in Japanese, are normally distributed for free on the streets to quickly share breaking news such as accidents, disasters, and sports game results. Mercari, a company that offers Japan’s largest consumer-to-consumer (C2C) marketplace, held a huge promotional event when the Japanese government announced its new imperial era name at around 12 pm on April 1st. The event took place in Shibuya, one of the most crowded places in Tokyo. Right after the government announced “Reiwa” as the new name of the era, Mercari staff started to print out the new era name on t-shirts and hand them out in a similar fashion to how newspaper extras are distributed, to inform people of the new imperial name. People who happened to be in Shibuya were able to experience the “once in a lifetime” occasion, by celebrating the new era with strangers, and with any luck, getting limited edition t-shirts. You might be wondering why Mercari, a C2C resale app company, would host this event and distribute shirts. The key to understanding their strategy is the fact that they handed out only 500 copies of the “extra edition” Reiwa t-shirts to add to the value of scarcity. The company intentionally encouraged the lucky 500 people who received the t-shirts to sell them on Mercari. And that they did! Some of them were sold for as much as $80! Through this campaign, Mercari was able get some great media coverage. They also succeeded in getting people to use their service with many of the shirts, featuring the new empire era name, being sold on Mercari. Pokémon Go is an augmented reality mobile game that allows players to catch Pokémon characters in real life. In Pokémon Go, an event called “Community Day” is held once a month, and a specific Pokémon will show up in large quantities for a specified amount of time. On April 13th, 2019, newspaper extras handed out by Sankei Sports newspaper informed people of the outbreak of Bagon, a Pokémon character, with the extras being given out at 15 major train stations throughout Japan. Pokémon Go utilized the newspaper extras to promote the community day as if it were breaking news (It definitely was breaking news for players!) The newspaper covered everything people needed to know about Pokémon Go, such as how to download the app and how to play Pokémon Go on “Community Day”. It also described how to capture Bagon using the app. The content was very simple and easy to understand, even for people who didn’t know about Pokémon GO and the Pokémon series. This was a great promotion to increase awareness of the app. Kincho, a Japanese manufacturer that mainly produces household pesticide products, published a full-page ad in Japan’s major national newspapers. The ad was titled “The ultra-difficult origami” which had many lines showing where to fold on a black background. Readers could not see what they were making with the newspaper sized origami until the final folds were done, showing a giant cockroach! People could not help but share their final product on social media. Not only was it difficult to make, with an average of about 50 minutes to finish, but the roach was very detailed and realistic. On that day, many Twitter timelines were filled with giant black roaches, encouraging others to try the origami challenge. Kincho successfully leveraged offline media to generate online buzz. If you are interested in making an origami roach, you can download the guided origami file from here. The TV broadcasting networks in Japan consist of public broadcaster, NHK, a network that is funded by fees collected from every household and business with TV receiving equipment, and commercial broadcasting companies that are supported by advertising. There are 127 commercial broadcasting companies in Japan and most of them are affiliated with the five key stations based in Tokyo; NTV, EX, TBS, TX, and CX. Subscribing to multi-channel platforms, like satellite TV, is not popular and its penetration rate is only 20%. As available TV programs are limited, the influence of TV has been and still is big in Japan, despite a decrease in viewership. The 7 pm to 10 pm prime time viewing slots have been seeing viewer numbers decrease since 1997. The percentage of households that view a TV program live once hit 71.2% in 1997, but recently hit the lowest percentage, 59.9%, in 2017 and has stagnated over the last few years. The main reason for TV’s decline in popularity is the recent saturation of content caused by the Internet. Before Netflix and YouTube emerged, TV was one of the few entertainment options that people could enjoy at home. However, that has changed and now people have access to an abundance of content, including social media. Also, the way TV distributes content no longer fits people’s diverse and on-the-go lifestyle. They want to consume content from anywhere and at any time, mostly from their mobile devices, while TV programs still require users to be in front of a TV on a fixed schedule. These obsolete requirements make it harder for people to keep up with TV shows. If viewers miss an episode of a TV drama series once, most of them won’t bother to watch the show again. TVer is an online video streaming platform that allows users to watch more than 200 Japanese TV programs from their mobile devices and web browser for free. In 2015, the aforementioned Japanese five key stations partnered with each other to launch this service with the purpose of reaching more viewers who prefer to consume content on mobile devices. The total number of content views in June 2019 was 73.65 million and the number of monthly active users was 8.17 million, both of which were the highest numbers since TVer launched. The awareness of the service among viewers aged 15 to 69 is 56.0%. The awareness among women from 25–49 increased by 1.7 points since March 2019, due to the popular TV dramas that are available on the platform. TVer succeeded in gaining popularity by allowing users to watch TV programs, even if they missed a show as long as they watched it within 7 days after the showtime. As it was explained earlier, TV programs on the key stations were originally only available to watch on TV at a fixed time, but not anymore. TVer completely changed how people watch TV programs. TVer has also become a great marketing channel for advertisers. Advertisements are inserted into the beginning, middle and end of a TV program, and they are not skippable. According to TVer’s media kit, the video completion rate of these ads are 93.6%, which is much higher than the average video ad completion rate of other video ads in Japan where completion ranges from 56.8% to 33.7% on desktop and mobile, respectively. Advertisers can insert video ads into a specific TV program or category, or at random. Another way Japanese TV shows are interacting with users is by creating social media content that is linked with a TV drama’s story. A TV show’s team runs social media accounts as if the characters in the show are using the accounts in real life. “Ossan’s Love”, a Buzzword award-nominated, popular TV drama series broadcast in 2018, used Instagram in a very creative way. An Instagram account was created for one of the main characters, Musashi, where he created and posted pictures of his daily life beyond what was seen on TV. The content was all made up as if the character was an actual person living in the real world. The posts on the Instagram account reflects his personality in the show; the ways he writes captions, uses hashtags (he likes to use very long sentence-like hashtags), and takes photos (most of his pictures are of Haruta, the man Musashi has a crush on.) By taking advantage of real-life social media to bring the TV show’s characters into “our” life, the TV show succeeded in making the show more real and increased audience engagement. The Instagram account has over 4 million followers telling us how successful this experiment and show was. The media landscape in Japan has drastically changed over the past decade, due to the rise of social media and internet-enabled services. Although the audience base of traditional media has been shrinking, they still have quite a bit of influence and continue to have a lot of subscribers. In Japanese media culture, using strategies that integrate old and new media can help you reach a large audience and increase brand engagement."
Medium.com,Society,Enka Music: From Political Protest to Cultural Tradition,World,https://medium.com/@unseenjapan/enka-music-from-political-protest-to-cultural-tradition-3d75482fdc65?source=topic_page---------660------------------1," By Alyssa Pearl Fusek If you’ve explored the Japanese music scene, you’ve inevitably come across enka music. Maybe you’ve heard people snort in derision and call enka “old people music.” Often performed to a mixture of Western and Japanese instruments, and with singers in traditional Japanese attire, enka (演歌), Japan’s folk music, hearkens back to an idealized view of Japan prior to modernity and a perceived degradation in tradition. With its focus on lost love, nostalgia, death, and other similar melancholy themes, enka lyrics are highly emotional. Singers of enka employ a technique called kobushi (小節), where a single syllable of a word is sung while moving through different notes. The singer’s pitch varies with this movement, adding a ululating effect not dissimilar from the technique used in vibrato. Derived from the term enzetsu no uta (演説の歌) meaning “speech song,” enka didn’t start off as sentimental. Its aesthetic changed with the turbulent pre- and post-war eras before evolving in its current emotionally charged form. Labeled by some as “the heart of Japan” (日本の心), enka music is notable for its ululating notes wavering somewhere between nostalgia and determination. 1868 saw witness to the overthrow of the shogunate and the establishment of the Meiji government. Yet despite its modern undertones, the new government was still led by powerful samurai from the Satsuma and Choshu domains. Not even five years after the Meiji Restoration, whispers of unrest eventually culminated in the formation of the Freedom and Civil Rights Movement (自由民権運動; Jiyū minken undō), or Jiyūto for short (自由党). Spearheaded by disgruntled farmers, factory workers, and urban intellectuals, the movement demanded a more democratic approach to how the government was run. Their list of demands included a reduction in land taxes, an amendment to the numerous Unequal Treaties (不平等条; Fubyōdō jō) brooked between Japan and various Western countries, institution of a national assembly, and a constitution that protected basic civil rights. (JP) Link: Understanding the Freedom and Civil Rights Movement in 5 Minutes! At the time, the Meiji government had banned dissident speeches and protests about the new regime. So the Jiyuto had to get creative in order to make their voices heard. Rather than use force, they found a roundabout way to make political speeches without breaking the ban: singing. Enter Soeda Azenbo (添田唖蝉坊). Rising from the depths of day laborer life to become one of the most well-known ballad composers, he wrote songs about the government and society couched in satire and humor. These political activist songs merited their own sub-genre: soshi enka (壮士演歌). His memoir A Life Adrift (流生記; Ryusei-ki) remains one of the most thorough and insightful accounts of life for a prewar enka singer. Enka nowadays utilizes a variety of musical instruments, but in Soeda’s day, many street corner bards, or enka-shi (演歌師) relied solely on their voices. Eventually enka-shi printed their song lyrics and distributed them as they were singing, which inevitably caught the government’s attention. The Jiyuto achieved some of their demands when the government established a national assembly, but many activists eventually abandoned the pacifist speech songs in favor of outright rebellion, and the movement eventually splintered into different organizations. Enka stayed and proved to be a more steadfast fixture in Japanese culture than its political origins. During the Taisho era (1912–1926), more instruments began to be introduced as accompaniments in enka music, and it moved away from its street-corner origins to the emerging music studios. Musicians and composers began to draw inspiration from jazz and Hawaiian music. In the rising wave of modernity, enka also gradually lost its political affiliations. A narrative style of music called rōkyoku (浪曲) also sprang up, similar to the satirical stories old enka-shi used to sing or chant. In the Showa era (1926–1989), enka eventually faded into the background in the late 20s as kayōkyoku (歌謡曲; pop music) flourished. As music genres are incredibly fluid and rarely stationary, many songs considered “popular” gradually merged with the enka genre. Postwar Japan brought a huge shift to the music scene. Many rokyoku singers shifted to singing enka songs, as enka was considered “lyrically shorter” than the long meandering songs of the rokyoku style. Much like artists in the American blues scene, many enka aficionados struggled to profit off their music and ended up becoming one-hit wonders. However, some managed to establish themselves as dominant in the enka scene. Misora Hibari (美空 ひばり) is one such household name. A prodigy at the age of 12, her first single “Kappa Boogie-Woogie (河童ブギウギ, Kappa bugi ugi) exploded the music charts and ensured her career as a singer. She is often known as the “Queen of Enka.” Misora Hibari singing one of her most popular songs, “川の流れのように” ( Kawa no nagare no yoni). This was her last recorded single before her death in 1989; many musicians today sing this song as tribute. The rise of “modern” enka is said to occur in the late 50s as Japan struggled to reconstruct after their defeat in World War II. Enka became favorable for its retrospective look on old values and beliefs that were facing scrutiny in a frayed society. Enka can be considered a “conservative” style of music.Female enka singers often perform in traditional Japanese kimono; male enka singers also deck out in formal wear. Famed enka singer Itsuki Hiroshi (五木ひろし), once dubbed “Japan’s Frank Sinatra” would usually perform decked out in handsomely tailored suits and tuxedos. The refined appearance and graceful gestures of enka singers is at complete odds with flamboyant, hardcore visual kei bands, yet just as compelling. As Japanese aidoru pop began topping the music charts in the 90s, enka gradually declined in popularity. In 2016, the government established the “Parliamentarians Supporting Enka and Kayokyoku Committee” (演歌・歌謡曲を応援する国会議員の会; Enka kayōkyoku o ōen suru kokkai giin no kai) to promote the “disappearing traditions” of enka and its parent style kayokyoku. (JP) Link: How Long Will Enka Remain “The Spirit of Japan?” The Moment Enka Became the Symbol of Tradition Numerous enka singers who began their careers in the late Showa era are still active in the music scene. Relatively younger enka singers like Hikawa Kiyoshi (氷川 きよし), aka the “Prince of Enka” and Yamauchi Keisuke (山内惠介) draw in large numbers of female fans — and therefore sales — with their charm and good looks. During NHK’s annual year-end music contest “Kōhaku Uta Gassen” (紅白歌合戦), there’s always an enka singer or two competing. Enka has also found its way overseas: American singer Jerome “Jero” White is regarded as Japan’s first black enka singer, taking inspiration from his Japanese grandmother and her old enka records. While enka certainly appeals to older generations, I don’t believe the enka scene will truly die out. Nostalgia for a different past (and better, for some) isn’t a trend that easily goes away. In enka there’s something virtually anyone can relate to — a night out drinking, watching the sunrise, missing an unrequited love. Those types of experiences are eternal, even if the style in which they’re sung has faded with time.

Medium.com,Society,Attacks on Saudi Arabia Spell Bad News for the U.S. Military,World,https://gen.medium.com/attacks-on-saudi-arabia-spell-bad-news-for-the-u-s-military-3b4d1fb0ac7e?source=topic_page---------662------------------1," the security situation in the Persian Gulf continues to deteriorate in the aftermath of Sunday’s cruise missile attacks on Saudi oil facilities, the Trump administration finds itself in an increasingly dire situation — and its apparently dysfunctional relationship with both Iran and Saudi Arabia appears to be to blame. The attack on Saudi Arabian oil facilities early Sunday morning, apparently carried out by Iran and its regional allies, highlights the terrible strategic position faced by the Trump administration in confronting Iran militarily in its own neighborhood. Iran denies launching the attacks, pointing out that the Houthi militants in Yemen have claimed ownership of the strike. Yet Iran and the Houthi are close allies, and the weapons appear to have been supplied by Iran. Assuming Tehran is indeed behind the strike, which knocked about 5% of the world’s oil production offline for a yet undetermined amount of time, it confirmed what military experts have long suspected: Despite billions in U.S. arms sales and training arrangements, the Saudi military is as incapable of protecting its own oil infrastructure as it is defeating the Iran-backed Houthi militants that control vast swaths of Yemen. And for the U.S., that means the billions of dollars in arms sales to Saudi Arabia have yet to produce a military that can stand on its own. Iran and its allies have made a bold statement with the attack, conducted with cheap drones and knock-off Chinese cruise missiles: Any direct military conflict between Iran and the U.S. or its allies in the Persian Gulf would come at an enormous economic cost to the worldwide economy. The attack follows a months-long pattern of hostility between the U.S. and Iran. Since tearing up President Obama’s nuclear treaty with Tehran, President Trump has inched closer to all-out conflict with Tehran. And with Iran’s declaration that it would no longer adhere to the 2015 nuclear treaty that the Trump administration broke, as well as repeated incidents involving oil tankers in the gulf, tensions seem to be increasing. Even if the U.S. retaliates with limited strikes against Iranian targets in the coming days, Iran’s already made clear that it, along with its network of allies, is fully capable of causing more economic harm than the U.S. — already facing an economic slowdown — can possibly stand. “This is exactly the sort of conflict the Iranians have been specifically preparing for decades.” “Sure, the U.S. can inflict wild damage on the Iranians with a sustained air campaign against its military,” says a NATO military liaison recently posted to their country’s embassy in Riyadh. “But, after 30 years of military sanctions, the Iranians have long ago quit trying to compete with large amounts of conventional weapons in favor of light, cheap easily replaceable drones and missile systems that will flood the region, hitting economic, military, and political targets.” Those targets, according to the NATO liaison, include cities, military bases, and oil facilities. The NATO liaison, who spoke on the condition of anonymity, is skeptical that the U.S. military is capable of protecting these critical regional targets from swarms of missiles, rockets, and drones launched by Iran and its allies. “The U.S. would need an all-out mobilization to even have a chance to contain attacks on their own facilities. That’s something I can’t see them doing, and even if they did, I have a hard time imagining it would work in the short term,” they say. “This is exactly the sort of conflict the Iranians have been specifically preparing for decades. They’ll get to fight it at home, with an enormous coastline and very well-trained proxies.” The chances of stopping Iranian attacks would be even harder considering the lack of faith military analysts around the world has in America’s Gulf allies’ militaries. “They’re all useless compared to us and we would have our hands full,” says an ex-Israeli military officer who now consults with the Israeli government on Iran’s military. The Israeli officer points to his own country’s confrontation in 2006 with Hezbollah, the Iranian-backed militant group that dominates Lebanon, as a warning of Iran and its proxies’ capabilities. “Look at our performance against Hezbollah,” says the former Israeli officer. “They were able to keep throwing rockets at our targets for 30 days, and their ability to maneuver and fight on the ground was never obviously degraded on a large scale: Now it’s 13 years later and Iran will have much higher capabilities than Hezbollah did.” In recent weeks, Trump has repeatedly expressed his desire to make peace with Iran. But Sunday’s attack might have ruined his oft-stated hope to meet Iranian President Hasan Rouhani at the U.N. General Assembly later this month, and likely put to bed any chance of diplomacy any time soon."

Medium.com,Society,UNGA 2019: there’s always a story behind a no-show,World,https://medium.com/@Rashmee/unga-2019-theres-always-a-story-behind-a-no-show-ca2c049ca324?source=topic_page---------664------------------1," Who attends the United Nations General Assembly every year — and more crucially, who doesn’t — makes for a handy snapshot of the political state of the world. The no-shows are generally significant because they indicate the seriousness of ongoing, homegrown crises in disparate parts of the world. A leader dealing with regional, national or domestic political issues might decide to skip UNGA, despite the opportunity for networking and making deep and meaningful political connections. South African President Cyril Ramaphosa’s decision to stay away this year, for example, points to the gravity of what he is facing at home. His country is struggling with the fallout of violence against Africans from elsewhere, mainly in Pretoria and Johannesburg. This has caused bad blood with another regional power, Nigeria, and until South Africa’s “profuse apology”, might have roiled the region. Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro will send emissaries to UNGA this year rather than attending himself, in a sign that his domestic position is weaker than before. Last year Mr Maduro made a last-minute decision to travel to the meeting to give his country a voice on the global stage. Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, campaigning feverishly for re-election ahead of next month’s poll, will also stay away from New York. Mr Trudeau’s Liberals are neck-and-neck with the opposition Conservatives. His main rival, Conservative leader Andrew Scheer, is seeking to capitalise on a recent scandal over government meddling in corruption charges against the global SNC-Lavalin corporation. Unsurprisingly, Mr Trudeau seems to feel it might be a better use of his time to talk to voters at home rather than to fellow leaders, diplomats and the world’s media in the UNGA bubble in east Manhattan. Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau will stay away from New York this year as he focuses on his re-election bid. Reuters UNGA’s list of maybes is often just as telling as the non-attendees. Israel’s Benjamin Netanyahu has said he will attend but circumstances this week might decree otherwise. Mr Netanyahu is fighting for his political life in an election that comes much sooner than Mr Trudeau’s. Talks in New York begin next week. It might be bravado or excessive self-confidence to promise attendance but it would not be a surprise if Mr Netanyahu is not there this year. It is also not confirmed that Germany’s Angela Merkel, who last attended in 2015, will be there. This might be yet another indication of Ms Merkel’s waning authority and slow disengagement after 14 years as chancellor. But if she does make it, it will probably be her last UNGA and an attempt to underline the importance Germany gives to climate change, which will have its own UN summit next week. Despite a torrid political year, Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan will probably attend, as he has in previous years. It is an indication of the importance placed by Mr Erdogan on connections and confidences during the two weeks in New York. It also indicates his pugilistic predilections — Mr Erdogan does not shy away from confrontation. Neither does India’s Narendra Modi, who will attend nearly six weeks after his unilateral decision to revoke the special constitutional status of the disputed territory of Kashmir. Iranian President Hassan Rouhani has also said he will attend, amid talk at one time of a possible meeting on the sidelines with US President Donald Trump. But it is the list of confirmed no-shows that is almost more interesting. It casts the spotlight on places on the world map where change is underway. That list could be read as an organic document — illustrating the current flux from South Africa and Venezuela to Canada, Israel, Russia and Germany. Sometimes non-attendance indicates bigger geopolitical shifts. Last year, the number of African leaders at UNGA was much smaller than those who attended the third summit of the forum on China-Africa Co-operation in Beijing a fortnight before. That could simply have been a matter of scheduling; UNGA takes place every year while the China-Africa forum is held once every three years. But it is also possible there is more interest in a dialogue with China than within the fuzzy parameters of the United Nations. If UNGA is the “World Cup of diplomacy”, as UN economist Sinduja Srinivasan recently said in the UN’s podcast UNdocumented, there is a lot to be learned from the line-up of each national team. Just as with football, the national squad that appears on the UNGA pitch is judged to be the best representation of talent — tactically, strategically and in terms of showmanship. But the no-shows indicate hidden factors at play. Originally published at www.thenational.ae"
Medium.com,Society,Who Cares That Saudi Arabia Was Attacked? You Should,World,https://medium.com/@alexchristy17/who-cares-that-saudi-arabia-was-attacked-you-should-49090eac9cb8?source=topic_page---------665------------------1," Saudi Arabia isn’t a very lovable country, especially if you work at the Washington Post. When the Saudi oil refinery at Abqaiq was attacked by more than 20 drones over the weekend, Post opinion writer Elizabeth Bruenig tweeted “Who gives a rat’s ass if [S]audi [A]rabia was attacked?” While Administration officials pointed the finger at Iran, the same cycle that we previously saw with the previous mining of tankers resurfaced: Trump and company blame Iran, Iran offers an empty and unconvincing denial, Trump’s opponents fear war is coming. However after this escalation, Bruenig’s question deserves answering, because even people who hate Trump, his decision to pull of the nuclear deal with Iran, and Saudi crown prince Mohammad Bin Salman should care greatly that Saudi Arabia was attacked. Whether Iran itself or its Houthi proxies conducted this attack is not particularly relevant. Iran keeps poking the hornet’s nest because so far it has gotten away with it. While some of America’s allies have heeded Washington’s call for an increased naval presence in the region to prevent minings and seizures, Tehran has not faced any direct consequences for those actions. Neither did it face consequences when it shot down a U.S. drone. Contrary to accusations of being either a warmonger or a confused idiot who is going to stumble into a war, there is a perfectly rationale explanation for what Trump is trying to do with Iran. He is trying to pull off a good cop-bad cop strategy to try to get Tehran back to the table for a more encompassing deal. He puts crippling sanctions in place, while also floating the idea of giving Tehran a $15 billion loan. It hasn’t worked because for the good cop-bad cop routine to work, you can not have the two cops be the same person. When Trump offers Tehran a bailout he thinks he is balancing the stick with the carrot, but he does not look like a good cop, he just looks weak. Iran knows Trump ran on being the anti-war president and that he wants to run for re-election on not getting the country involved in another war in the Middle East, so they set the Middle East on fire, assuming that he won’t do anything, while hyping Trump as a danger to world peace in their public diplomacy in the hope the Democrat wins next year so they can get sanctions relief to greater finance their expansionist foreign policy. Thus far it has worked for them. Trump does not want war and has to consider public opinion. Same with the Europeans who not only have to consider what their people think about Iran and the nuclear deal, but what they think about Trump. In both America and Europe support for the Saudi Arabia isn’t high to begin with and the support for the Saudi war effort in Yemen is even lower. Still, every president from Franklin Roosevelt up through Trump has believed that the U.S.-Saudi relationship was important for any number of reasons, whether that be energy interests or that Saudi Arabia represents a sizable counterweight to Soviet communism, Ba’athist Iraq, and or post-revolutionary Iran. The U.S. has supported Riyadh in its war, because despite the loud voices of opposition, it is generally accepted that the future of U.S. foreign policy will be dominated by concerns in the Indo-Pacific region and the Yemeni port of Al Hudaydah is located at the western edge of this two-ocean space that also controls access to the Suez Canal. Keeping this strategic area out of enemy hands has been a constant in the 21st century. Earlier in the century the enemy as AQAP, now its Iran and their proxies. All of this makes it hard for any U.S. president to simply brush aside an attack on a Saudi oil refinery, regardless of public opinion. In addition to weakening Saudi Arabia for its own sake, Iran is probably hoping that by forcing Trump to come to Riyadh’s defense, they can weaken him domestically in the eyes of a public that is not eager to defend Riyadh in light of the war in Yemen and in the aftermath of the murder of Jamal Khashoggi. After the attack, that knocked out 5% of the world’s daily oil production, oil prices spiked more than at any point in history. The last time oil prices jumped that nearly this high was when Saddam Huessien invaded Kuwait. That invasion led to war because, like Iran today, Saddam felt he could get away with it. He was wrong and his invasion of Kuwait remains the biggest geopolitical blunder in recent times. Saddam invaded Kuwait because he needed the money that Kuwait’s oil would provide him after bankrupting Iraq during the Iran-Iraq War. Iran today is in a similar situation. It justifies its actions by saying if they are not allowed to export their oil, then neither should anyone else. It is not going to invade Saudi Arabia, even they are not that stupid, but they keep escalating these attacks on the assumption they will not get stung. None of this means that the U.S. needs to fight a war on Saudi Arabia’s behalf, which is always where critics immediately take the conversation, or that the U.S. needs to bomb an Iranian facility in return, but it does mean that that the U.S., Europe, and maybe even the Saudis need to come together and put their foot down and say “Enough.” Israel, for example, has countered Iranian influence in the region through military action, but has not bombed Iran itself. By saying who cares if Saudi Arabia was attacked, you are giving Iran the impression that there are no consequences for its behavior, behavior that did not start when Trump decided to pull out of the nuclear deal. Everyone has a red line, even Democrats and Europeans. The less we do to stand up to them now, the faster they charge towards that line of no return."
Medium.com,Society,Are You a Capitalist or a Socialist? I Am Both.,World,https://medium.com/datadriveninvestor/are-you-a-capitalist-or-a-socialist-i-am-both-f32378c5d998?source=topic_page---------666------------------1," Capitalism and Socialism work best when they work together. Neither works without good government. Merriam-Webster defines Socialism as ‘any of various economic and political theories advocating collective or governmental ownership and administration of the means of production and distribution of goods.’ This type of socialism is a terrible idea. This type of socialism would stifle innovation through its failure to reward entrepreneurship. One would be hard-pressed to find an economic system anywhere in the world that meets this definition of Socialism. North Korea may still meet this definition. The remaining former and current communist countries use a mixture of socialism and capitalism. Merriam-Webster defines Social Democracy in its second definition as “a democratic welfare state that incorporates both capitalist and socialist practices.” This is the predominant type of socialism in the world today. I am a strong believer in this type of socialism, even though I am a capitalist. Merriam-Webster defines Capitalism as “an economic system characterized by private or corporate ownership of capital goods, by investments that are determined by private decision, and by prices, production, and the distribution of goods that are determined mainly by competition in a free market.” Capitalism is great for innovation. Capitalism has proven to be the greatest economic system in history because capitalism provides a path for anyone with a good idea to become wealthy. Merriam-Webster defines Laissez-faire as ‘a doctrine opposing governmental interference in economic affairs beyond the minimum necessary for the maintenance of peace and property rights.’ Laissez-faire capitalism stifles competition due to corporations’ attainment of monopolistic and monopsony powers. These monopolistic and monopsony powers lead to high prices and low wages respectively. Laissez-faire capitalism leads to income disparity, excessive pollution, and an inability to meet challenges such as climate change. This form of capitalism is advocated by many Republicans. All Americans should vigorously resist such as awful economic system. Right-wing politicians use Venezuela as an example of the failure of socialism. Is this a fair assessment, or is there something else wrong in Venezuela? Has anyone ever noticed that these same right-wing politicians never hold up Haiti as an example of the success of capitalism? By the logic of these right-wing politicians, we should quickly move away from capitalism or we could become like Haiti! The common denominator between Venezuela and Haiti is not their economic systems. The problem with Haiti and Venezuela is the corruption level within their governments. Venezuela ranks 168 out of 180 countries with its level of corruption according to the 2018 Corruption Perception Index. Haiti ranks 161 out of 180 countries according to the same index. See the Transparency International data at this link. What is the key difference between countries where socialism works and countries where it doesn’t work? For socialism to be successful in any form, the managers have to be competent and cannot be corrupt. With socialism, the managers are government employees and ultimately, the government itself. An incompetent and corrupt government leads to the failure of socialist (public sector) programs. Denmark ranks as 2 out of 180 countries when it comes to the least corrupt countries by Transparency International. Denmark is an example of a country where democratic socialism is very successful. Venezuela ranks as 168 on that same list. See the map below for more information on the least corrupt and the most corrupt countries in the world. The map below provides more information on the corruption perception index rankings of the world’s nations. Like socialism, free-enterprise capitalism does not work well with a corrupt government. Corrupt governments will give some enterprises preferential treatment for bribing government officials. For free-enterprise capitalism to work, the most successful enterprises must be those chosen by the consumers based on the quality/price of their goods and services. If corrupt government officials choose the most successful enterprise, the consumers will get sub-par goods and sub-par services along with high prices. Which form of economic system do we have in the United States? We have a mixed capitalist/socialist system. America’s move away from pure capitalism dates back to the late 19th century. This is when the government started intervening in the private enterprise system through anti-trust laws and labor laws. One could say that socialism in America goes all the way back to 1639 when the first taxpayer-funded free public school opened in Dorchester, Massachusetts. In the 21st Century, government controls parts of our healthcare industry (the VA Health System, Medicare, Medicaid), some regional power generation (the Tennessee Valley Authority), public schools, and some pensions (Social Security). The government owns public parks. There are also privately owned parks. The government owns most highways and roads, yet the private sector owns some roads. Which industries are more suitable for permanent government ownership? Which industries are better suited for short-term government takeover? Which industries should the government subsidize? These are the questions we should be asking. The free enterprise system is enhanced by government ownership of some natural/legal monopolies. Highways and roads are examples of natural monopolies. Highways and roads are usually government-owned. The government owns the highways and roads because it would be inefficient to have competing, privately owned roads, side by side. Government ownership of roads and highways enhances competition among trucking companies. Would you want to pay an additional shipping fee to incorporate tolls charged by private companies to these trucking companies? Another example of a natural/legal monopoly would be power transmission lines in a state or region. These power lines are usually owned by private companies. Since it would be inefficient to have multiple sets of power lines for competing companies, state and local governments grant legal rights to particular companies to supply power. This was once necessary, but now we have the technology to run electricity from multiple power companies over the same lines. Government ownership of power lines would support competition among multiple power companies. Would it be better for the government to own power transmission lines? See the allconnect.com site at this link for a list of states where there are some choices of power companies for consumers. Should internet transmission lines be owned by the government? Government ownership of internet transmission lines could also be used to enhance competition among multiple internet service providers since the transmissions could work over the same lines. Would it be better for the government to control the entire health insurance system? A single national healthcare system would bring a great deal of bargaining power. This bargaining power would bring the price of our prescriptions in line with those paid in other countries. The rational question is, do we want to increase the level of socialism in this mix or do we want to reduce the level of socialism? Comparatively, the citizens of so-called ‘socialist’ countries such as Denmark seem to be much happier with their system than Americans are with ours. Paul Krugman wrote the following about Denmark. It’s true that Denmark doesn’t at all fit the classic definition of socialism, which involves government ownership of the means of production. It is, instead, social-democratic: a market economy where the downsides of capitalism are mitigated by government action, including a very strong social safety net. See Something Not Rotten in Denmark from the New York Times. This is one of the best articles available for describing what most American advocates of socialism really mean when they use the word, ‘socialism.’ Yet, the Republican fear-mongering propaganda machine tries to paint all ‘socialism’ in terms of Venezuela or the old Soviet Union. I would say that America does need to greatly increase the level of socialism in our economy. We need to go to a socialized universal healthcare system. We need affordable (if not free) higher education. We need a stronger social safety net instead of the cruel system we currently have. These are questions of economic optimization best determined by careful analysis. These are not questions for political demagoguery as they are framed by the right-wing. Americans need to ask where in our economy can we use socialism to improve capitalism. Americans also need to ask if our current government is capable of handling more socialism. Since Trump was elected, he has been trying to ‘drain the swamp’ and replace it with a ‘toxic waste dump.’ Corruption within our government has grown at unprecedented rates. From 2017 to 2018, America dropped from the 16th least corrupt country to the 22nd least corrupt country in Transparency International’s rankings. Democratic socialists in America must focus not only on economic issues but also on how our government processes can be improved to reduce or eliminate corruption. Many progressive policies simply will not work unless we improve our government. Corrupt governments do not work well with socialism. Corrupt governments do not have long term success with capitalism. Authoritarianism always leads to corruption in the long-term. We must promote Madisonian democracy in order to reverse the trend toward authoritarianism. We must improve our ‘checks and balances.’ All Americans must vigorously defend our democracy. Americans should support an economic system that rewards innovation while mitigating the downsides of capitalism."

he Global economy which was already reeling from a slowdown resulting from a protracted trade war between the two largest economies has was hit by another Black Swan event yesterday in the form of a drone attack on one of the biggest oil refineries in the heart of the Saudi Kingdom — the second-largest producer of oil & the largest exporter of crude oil. Just goes to show how fragile our interconnected & intertwined global economy is from supply chain shocks like these. Over the weekend, 10 drones struck at an important Aramco (ARMCO) facility, including the world’s largest oil processing plant and a major oil field forcing the kingdom to shut down half of its crude production. The attack took out 5.7M barrels a day, or roughly 5% of the world’s daily production of crude oil. The massive disruption sent WTI futures as much as 15.5% higher overnight to $63.34, the biggest intraday percentage gain since June 22, 1998. The estimated 5.7 million barrels a day of lost production is the single biggest disruption on record, surpassing the 1979 hit to Iranian output from the Islamic Revolution, as well as the loss of Kuwait and Iraq supplies during the 1990 Gulf War as reported by Bloomberg. Most of the global equities posted losses after the event just as they were looking to get back in the rally mode. U.S stocks were reporting double-digit losses at the time of writing. Timing of the incident couldn’t have been worse for the global markets. China had reported the weakest industrial growth of 4.4% over the weekend and now this incident has further jeopardized a global economic recovery or a meaningful rebound in Equities."
Medium.com,Society,How Two Weeks On Vancouver Island Soothed My British Soul,World,https://medium.com/@sjmyles79/how-two-weeks-on-vancouver-island-soothed-my-british-soul-cbd4b01cad50?source=topic_page---------671------------------1," D
ue to a variety of circumstances, I had not travelled beyond the shores of Great Britain for a number of years. We decided that the summer of 2019 would be the time to shake that up, though, and headed to Vancouver Island, British Columbia, for a an epic two-week adventure. This was not my first visit to the region. We had undertaken a tour of the Pacific Northwest in 2000, which included driving across British Columbia — from Calgary to Vancouver. This time, however, we were heading further west to visit Victoria, Ucluelet, Tofino, and Nanaimo, before wrapping things up with two days in Downtown Vancouver. The trip was beyond our wildest dreams, and we made memories to last a lifetime. Sunsets over the Pacific Ocean, hikes along the Wild Pacific Trail, listening to the Netherlands Centennial Carillon in Victoria Inner Harbour, spotting humpback whales in Barkley Sound, spotting orcas from float plane over Clayoquot Sound, spotting black bears around Ucluelet Harbour, crossing the Capilano Suspension Bridge in Vancouver… we certainly made the most of our time. But, when it was all over and we had settled back into our quiet North Yorkshire home in the U.K, I was struck by the overwhelming sense of being plunged back into conflict; of heading back into a battle, of sorts. I felt as though I was returning from a much-needed fortnight of respite — but not the kind of respite one gains from a regular break from the usual daily grind. This was far deeper than that. I felt as though my very soul had been soothed by my Vancouver Island trip, and this prompted me to ask the question: Why was this sensation so striking? The answer was simple: Reconciliation and the acknowledgement of injustice. While our own nation — the Britain formerly known as ‘Great’ — has been tearing itself to shreds with excessive austerity measures for a decade and with Brexit for three years, British Columbia — and specifically the cities and communities of Vancouver Island — has been taking a different approach to both social and environmental issues. As visitors, we were immersed in it from the moment we stepped off our Airbus 330 and into Vancouver International Airport: the simple act of acknowledging injustice, making a public commitment to inclusion, and demonstrating a desire to move forward in a better way, together. In the U.K, ten years of Conservative government policy has caused the infamous British class divide to widen exponentially — with the rich getting richer, the poor getting poorer, and those in-between being pushed further down the economic ladder. Now, the National Health Service is in crisis, the education system is in crisis, there is a housing crisis, and teenagers are stabbing each other to death as a result of extreme cuts to the police, youth, social, and mental health services. And then, there is Brexit — the burdensome weight that has been dragging us down since the 2016 referendum. It was a strategy implemented by then Prime Minister David Cameron as a way of addressing internal party divisions, which was then seized upon by right-wing elements who went on to win the referendum by a narrow margin with methods that constituted electoral law-breaking. The country has unravelled so much since that point that the Conservative Party just installed many of those very same law-breakers as Government, while the populace is riven with anger and frustration. All of these issues have combined to create an oppressive country-wide atmosphere of discord and antagonism but, crucially, with nobody taking responsibility, the nation is effectively under a constant stream of gas-lighting from its government, in much the same way as the United States of America is, under the Presidency of Donald Trump. The facts of the injustices, law-breaking, and abuses of power are documented, and yet, the culprits are still installed in the highest office in the land, from which privileged position they tell us not to believe our own eyes and ears. Any respite from such a situation can only serve to pull the bigger picture into sharp relief, so it is no surprise, in retrospect, that I should be stunned at the incredible social contrast. Just look at the airports. Some argue that airports are just travel hubs, and are largely inter-changeable, but I argue that this attitude does regions around the world no favours — especially Manchester in the U.K. Manchester is a major city in the north of England and Greater Manchester is actually the second most populous urban area of the United Kingdom. It also has a rich and fascinating history, having thrived during the Industrial Revolution. Everything from manufacturing and engineering, to political, philosophical, and economic theory was developed and put to use in the region, creating an economic and academic boom. This success was irreparably damaged by the Great Depression of the 1930s, World War II, the Thatcher Government, and terrorism - but the Manchester of today is still often considered to be the second city of the United Kingdom. You would not know that from its airport, though, Terminal 1 of which is like a neglected municipal facility from the 1970s. There is nothing of the rich culture of Manchester in it, and at a time when the Conservative Government is waving its ‘Northern Powerhouse’ plan around like a vote-winner, this shows a disgraceful lack of investment. With Brexit looming large, and this run-down, grim facility being the first thing overseas visitors see when they step off the plane, it begs the question: Why would anyone else invest in Manchester when the U.K’s own government doesn’t seem to bother? Vancouver International Airport is a shining example of the difference regional investment can make. The city received a significant economic boost as a result of hosting the 2010 Winter Olympics, and the airport is designed to welcome overseas visitors to this city that has a very specific history and culture. For example, upon descent into the Vancouver International Airport Customs Hall, travellers pass the giant Musqueam Welcome Figures. Created by artist Susan Point, these are a traditional Coast Salish welcome, and are inspired by historical Coast Salish house posts. Vancouver International Airport is filled with such art installations reflecting First Nations traditions and history, as well as the region’s unique relationship with its wildlife and habitats. It all combines to communicate a philosophy of reconciliation and co-existence, and this continued work now results of The Musqueam Indian Band — YVR Airport Sustainability & Friendship Agreement of 2017. This agreement reflects the fact that the airport stands on land that is Musqueam traditional territory, and that both parties are committed to working together in friendship for the benefit of the community. This philosophy continues over on Vancouver Island, and is perhaps best encapsulated by the Royal BC Museum in Victoria, which dedicates an entire floor to the anthropology of the region, in addition to its natural history floor. These exhibits include First Nations own voices in their documentation of the true past of British Columbia — including the arrival of colonisers from Europe, such as George Vancouver from England. Facts are laid bare — from the devastating effect of European bacteria being introduced into indigenous communities, to the lasting impact of First Nations children being taken and ‘re-educated’ in Residential Schools to assimilate them into the culture of the colonisers. There is no apparent desire to shy away from these past crimes in the Royal BC Museum, or indeed Vancouver Island itself, and it is galling to a British tourist that we would have to travel over 4,000 miles to experience an objective presentation of this part of our own history. The impact of British colonialism in Canada and around the world is not taught in British schools, and it is not emphasised in our museums. There is simply no meaningful public acknowledgement or acceptance of such past injustice — the current treatment of the Windrush Generation being a particularly egregious case in point. While the U.K is busy imploding and isolating itself from its neighbours, the federal and provincial governments of Vancouver Island have signed a Treaty agreement in principle with the Ditidaht and Pacheedaht First Nations. Once ratified by all parties, this would provide up to $60 million in cash transfers, 8000 hectares of Crown, reserve and National Park land, as well as rights of self-governance after 20 years of negotiations. This point has been reached as a result of a national push toward reconciliation, helped along by the Truth and Reconciliation Commission of Canada — established to acknowledge injustices committed through colonialism (especially with Residential Schools) and to determine actions to do better. The emphasis is on moving toward a respectful partnership between all peoples. There have been, and are, many Truth and Reconciliation Commissions focused on various issues throughout the world — from Algeria to Uruguay. Even the United States of America has had two. The United Kingdom does not appear on any list of official Truth and Reconciliation Commissions, though. Indeed, for a country whose people are stereotyped as being overly polite and inclined to say “sorry” for no reason, we are very far away from truth and reconciliation. This is not to say that Canada is perfect. Injustice and racism exists, and specifically, so many indigenous women have been murdered or declared missing that this particular crisis has its own acronym (MMIW), and had its own national enquiry. Poverty levels on reservations are notably high, and several First Nations do not have access to clean drinking water. The Neskantaga First Nation, for example, has been under a ‘boil water’ advisory for 25 years. These are unacceptable human rights violations that result from colonialism, and they need to be addressed and resolved — but, there is value in the willingness of those in authority to admit to the problems in the first place, which the national public emphasis on reconciliation demonstrates. The existence of these injustices is no longer denied by authorities. There is evidence of progress in many areas. It is moving far too slowly, but moving too slowly is better than not moving at all — which is the stagnant situation afflicting the United Kingdom. Acknowledgement of injustice — as demonstrated by British Columbia — paves the way to a future of reconciliation, which is a philosophy that extends to the relationship between humans and the Canadian landscape. While West Coast economies now thrive on tourism — notably ‘adventure guides’ and tour operators — each undertakes their business with an eye on the past. The conservation of whales, bears, wolves, and cougars on Vancouver Island (and across British Columbia as a whole) is at the forefront of activities — from the way in which vessels operate in the waters around the coastline, to the design of public trash cans on the street. All are well aware of the hunting that was once prevalent, and the efforts to now protect these animals and their habitats. Most importantly of all, this national embrace of reconciliation is itself a celebration and honouring of First Nations cultures — upholding the idea of the connectedness of all things. There is still a long way to go to achieve true reconciliation on Vancouver Island and in Canada as a whole, but the willingness to try breeds hope for the future — and this is something that the United Kingdom has been lacking for a very long time. For us as British visitors, this Vancouver Island trip wasn’t just an experience of a lifetime, it was also a much-needed respite from a culture that absolutely refuses to acknowledge injustice within itself. I just wasn’t prepared to be confronted with that stark truth. Thank you, Vancouver Island, and please keep showing us how to do better."
Medium.com,Society,I Was There After Katrina. Trump’s Treatment of Dorian Survivors Is Pure Evil.,World,https://gen.medium.com/i-responded-to-katrina-what-donald-trump-is-doing-to-victims-of-dorian-is-pure-evil-5dbd762f9c65?source=topic_page---------672------------------1," You have to smell a place, in the aftermath of a hurricane, to know what it’s like. You have to look into the eyes of a woman with three kids as she weeps uncontrollably, without a single solution to offer her. You have to feel way too hot, with too many mosquito bites, and no shower. You have to be reminded not to give away your own bottled water to old ladies begging you for it because you don’t want to be stranded without it. You have to spend two weeks caring for someone in renal failure, whose condition was not considered quite near-death enough for the paramedics to take action, only to see them die after you finally get them to an open hospital. You have to look at a stunned, pregnant, 16-year old girl, who has been living under a tarp for 10 days, so dehydrated her skin stands up when the nurse gently pinches it. In the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina, I worked as a volunteer responder with the American Red Cross in rural Louisiana. For just shy of three weeks, I helped the survivors who arrived at the shelter. It is an utterly fruitless exercise to use words to describe the situation — one simply has to experience it using all five senses in order to fully grasp the stakes of trauma and destruction. And it’s because of my experiences that I cannot stand by and just watch as the Trump administration turns away nearly 100 victims of Hurricane Dorian who seek safe haven in the United States. Ordinarily, Bahamians without criminal records do not need visas to fly to the United States. But even after their country weathered a Category 5 hurricane, which left nearly 70,000 people homeless, survivors were asked to disembark a rescue ferry, simply because they did not have visas. The company that ran the ferry claims Customs and Border Patrol alerted them of the visa requirement; CBP officials, however, say the company was responsible for the hardship and that they would have accepted the evacuees. But no matter who is responsible for the incident, to me it’s clear this was born out of this administration’s attitude toward these particular victims of Dorian. Some of the hardest-hit areas in the Bahamas were inhabited by immigrants from Haiti, a place Trump once notoriously referred to as a “shithole.” After returning home from Louisiana, I wrote every single member of Congress. The task took me two weeks to complete. Out of over 530 politicians, only two bothered with a response; one Democrat and one Republican. Politicians don’t want to hear the harsh truth about how we’re failing our fellow Americans. When a hurricane is coming, they just hedge their bets it won’t hit their district. Still, there was some beauty found within the aftermath of the disaster. I forged lifetime friendships with two other women while on a hair-raising Odyssey to our shelter that lasted for days. During the long, adventure-filled journey, one of my co-workers and I discovered we were on opposite ends of the political spectrum. Fighting wasn’t an option. We found ourselves listening to the other, and laughed about how much we had in common. Among the ruins, suddenly we are all, simply, people. The clients in the shelter worked with us. We got through that time together, united, and with a singleness of purpose. The day I left, every single client had been reunited with friends or family; not a single person went to a FEMA shelter. I consider it a holy time; facing destruction caused by nature is beyond humbling. The experience united us all. My breath left me this week as I watched those survivors of Hurricane Dorian being forced off of that ferry. My blood ran cold. It’s impossible to expect that people who just survived such horrific conditions, and lost everything they own, should somehow manage to have the necessary travel documents required by our government. Watching a press conference Trump gave about this issue, I found myself hearing the same coded language he uses about nations with people of color, again and again. Some of the hardest-hit areas in the Bahamas were inhabited by immigrants from Haiti, a place Trump once notoriously referred to as a “shithole.” His response to survivors last week struck a similar note. “I don’t want to allow people that weren’t supposed to be in the Bahamas to come into the United States,” Trump said last week, “including some very bad people and some very bad gang members, and some very, very bad drug dealers.” The conditions inside the Bahamas are hard to imagine, likely far more dire than what I experienced after Katrina, where 10 days into the job, I drove with a National Guardsman to pick up the medical supplies we needed for our clients who had gone days without necessary medications. “I’ve done two tours of Iraq,” the young guardsman said to me. “This is worse than Iraq.” But Katrina was a Category 3 when it made landfall in Louisiana. Dorian was a Category 5. I’ll be spending the evening of my wedding anniversary this month with my husband, at a protest against the president and his racist policies. It may seem like an odd way to celebrate our marriage, but my husband and I do not want blood on our hands. Because the president is amoral, he can create controversy without the hindrance of a conscience. The rest of us aren’t so fortunate; we have to live with his decisions. We have to act in order not to be just like him."

The plastic bag for your supermarket run, the banh mi sandwich wrapper you strip away for lunch, the endless packaging shipped via every Amazon order, the water bottle you crush post-workout — what happens when you throw it away? And if you haul it out to your green recycling bin, does it even get recycled? Common sense screams yes, but in the wake of changing laws and shifting global markets, the reality is far dirtier. At a time when we’re able to irrigate deserts, create man-made glaciers, communicate constantly across time zones and borders — even if it destroys our mood and memory — one of the biggest problems we face starts at home. And no, it’s not politics or climate, but in many ways it’s just as important. We Americans create about seven pounds of trash per person a day. As a nation, that’s more than 262 million tons of waste a year, according to the EPA. Despite our best efforts, more than half of that waste is sent to landfills, according to the Environmental Protection Agency. The plastic that ruled our lives was a commodity yielding huge returns when it came to recycling. The market shift began tilting once China decided to stop taking our junk. In 1960, the United States recycled 5.6 million tons of trash — a number that grew to nearly 70 million tons by 2015. While numbers have trended upward for decades, even taking into account growth in overall trash production and population, there’s been a staggering 184% increase in the amount of trash produced today versus 1960. No matter how much you fill your recycle bin, the system is crashing. The “why” is the dark corollary to globalism. Cheap products beget cheap products beget more and more packaging. For years, the plastic that ruled our lives was a commodity yielding huge returns when it came to recycling. That profitability is based on global demand, and even before the trade war began, the market shift began tilting once China decided to stop taking our junk. Last year, China decided to scrap what once made fiscal dollars and sense. After years of hoovering up our junk, it stopped being profitable to sift, clean, and recycle plastics contaminated with paper, food waste, and other nonreusable materials. In 2017, China began to cut back on plastic imports. In early 2018, it banned all imports. China’s National Sword policy meant the Middle Kingdom went from buying 60% of the plastic waste exported by the G7 during the first half of 2017 to taking less than 10% a year later. This monumental move signaled the end of the recycling market for the rest of the developed world. To give a sense of this impact domestically, the United States exported 30% less plastic scrap in the first half of 2018 than in 2017. Today, those numbers are even grimmer. The equivalent of 250 Olympic-sized swimming pools — about 19,000 shipping containers’ worth of plastic once exported abroad — is now piling up each month. As a result of this ever-growing pile, U.S. cities are now sending their plastic to landfills in record numbers. In my own Los Angeles County, Coby Skye, assistant deputy director of environmental programs for L.A. County’s Department of Public Works, admitted to the Guardian recently that cities throughout the United States are reflecting this global change by dumping everything you and I throw into a recycling bin into a landfill. With China saying no, new scrap kings have been crowned in Thailand, Malaysia, and Vietnam, since many Southeast Asian nations have scant environmental restrictions and are teeming with illegal processing plants and pollution. In Thailand alone, there are at least 60,000 Thai and foreign-registered factories that import waste products, many of them toxic. Greenpeace says Thailand’s plastic waste imports grew from 70,000 tons in 2016 to nearly half a million tons in 2018. In that two-year span in Southeast Asia, plastic waste imports rose over 171%, which translates to about 423,000 20-foot shipping containers. There’s big money driving these moves. Between January and November of last year, Chinese imports of copper scrap from Thailand shot up nearly 95% from 2017, a 355% leap from the previous year; in the Philippines, scrap copper shipments rose over 520%. But even that shift could now be threatened. A new legally binding and globally reaching hard stop called the Basel Amendment seeks to protect the developing world from all of our junk. The treaty, which was ratified earlier this year by 187 nations — though not the United States — amounts to a de facto trade restriction where rich nations could no longer dump their trash in 36 developing ones. In many ways this is an idealistic approach to protecting the third world, but doing so poses a huge unanswered question: If not there, then where? Why hasn’t the United States backed the amendment? The EPA says it hinders recycling. In a July letter to the Basel Action Network, the nongovernmental organization that championed the change, EPA Administrator Andrew Wheeler waves a stick, warning that these regulations will promote more waste being sent to landfills by the first world. The Basel Action Network reckons forcing world governments into an even more untenable solution will force their hand and, thereby, actionable change. To that end, it advocates for legislation and market incentives to reduce plastics use, which Jim Puckett, the organization’s executive director, calls the only solution to this problem. “The amendment was a very important first step to prevent the plastic crisis being put on the backs of developing countries,” says Puckett, who acknowledges that forcing nations to incinerate their plastic exacerbates an already critical burden of carbon output. “In the end, this could do more harm to the environment.” The amendment, which will take effect in January 2021, remains highly controversial. The United States is, after all, the only member of the 36 OECD nations out of step. Puckett rationalizes that “there is simply no way that we are going to be able to recycle our way out of the plastic waste problem. We’re running out of options other than reducing plastics use, starting with single-use plastics.” He’s right, but pulling the rug out from under the feet of world leaders is a rude way to force change. Change takes time, and in the interim, the metric tonnage stacking up has nowhere to go and is largely being burned or buried. “The Basel Convention’s restrictions on plastics trade, when implemented, will stymie the supply chain and prevent recyclable materials from getting to where they can be recycled,” says Adina Renee Adler, vice president of international affairs at the Institute of Scrap Recycling Industries, an association of companies that process, broker, and consume scrap commodities. “In the end, this could do more harm to the environment.” Adler calls it critical that products be manufactured with recycling in mind. She thinks that could help influence purchasing behavior, but that assessment seems optimistic. It’s an approach reminiscent of green energy hopefuls who believe that the commonsense benefits of sustainable energy could reinvent costly fossil fuel infrastructure. Yes, cleaner manufacturing practices could be a big win for plastic in the long term and even open new avenues to recycle them, but it’s a costly gambit. Industrial-scale revolutions are never led by mom-and-pop shops. To be fair, there are some positives: 127 countries already have restrictions on plastic bags. In July, Panama banned them altogether, the first Central American nation to do so. Britain is debating a tax on plastic packaging made with less than 30% recycled content, and Rwanda has banned plastic (much to the frustration of its people). San Francisco’s airport has outlawed plastic water bottle sales. In a move to curb straws being dumped into the ocean, in many big cities now it can seem impossible to find a plastic straw (which can endanger the already disadvantaged disabled community). In March, the European Parliament backed a law requiring 90% of plastic bottles to be recycled by 2029. But just how they’ll do that with the old infrastructure in shambles remains unclear. In California, RePlanet, the state’s biggest recycling center, shuttered all 284 locations, leaving countless poor and often homeless people with one less income stream from redeeming bottles and cans. As more of us realize the futility of saving plastic bottles, public morale will shift, although it’s doubtful that an administration that’s pulled the plug on the Endangered Species Act — and is actively hostile to climate and environment — will take action. Beyond plastic, cardboard recycling has plummeted: Two years ago it was worth around $200 a ton in California. It’s now $20 a ton. Similarly, mixed paper was once $100 a ton — now it’s worth zero. Where once a recyclable commodity’s value was paid for by the cost of the service, plus shipping and manufacturing, that’s now a thing of the past, says Pete Keller of Republic Services, one of the biggest waste and recycling companies in the United States. That means it costs a lot to recycle, which supports why the global business framework has collapsed. “The entire notion of recyclability is being revealed as a fraud.” Even at peak reduce-reuse back in 2015, a recent study found that, at best, around 9% of all world plastic has been recycled — the rest was heaved into landfills. And back to Southeast Asia: They’re cracking down too. Indonesia, the Philippines, and Malaysia are so inundated that their ports have been pushed to the brink. Now they’re sending waste to even poorer nations, like Vietnam. The Philippines has even sent back years-old rotting waste to Canada in a diplomatic row that reflects the stain on national pride that comes with being dubbed the world’s garbage dump. “The entire notion of recyclability is being revealed as a fraud,” Puckett told me. “Export is going to be increasingly impossible as an avenue for plastic waste.” While most scrap traders have gone under, some leverage a loophole to sell plastic pellets to China, which is not covered by the ban. In Hong Kong, Craipeau, the eponymous firm created by Max Crapieau is doing just that. China has gone from being the biggest scrap processor to the biggest importer of pellets used for everything from bottles and toys to blankets and bean bag fillers. Another way to stay afloat in this market is being navigated in California: Companies like CalRecycle are retrofitting facilities to clean waste so China accepts it. San Francisco’s Recology, which spent $3 million installing new sensors to reduce impurities, and SA Recycling upgraded facilities to wash aluminum waste, making the trio among the biggest scrap traders in the country. Steve Wong knows what it’s like to be on top. The founder of Fukutomi Recycling in Los Angeles was once Asia’s de facto scrap king, accounting for 7% of China’s total plastic imports, a business formerly worth more than $100 million with manufacturing centers and subsidiaries around the world. For decades, Fukutomi was doing 400,000 tons a year. Today, the company Wong built in 1984 is teetering, looking at once no-go markets like Haiti and Mexico to stay afloat. We meet in an asphalt-heavy office park off Interstate 10, about an hour east of Los Angeles. Fukutomi’s modest HQ is sandwiched between offices advertising foster and hospice services. It’s a cramped space filled with boxes, piles of sample pellets, and dated company pamphlets. Wong says this tumult began in 2013, when China introduced its Green Fence policy, the precursor to today’s full ban. It was around that time when Fukutomi started hemorrhaging funds. “China doesn’t want the image that we live on other people’s rubbish,” he says. “Recycling is not only about collection — it’s about separation. And the market change means the situation is limited. For me, we can make money in the raw material, trading. Just trading.” That’s a big change from years past. The 62-year-old, days after completing a marathon — his 100th, he says between sips of green tea — takes out a lighter and holds the flame under what looks like ordinary plastic wrapping. He shows off the different smoke colors and pungent smells that indicate impurities and plastic mixtures. It’s a crash course demonstrating just how hard it is to separate and clean a substance so many of us take for granted. Melting points, density, contamination, additives, properties, separation. “Not many people know this, but there are more than 42,000 different types of plastic,” Wong explains, holding a piece of burning polyethylene terephthalate, or PETE, which you and I know as the thin rolls of plastic found in countless everyday items. “Most people only recycle four of them. There are lots of material companies can still recycle, but they don’t make money. The cost of recycling is more than the selling price.” The master alchemist describes the process itself, using salt to change water density to separate materials of the plastic, such as aluminum, a dizzying process made worse from the fumes circulating the room. Thickness, color, weight, melting point — all Wong needs to tell what kind of plastic we’re talking about is a quick glance. “You can tell by the smell,” he smiles. The developing world values recycling more than the West, he points out, but that’s changing as the Basel Amendment squeezes an already squeezed market. Wong’s one of a growing group of scrappers pushing against the change. “All of these countries will no longer be able to take imports of plastic scrap. The USA is not a party, but it affects the United States because all these importing countries, developing countries, they are Basel Convention parties, so they will not allow imports of material which is classified as hazardous waste. In one year, 90% will not be allowed in developing countries.” The irony of what’s going on here in the West, where we tout clean living but ship our waste elsewhere, isn’t lost on Wong. “How many of us really know where our trash goes?” he asks, wondering aloud about the paradox of how to clean world oceans when it’s impossible to sift the microplastics we all know about, yet we bury our heads when it comes to funds or global strategy. It’s a see-no-evil approach, one that begs for the end of single-use plastics and new composites, Wong says, all lofty goals without global consensus. “People are looking for financial efficiency, and that means that this is an environmental consequence,” Wong says. “But the recyclers don’t look at it as the main objective. We are not NGOs.The main thing is survival.” Driving home, I can’t help but notice the junk strewn along the overpass — medium- and high-density polyethylene bags, torn nylon polyamide flowing in the wind. After an afternoon with Steve Wong, these will never just be plain old plastic. When I get home and look at the overflowing waste bin, the question of what to do if there’s no point to recycling feels like the biggest bamboozle no one talks about. Normally I chuck as much as I can into the green bin and feel a little better about my footprint. Today it all goes into the dumpster that says “landfill only.” It all goes there anyway."
Medium.com,Society,"Brexit, Tourism and the border",World,https://medium.com/@nevininstitute/brexit-tourism-and-the-border-4a8b6df33f8f?source=topic_page---------674------------------1," Last week my colleague Paul Mac Flynn in this same column warned about the need to ensure that people are not left behind, in our increasingly more probable, crashing out of the European Union without a deal. Like many other Brexit commentators, Paul Mac Flynn is of the opinion that there is no use now in debating the impacts of the various different Brexit deal options which have been on and off the negotiating table over the past two years. And I agree, we do need to move full steam onto operation preparation. We do need to divert all of our energies over the next 9 weeks to preparing for the practicalities of a no-deal Brexit and in doing so seek to minimise the negative impacts for businesses, workers, and well, everyone. But before we embark on making preparations, we need to be truthful with ourselves and recognise that our approach to exiting the European Union until now is already having a negative impact. Any preparations we make now are being made on the backfoot and are being made to minimise continuing or heightened negative impacts resulting from the political mish-mash approach to Brexit that has been ongoing since the negotiating period began on March 2017. The Northern Irish economy has been contracting since March (the original Brexit deadline) and key indicators would suggest that we are in a recession. Output, employment, new orders, exports have all declined. The already occurring negative impacts of our approach to Brexit for the tourism sector, for example, were brought to life and made particularly clear to me two weeks ago as I enjoyed a very last-minute holiday along some of the border counties — traversing between Donegal, Sligo and Fermanagh. It was the first week in August and the weather was sunny, with temperatures in the mid to low 20’s. I’m from Donegal, and I grew up crossing these same roads each Summer when the sun came out as we went from surfing in Rossnowlagh, Co. Donegal to jet-skiing in Lough Erne, Co. Fermanagh. I know what this time of year, particularly with this weather, usually meant for tourism in these counties. It meant that the roads (and petrol stations) were busy. It meant that last-minute hotel and restaurant bookings were almost impossible to secure. It meant that it was best to set off to the beach or other tourist attractions early in the morning. It meant that pubs and coffee-shops were spilling out onto the streets. It meant that for businesses and workers alike it was time “to make hay as the sun shines”! Two weeks ago, though I was surprised by how stark my experience was to what I have grown accustomed to over the years and those declining PMI indicators were given meaning. The roads were quiet. I was making bookings for hotels one day in advance, at rates considerably lower than I had expected. Restaurants were empty and closing early, as the custom just wasn’t there. Publicans were expressing with unease about the quiet season that they’ve been having. In essence, the sun was shining, there just wasn’t any hay to be made. On return from holidaying I set about to confirm or refute my observations in the data — and well unsurprisingly my observations held true. Donegal’s tourism sector has recorded a 25% decline in the visitor numbers from Northern Ireland and Britain this Summer, whilst hotels are said to be experiencing a 25% downturn. There is also some evidence seeping through that visitors are using fewer services and are spending less. All of this inevitably means that there is less business to be done and less work available for workers in these regions. Comparable figures of how Northern Ireland’s tourism sector has been performing this Summer are not yet available. I have however heard some claim that one positive of the slump in sterling is surely that Northern Ireland is now a very cost-attractive holiday option for Brits and Europeans alike. However, one would be mistaken from concluding that this slump in the tourism sector is confined to south of the border or indeed that Northern Ireland is a net benefiter of their loss. Yes, one of the principal reasons for the slump in tourism in the southern border counties has been the slump in sterling. The sterling rate four years ago was at €1.44 — now it is at €1.09. But we need to give weight to what experts in the tourism sector have been telling us. They tell us that a lot of visitors just look at us as Ireland — they come to travel around and visit both regions on the island — often coming in via Dublin and then travelling up. If there is a decline in the number of visitors into the Republic of Ireland — this will have a knock-on negative effect on tourism in Northern Ireland and vice versa. What is more there is already evidence that the economic uncertainty is leading people to tighten their purse strings and to reduce their discretionary spending — which of course also impacts on the tourism sector. These negative effects are already happening before we crash out with a no-deal Brexit which is likely to cause a further slump to Sterling, continuing economic uncertainty — and oh, did I mention, a hard border! For the tourism sector at least, a no-deal Brexit amounts to what I would call rubbing salt on a wound. This article was originally published in the Belfast Telegraph on 13th August 2019."

Medium.com,Society,Is There Going To Be A Gas Crisis?,World,https://medium.com/swlh/is-there-going-to-be-a-gas-crisis-c3241fa03cb1?source=topic_page---------677------------------1," Which had been preceded by just a few minutes by this: So now it all may come down to what Trump means by “locked and loaded”, and who exactly he’s threatening. (And also a general — and we think fair — characterization that when Trump says everything’s great IN ALL CAPS, it probably isn’t). Also, since when does the U.S. wait until “the Kingdom” tells us “under what terms we would proceed”? Can the Saudis not do a counter-strike on their own, if that’s what they want to do? They’ve got all this military equipment the U.S. sold them. Houthi rebels in Yemen took credit for the weekend drone attack, which effectively knocked out 6% of the world’s oil supply. Iran supports those rebels in Yemen, although the Iranian government denied any direct involvement in the attack. Saudi TV says no workers were killed in the attack. The attack also deeply embarrassed the Saudis who are currently trying to sell shares in their giant national oil company to global investors. We think this part of the story is being significantly under-reported, especially since just a couple of days ago, Saudi Arabia replaced its oil minister and Chairman of the Saudi national oil company, Aramco, with the half-brother, and a close friend of Crown Prince Mohammad bin Salman, respectively. In order to pull off the public offering of stock, Aramco has also been looking for ways to get oil in the $60–70 barrel range, instead of $50–60, where it’s been for a while. So this is a real test for Trump, especially since the President has proven himself to be very sensitive to changes in the price of gas at the pump, often giving himself credit for low gas prices. And sudden military action (or even the threat of it), certainly isn’t going to help with that. It’s something that really has to be handled pretty delicately, and even if you feel Trump has some strengths on the world stage, you’ve got to agree he doesn’t do “delicate”. Still, he was unusually coy in his Tweet; not directly naming a culprit, even though his own Secretary of State, Mike Pompeo called out Iran by name almost immediately following the attack. (Also, the last time we remember the President Tweeting the phrase “locked and loaded”, it was aimed at North Korea and Kim Jong-un, which ended in a cordial relationship. But the players are different here, with very different objectives). Since the attacks took place over the weekend, oil markets hadn’t really had a chance to react until this morning. At time of publication of this newsletter, global crude oil prices are way up and swinging wildly. The price of a barrel of the most commonly traded type of oil soaring close to 20%, the biggest one day surge ever, putting a barrel of oil well above $70 at one point, before settling for a bit to a gain of 10%, on absence of additional news. But on any “normal” day, that’d be huge in itself. Although U.S. markets haven’t opened yet, West Texas Crude is up about 10%. According to the AAA, the nationwide average for a gallon of regular gas right now is $2.56. So even though crude and unleaded gas prices don’t always run exactly in parallel, and there are a lot of other factors that go into pricing, let’s do our own unscientific guesstimate: tack on 10% or maybe a little more, and you’re perhaps looking at something close to $3.00 a gallon in the near future. The President Tweeted that he’d tap into the U.S. Strategic Petroleum Reserve if needed to lessen any impact. But mostly that just sounds good. That reserve would only last for about a month without replenishment or severe rationing (neither of which we expect). So as we said, that’s mainly just for show for now. Saudis say they will have the attacked plant up and running again by today at 1/3 to 1/2 capacity, and will mitigate the impact by filling orders with supplies they already have sitting around elsewhere, which they will then slowly replenish, thus reducing the possibility of shortages, at least not right away. Officials promise an announcement sometime tomorrow on their progress. That could make all the difference to financial markets, and gas prices. Beyond the immediate impact, and imminent consequences, there are quite a few decisive factors that will determine how much all this will mean to the everyday lives of Americans. Things that could make everyday-life-in-the-U.S.-impact not-so-bad: Things that could make everyday-life-in-the-U.S. impact a lot worse: When you buy a gallon of gas, you’re not always just buying a gallon of gas; in times of turmoil, you’re also paying for the uncertainty of future supplies. So if it looks like these drone attacks weren’t just a one time thing, or somebody’s headed to war with someone, prices absolutely could spike. Not so much because there’s a threat of a shortage immediately, but due to a lack of visibility about the future. So by all means, fill up that tank today, and take public transportation or carpool to work for a few days if you can, until we all get a better read on where this is headed. Why not? Gas prices are definitely going to go up. There’s no question about that. How much and for how long, and at what cost (and we don’t just mean money), won’t be clear for a while."
Medium.com,Society,Brazil’s tourism marketing fail,World,https://medium.com/swlh/brazils-tourism-marketing-fail-b9dbbe35c1c6?source=topic_page---------678------------------1," “Brazil, visit and love us” is an embarrassing slogan Embratur or Brazilian Tourism Institute is the name of a special department of the Ministry of Tourism of Brazil. They have recently unveiled the new slogan to promote Brazil abroad, “Brazil, visit and love us”. The slogan was accused of promoting sex tourism, as well as containing a number of errors ranging from grammar to basic marketing. “The slogan seems to want to unfold the old motto ‘love it or leave it’, in a kind of intertextuality with the military period” says Sérgio Tavares Filho, PhD in Digital Culture from the University of Jyväskylä and senior consultant at Idean. The slogan “Love it or leave it” was created in the 1969 by the counterinsurgency unit Operação Bandeirantes (OBAN) inspired in the “love it or leave it” motto used in the US during the Vietnam War. The slogan was popularised at the beginning of the government of the then dictator Emílio Garrastazu Médici (1969–1974), one of the periods of greatest repression of the military dictatorship that lasted from 1964 to 1985. The phrase, along with others like “Nobody can hold back this country”, “You Build Brazil”, “Brazil Deserves our Love” or the song “Forward Brazil [Hail our National Football Team]” sung during the 1970 Football World Cup in which Brazil became three-time world champion, was used to encourage patriotism and to send a message to those unhappy with the regime amid a period known as “economic miracle” in which the country was going through a phase of economic growth and technological advances — and to mask the tortures in police stations and military facilities as well as the tremendous and persistent economic inequality in the country Tavares adds that the slogan also doesn’t work in English and “there is an unquestionable ambiguity in the slogan; the reference to sex tourism. A good marketing professional always exploits the good ambiguities and questions the inadequate ones, to choose the best ones” — that is not the case here. To make matters worse, the typography (Fontastique) was created by a graphic artist, Benoit Sjöholm, who lives in France and did not give permission for its use by the Brazilian government. “The typography is free to download on the internet for non-commercial use and Embratur used the typographic type without being aware of their license,” explains Angelo Souza, Brazilian graphic designer. The federal tourism agency confirmed the mistake to newspaper Folha de São Paulo informing they will make changes to the typography. For experts and ordinary citizens manifesting on social media, the use of “z” in Brazil instead of the common form in Portuguese, with “s”, would also be a problem, a disrespect to the national symbols and a significative change from the previous brand. However, the biggest criticisms were due to the supposed sexual connotation of the phrase “visit and love us”. In English the pronoun -it- is used for things, places and animals, but there’s no equivalence in Portuguese, therefore the use of -us- makes sense in Portuguese, but not in English. Also, a literal translation would possibly make the verb -love- refer to a sexual act to any English-speaker. Americas Quarterly editor-in-chief Brian Winter tweeted that “the slogan is creepy and embarrassing and any international consultant — or native English speaker — could have told them that”. To make things worse, Brazil is already a major hotspot for sex tourism and several local governments have tried their best to tackle the issue. Embratur’s original idea was to translate the phrase “visite e encante-se” that in English would read “visit and be enchanted” or “visit and be amazed” — without any possible sexual or geopolitical connotation — but they have failed to do so. Not to mention the use of “us” might be misunderstood for the U.S. — curiously, the relationship between the current Brazilian government, led by far-right Jair Bolsonaro, and Donald Trump’s U.S. is the closest in the past two decades decade. Souza explains that “the symbolic brand of a country embraces a semiotic complexity that dialogues [with] its sociocultural diversity, being an image capable of constructing and deconstructing concepts and showing the personality of its people, combining the symbolic assumptions of cultural identity and dialoguing with the notion of state, country and nationality,” but in Embratur’s new brand “the semiotic aspect of the state prevailed over all cultural aspects.” One of the most significant aspects of Bolsonaro’s government is the attempt to bring back the memory of the military dictatorship (the president has often openly defended the regime and even practices such as torture), and the official slogan of Brazilian tourism could not be different, with a “childish representation of the Brazilian flag that reminds us of the 1970’s brand, which promoted the Brazilian woman [thus, sex tourism] and carnival,” adds Souza. Ricardo Freire, former publicist and writer specialized in travel, wrote a long article on his website explaining some of the main mistakes of the new Embratur brand. “The new ‘Brazil’ brand is an embarrassment to Brazilian design. It was proudly announced as having been made internally, in a short time, saving public money. All these qualities are well evidenced in the result: it is amateur, unfinished and poor,” he said. The Brazilian flag, says Freire, “applied as a mere civic symbol to our tourism brand [and] adds absolutely nothing to what the lettering already informs: it is a Brazilian brand.” According to Embratur, the flag was inspired by the rose of the winds, but it doesn’t convey an idea of movement as “it is necessary to explain to the receiver that the flag is a stylized rose of the winds,” explains Freire Both Freire and Souza agree that the previous brand, from 2004, “represented the Brazilian diversity much better,” says Souza and “it was the fruit of a very rich planning,” sentences Freire, even though, he explains, he’s encountered several problems with the old brand. It is not clear if Embratur will search only the use of the fount, or if it will rethink the whole idea, but the fact is that the negative opinions of specialists and ordinary Brazilians accumulate and the choice of a bad branding can damage the image of the country abroad."
Medium.com,Society,Venezuela and the Rules of Capitalist Development,World,https://medium.com/@ksyed81088/venezuela-and-the-rules-of-capitalist-development-ed2116f1a6fd?source=topic_page---------679------------------1," I’ve been wanting to find a good way to talk about imperialism, the world system, and prospects for development in the periphery — and unfortunately, talking about the current economic crisis in Venezuela is a clear case where all of these factors coalesce in an explicit manner. Since around 2015, Venezuela has been suffering from hyperinflation, shortages of food and medicine, massive unemployment and poverty. According to the IMF, unemployment hit 44% in 2019. How did Venezuela get to this point? Was it all due to the failure of socialism as an ideology as the right claims? Or was it purely US imperialism, as some on the left declare? Most importantly, how can the people of Venezuela escape this situation and survive? These are complex questions that require some analysis on multiple levels: we need to understand the general limits of capitalism and see how they apply to development. In doing so, we will find that there are both internal and external, local and global constraints. During this Chavez-Maduro era, what Venezuela did actually try to do is implement some degree of social democracy in Venezuela. Due to its mass base of support among the poor and working classes, the Venezuelan state under Chavez and then Maduro attempted to protect the wage share for workers and keep the rate of exploitation in check — even lower it. When times were good and oil prices were high, this was possible without much negative consequences, even though Chavez did not come to power in a revolution that totally expropriated the ruling class. However as oil prices fell, import prices rose, state revenue declined, and the state printed money to pay its large public debt — all leading to crushing hyperinflation. That point about Chavez not having come to power via a workers revolution is the important piece here. As long as the capitalist class maintain their position in Venezuelan society, it’s their rules that inevitably have to be followed. Oil prices fell and profits got squeezed, not just in the oil sector but throughout the private sector. This has caused massive divestment and capital flight by the capitalist class, who have appealed to their alliance with the US and global capital to turn things around. The US has acted by imposing sanctions and backing what has so far been a failed coup by the right. However, the Maduro administration has also severely discredited itself by not only its mismanagement of the economy but also because of its violent and heavy handed suppression of dissent — and with so many starving people, dissent is not exclusively coming from the capitalist class. I don’t want to get into a discussion about the complexity and heterogeneity of the Venezuelan opposition here — as an anarchist I oppose the Maduro regime just as I would oppose any state; my focus here is a bit more technical. From a purely economic standpoint, what could have gone differently?"
Medium.com,Society,The British working class is a rainbow of diversity: to claim otherwise is dangerous and wrong,World,https://medium.com/@OwenJones84/the-british-working-class-is-a-rainbow-of-diversity-to-claim-otherwise-is-dangerous-and-wrong-138ca4159c6?source=topic_page---------680------------------1," It is a fact that is rarely commented on, but until relatively recently, the working class had been widely erased as a social and political category. In the 1990s and 2000s, the dominant mantra in politics and media alike was “we are all middle class now”. The crushing of organised labour, the apparent hegemony of rugged individualism, the end of the Cold War — portrayed as the absolute historical victory of capitalism red in tooth and claw — and New Labour’s surrender to Thatcherite tenets seemed to render class to historical irrelevance. That was Margaret Thatcher’s avowed aim: as she once wrote, “Class is a Communist concept. It groups people as bundles and sets them against one another.” No-one reads the funeral rites of class anymore, including on the right. After Theresa May become became Prime Minister, her first Conference speech was littered with references to “ordinary working-class people” and “ordinary, working class families.” UKIP and its Brexit Party successor relentlessly trumpet the language of class, with the likes of Nigel Farage claiming that “the Labour Party used to represent the working class. Now they are the party of Remain.” Apologies for being that guy who quotes back his own work, but this reactionary reformulation of class is something I have longed feared. In 2010, I wrote the following in Chavs: The Demonisation of the Working Class: “The danger is of a savvy new populist right emerging, one that is comfortable talking about class and offers reactionary solutions to working-class problems. It could denounce the demonisation of the working class and the trashing of its identity. It could claim that the traditional party of working-class people, the Labour party, has turned its back on them. “Rather than focusing on the deep-seated economic issues that really underpin the grievances of working-class people, it could train its populist guns on immigration and cultural issues. Immigrants could be blamed for economic woes; multiculturalism could be blasted for undermining ‘white’ working-class identity.” This is exactly what happened, of course. But this formulation of class identity does not only exist on the right. The idea that the emblem of working-class Britain in 2019 is a white, middle-aged straight man in an industrial occupation in a small Midlands town who holds socially conservative views finds its reflection on the left, too. (NB: Do such men exist, and do Labour need to win them over? Yes. Are they emblematic of the working class in 2019 at the exclusion of others? No.) It was most notoriously championed by the ‘Blue Labour’ tendency, whose slogan was “family, faith and flag” — and also finds torchbearers on the self-described radical left, too. Bear with me for this anecdote. A few weeks ago, both me and Novara Media editor Ash Sarkar were invited to speak at a rally organised by the People’s Assembly. As it turned out, I’d double booked, but I was lobbied particularly by BME activists to withdraw, which Ash quickly did. The reason: the presence of RMT activist Eddie Dempsey, who once argued that “the one thing that unites” those who turn up at Tommy Robinson protests “is their hatred of the liberal left. And they are right to hate them.” Now we socialists have our own critique of the “liberal left” — principally their support for market economics — but that is not what Tommy Robinson supporters (or “fascists”, to use shorthand) hate them for. No, it is for having perceived anti-racist, pro-migrant, anti-Islamophobia politics. What makes it even more egregious is that Dempsey folds anyone on the left who isn’t pro-Brexit into his “liberal left” category, including both myself and Ash Sarkar. We were expected to stand as an ally with someone who believes fascists are right to hate us. For those of us at risk of violence from Tommy Robinson’s fascist supporters for espousing our socialist politics — indeed the last People’s Assembly protest I spoke at, they surrounded me chanting “Jonesy as a homo” then attempted to punch me in the face — it is a lot to ask us to stand together as comrades and allies with an individual who believes these hateful thugs are right to hate us. (We’ve since been accused of ‘no platforming’ Dempsey, including by the right-wing libertarian Spiked website, and Sarkar was inundated with racist abuse: in actual fact, we simply disinvited ourselves — no-one is forced to share a platform — and turned down an offer by the protest organisers to remove Dempsey as a speaker). Dempsey’s perverse argument rests on the assumption that Tommy Robinson’s supporters represent a meaningful, if wrongheaded, constituency of working-class Britain. It is a belief which should have been put to bed by this convicted fraudster, thug and grifter getting 2.2% of the vote in the North West during the European elections: most working class people detest this far-right businessman. An even more extreme worldview is expounded by Dempsey’s ally Paul Embery — a pro-Brexit union activist suspended by the Fire Brigades Union’s national executive — who opposes equal marriage, believing it alienates “traditional Labour voters”, opposes trans rights, and claimed that Labour’s demand for revoking Geoffrey Boycott’s knighthood on account of his domestic abuse conviction had “alienated the whole of Yorkshire.” But this caricature of working-class identity is simply not based on the facts. Take Brexit: a debate often simplistically portrayed as Leave = working class, Remain = middle class. This is partly because of a ‘ABC1C2DE’ social classification system which has a lot to answer for: ABC1 lumps FTSE 100 board members in with public sector workers as ‘middle class’, while C2DE — which is weighted towards pensioners — is used as a working-class social indicator. But even using this profoundly flawed system, most working-class people under 35 and working class BME people voted for Remain. We are told that “the Labour heartlands voted Leave”: why Liverpool, Manchester or indeed London are excluded from “Labour heartlands” is not explained. Where does the Scottish working class fit in all of this? As for social conservatism: previous research has found that working-class people were more pro-gay rights than their middle-class counterparts. This is a bombshell, I know, but working-class people are also gay, lesbian, bisexual or trans, and indeed many ‘gay villages’ have an overtly working-class ethos. We often hear “white working class” bandied around, when working class communities and workplaces are the most likely to be mixed — see: urban working-class communities in Manchester, Birmingham, Glasgow or London — yet never hear about “the white middle class”, a term more suitable for many middle-class professionals or suburban communities in, say, Surrey. It is impossible to talk about the reality of the modern working class by excluding the lived experiences of minorities and migrants, disproportionately concentrated in the lowest paid, most insecure and least prestigious occupations. The modern working class is a rainbow: and a conception which excludes a young black shop assistant in Hackney, or a gay public sector worker in Sunderland, is not one based on truth. We often hear “identity politics” used pejoratively to suggest the struggles of minorities and women for their right are on a collision course with working class interests. But women and minorities represent a majority of the working class: there is no true liberation until, for example, working-class women are liberated from both class and gender oppression. The ascendant right-wing populism of our time relishes reconceptualising class, focusing not on the economic exploitation of labour inherent in capitalism, but rather on a socially conservative class slighted by a rootless pro-migrant middle class left. It is a narrative based on myths and distortions, serving to advance an agenda which divides working-class people and communities and ultimately only serves the interests of capital. Its dangerous echoes on the left must be challenged and defeated, too."

Medium.com,Society,A Common Fight Against Climate Change and Authoritarianism,World,https://medium.com/@rkefferputz/a-common-fight-against-climate-change-and-authoritarianism-90cb0965c9ee?source=topic_page---------682------------------1," Three people, three places on three different August days: They are people whose names are not particularly internationally known at that time. But they inspired people. They sparked social movements and triggered a dynamic. Joshua, 22 years old, is the head of the protest movement in Hong Kong. Greta, 17 years old, is an icon in the fight against climate change. Yegor Zhukov, 21 years old, is a symbolic figure of the Moscow protests. What unites these young movements? The fight against lacking prospects, the struggle for a liveable, free future. In Hong Kong, people are fighting against a Chinese ruling system that robs freedom — a system of digital total surveillance and an extradition law that would allow Beijing to arrest Hong Kong citizens and let them stew in some mainland dungeon. In Moscow we have seen the biggest protest movement for “honest elections” in years. It is thanks to these people that the liberal opposition faction Yabloko has finally returned to the Moscow City Council. And in many European cities schoolchildren are protesting for a future worth living, against climate change and the failure of adults to meet this challenge. Authoritarianism and climate change do not offer bright prospects for the future. And it is difficult to negotiate with both. Lacking prospects is poison. It touches the inner human core. It robs freedom and meaning. Life can be many things, but not meaningless. For this very reason these movements are emancipatory in nature. And perhaps that is why they are so pronounced in youth. Young people fight for their freedom to lead a self-determined, meaningful life in a world worth living in. They are sacrificing their present for a better future. It is Joshua Wong against Xi Jinping and his struggle for human rights. It is Yegor Zhukov against Putin and his struggle for free elections and a secure rule of law. It is Greta Thunberg against Trump and her struggle for an intact environment. Freedom and ecology are linked. You cannot play them off against each other as a major German newspaper recently did with the question “What is more important — climate or freedom”. Anyone who asks this question has understood neither climate change nor authoritarianism. Both climate change and authoritarianism destroy life realities. Freedom decreases with climate change. And ambitious climate protection will not be possible if it robs freedom. Authoritarianism cannot be an answer in the name of climate protection. Climate protection is a global challenge that seeks global, cooperative, rule-based answers that all adhere to. Authoritarianism is a firm, closed, introverted system that does not focus on global cooperation, but only on systemic self-preservation. Those who believe that authoritarianism is necessary to save the world also believe that the Soviet Union must have been a socialist paradise on earth….it wasn’t. Authoritarianism and climate change are therefore of the same nature — they challenge society. Those who do not stop climate change will lose freedom, because climate change is destructive. Those who do not stop authoritarianism will lose the fight against climate change, because authoritarianism is destructive. No nature, no future. No freedom, no future. Autocrats have nothing to do with climate change because autocrats are only concerned with themselves and their power. China is not an ecological pioneer, but the world’s biggest polluter. Bolsonaro is not an eco-warrior but is deforesting the Amazon and won’t let anybody stop him. Putin is not a climate fanatic, but a climate denier. Trump leaves the Paris Agreement because he sees international cooperation as a limitation of power. Joshua, Greta, Yegor are their liberal opponents. They are not authoritarian leaders of protest movements. They don’t command troops, they inspire people. Greta Thunberg is an icon, not a climate commander. Joshua Wong regularly asserts that he is “not the leader of this movement”. And Yegor Zhukov is a libertarian symbolic figure. They are role models. The youth movements are, as in the new Netflix Series “The Dark Crystal: Age of Resistence”, the Gelflings that fight against the authoritarian rule of the Skeksis and for the preservation of their world Thra. The fight for a world worth living in is a fight against climate change and a fight against authoritarianism. Both are systemic challenges for liberal democracy in the 21st century and intertwine. The fight against climate change can also be a meaningful, joint project for liberal democracy that brings people together and gives a purpose. Even if an authoritarian spirit sleeps in some young, perhaps naïve, climate protesters, I am hopeful that we are witnessing the growing up of a new generation that fights for liberal democracy. Authoritarianism cannot be an answer to a global challenge that requires creativity, cooperation and compromise."
Medium.com,Society,HK’s M2/GDP Ratio is the HIGHEST in the World,World,https://medium.com/@edwardyiu/hks-m2-gdp-ratio-is-the-highest-in-the-world-86a26a6cbb99?source=topic_page---------683------------------1," In recent years, the coherence of economic parameters between Hong Kong and Mainland China has become more and more obvious. Various economic sectors of Hong Kong are mainly serving the Mainland China economy, including the stock market, tourism industry, retail and wholesale, education markets and logistics and freight industries. The economy of Hong Kong has become highly regionalized, and farther away from internationalization. The advantages of Hong Kong in the Greater Bay Area are gradually lost. At the same time, the contagious effects between Hong Kong’s and the Mainland economies are more serious, and the financial and asset bubbles of the two are interlinked. The risks are getting higher and higher. For example, since the international financial turmoil in 2008, the US’s three rounds of QE and China’s 4 trillion RMB flooded the markets, which has caused China’s total debt to rise sharply. In just 10 years time, China has become one of the world’s most debt-ridden countries. According to the Institute of International Finance (IIF), China’s total debt (including households, enterprises and national debts) in the first quarter of 2019 accounted for 303% of GDP, exceeding the international alarming threshold. The amount of China’s total debt exceeds 40 trillion US dollars, accounting for 15% of global debt [1], which is certainly an international concern. However, we often overlook Hong Kong. Hong Kong, being China’s most important capital flowing window and with the advantages of a free circulation of international currencies and currency exchange rate stability, many Chinese companies issue bonds, especially foreign exchange bonds, in Hong Kong. The bank/corporate debt situation of Hong Kong is therefore inevitably directly affected by China’s corporate debts. Last week, my article [2] has analyzed that “the loans from the banks of Hong Kong to mainland China exceeded HK$4,000 billion, … Hong Kong’s total debt accounts to GDP ratio exceeds 300%! It is even higher than that of China. The situation of HK is worrying.” Corporate debt has exceeded 200% (Figure 1). Another economic indicator that has received much attention in recent years is the M2/GDP ratio. Many analyses use this as an indicator of the capability of a country’s productivity growth. If the ratio is low, it implies a high efficiency of each supply of money or loan as far as GDP growth is concerned. In contrast, if the ratio is much higher than one, it indicates that the increase in money supply or debt is less effective in increasing the output value. As early as 2013, Reuters quoted an article published by the Governor of Bank of China [4] pointing out that China must reform to reduce M2/GDP levels. At that time, China’s M2/GDP ratio (in 2012) was only 188%, but it has already been the highest in the world’s major economies. Then, China’s M2 continued to grow at a rate of almost 13% per year, but it could only make about 10% of GDP growth. Unfortunately, after seven years of hard work, China’s M2/GDP ratio has not been reduced. Instead, it has surged to more than 200% continuously and has been becoming one of the highest M2/GDP countries in the world. According to the World Bank database, China’s Broad-money/GDP has risen sharply since 1997, rising from around 160% to 199% in 2018 (up to 209% in 2016). On the contrary, the US’s M2/GDP ratio manages to remain lower than 1. The Broad-money/GDP ratio of the US in 2018 was about 89.5% (Figure 2). However, one may overlook Hong Kong’s role in China’s debt and economic output. When China’s Broad-money/GDP rose to about 200%, Hong Kong has become the world’s highest Broad-money/GDP ratio economy, with a value of 384.757% in 2018. ! If China needs to increase its debt by $2 to promote $1 growth of the GDP, then Hong Kong needs to increase its debt by about $4 to promote $1 growth of the GDP. This may reflect the fact that the flow of hot money into Hong Kong is not for improving productivity, but for speculation in stocks and assets. Even though the efficiency of increasing debts to promote GDP growth is getting lower and lower, when the government has no other better alternatives to help increase the productivity, many governments cannot resist the temptation of using more debt growth to help stop a recession or to help boost the economy, disregarding any adverse consequences of piling up too much debts. Figure 3 shows the relationship between Hong Kong’s M2 annual growth rate and quarterly GDP annual growth rate. The positive correlation between the two is very obvious. Most of the time, M2 growth (red line) is higher than GDP growth (blue line), but their up and down cycles are tracking each other closely, except during the 2008 international financial turmoil when there was a countercyclical phenomenon. That is when GDP has fallen sharply, but M2 was still growing substantially. In recent years, M2 growth is clearly ahead of GDP growth. It is obvious that the rise in GDP is dependent on the rise in debt. Although the total amount of M2 and GDP in China in 2018 is 13 and 30 times that of Hong Kong, the annual changes of the two are very similar, especially the annual rate of change of the nominal economic output of the two economies (Figure 4). After the fall of the financial turmoil, the output value of the two economies rebounded simultaneously. China’s output value growth rate rose to 20%, and Hong Kong’s rebounded to 10%, which was the period of the highest economic output growth in the past decade. Since 2012, the growth rates of output value of the two economies have dropped by half to 10% and 5%. In 2016, we had the lowest growth year of nearly ten years. After the rebound in 2017, they have both fallen back since 2019. The patterns reflect the high correlation in inflation and economic growth between the two economies! In terms of M2, although the correlation between the two is not as high as in GDP, except during the 2008 period when there were the bailout measures of 4 trillion yuan in China after 2008, but Hong Kong has implemented a tightening fiscal policy. It is noted that China’s M2 annual growth rate is much higher than that of Hong Kong, which is about 5.2% higher in recent years. The cyclical pattern of M2 in Hong Kong is more obvious. The economic slowdown in 2008, 2012 and 2016 coincides with the slowdown in M2 growth. China’s M2 growth rate has been falling since 2009, falling from 29% all the way to 8.3% in the first quarter of 2019, but by international standards, it is still a very high growth rate in money supply. Furthermore, M2yoy/GDPyoy ratio is also greater than one, which makes the money supply efficiency doubtful. Due to the high correlation between economic links and Hong Kong’s emergence as a small free economy, Hong Kong’s inflation has become imported inflation. Therefore, the high correlation between inflation in the two economies is also expected. Figures 6 and 7 show the inflation rates of the two economies over the past decade. Although Hong Kong’s inflation rate is more volatile than that of China, it is basically similar in terms of the cycle and magnitude, including a deflationary period around 2009, then a peak period of high inflation around 2011 (with inflation rates exceeding 6%). Then, it fell back to a low of 2% around 2017. The inflation rates in the second quarter of 2019 were both around 3%. Hong Kong’s inflation and economic output are highly correlated with China’s, but because of the linked exchange rate, Hong Kong’s interest rates and exchange rates must basically follow the United States, so there are often mismatches, resulting in abnormal real interest rates, causing a large number of hot money suddenly flow in or out, for speculation purposes. This is the real interest rate theory that I have been using to explain the long-term rise or fall in property prices in Hong Kong.

Medium.com,Society,Merthyr’s March for Independence,World,https://medium.com/@boxcymru/merthyrs-march-for-independence-906c653d718b?source=topic_page---------685------------------1," An account of an afternoon in the ‘crucible of protest’ Saturday 7th September marked Wales’ third march for independence, the second I’d attended myself, and the first in the valleys of the south Wales coalfields. Having been born and raised twenty minutes and a mountain or two away, I confess that during the build up I felt as if I had something of a personal stake in its success; I was apprehensive. The second march in Caernarfon had more than doubled the figure of the inaugural effort in the capital, and while the optimist in me wanted to continue the trend, the pessimist had other ideas. Independence has long been a political dream for many in the Welsh speaking heartlands of Gwynedd but the same is not necessarily true for Merthyr Tudful. For me to consider the day a success in terms of turnout I felt it had to surpass that of our capital city, back all those weeks ago when the less confident may have stayed away for fear of being the only ones to turn up (they needn’t have worried.) I spoke with a friend who was also uneasy about the location of the march, uncomfortable with the idea that all of Merthyr’s passionate Welsh people would be imports for the day — he himself was from Aberystwyth. Was the march somehow imposing itself on a place that wasn’t willing to welcome it? He was wrong about everyone being imports, of course; I was there, along with my family and a number of friends. Throughout the day I bumped into local faces I hadn’t expected to see — some of whom I never would have expected to harbour hopes of independence. There were people on doorsteps with flags (and one with a water bowl for the marching dogs!) and banners and accents from towns and villages close enough to consider Cyfarthfa their local retail park. But I understood his point. There were so many wonderful groups from all over Wales that the local ones were hard to spot. There were the travelling football fans from all over the country, stopping by on the way home as they looked to regain some optimism after the previous night’s victory that felt like a defeat. Many, if not most people there were Welsh speaking, increasing the value of the experience for those of us who rarely get to hear it spoken as a community language, but ensuring the march did not feel like a ‘local’ event. But then for me it wasn’t supposed to. Everywhere you looked there were banners celebrating Glyndŵr, advocating a republic or expressing solidarity with Catalonia or Scotland. Seeing the myriad flags, the town flooded with red, hearing the language, the language that belongs to every one of us — Merthyr has never felt so Welsh and rarely so positive. Of course there are many Welsh speakers in the valleys and I do not mean to dismiss them (my children, and to some extent myself, are among their ranks), but this was more than just an increase in numbers: its prevalence transformed the sensation of what it is to be Welsh in Merthyr. Acting as an unsubtle metaphor for Welshness in general, for one day it wasn’t a private thing, hidden away in the subconscious, rarely spoke of in public. It was expressed openly, proudly and with intent, and — above all — naturally. This was Welsh in Merthyr, as it should be; the language, the sense of identity. And it was great. Trying to put myself in the position of someone outside the movement with little interest in politics, it’s still hard to image how such an event could emit anything other than a positive ethos. How could having such a vocally inclusive event, right on my doorstep, make me feel anything other than involved? And when the media refuses to amplify the voices of those who challenge the status quo, what better way to advertise your aims than by putting the streets of your audience on the telly and in the papers? It was never going to get the coverage it deserved but it couldn’t be ignored: Merthyr was in the news and for once it wasn’t in relation to deprivation or austerity. Merthyr is a town bustling with potential and for once the whole country got to see it; for me that can only be a good thing for the hopes of the movement locally. The sun shone as the march concluded with some wonderful speeches, hosted by with humour Phyl Griffiths . Delyth Jewell showed impressive oratory skills, Catrin Dafydd spoke as always with passion and ambition, while Ian Black offered much appreciated support from our Celtic cousins in Scotland. We were treated to poems by Patrick Jones and Mike Jenkins, each expressing the inclusivity that for me this movement is all about. (All of the speeches are available on the Nation.Cymru website here.) But regrettably (and with no disrespect intended) these are not names that are likely to draw an interest from people hitherto uninterested in the cause. One of the most powerful aids in recruiting those who pay little attention to politics (precisely those who we need to convince if we want the movement to achieve anything) is the endorsement of a celebrity. Unfortunately, this is the reality we live in. Fortunately, we had two of them in the shape of Welsh sporting legends. Neville Southall, one of the greatest goalkeepers of his generation, has long been a supporter of charitable causes and has amassed a bit of a cult following on Twitter. He is also a vocal supporter of Welsh independence. ‘Big Nev’ opened by referring to Boris Johnson as the ‘complete homophobic, racist, sexist idiot in Westminster’; the cheers from the crowd reassured me that I was surrounded by politically like-minded people. His words were laced with the theme of an independent Wales needing to look after those positioned ‘lowest’ in society, along with more general praise for Wales littered with hyperbole, all received approvingly by the crowd. This wasn’t just anyone talking, it was Big Nev, a man whose posters once adorned walls all over the country. But the highlight for me and many others was Eddie Butler. I’ll write that one more time, because it’s still hard to believe: Eddie Butler. Welsh rugby captain in the early eighties, his career perhaps didn’t reach the heights of his footballing counterpart but he has a constant contemporary presence on the BBC’s rugby coverage. His voice, deep and benign, is instantly recognisable, his always carefully chosen words delivered with authority. But the Cambridge educated man is also, for many, one of the last Welsh celebrities likely to come out in support of independence; and that’s why his advocacy is such an important gain. I’ve watched rugby with more than a few fans who have accused him of being anti-Welsh in his commentary, particularly when offering over-enthusiastic compliments to impressive English play or agreeing with his English colleagues. Personally I have always thought that, in addition to a healthy ability to be objective, there are often sarcastic tones that go unnoticed (particularly when conceding points to Brian Moore, who incidentally supports his decision to back independence.) In any case the effort he puts into writing a montage should be enough to convince anyone he loves Wales. But for him to go as far as coming out in favour of independence? I was as shocked and thrilled as everyone else within the movement. He opened by describing Merthyr as a ‘crucible of protest’, solidifying what was by now my opinion that this was a perfect setting. He was ‘amazed and dismayed’ that the spirit of defiance he experienced during his playing career had been confined to the sports field. His was one of the more grounded speeches, recalling his family’s affinity for the union during the war, before declaring that ‘the United Kingdom that made my parents proud to call themselves British no longer exists’. He spoke of the dangers of the kind of rhetoric being normalised by UK politics, warning that anyone looking ‘for extreme ideologies’ should ‘look no further than Westminster.’ The solution cannot be timid; ‘devolution is no revolution’, he said, as he again celebrated Merthyr as the ‘birthplace of an uprising’. Towards the end of the speeches we heard a beautiful rendition of Calon Lân by two local and incredibly talented artists in the form of Kizzy and Eädyth Crawford. They returned to lead us in singing the national anthem to round off a successful afternoon. Of course it could have gone better. The valleys may have outdone their city rivals but we can no longer say support is growing exponentially with each march; I can only imagine what it would have been like to have 20,000 attendees as they did in Perth. In terms of celebrities we could have gone bigger — had Gareth Bale led the march we’d be independent by the end of the week. More seriously there has been criticism that little action has been taken to actively prevent any potentially racist or fascist factions from attending the marches. All of the (beautiful, poetic) talk of equality and inclusivity cannot be allowed to be seen as mere virtue signalling — practical steps need to be taken to ensure that any independent Wales will be intolerant of intolerance. But the movement is young, and the space exists to continue improving for as long as there is will. As everyone dissipated into the surrounding Merthyr streets the positive energy remained. It remains too when Welsh independence is examined in juxtaposition with the increasingly racist, xenophobic, homophobic, misogynistic rule of a seemingly perpetual Tory Westminster elite. For many in attendance this was a rally against the right. And Merthyr was the right place to do it."
Medium.com,Society,How Public Information Leaks are Exploited — a Case in HK?,World,https://medium.com/@edwardyiu/how-public-information-leaks-are-exploited-a-case-in-hk-aed14e15d225?source=topic_page---------686------------------1," Senior government officials own a very valuable asset, that is the information of their decisions. There have been some cases of information leaks from government officials or their allies, that was related to some unethical personal financial benefits, yet legal. The following is another allegation happened in Hong Kong this month. When everyone thought that the Hong Kong Chief Executive (CE) finally made a concession under political pressure by publicly announcing to withdraw the Fugitive Offenders (Amendment) Bill in the evening of September 4. Then, the Development Bureau, on September 11, also responded to the press inquiry that they changed their mind now and did not oppose using land resumption any more for the development of public housing. It seems to be a positive response to the long pursued public request. However, intriguingly, all these decisions were leaked before the formal announcement or the formal response. These leaks are alleged to probably have facilitated her friends and allies to benefit from insider trading in the stock market! According to the Ming Pao’s two-day reports [1][2], before the CE officially announced the news, the information probably had already been released to her allies, as the stock price surged substantially before the news was released. It is reported that some unusual transactions were found by a “white glove” fund manager in the week before the announcement, on the three real estate stocks: SHK (0016), Henderson Land (0012) and Champion REIT (2778). It is estimated that, at the current share price, the transactions amount to about 0.145 billion yuan.” [1] In addition to the “white gloves” transactions, the stock market also had an unusual surge in the stock market on the day before the news was released. On September 4, when the stock market opened, “it surged 300 points, many people thought that was due to the encouraging economic data from China, until the market opened in the afternoon, some net media began to report that the CE urgently called the members of National People’s Congress, the CPPCC members and some lawmakers of the pro-establishment camp, to meet at the Government House at 4 o’clock, preparing probably for a formal withdrawal of the amendments. In the wake of the Hong Kong government’s first concession in the past few months, Hang Seng Index immediately rose by a thousand points. Property stocks such as Wharf Real Estate (1997) and SHKP (0016) all rose a lot, and it is roughly estimated that the market value of the market had increased by at least several tens of billion yuan,…” (translated from [2]) Figure 1 shows the change in the Hang Seng Index from August 12 to September 11. According to the analysis of the South China Morning Post [3], the Hang Seng Index was “ending September 3 at 25,528. Amazingly, on September 4, the market opened up half a per cent at 9.30am and, within two minutes, it was already up 1.2 per cent at 25,835. It held this level for the rest of the morning and through lunch, and then, at 1.55pm, it began to climb steeply. The market rose another 2 per cent to 2.13pm (covering the period of the Post’s report). It continued to Rise to 3.45pm, when it peaked at 4.4 per cent higher for the day, only to settle back to 26,523 on profit-taking at the close, up 3.9 per cent up on the day. The Hang Seng has since then been treading water. “[3] Figure 2 shows further the Hang Seng Index from September 9 to September 12. Before September 11, the Hang Seng Index was stagnated, moving narrowly between 26,600 and 26,800, and closed at 26,648 on September 10. One day after, when one of the Pro-establishment Parties published a front-page advertisement requesting the HK government to use the Lands Resumption Ordinance for public housing developments, which overthrew their previous political views. In the evening, the media further leaked more information that: “The Government is recently studying to use the Lands Resumption Ordinance to build public housing.” [4] Then, the Development Bureau made a positive response to the press inquiry that they are open for “any methods that can increase in land supply to achieve the housing supply target under the Long Term Housing Strategy, including the use of the Lands Resumption Ordinance for public housing development.” [5] With these events and news leak, the Hang Seng Index on September 11 broke the stagnation, and rose to 27,104 at 11:30 am and maintained its upward trend throughout the day. It opened at 27,283 points on September 12 as shown in Figure 2. In fact, the CE and her team are very good at leaking confidential information. In the past three months, it has repeatedly created a variety of political and economic effects through the leakage of highly confidential government information, which shaped the whole world’s understanding of the anti-extradition crisis. Two of the most dramatic leaks are the Reuters’ reports on the content of the CE’s speeches to young talents and business leaders of the city. The latter even leaked the recordings to ensure that they were trustworthy. (Detailed analyses of the contents of the two speeches can be found in my article last week [6]). In addition, there was also another leak not reported by the mainstream newspapers on a so-called “morning prayer meeting” between the CE and her subordinates in July. These leaks do not only help shift the liabilities to other people, but they can also bring economic benefits and electoral advantages to the cronies. No wonder so many “elites” choose to be pro-government!

Medium.com,Society,A Selection of Stat Checks,World,https://medium.com/swlh/a-selection-of-stat-checks-f41ba6ef02b8?source=topic_page---------687------------------1, I was asked to check some statistics for the launch of the Royal Statistical Society’s Statistic of the Decade.

Medium.com,Society,"No deal, no hope: Type-1 diabetics and the Brexit threat",World,https://medium.com/swlh/no-deal-no-hope-type-1-diabetics-and-the-brexit-threat-5d3acf172baf?source=topic_page---------688------------------1," In 2012, Theresa May was diagnosed with Type-1 diabetes. This was seen as a remarkable advance in the awareness of the disorder. Jump forward seven years and May has been exiled to the backbenches — but not without causing immense anxiety to diabetics, amongst others. The potential shortages of insulin and diabetic equipment have been reported since the first threat of a no-deal Brexit. But since the short summary on Operation Yellowhammer was published in the past week, more calls have been made for guarantees over medicine supplies. Last month, health leaders issued a sincere warning to the Prime Minister, urging action to prevent any disruption to medicines after a no-deal exit. Diabetes charities have been regularly in contact with both government and manufacturers to keep updated on the current crisis. JDRF, a Type-1 charity, was told in August that two of the main insulin producers were keeping 16 weeks worth of insulin stockpiled. There were also suggestions that ferry capacity was guaranteed for essential short-life medicines, such as insulin. But that was before the Yellowhammer document ignited a more serious call for action. With Parliament currently prorogued, charities and healthcare providers are undeniably at odds with how reckless this government is. After all, it’s people’s lives. David Nicholl was defamed by Leader of the House, and resident sloucher, Jacob Rees-Mogg who likened him to the infamous anti-vaccination campaigner Andrew Wakefield. An extraordinary situation where a government minister uses parliamentary privilege to attack the advice of an expert that his own administration had hired. Type-1 diabetics are nervous. Their lives, like so many others with conditions threatened by no-deal, are at serious risk. The comments by Dr Nicholl won’t be warmly received by many — but at least it’s truthful. Uncertainty is crippling people’s lives. Last month I put a call-out on Twitter asking for Type-1 diabetics to come forward with their problems related to the no-deal threat. I was shocked to receive not just details regarding insulin supplies, but concerns over the essential equipment as well. You forget that having the insulin on its own isn’t a saviour in itself — there’s a wide inventory of additional supplies, which some respondents raised as an issue. One person reported they were already experiencing shortages in this area, with needles being in low supply. There are rumours that fly around that supplies are low in all sorts of areas, due to the stockpiling demands. The BBC reported last year that the NHS is finding troubles with the costs of stockpiling and maintaining a regular supply. Someone commented with news that their partner, who works in the medical device industry, has attended conferences where “no-one has a clue what to do.” Type-1 diabetics are especially reliant on medical devices, specifically pumps, blood sugar monitors, and sensors. The costs of these devices are often high, and the pressure for both healthcare providers and patients is enormous. Without the ability to regulate blood sugar, diabetics are at serious risk of bad management of their condition or worse. Several people were concerned particularly about shortages in specific types of insulin. The ‘brand’ corresponds with the strength or effect of the insulin i.e. long-lasting or a quick burst. Indeed, the necessity to prescribe multiple types is essential for diabetics to manage their blood sugar. Longer-lasting brands such as Lantus or Levemir are usually injected in the evening before bed, so to maintain an even level. Prescribing a rapid-acting jab alone would cause problems for patients. Being hyper/hypoglycemic would become much more common without a prescription that best supports the patient. The logistics of stockpiling and supplies is one thing, but the emotional and mental health of Type-1 diabetics is in itself a monstrous concern. Several people came to me to ask what I could do to raise this crucial issue. I’m only a writer. But I sensed a real urgency and desperation for hard answers, not government spin. People referenced their loved ones, some who have more erratic problems or bad management. A few used humour to mask their efforts to stockpile; others decried their local care authority for refusing to allow large prescriptions. In a private message, one person described how their partner suffered serious complications from low supplies in March. They ended up in A&E from the instability of their blood sugar levels, and falling down a flight of stairs. For many people, having a loved one who suffers with Type-1 is a matter of commitment. You want to ensure they are looking after themselves, but not mothering them. Having experienced the perils of Type-1 diabetes in my family, having those experiences amplified due to a lack of medical supply would be deadly. This uncertainty has been spun into anger and action. Lives are at risk for a whole host of different medical conditions. Not having the regular supplies needed to treat patients will kill. A Prime Minister that allows this to happen has no moral authority over their citizens. Indeed, stockpiling bodybags and making provisions for civil disorder post no-deal is evidence enough of a repugnant government. Eyes must be opened. Put ideology and votes aside — this is a threat to life."
Medium.com,Society,A Family Cries for Justice as India’s Kashmir Situation Deteriorates,World,https://medium.com/citizen-truth/a-family-cries-for-justice-as-indias-kashmir-situation-deteriorates-60507d38a0ef?source=topic_page---------689------------------1," “Shortly after a recent parliamentary vote in India to remove the special autonomy status of Jammu and Kashmir, Human Rights Watch (HRW) published a report detailing the worsening of humans rights within the areas, including local leaders being placed under arrest, severing phone communications and disconnecting the internet,” Citizen Truth reported in late August. With the situation in Kashmir continuing to draw international attention and scrutiny for known strongman Indian Prime Minister Indian Narendra Modi, there doesn’t seem to be an end in sight that doesn’t leave Modi with more human rights violation accusations. “The father of a teenager killed in Kashmir has demanded justice for his son, after witnesses said he was fired at with pellets and teargas in an unprovoked attack by Indian security forces,” The Guardian reported Sunday. “Asrar Ahmad Khan, described as a shy and studious teenager, died last week 11 days before his 18th birthday. He had spent almost a month in hospital, where he was being treated for injuries sustained during the incident on 6 August.” Indian officials claim Asrar’s death was caused due to a thrown stone hitting him in the head. Other protestors in the area deny that there was any stone-throwing in the area. “The government is a liar. He was not hit by a stone but they killed him,” Asrar’s father, Firdaus Ahmad Kha, told The Guardian. “They fired a tear gas canister that hit Asrar’s head,” the grieving father said to TRT World on Wednesday. “There was no protest. In fact, there never is a protest in our locality,” said Adil Ahmad, Asrar’s cousin who was with him prior to the incident. Adil also told TRT World reporters that Asrar was hit by a storm of shotgun pellets fired by Indian forces, which added to his injuries. After Asrar’s death on September 3rd, TRT World was able to obtain his birth certificate, which listed the official cause of death as “pellet injury with shell blast injury,” refuting the official talking point from Modi’s administration. “Asrar’s x-rays show dozens of pellets embedded in his skull and a picture of the teenager taken soon after receiving his wound show his face pockmarked with fresh pellet-sized scars,” TRT World continued in their report after reviewing x-rays provided to them by the Khan family. The Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR) released the “Update of the Situation of Human Rights in Indian-Administered Kashmir and Pakistan-Administered Kashmir from May 2018 to April 2019” on July 8th, which included sections touching on the targeting of Muslims by the anti-Muslim Hindu Nationalist, Bharatiya Janta Party (BJP). On social media, individuals, journalists and even some political leaders were inciting hatred and violence against Kashmiri Muslims, people critical of the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party’s (BJP) Kashmir policies or those seeking accountability for human rights abuses in Jammu and Kashmir. In one instance, the Central Government-appointed Governor of Tripura state made a social media statement suggesting Indians consider a “boycott of all things Kashmiri.” No action has been taken against him or any others who incited hatred and violence against Kashmiris. The report included a damning conclusion to the actions happening within Indian-Administered Kashmir and implored that the international community ensures India obliges international human rights laws in the disputed region. “This report highlights serious human rights violations and patterns of impunity in Indian-Administered Kashmir and significant human rights concerns witnessed in Pakistan-Administered Kashmir. As stated in OHCHR’s June 2018 report, there remains an urgent need to address past and ongoing human rights violations and to deliver justice for all people in Kashmir.” Read the original article and sign up for our newsletter at https://citizentruth.org"

Medium.com,Society,Ireland Declared A Climate Emergency. So Why Are We Building A Motorway Through A Bog?,World,https://medium.com/@katieholten/ireland-declared-a-climate-emergency-in-may-so-why-are-we-building-a-motorway-through-a-bog-eab09276d5e2?source=topic_page---------691------------------1," Ardee Bog is Ireland’s most easterly Raised Bog and a site of National Ecological Importance. It is now threatened with destruction by the proposed N52 Ardee bypass. If Ireland is serious about being a climate leader we need to stop this project. In 1990 and 1998 the Irish Peatland Conservation Council (IPCC) surveyed the Bog and identified a core area for conservation surrounded by a buffer zone of supporting habitat. It’s a sanctuary of Heather, a living carpet of psychedelic greens and reds of Sphagnum Moss, Lichen and Sundew, with yellows and pinks of Bog Orchids, and white of Bog Cotton. At least three pairs of Curlew are currently nesting in Ardee Bog.² Their haunting call fills the air. There are Otters, Cuckoos, Owls, Hares, Bats, Frogs, Deer and Snipe too. The Curlew may become extinct as a breeding species in Ireland within 5–10 years. Raised bogs are discreet landscapes, essentially sponges made from peat mosses that began to develop over 10,000 years ago when glaciers retreated. Due to their scarcity and vulnerability raised bogs were designated a priority habitat under the 1992 EU Habitats Directive. In Ireland they are most commonly found in the midlands and the Shannon basin. Ardee Bog in County Louth is unusual, a rare gem. Unfortunately, to some it’s only a brown smudge on the map, terra incognita, something to be filled in, paved over. Plans for the N52 Ardee bypass began in July 2001. An Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) is required by Irish and European law prior to work commencing on such a project. But an EIA was never carried out. An Bord Pleanála erroneously granted planning permission for the project in October 2001 and it has been on hold pending funding. In 2018 Minister Shane Ross took it off the shelf and Transport Infrastructure Ireland (TII) is now preparing to construct a 4.5 km Type 2 Single Carriageway in the proposed National Heritage Area and Flood Zone.³ A raised bog may be up to 98% water and only 2% solid matter. Since 2008 the flood waters from Ardee Bog have risen dramatically (pictured). So has the project budget, which has almost doubled to 34 million Euros. As an EIA was never carried out, TII only discovered the flood risk when the Community Action Group pointed it out at a meeting in the Dáil.⁴ The updated plan seems to propose a road on stilts, elevated three meters over the flood zone with a concrete foundation. The damage this would cause is inconceivable. We cannot allow a road to cut through one of the country’s last remaining Raised Bogs. An EIA needs to be carried out immediately. The IPCC states that “We are legally bound by National and European legislation (The Wildlife Acts, Habitats and Bird’s Directives) and international conventions (Ramsar, Bern, and Convention on Biological Diversity) to do our utmost to protect peatlands now and for future generations. In County Louth specifically, only ~30% of raised Bog habitat remains, an area of 300 hectares. Peatland habitats have been severely diminished in the country and this destruction is an issue in other legislation such as the UN Convention on Climate Change, Bonn Convention, World Heritage Convention, Water Framework Directive, Environment Liability Directive, Planning and Development Acts, National Monuments Acts, Environmental Directive, EIA and SEA. All of these legislative instruments have been adopted by Ireland.” Louth County Council themselves say: “[We] will pursue environmental policies that will seek to safeguard the long term economic, social and environmental wellbeing of the county and will lead by example in the compliance with EU, national and regional policies. [We] will also seek to ensure that the highest possible environmental standards are maintained so that a high-quality environment can be bequeathed to future generations.” Ardee Bog is the very last and most easterly Raised Bog within County Louth and the Republic of Ireland. — Irish Peatland Conservation Council Anyone who’s driven through Ardee knows it’s a bottleneck. Some form of bypass may be necessary, but it would be wrong to put it through the Bog. It won’t solve the problem because most of the traffic does not come from the N52 Kells road, site of the proposed bypass, but from the N2 Dublin road where three local schools, and all the new housing estates (built since the bypass was originally conceived seventeen years ago) converge at a little bridge over the river Dee."

He left his downtown San Diego apartment an hour and a half earlier, heading south on Highway 5 along the San Diego Bay, past the border towns of Chula Vista and Imperial Beach, before crossing into Mexico at San Ysidro. He drove through Tijuana Centro, then swung a left off the Boulevard de los Insurgentes onto the pock-marked residential roads that lead up to the stadium. He walked by the still-closed concession stands, high-fiving the security guard before taking the stairs down to the field. Now he silently enters the dugout, a rare state of serenity for the 30-year-old pitcher. He’s on the mound today. Baseball’s unwritten rules say the Tijuana Toros’ starting pitcher must be left alone. The blast of pyrotechnics near the scoreboard breaks the relative calm at Estadio Chevron, and the crowd of roughly 5,000 stands and cheers. The eight Toros fielders take their positions on the grass before Barreda jogs to the mound. Guns N’ Roses’ “Welcome to the Jungle” begins to play. The stadium is still just a quarter full as the orange glow of the sunset lights up the Cerro Colorado mountain, which towers over the right-field wall. The grandstand of Estadio Chevron is a fraction of the size of Petco Park, the San Diego Padres’ stadium which sits less than two hours north of Tijuana’s home field. Here, pitchers still throw 90 mph darts and sluggers still hit majestic home runs, but it’s hard to see a path from Tijuana to San Diego. It’s much easier to come the other way. Barreda, raised 30 minutes north of the border in Arizona, inhales and squares his shoulders towards Johnny Davis, originally from Compton, California, the leadoff hitter for the Tecolotes from Laredo. Barreda rocks back and fires and Davis sends a soft flyball to left field where it’s caught by Jesús Valdez, from the Dominican Republic, who signed with the Chicago Cubs 15 years ago. Valdez lofts the ball towards shortstop Isaac Rodriguez Salazar, who moved from Sonora, Mexico to Florida for middle school. Salazar snaps it back to a strutting Barreda, who catches it, nods at the shortstop, and retakes his place upon the mound."
Medium.com,Society,A Perfect (Vegan) Weekend in Johannesburg,World,https://medium.com/tenderlymag/a-perfect-vegan-weekend-in-johannesburg-a112730a0eb3?source=topic_page---------693------------------1," T
here’s so much to do and see in this city bursting full of culture. Known for its superlative art, talented entertainers, and ever-growing nightlife scene, Johannesburg has become a go-to destination for people looking to experience a piece of African life on the continent. If you have ever heard of the Zulu tribe, if you remember the dance (called “gwara gwara”) that Rihanna performed during her Grammy’s performance, or if you’ve listened to the late, great jazz trumpeter Hugh Masekela, then you may know more about Johannesburg than you thought. When it comes to eating, the city has a cornucopia of flavors and food fixtures that highlight the diversity of traditional South African cuisine. The city’s cuisine is influenced by a variety of tribes, including Zulu, Xhosa, Sotho, Tswana, and others — but there are also influences from Indian, Dutch, French, and Malaysian cuisine, due to the country’s history with settlement and colonization. You can find anything from samp (dehulled kernels of maize) and pap (porridge/polenta made from coarsely ground maize), to bunny chow (a hollowed-out loaf of white bread filled with curry) and samoosas. Traditionally, South African food culture centers on meats prepared in various ways, including grilling and barbecuing (known as braai or shisa nyama); seasoned sausages known as boerewors; and dried and cured meat similar to beef jerky known as biltong. But more recently there has been a blossoming demand for more vegan options in restaurants, and even entire establishments that offer meat- and dairy-free menus. The call has been answered. You’ll just need the time and resources to get around town. If you’re not renting a car, the easiest and most convenient way to get around Jozi is with Uber. Unless you are visiting with someone local who is familiar with the specific hand gestures necessary to catch one of the taxi buses, you shouldn’t plan on getting around that way, and using the Gauteng train without additional wheels can be difficult. There are lots of cool things to do in the city that are spread around in different areas, and it’s worth the travel to and fro. In an Uber, you’ll be able to sit back and see the different suburbs, check out the homes and architecture (thatch roofing is incredibly popular), and buy anything from fruits and veggies to sunglasses or soda from vendors on the road as you wait at the robots (traffic lights). These are just a few suggestions to get you started while you enjoy your holiday. Johannesburg is full of suburbs that each have their own unique flavor, and weekends in Joburg are always jam-packed with event options. Everywhere you go will be full of life — you’ll be able to eat, drink, and be merry here in Jozi without giving it too much thought. Jackson’s Real Food Market Eatery is all about organic, local food and produce grown by small farms, and they offer breakfast all day long, which is helpful if you’re getting a late start. You can choose any of their vegan options such as scrambled tofu, organic acai bowls, or a vegan toastie with smashed avo. Or keep it light with a nourishing smoothie or a health shot. Between meals you can stop by Nelson Mandela Square to shop at the boutiques, see the larger-than-life bronze statue of Nelson Mandela, get lost perusing the 92,000 books in the Sandton Library, or catch a show at the Theatre in the Square. For a quick and easy lunch, the quaint cafe located inside of Fruits and Roots Organic Health Store is a good choice, especially if you are undecided about what you want to eat or if you are with a group of people with varying tastes. In addition to a vegan and vegetarian buffet, the restaurant has a menu full of sandwiches, salads, wraps, soups, juices, and smoothies. Later, you can grab a bite at Qunu, the posh restaurant inside the Saxon Hotel. The restaurant is named after Mandela’s rural village, and they pride themselves on paying homage to authentic South African food. You can try their mushroom and hemp entree with rooibos gel (made from the leaves of the indigenous South African plant of the same name); the eggless baobab mayo with veggies; or the pear, banana, and sorghum dish. They offer a vegetarian- and vegan-friendly menu as well as an omnivorous menu if you are in shared company. After a night out on the town, breakfast needs to be something hearty and filling like the food from The Fussy Vegan. They have a breakfast burrito with tofu and seitan bacon, toasties, subs, and burgers — perfect for a late breakfast. They also offer bowls of mac and cheese, and a creamy lasagna made with shiitake mushrooms and lentils layered with corn pasta and cashew cream. Free Food is a tiny, menu-written-on-a-chalkboard kind of spot that’s tucked away in a shopping center just a few minutes from Melrose Arch, a cosmopolitan shopping and entertainment complex. The cute cafe is a casual space where you can grab your food and go or chill at the family-style communal table and chat with others enjoying their meals. All of the food here is vegan and gluten-free, so people with additional dietary needs can rest easy during lunchtime. The mains are mostly Asian-inspired dishes like curries and Thai stir fry but there are also soups, salads, pizzas, and wraps if you’re in the mood for something simple. After lunch, you can head over to Rosebank. It’s a vibrant business, arts, and entertainment hub with a posh yet approachable vibe. This is where you’ll see high-end boutiques and laid-back weekend markets, chic rooftop venues and casual cafes, world-class art galleries and popping nightclubs. If you’re in the mood to soak up some art, you can check out the Rosebank Art Gallery row, including Circa Gallery and Everard Read Gallery, Africa’s oldest commercial art gallery. If you’re more in the mood to shop, you can drop by Rosebank Mall where you can find African crafts and local designers’ wares, or hop on a tour bus that will take you around the city. While you’re in Rosebank, you can stop by Lexi’s Healthy Eatery — which is not only vegan, but also gluten and refined-sugar-free. It’s a bright, welcoming place right in the middle of the hustle and bustle of the mall with a gorgeous mural on the wall, plush seating, and a simple but sumptuous dinner menu. Choose from things like cauli-steak, coconut crusted tofu, black rice porcini risotto, and burgers like their sweet potato and chickpea patty with activated charcoal, or the green burger made with peas, spinach, and hemp hearts. Fresh Earth Cafe is good for standard, straightforward brunch-type fare from smoothies, salads, and sarmies (South African slang for sandwiches), to wraps and hummus bowls. They also have a daily buffet and fresh kombucha brewed in-house on tap. For lunch, you can head to Greenside to get a taste of South Africa’s infamous bunny chow, vegan-style, at Conscious 108, nestled in the middle of a tree-lined neighborhood with shops and cafes. The small restaurant has a rustic feel, with wooden tables and decor paired with hanging light fixtures, but boasts a modern menu including options like buddha bowls, bakes, and all types of burgers from soy patties to beans to beetroot. If you happen to be in this area on the last Sunday of the month, you can stop by the Vegan Hippie Connection Market for more vegan-friendly goods. You’re also not far from the Emmarentia Dam and the Johannesburg Botanical Gardens, with seven distinct gardens including the Arboretum, which is composed exclusively of trees. Afterwards, you can stop by Greenside Cafe where you can happily enjoy anything from their 100% vegan menu. It’s a moderate-sized, minimalist situation with indoor and streetside patio seating, simple white tables and chairs, and a bright green backdrop courtesy of its namesake.

Medium.com,Society,The Future Abortionists of America,World,https://gen.medium.com/the-future-abortion-providers-of-america-9238b1664b93?source=topic_page---------695------------------1," A sign in the lobby of the Philadelphia hotel read: THERE ARE NO EVENTS SCHEDULED FOR TODAY
Please enjoy your day! Meanwhile, in the ballroom upstairs, a significant portion of America’s current and future abortion providers were eating breakfast. The fake-out sign was one of multiple security measures, but the atmosphere at the Medical Students for Choice (MSFC) national conference still hummed with energy. Over the course of a day and a half, 450-plus medical students tried to absorb as much information as possible about providing abortions, information that—depending on where they go to school—can be extremely difficult to get. The vast majority of attendees were women in their early twenties. When the organization’s executive director Lois Backus announced that one of the two men’s rooms would defect for the weekend, an involuntary cheer passed through the audience, followed by laughter. There are approximately 1,700 abortionists working in the United States—about the same number as active NFL players, and a small fraction compared to the 10,000-plus orthodontists. Because abortion reporting isn’t mandatory in all states, exact numbers on procedures performed aren’t available, but most estimates put the current annual total between 650,000 and 750,000. The rate works out to more than one procedure per day, every day of the year, for every single provider, and it’s not equally distributed among those 1,700 doctors. Though most abortions are simple procedures, national capacity is stretched, representing yet another threat to U.S. abortion access at a time when state laws are increasingly chipping away at reproductive rights. In 2017, more abortion restrictions were enacted at the state level—doctors and advocates call them TRAP (Targeted Regulation of Abortion Provision) laws—than in the entire previous decade. However, the paucity of abortion providers is not simply a function of the war on choice. Attacks on doctors have slowed as the anti-abortion-rights movement switched tactics from terrorism to legislation, and public approval has stayed relatively constant since Roe v. Wade, with around 80 percent of Americans in favor of legal abortion in some or all cases. The lack of providers is due in large part to the series of obstacles placed between medical students and the profession, which is the raison d’être for MSFC. It’s the org’s job to guide students under, over, around, and through those barriers. The hope is that these students will become the providers, teachers, and administrators who will make the process easier for the doctors who come after them—and for the patients they serve. Medical schools, students, hospitals, and individual physicians, on the whole, simply avoid anything to do with abortion. Nationwide, students at over 150 med schools are organized in campus chapters of MSFC, where they support and train each other in an extracurricular fashion, as well as lobby their schools for resources and for abortion to be incorporated into standard syllabi. At the annual conference, organized by the small Philadelphia-based national office, students from around the country meet to steel their collective resolve and to learn. The conference featured more hours in abortion training—theoretical and practical—than many attendees will ever receive in medical school."

Medium.com,Society,Tunisia and the Jasmine Revolution  Eight Years Later,World,https://medium.com/@aa9274a/tunisia-and-the-jasmine-revolution-eight-years-later-102be03127ef?source=topic_page---------699------------------1," AWST 225 Bordering the Mediterranean Sea and the Sahara Desert, the Republic of Tunisia is the smallest North African country included in the Maghreb. Ruled by a long succession of Islamic dynasties including the Ottoman Empire, it became a French protectorate beginning in the late 19th century. Beginning formally in 1881, Tunisia remained a French colony for 75 years until its independence in 1956. The fight for independence lasted four years and was led by Habib Bourguiba, who went on to become the country’s first president. Bourguiba served four terms before being overthrown in a coup d’etat led by his prime minister Zine El Abidine Ben Ali. It was during his regime that Tunisia plunged itself into a revolution that forever altered the course of not only the Republic, but the rest of the Arab World. On January 14th, 2011, the Ben Ali Regime officially fell, following a year-long struggle to topple it. Prompted by high levels of unemployment, food inflation, corruption, lack of freedoms, poor living conditions, and more, civilians took to the streets following the self-immolation of a street vendor. The revolution saw the collapse of a 23-year regime as well as the democratization of the Republic. Eight year later, Tunisia remains a free country, but is still unable to completely recover. Marred by social and economic inequality as well as a struggling democracy, the Republic of Tunisia has proved that it still has a long way to go before it fully recovers. The Tunisian Revolution formally began after a street vendor self-immolated in protest outside a municipal office in the town of Sidi Bouzid in central Tunisia on December 17th, 2010. However, it is important to note that the death of the vendor merely served as the catalyst for the revolution. Years of repression and a rapid decline in the country led up to the self-immolation. The three main factors that contributed were corruption, unemployment and economic stagnation, and shrinking freedoms. One of biggest reasons Tunisia plunged itself into a revolution was because of the rampant corruption in the government. Reports following the end of the Ben Ali regime revealed that he and his family owned 21% of private sector profits in the country by bending rules to benefit their own companies. Him and his family controlled an estimated 220 companies throughout the entire country, frequently using nepotism to further benefit the family name. The regime frequently blurred the lines between business and government when making deals, allowing Ben Ali’s family to acquire numerous sweetheart deals. “Ben Ali’s relatives ran to the sectors that were riddled with these barriers, where there was no open competition. This allowed them to be super-performing because they did not have any competitors,” Antonio Nucifora, the World Bank’s lead economist for Tunisia and one of the report’s co-authors, said. Unfair rules and regulations were inflicted on companies, stifling competition and making family businesses the only businesses that thrived in the country. Competition was quickly shut down, forcing Tunisians to turn to regime-owned institutions to get their education, cellphones, and more. Reports in the years prior to the revolution portrayed Tunisia as an the symbol of economic success on the African continent. In 2010, it had a 3.7% GDP growth, a per capita income of $3,720, demonstrated successful transition from a agricultural-based economy to a service-based one, and more. But a more in-depth look revealed problems hidden by the regime that eventually led to the revolution. Elements like high youth unemployment, the sheer lack of a private sector, and more contributed to the steady decline of the economy. At the time, Tunisia’s economy relied on three main entities- tourism, exports to Europe, and remittances from expats. Emerging as a destination vacation spot, major cities relied on tourism to keep the economy afloat. But rural cities like Sidi Bouzid remained largely agricultural, lagging severely behind major cities. In the months leading up to the revolution, Tunisia’s unemployment rates rose as well as severe jumps in everyday product prices. According to government estimates, unemployment rose to nearly 14%, with simple foods like milk doubling in price. “The absence of work violated an unspoken bargain struck between Ben Ali’s authoritarian regime and the people: You ignore our iron fist, and we will supply you with jobs,”said Harvard professor William Granara. According to the World Press Freedom Index in 2010, Tunisia was ranked 164th out of the 178 countries listed, placing it among the most oppressed countries like Iran and Saudi Arabia. In April of 2009, Ben Ali’s son in law bought the publishing house that printed four major newspapers, including Le Temps. With the exception of international stations like Al-Jazeera, television remained state-controlled under the regime, along with the internet. “They block websites, they chase down users, they track down IP addresses.” As the recent protests ramped up, the Committee to Protect Journalists reported extensive government attempts to steal Facebook and Yahoo passwords from dissident online journalists…,” said Clothilde le Coz, Washington director of Reporters Without Borders. The tipping point, however, was the self-immolation of a street vendor in the countryside. Mohamed Bouazizi was an unemployed 26-year old street vendor who sold fruit. He became increasingly frustrated after local officials repeatedly demanded bribes in order to keep his business as well as confiscated his merchandise. On the morning of his protest, he was allegedly slapped by a policeman for refusing to give him some of his fruit for free. Following his death days later, Bouazizi became the symbol of injustice and economic hardship created by the Ben Ali regime. In the wake of his death, street protests broke out all over the country. The small protests then spiraled out into what is now known as the Jasmine Revolution. Following the death of Bouazizi, protests began popping up in Sidi Bouzid, which then quickly spread to the rest of the country. As unrest spread, the government began cracking down, killing dozens during clashes with policeman. With many in the international community criticizing the regime’s excessive force, Ben Ali fired Rafik Belhaj Kacem, the minister of interior, and promised to create a committee to re-evaluate the response to the issue. The decision was met with more clashes and protests, prompting the deployment of troops to diffuse the situation. On January 13th, 2011, Ben Ali appeared on national TV in an effort to please resistors. He promised to not seek another term when his was over in 2014, vowed to order policemen to stop using live ammunition, promised to reduce food prices, and to loosen internet restrictions. Once again, the pleas fell flat and clashes increased. On January 14th, Ben Ali declared a state of emergency and the state media announced the dissolution of the government as well as announcing legislative elections would be held within the next six months. Ben Ali and his family then fled to Saudi Arabia. Prime Minister Mohamed Ghannouchi was forced to assume the presidency. In the years following the Jasmine Revolution, Tunisia proved itself to be the only country involved in the Arab Spring to be able to successfully become a democracy. However, the governments following Ben Ali proved themselves unable to implement structural reforms that could place the failing economy back on track. Youth employment, which was a problem during the regime, continues to be a large problem. While Tunisia has come a long way since the oppressive Ben Ali regime, three major problems need to fixed: regional inequality, an unstable democracy, and an unstable economy. One of the biggest challenges facing the Republic to this day is the social and economic inequality between states. Southern and inner states bear the brunt because of the sheer lack of basic infrastructure, services, and the disproportionate poverty rates. Big coastal cities such as the capital Tunis, Sousse and Sfax have historically seen the bulk of investment and development in the country. To put this in perspective, the Kasserine Governorate, which is located outside the capital Tunis, has a poverty rate of 32% compared to the national average of 15.5%, and 9% in the capital. Since the overthrow of the regime, following governments have struggled to control and accommodate the population. In the days following the end of the Ben Ali regime, protests continued, stemming from the fact that the then-president Ghannouchi was from the same political party as Ben Ali. On January 17th, Ghannouchi then announced the formation of a new government, comprised of political rivals and members of the Ben Ali’s party, that had Tunisia’s best interests at heart. He announced the new government would be working to maintain economic stability, reinstall freedoms, release political prisoners, and end state-wide censorship. The new government did not last long, forcing Ghannouchi to hand over the country to Fouad Mebazaa. Since Mebazaa, Tunisia has had three interim presidents. Over the course of the three, the newly installed democracy has faced challenges stemming from both Islamist and secular parties. However, democratic elections were held in 2014, with Beji Caid Essebsi being elected. The successful execution of a democratic election proves there is indeed hope for the insecure and still-developing country. Under the regime, the economy of Tunisia was quickly declining due to the international recession, rising prices, and more. In the wake of the revolution and in the years since, the economy has stopped moving and has become stagnant. The national employment rate is continuing to deplete, with youth unemployment rising to around 35%. While successive governments have attempted to fix the problem, the reason why the problem still lingers is because the focus remains incorrect. The goal needs to be reaching fiscal stability, especially after the 2008 recession. The 2008 recession hit the Republic hard, almost irreparably damaging it beyond repair. The country saw a decline of foreign direct investment from 5.8% of GDP in 2008 to 1.7% as of 2016. In the wake of the 2015 terrorist attacks, the tourism sector of the country has taken a huge hit. In addition, the once highly lucrative hydrocarbon and phosphate mining sectors have also been hit hard. Total natural resource rents have declined from a peak of 11% of GDP in 2008 to 3% in 2015. Because the economy has become virtually stagnant, the country was forced to acquire a $2.9 billion loan from the International Monetary Fund on the condition that Tunisia lower its public expenditure, reform its civil services, and revise its tax code. The hope is that Essebsi will use the $2.9 billion in the coming years to close the gap between states, end unemployment for the youth, and rejuvenate and stabilize the economy finally. It is undeniable the mark Tunisia left on the Arab World following its revolution. What started out as simple protests against the government spiraled out into a region-wide revolution that saw the toppling of major dictators and regimes. In the years since the Arab Spring, Tunisia has proved itself to be the only country fully able to recover from its effects. Tunisia has come a long way since the the toppling of the Ben Ali Regime, but it would be naive to ignore the work that still needs to be done. Tunisia needs to be able to fix the disparity between states, get its economy on the right track, and strengthen its democracy in order for its future to be fully secure."
Medium.com,Society,Resisting through Writing: Life Under Occupation in Palestine,World,https://medium.com/@aa9274a/resisting-through-writing-life-under-occupation-in-palestine-b5646c41962?source=topic_page---------700------------------1," AWST 115 “Palestine is the element that holds the Arab world together or it is the explosive that blows it apart,” said former Palestinian president Yasser Arafat in a 1974 speech in Morocco. Arafat’s strong sentiment speaks volumes to the pivotal role Palestine plays in the overall maintenance of peace in the Middle East and how what goes on there cannot be ignored. And nearly 44 years later, Arafat’s words still ring true. Over the course of the last 70 years, the de jure State of Palestine has been at the center of one of the worst land disputes the world has ever seen. The conflict over the ownership of the land in and around Palestine began on May 14th, 1947 when Jewish Agency chairman David Ben-Gurion announced the creation of the State of Israel from “a section of land belonging to the State of Palestine.(Declaration)” From there, the conflict spiraled out and has served as the catalyst for the now decades-long tension in the Levant. However, the land in and around Palestine has been the source of conflict dating as far back at the days of the Ottoman Empire. Following the first World War and the eventual collapse of the Ottoman Empire, British forces took control of the land. The British and The League of Nations together created the British Palestine Mandate in 1923. The Mandate “granted the Jewish and Arab communities the right to run their internal affairs.(Israeli)” When World War II broke out in 1939, a period of intense anti-Semitism was ushered in that culminated in what is now known as the Holocaust, which resulted in the deaths of nearly six million Jews. After the war, many Jews began to ask for a homeland because they no longer safe in Europe. The push for the creation of a true homeland was spearheaded by Theodor Herzl and is known today as Modern Zionism. Zionism is the national ideology of Israel and proponents of it believe “Judaism is a nationality as well as a religion, and that Jews deserve their own state in their ancestral homeland.(Beauchamp)” As for the homeland, Herzl naturally chose Jerusalem and the land around it because of its significance to the Torah, the holy book of Judaism. After years of Zionist movements, the State of Israel was created in May 1948 from land belonging to Palestine and Jordan. The creation of Israel from “stolen land” served as the main catalyst for the tension in the region and over the years, the tensions have risen so high to the point wars have broken out. The 1948 Arab-Israeli War that involved Israel and five Arab nations occurred directly because of Israel’s creation. In 1987, the First Intifada broke out as a result of Israeli occupation in Gaza and in West Bank. In September 2000, the Second Palestinian Intifada broke out after “negotiations between Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak and PLO Chairman Yasser Arafat broke down.(Beauchamp)” The most recent conflict occurred this year in February when U.S. president Donald Trump announced his plan to move the United States embassy in Israel from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem. This motion was interpreted by many as the West saying Jerusalem belonged to Israel and not Palestine. Massive protests broke out that culminated in Palestinian president Mahmoud Abbas saying Palestine would not work with “any peace plan the United States puts on the table.(Rasgon)” The unfair application of laws and the illegal stretching and retracting of borders over the years has resulted in a constant and unregulated genocide of the Palestinian people. In an effort to escape the violence, many living in the country turned to writing as an outlet. The writing accumulated over the last seventy years is the rawest account of everything that has happened that the mainstream media has refused to cover. Some of the most famous literary pieces have emerged out of Palestine but one in particular stands out among the rest. Originally published in 1997, “I Saw Ramallah” by Mourid Barghouti is his intensely personal account of his journey back to Palestine after being exiled for years. Mourid Barghouti is a prominent Palestinian writer and poet born in the village of Deir Ghassaneh located inside the city of Ramallah on West Bank. In 1966, he left Palestine to pursue his college education, moving to Egypt to attend Cairo University in Giza. During his senior year, the Six-Day War of 1967, a brief war between Egypt, Syria, and Israel, broke out and he was banned from going back to Palestine. After graduating, he moved to Kuwait where he worked as a teacher and then began formally publishing his work. Following Muhammed Anwar el-Sadat’s, then-president of Egypt, controversial trip to Israel, Barghouti became heavily involved in resistance movements abroad. Due to his political affiliations, he was deported and emigrated to Budapest, Hungary, where he worked for the Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO) as a representative on behalf of the World Federation of Democratic Youth. Barghouti was banned from returning to his homeland for nearly thirty years and his return nearly thirty years later was the reason he wrote the book. Despite the book being very small, Barghouti manages to convey his deepest emotions and covers a vast array of topics. The main themes he addresses throughout are what it means to be Palestinian, what it means to be a refugee, and coping with loss The first theme Barghouti addresses in his memoir is what is means to identify as Palestinian. Throughout the book, he attempts to assign concepts to the identity of a Palestinian but often runs into roadblocks. Simply put, he believes identifying as such is a complicated endeavor because of the mere fact that you are a refugee in your own country. You may live in your ancestral home, but you do not own it nor do you control it. Nothing is in your control and you have to accept that crude fact one way or another. Several times throughout the book, he reiterates the phrase “The others are still masters of the place.” Barghouti makes the constant realization that he is not in charge of this land- the Occupation is. The Occupation controls it all, whether it be through illegal border checks, illegal settlements on Palestinian land, or the lack of a true Palestinian airport. Barghouti knew all of this before entering but it only became truly real once he crossed the threshold and saw it firsthand. According to Barghouti, another part of identifying as Palestinian is being constantly reminded of your loss. It isn’t enough that you have lost your ancestral land, but you are constantly reminded of it. Reminders of the lost ancestral land come in all shapes and sizes, some explicit and other implicit. On page 13, Barghouti is discussing in detail his first encounter at the border with Israeli soldiers. He says, “His gun is my personal history. It is the history of my estrangement. His gun took from us the land of the poem of the land. In his hands he holds earth, and in our hands we hold a mirage.” For Barghouti, the gun of the soldier is the biggest reminder of all he has lost. To the soldier, the gun is nothing more than a weapon to be used in a situation gone wrong. To him, the gun is something to protect him if need be. But to Barghouti and thousands of other Palestinians, the gun is more than a weapon. To them, the gun is what was cruelly used on them to wipe out thousands of innocent men, women, and children. To them, the gun was the main tool that was turned on them at the last second to push them off their land. When Barghouti sees the soldiers, he realizes that as long as the soldiers hold the gun, they will be in possession of the land. He also realizes that as long as the Palestinian people lack guns and other tools to fight back, they will hold nothing more than empty dreams. The second theme Barghouti addresses is what it means to be a refugee. To him, the idea is complicated because it changes depending on one’s circumstance. But at the same time, all refugees are similar because they all have to deal with the same things- insecurity and silence. On page three Barghouti says, “He is the one whose relationship with places is distorted, he gets attached to them and repulsed by them at the same time..” For Barghouti, he believes one aspect of being a refugee is impermanence because you are constantly being moved around like cargo. The impermanence prevents you from forming attachments to places because you develop a fear- a fear of being uprooted at a moment’s notice. This fear grows over time and permeates into every being of a refugee and forever alters the way they live their lives- from living day to day to living minute by minute. The other aspect Barghouti identifies is getting used to and accustomed to silence and time. It is human instinct to reject both concepts because they make us uncomfortable and because they have the tendency to disrupt our lives. However, as a refugee, the two concepts are intertwined in their lives and become their constant companions. On page 74, he says, “They snatch you from your place suddenly, in a second. But you return very slowly. You watch yourself returning in silence. Always in silence.” To Barghouti, the process of becoming a refugee happens within a blink of an eye. For him personally, it happened within the span of four years. He left for college in Egypt, four years or so later the Six Day War broke out, then he was told he couldn’t go back thus becoming a refugee. Fom there, a snowball effect took place and one tragedy after another took place. The problem for him didn’t lie so much with being taken away so quickly but with being returned so slowly. Barghouti was exiled for nearly 30 years and when he returned, he was forced to see all the changes afterwards. He had no say in reversing any of the changes because too much time had gone by, forcing him to accept the facts in silence. And to him, that is what it truly means to be a refugee- accepting changes in absolute silence. The last theme addressed is the idea of loss and how to cope with it. To say the Palestinian people have loss a lot is a gross understatement. The nearly 70 years of unrest have culminated in millions dead, displaced, and injured. For Barghouti specifically, he lost his brother, family friends, his childhood home, and more. But what he considers to be the worst and most painful loss is the loss of the land. On page 7 he says, “It is a land, like any land. We sing for it only so that we may remember the humiliation of having had it taken from us. Our song is not for some sacred thing of the past but for our current self-respect that is violated anew every day by the Occupation.” Barghouti acknowledges that in the end, what he has lost is not unique and that in the end it is just land. Refugees all over the world and all throughout history have lost their land. But for the Palestinians, the loss is much greater because of the deep connection to the land. Barghouti explains how the land is everything to them because their identity is centered around the land. For many, their families have been there since the days of the Ottoman Empire. The land and everything on it was passed on from generation to generation until it ceased to be theirs to pass down. He explains they sing and talk about the land because it helps ease the pain of having lost it in such an humiliating and painful way. Barghouti’s memoir is unique for its time and is crucial to fully understand the Israel-Palestine conflict. Through this memoir, Barghouti is able to dismantle the news-created image of the Palestinian plight and redraw it. His raw account put a new and more accurate face on the conflict because he is able to show from all angles how the Occupation has impacted lives. Barghouti’s memoir is also important to fully understand the conflict because of the route he goes and the one he neglects to go down. Many times with memoirs and personal accounts, there are almost always hints of anger or hatred towards the situation. However, Barghouti refrains from doing so because he realizes it’s useless. Instead, he writes from his heart and fills the pages with his heartbreak, emptiness, confusion, and longing. We see the raw Palestinian side for once and it is crucial now more than ever to hear it.

he artistic sub-cultures or communities in any society can be used to test the pulse of the country. Art is simply a visual expression of facts, thoughts, and ideas in the form of a painting, sculpture or a music video. Today, I would like to discuss the lamentation and rants of a segment of the youth expressed through two music videos. Ghana’s current political regime is a paternalistic winner-takes-all strain of democracy, although internationally, it purports to practice a multiparty republican strain of democracy awash with free speech and citizen participation. The former is not big on free speech especially when it criticizes the government. This is because criticism is sometimes perceived as an insult, offense, or political jab. That notwithstanding there are certain things that are pivotal to the success of a democracy and these are stated in the 1992 Constitution of the Republic of Ghana: Article 21 (1) All persons shall have the right to (a) freedom of speech and expression, which shall include freedom of the press and other media;(b) freedom of thought, conscience and belief, which shall include academic freedom; (c ) freedom to practice any religion and to manifest such practice. It is not a coincidence that freedom of speech and expression is the first listed because it is a linchpin upon which hangs all the other freedoms as a nation. These freedoms determine whether a nation’s people remain free or fall to a terrible tyranny. Understandably, freedom of speech may on occasion offend someone because of how it is presented, but the citizenry should never be controlled by the fear of offending someone to the point of almost completely shackling free expression. This is unhealthy for a democracy. The videos that will be discussed are an exercise of the freedom of speech and expression of the artists. LISTEN TO THE YOUTH Does the youth have something to say to politicians? Why should politicians pay attention to them? To answer this, let us first define governance. According to the World Bank, Governance is, “the manner in which power is exercised in the management of a country’s economic and social resources for development.” If the youth feel that the management of the country’s economic and social resources are not being administered in a way that promotes inclusive development, then as citizens and people affected by such governance, they have the right to voice out their concerns and the government MUST listen. Why? The Sovereignty of Ghana resides in the people of Ghana (not the government) in whose name and for whose welfare the powers of government are to be exercised per the 1992 Constitution. The purpose of government according to the supreme law of Ghana is to “secure for ourselves, and posterity the blessings of liberty (freedom), equality of opportunity and prosperity”. If the youth feel this is not being done, then as the Sovereign, they can demand Justice, Probity, and Accountability from elected officials. For the purposes of our discussion, I will define youth as anyone below the age of 34. Why should anyone pay attention to the youth? First and foremost, they are citizens and that should suffice. Also, if economic resources were divided up per demographic, they would own a significant percentage. After all, they are 73 percent of the populace. Furthermore, they and their children are the ones who will inherit future debt and other consequences of any mismanagement today. They are also the ones bearing the brunt of cumulative bad policies that have led to a weak educational, labour and industrial system that has spurred youth under-employability, unemployment, and human insecurity. Politicians should also listen because, at present, Africa is undergoing a youth bulge. More than 60% of its population is 24 years old or younger, according to the United Nations World Populations Prospects. Put differently, 6 out of every 10 Africans is 24 years of age or younger. To get a better perspective, Africa’s population is 1,308,064,000 or 1.3 billion (2019 Est). 60% of 1.3 billion is 784,838,400. The population of sub-Saharan Africa is projected to double by 2050 (99%). The average median age of a Ghanaian in 2015 was 20.7 and in 2020 it is estimated to be 21.5. This means that Ghana is a country with a young populace. Ghana’s population is currently 30,417,000 (30 million) and by 2020 estimates, 22,339,000 (22 million) of the 30 million people will be under the age of 34. Put differently, about 73.33% of the Ghanaian populace is under 34 years of age — that is 7 out of every 10 Ghanaians. It makes sense that their concerns should be heard. Africa signed the African Continental Free Trade Area (AfCFTA), and many within the sub-region are happy because the CFTA is estimated to bring together fifty-four African countries with a combined population of more than one billion people and a combined gross domestic product of more than US $3.4 trillion. However, this will not amount to much if a sizable portion of the populace, that is, the youth, are poor, disenfranchised, unemployed, uneducated, and unhealthy. Such a status quo could constitute a security risk for the continent and its nations. For the AfCFTA to mean anything, governments across the region must tackle Education, Employment, Hunger, Poverty, Health, Shelter etc. Politicians will do well to listen to the average youth — not just those who belong to the youth arms of their political parties. It is unwise to test the pulse of a nation by listening only to those who have allegiance towards your party. WHAT IS THE YOUTH SAYING? This section will discuss the summary contents of two music videos, namely: Both videos are speaking truth to power. The message I believe, goes to all political parties. The World Bank states that “Good governance is epitomized by predictable; open, and enlightened policymaking (that is, transparent processes); a bureaucracy imbued with a professional ethos; an executive arm of government accountable for its actions, and a strong civil society participating in public affairs; and all behaving under the rule of law”. It adds that there are three distinct aspects of governance, namely: Both music videos have much to say about these three aspects of governance in Ghana . They did not necessarily use public policy language but they still communicated how these three are not functioning the way they should in a healthy democracy. The artists have a right to speak up if they feel there is a problem with governance within Ghana, howbeit, it must be done in a way that does not flout the rule of law. Cypher’s video is a collaboration with multiple artists, Kwame Legacy, Equation, Otaado, Posy, Benny Blakk, Semi Heva, and KobbySeven. The video laments that, the government is not accountable. It states that the government is also unwilling to learn because it has a know-it-all posture (Mma mo ny3 menim menim). It lists the natural resources of Ghana and laments that these resources do not benefit the youth. Both videos talk about promises made and never fulfilled by the political class which has led to a state of mismanagement, frustration and desperation. The Koboo music video adds that, poor governance has resulted in some youth taking up armed robbery, kidnapping and vigilantism. The other music video speaks to the absurdity of building a national cathedral and later, a parliamentary chamber for $200 million when University campuses lack lecture halls. Koboo’s video starts with Kwame Legacy addressing the first gentleman of the nation by quoting a proverb to him that loosely translated means, “Nana, you should not step on an imbecile thrice, but you have done so four times, and now you have made me wiser for it. Nana you have betrayed your brethren and your nation by not fulfilling your promises or by taking their hopes and dashing it”. Understandably, members of the ruling political elite may politicize and criticize the music videos and the messages they convey but that would be unwise. There is more than one video out there with these sentiments and themes. Music is an outlet for the youth, their feelings, thoughts, and ideas. It is not prudent to ignore these songs. Listen to the youth who made them, determine if there is an iota of credence to any of their rants. If yes, address their concerns publicly and in a timely fashion because after all, you serve at their discretion. They put you in that seat to serve them. This is what it means to be a public servant unless of course, you would rather be known as a public master or worse a public bully. Public masters and bullies have no place in real democracies. Koboo’s music video has a chorus that says in part, “Ya hw3 n’anim daadaa, saa na adanko daadaa adoe ne ba”. In this section, the artiste is saying: We have looked to government time and again and been lied to and let down. Government, listen up, Good Governance is not a matter of having a degree or oratory skills. It is not about eloquent English. Do not try to hoodwink us with that. It is simply a matter of common sense speaking. If it was dependent on educational degrees, then Osei Kwame should be selling peanuts. Osei Kwame is a business mogul in Ghana who has not earned academic degrees (although he has been awarded honorary degrees) nonetheless, he owns a bouquet of thriving companies. Koboo’s video ends with this quote, “it is amazing how some people could DIE for a political party but NOT for the country which the political party depends on”. Listening is not the strong suite of political parties in Ghana. Governance, as we have said, is about being open, and enlightened policymaking (that is, transparent processes) and an executive arm of government that is accountable for its actions. But this is not always the case in Ghana. Not too long ago, there was a military deal concluded between the Ghana government and the USA. The processes were not transparent or open to public debate. The document was leaked into the public domain, and Ghanaians demanded accountability. The President went on air and lambasted citizens for having reservations. He treated the reservations as if all who raised objections and concerns belonged to the opposition party. This is poor governance. The New York Times carried an article titled ‘Deal With U.S. Military Sets Off Protests in Ghana’ that captured the protests that followed such conduct. The NDC was no different. Concerning the resettlement of GITMO detainees in Ghana, that government administration entered a deal with the USA government, and kept the information from the public until it was leaked. The ‘Dead Goat’ comment was also part of what cost the NDC the election. Keeping secrets from the public and refusing to be accountable are all signs of bad governance. It is the elected officials who serve and must be willing to be transparent and accountable to the sovereign. Opaque governance is recognized the world over as poor governance and both music videos speak to this. THREATS OR FED UP RANTS In addition to listing a litany of things gone wrong in the nation, Koboo’s video states that if the status quo continues, “Biribi ba o, 3b3y3 hye roff” loosely translated “something is coming and it is going to be extremely hot or unpleasant”. From this statement, it can be inferred that the artist is referring to an uprising or revolution because the title of the track is ‘The Return Of 1979’. In 1979, alleged government corruption by the then government, the Supreme Military Council, led to a coup d’état that saw the installation of another military regime, the Armed Forces Revolutionary Council (AFRC). Similarly, Eldeezy’s video complains about the government’s decision to build a national cathedral and a parliamentary chamber for $200 million when University students lack lecture halls. He adds that if he was born in London or Dubai, he would be better off, because there, governance delivers a better standard of living. He accuses the government of living in luxury while the rest of the nation languishes in poverty. He warns that the day of reckoning is here. “We are tired of the cheating. We are coming to your offices. We are tired of the lies”. He complains of poor Dollar to Ghana Cedi exchange rate. He complains of fuel prices that keeps being hiked by the government. He states that the youth is no more going to play nice because if they do not stand up now, they will pay the price for the poor governance. Are these threats or fed up rants of people whose hopes have been deferred or dashed time and again? No one can say for sure but I am hoping it is the latter. Ghana has seen many coup d’états and it is my prayer that Ghana does not go through any uprising of any sort involving its youth. This will only set Ghana back possibly for decades. But lest people think these complaints are isolated to these musicians alone, other youths, have gone to parliament to protest specific decisions by the government. One of them was Ernesto Yeboah and another was Frank Abeku Adam of the Economic Fighters League. Adams’ clothes were torn when he was yanked out of the gallery at Parliament House while Yeboah was pinned to the ground and handcuffed. The response of authorities seem to suggest an unwillingness to hear the youth out. Koboo’s video states that, “Wo ka aa, ye dwa wo s3 bankye” loosely translated “when you speak truth to power they get angry or cut you down like cassava”. True republican democratic government is as Abraham Lincoln put it, “a Government of the people, by the people, for the people.” These videos seem to suggest that governance is no longer for the people and by the people. Instead of representatives and elected officials representing the people, they seem to be representing themselves. In a well-functioning democracy, representatives of the people must hear out the people and covey their wills and sentiments. Those who do not want to do this may vacate their seats, so that other Ghanaians who can pay attention to the people’s desires may take their place. The good thing is the youth are venting out their frustration through music videos and not violently on the streets. Leaders would do well to listen to them and address their concerns. Could things have been said in a better way in these artistic expressions? Possibly! Has the current government and its predecessor been the best in our nation’s history? Definitely not! Could they learn anything from these videos? With a humble heart, I believe so. Do they stand to lose anything by listening and making amends if need be? Nope! They lose nothing but rather stand to gain the trust of their youth, some of whom seem disoriented while others are simply disappointed. These videos were critical of the government. That said, some African governments must realize that criticism is not always a bad thing. There is much we can glean from criticism such as the perception of those doing the criticism. Perception does not always tally with reality, but in some cases, it can be even more powerful than reality. In relation to the music videos, the stance of political parties should not be to condemn the voice of the youth as being tools of an opposition party — but to interrogate their concerns first to see if there is any validity to it. Listening only to political party youth or youth organizers may not be prudent. Welcome criticism from all walks of life. If it is not constructive, help make it constructive and then address legitimate concerns. The sentiment of a segment of the youth revealed in these music videos I believe applies to all political parties."
Medium.com,Society,Patriotism or Terrorism? The Second Amendment Glorifies Both,World,https://medium.com/discourse/patriotism-or-terrorism-the-second-amendment-glorifies-both-c4cf2a90538b?source=topic_page---------702------------------1," In 2014, Vice Media released Assassination Nation & the Killer Kids of the Taliban, detailing then-ongoing violent conflicts in both countries; a portion of this piece shall make reference to the Filipino half of the video. F
ilipino (like American) gun culture is inextricably linked to political revolution and freedom — theirs from Spain, ours from Great Britain; yes, there is a clear, patriotic rationalization for gun ownership present in both countries. But despite the noble roots, it should be acknowledged that firearms are singly responsible for making an atrocity like the Maguindanao Massacre, when Islamic insurgents slaughtered 58 of Mayor Mangudadatu’s supporters (including his wife and children), possible in the first place — sure, the necessary sociopolitical conditions to foment such brutality could have existed without the presence of firearms, but it’s nearly impossible to refute that weapons themselves are what make mass killings possible. Why engage in discourse or organized protest when bullets make a far bolder statement? “In a system where violence and killings are met with wealth and power, things probably aren’t going to change anytime soon. Because in the United States, he who campaigns with the most guns, wins.” This quote almost perfectly encapsulates our current gun situation in the United States; there’s a reason the NRA spent $5.1 million lobbying for the general preservation of the Second Amendment in 2017. It’s incredibly difficult for things to change when senators (who are coincidentally being funneled millions of dollars by groups like the NRA) refuse to even consider passing gun control bills. He who is able to campaign with the most money enjoys an immense advantage over others, and it follows that “he who campaigns with the most guns wins” rings uncomfortably true in our country. But the wonderful thing about the aforementioned quote is that it’s a slightly altered version of one about the purportedly violent mess of insurgency that is the Philippines, and not about the oh-so-peaceful U.S. of A. Here is the original, transcribed from 11:05 in the Vice video: “In a system where violence and assassination are rewarded with wealth and power, things probably aren’t going to change anytime soon. Because in the Philippines, he who campaigns with the most guns, wins.” Again, it poses the question of whether our elite, first world, American society is fundamentally different from a place with more egregious violence, like the Philippines — well, I mentioned the “egregious violence” of the Philippines, but the fact is that in 2012, the state of Louisiana appears to have had a higher rate of intentional homicide (10.8 per 100,000) than that of the Philippines in 2017 (8.40 per 100,000). The BIFM militia is the Filipino insurgency group showcased within the Vice video. Without a doubt, the most unethical aspect of their plight is their willingness to train and indoctrinate children who are incapable of truly thinking for themselves — something that appears to be a terribly unjustifiable act, something that we will all swiftly condemn. “A well regulated Militia, being necessary to the security of a free State, the right of the people to keep and bear Arms, shall not be infringed.” Shifting gears, let us discuss how here in the United States, a common justification of citizens’ right to bear unwieldy firepower is the fact it, in theory, enables civilian militias to rise up and protect themselves against what they perceive to be a rogue government. With this in mind, consider the Bangsamoro Islamic Freedom Fighters, the insurgent Filipino militia group showcased in the film. Once again, this is something whose existence Americans will hasten to condemn, but if Americans are to act in accordance with their Second Amendment beliefs, shouldn’t they support these freedom fighters? These people are utilizing guns to fight for causes that they believe in; they’re fighting against a rogue government who won’t let them properly express their beliefs. If seeking to voice a refutation, the next probable step here is to mention the BIFM’s willingness to indoctrinate children and use them as puppets for their plight, and proceed to use condemnation of that awful practice to differentiate us from them; to distinguish us, fearless advocates of freedom, who wish for our righteous ideals to spread through the entire world; from them, horrible terrorists, who fight for what they think will improve the world and, more importantly, defer everyone from hell and instead to paradise. Both groups condone the use of force if necessary and both groups inevitably engage in instilling certain values within children; children who lack the mental aptitude to reject them. The severity of the groups’ actions differ, certainly, but they are fundamentally analogues of one another. Perhaps when we impose an iron fist upon people who share radically different ideals, we are the terrorists. Conservatives love to laud the document’s vagueness as testament to its eternal fluidity — its ability to morph itself and adapt to any zeitgeist, without exception — but they so conveniently ignore that such a dynamic composition also necessitates an intoxicating, all-encompassing, doublethink. It’s essential to our whole historical canon: Terrorism is only bad when it’s against us and our capital interests. Violence is only bad when it isn’t in the name of Christianity, capitalism or neoliberalism."
Medium.com,Society,The Rabble Alliance,World,https://medium.com/times-a-wastin/the-rabble-alliance-1637d5ead617?source=topic_page---------703------------------1," Last week, all of the very highly paid representatives of the mainstream media, along with senior politicians and other pundits were crowing that Boris Johnson was caught in a trap. Parliament was going to take control of the Order Paper and pass legislation demanding that, if Johnson did not get a Brexit Deal, before the EU Council Meeting, on October 17th, he would have to go to them, and plead for an extension of Article 50. When Johnson made clear he would not do that, and would instead call a General Election, they responded by saying that he would be prevented from doing that, under the terms of the Fixed Terms Parliament Act, if opposition parties voted against him, because it requires a two-thirds majority. What all of these very highly paid journalists and pundits seemed to have missed, in all that, but which I had pointed out a week ago, is that Johnson had a very obvious, and useful alternative, which suited his purpose, and that was simply to resign! A week later, some of those very highly paid journalists and pundits, have eventually cottoned on to that possibility. But, it was fairly obvious, if you step back from the realms of parliamentary cretinism, and a world in which success or failure is measured by whether you win or lose parliamentary votes, that this is precisely where Johnson/Cummings’ strategy needed to take them, and where they were planning to be. Their strategy, and their narrative depends upon presenting themselves as (counter) revolutionaries, fighting on behalf of the common man against the privileged elites whose representatives, in parliament, for the last three years, have frustrated the implementation of the Brexit vote. Its rather hard to present yourself as a revolutionary opposition, if, in fact, you are the government, which was the position that Johnson found himself in, having unseated May. To make that narrative work, Johnson had to turn himself and his ranks into the principled opposition, prepared to “die in a ditch”, rather than succumb to the demands of the traitors and surrender monkeys on the opposition benches, demanding that he crawl to Brussels to ask for another extension of Article 50. And, that is precisely what he has been able to do over the last week, and the opposition have helped him do it at every step of the way! Cummings/Johnson, in fact, have done what Corbyn and his supporters should have done, in the Labour Party, four years ago, after he was elected Leader. Johnson has cleared out all of the soft Cameroons, and conservative social-democrats from the Tory benches, cowing any of those remaining who did not make themselves susceptible to expulsion, by voting against the government whip. Already, in the Tory Associations, where 80% of the members are No Deal Brexiters, backing Johnson, they have replacement, hard right candidates lined up to fill those positions. Compare that with the weakness and vacillation of the Corbyn leadership, despite its mass backing by half a million new members, and initially the organisation of Momentum. Confronted with this new reality, the liberal luvvies do not have a clue about the world they are now in. Kirsty Walk on Newsnight, confronted Andrea Jenkyns, one of the new breed of Hard Right Tories. Walk began, pathetically, by asking her about Johnson’s “intemperate language” of talking about “dying in a ditch”. Its as though Walk has never read any of the great Scottish novelists, and their use of all of the facets of the English language for florid description, the use of metaphor and simile, and wants the language to be reduced to the same dull greyness as the centrist politics that has, itself, dominated for the last thirty years. Walk must be overcome with the vapours whenever she reads the intemperate language of Shakespeare, one must think. But, of course, Johnson, in any case, was not talking about someone else dying in a ditch (even were that to be idiotically understood literally) but himself. And, so Jenkyns, fully in line with the Cummings/Johnson narrative, could easily respond that it simply reflected Johnson’s passion on the issue, not to surrender, but to stand up for principle, and for all those that voted for Brexit. In this new world, the liberal luvvies of the BBC and elsewhere, simply have no compass to deal with the realities of people who will give a straight and pointed answer, rather than the endless waffle and meaningless, grey verbiage that centrist politicians have got away with, as a staple diet, for the last thirty years. So, when Walk expected Jenkyns to show due deference to former Tory Leader John Major, she was completely thrown off her feet, when Jenkyns simply replied that he was a hypocrite, causing the interview to come to an abrupt end. Eventually, some of the very highly paid journalists, and pundits have realised what I pointed out a week ago. Johnson can simply resign rather than comply with the demand that he plead for an extension of Article 50. Nick Watt, on Newsnight, suggested that, instead, he might use a manoeuvre, by not appointing an EU Commissioner. That too misunderstands the situation, and what Johnson is about. Using that manoeuvre would be a defeat for the Cummings/Johnson strategy and narrative. It would be seen as running away from a fight with the opposition. Moreover, it assumes that what is foremost in their minds is pushing through a No Deal Brexit, which it isn’t. What is foremost in their minds, is winning a General Election, reversing the damage that May did in 2017, and, from there, carrying through their counter-revolution. Simply getting Britain thrown out of the EU on October 31st doesn’t achieve that, or change anything in their favour. It would leave Johnson leading a Minority Government, and ,potentially, one having to cope with the actual chaos that will follow a No Deal Brexit. It would give them the worst conditions on which to fight an election. Johnson certainly does not want to be fighting a General Election, after the inevitable chaos that a No Deal crash out will bring. That is why it would have been better for Labour to simply challenge him to carry through his No Deal Brexit threat, promising to retrospectively revoke Article 50 after it was returned to government. Now Labour has let him off that hook. But, the strength of the Cummings’ strategy was shown clearly yesterday. It is, in fact, the strategy I had set out last December, of what May should have done had she been a more competent politician. I said, last year, that I expected May to call a snap election in February. The reason was that Labour was in disarray under Corbyn, because of his continued pursuit of his own fantasy Brexit agenda. Had May swung right in February to a hard, Managed No Deal Brexit position, she could do what Cummings/Johnson are doing now, which is to rally the Tory core vote behind them, along with the core Brexit vote, for which there is a large overlap. With Corbyn’s Labour shedding support by the bucket load to the Liberals, Greens, Plaid and SNP, because of its continued pro-Brexit stance, May would have faced a divided opposition, and swept in with a sizeable working majority. The Cummings/Johnson strategy is the same now. Yesterday, on Politics Live, Andrew Neill, a week late in realising that Johnson could simply resign, rather than agree to go to Brussels to ask for an extension, put that scenario to Jo Swinson of the Liberals. “So, what would you do, then,” Neill asked, “would you then support Jeremy Corbyn as caretaker Prime Minister?” And, of course, just as Cummings/Johnson anticipate, the answer back from Swinson was an emphatic “No!” The Liberals, with their pathetic dozen or so MP’s, even after Blair-right and Cameroon defections, insist on determining who that caretaker PM should be, and thereby holding Labour’s 246 MP’s to ransom. The reason for that is again quite simple. The Liberals’ primary aim, as with the Blair-rights, still inside the PLP, is to break apart the Labour Party, and Corbyn’s leadership of it. Their primary aim, above even preventing a No Deal Brexit, is to support their fellow centrists inside the Labour Party to implement their own coup to remove Corbyn, which would spell the end of the Corbynite project within Labour. Its quite clear that Labour is not going to accept any attempts by the Liberals to tell Labour who the next Prime Minister will be. Labour is not going to allow the Liberals, and other assorted rabble alliance forces to tell Labour that they must back Harriet Harman, or some other Blair-right to fulfil that role. So, its quite clear that the Cummings/Johnson strategy is playing out perfectly. Johnson will resign as a matter of principle, of defending democracy on October 17th, rather than carry out the act of surrender that the rabble alliance wants to impose on the country. When that rabble alliance itself then collapses in a fit of internecine squabbling over who should become PM, Johnson will rise above the fray, as an authority figure, pointing out that it was exactly this kind of chaos and disorder that he had tried to prevent, and will make the traditional Bonapartist appeal for order. He will demand the election that the opposition had been too afraid, too undemocratic to agree to, and as the rabble alliance fails to reach agreement, a General Election will then result by default. But, even if that rabble does get itself together enough to select a caretaker Prime Minister, the fractures amongst it will be fatal. If the Liberals, and other rabble have to agree to Corbyn, it will involve them in eating a huge dollop of humble pie. Corbyn, himself, will have to take responsibility for asking for the further extension, which will consolidate opposition to Labour from Leave voters. That will also cause some concern in Labour ranks. The Labour rightwingers, who should have been expelled long ago for having voted with the Tories, are already hankering after some Brexit deal to assuage their reactionary constituents who want to end free movement. At the same time, progressive Labour members do not trust Corbyn not to use the opportunity of such an extension to again pursue the course of trying to negotiate Labour’s fantasy “Jobs First Brexit”, and indeed the fact that Corbyn and Labour has held that position, and it has been resurrected in the last few days, is one reason that the Liberals have been able to justify their own refusal to back him as caretaker PM. And, indeed, it is not at all clear, at this stage, that some rabble alliance comprising the Liberals, SNP, Plaid, Greens, and rebel former Tories might not by-pass Labour, and appoint their own caretaker Prime Minister. After all, Corbyn can probably only count, absolutely, on around 20 Labour MP’s; another result of having failed to carry through mandatory reselection after 2015, which allowed all of those right-wing Labour MP’s to fight the 2017 election. It would mean a fundamental split in the Labour Party, and the fundamental contradictions in such an alliance would quickly break it apart, but it would probably result in a realignment of parties, with the Liberals taking on sizeable extra weight, from the bulk of Blair-right MP’s, and some Cameroon Tories. Of course, I do not want to see any such development. Everything I have written over the last few years has tried to warn of this kind of development, but the job of Marxists, as social scientists, as well as revolutionaries, who must begin from facts, in our attempts to understand and change the world, is to analyse and describe the world, objectively, as it is, not to act as moralists and subjectivists describing the world as we would like it to be. In 2016, I spent many weeks arguing against Brexit, and setting out how it needed to be opposed by putting forward a positive, progressive, internationalist view of how the EU could be reformed, and utilised by socialists. Yet, on the eve of the vote, I pointed out that, any objective analysis indicated that, the vote would be lost, and there would be a vote to Leave. It arose, because the forces backing Remain were a rabble, they had no clear positive attractive message to sell, whilst the Brexiteers were able to concentrate on a core vote strategy. On one level it was symbolised by the slogan “Take Back Control”, but that slogan was itself code for “Close The Borders”, and in the minds of some “Kick Out the Immigrants”. Today, Cummings is again directing Johnson’s strategy, and he is pursuing the same core strategy of focusing on the 80% of Tory members and voters that want a No Deal Brexit. They represent only around 25–30% of the electorate as a whole, but with a divided opposition split amongst the rabble alliance, that is enough, with the other elements of the Tory vote, to secure a majority, especially as Labour continues to vacillate with its own fantasy Brexit position. The stage is set, for Johnson to resign and adopt a position of extreme opposition, presenting himself as a principled tribune of the people, ready to step back into the fray, to end the chaos and disorder that the rabble alliance will have caused. He does not have to actually carry through an immediate No Deal Brexit, once elected with a sizeable parliamentary majority. Once elected, he will have five years, more if his Bonapartist regime simply amends the Constitution. He will be able to go back to the EU, to negotiate a deal before the end of any extension agreed by the caretaker PM runs out. But, he can simply put forward the case for a Managed No Deal, and argue the case for negotiating that over a longer period if required, because he will not have a General Election, and the Brexit party then breathing down his neck. Of course, given the Bonapartist nature of the Cummings/Johnson regime, they may feel that confrontation is what they thrive on. They may challenge the EU to accept a No Deal crash out in January, seeing that as a good opportunity to utilise the Emergency Powers Act to implement martial law, and grab additional executive power. Either way, we are in for a period of a strong state, unless the labour movement can stop them in their tracks, by decisive, militant, direct action. We are likely to see a regime that will be something between that of Trump, and that of Orban. The liberal luvvies had better get used to a lot more harsh and intemperate language, as the least of their troubles."
Medium.com,Society,50% of the UK still Want to Leave the EU,World,https://medium.com/uk-politics-today/50-of-the-uk-still-want-to-leave-the-eu-e0ad7df8e98c?source=topic_page---------704------------------1," It is still unbelievable that so many citizens from the United Kingdom want to leave the European Union after all the truth about Brexit has been brought to light. The thing that is even sadder is their petty argument: “We want our country back” It again just blows my mind, who has taken your country in the first place? Just because the country is full of immigrants this does not mean that they have taken your country, as long as you still have all your rights as a British citizen no one has deprived you of anything. Better yet, these so-called ‘immigrants’ have raised the economy of the country for the last 5 years and they still have the nerves to throw them out when they are here to make an honest living as their countries do not provide the same opportunities or the same quality of public services. Do people not actually realise the importance or severity of this event? Such a political change would have a devastating effect, which apparently 50% of the country is denying because of their denial. We are trying to do everything to show them the light, the truth about Brexit and how Boris Johnson has lied all the way through his campaign just to receive fame and I guess a better paycheck. My question is where does all this hatred from the 50% come from? Has this hatred been hiding inside them? Have we, the other 50% that want to be united with other countries done something to cause this hatred? So many questions with no answers as the 50% that want out of the European Union know only to argue with other questions, false facts as well as false accusations. Funny enough they say that they do not want to be in a democratic government that controls their choices… The level of stupidity in some is just to be ridiculed with (with all due respect). I tend to listen to LBC Radio almost every morning and sometimes they take in calls from Brexiteers that are contradicting themselves in their own argument as they have no clue how politics actually work or any idea of what their government is about to do to Britain. As amusing as it can be sometimes it is sad to see so much hate. Usually, Brexiteers are sensitive and if you do start an argument with them they become very defensive to the point where they change their argument every 5 seconds and it makes no sense what so ever. I am the type of person to not desire an argument as most arguments do not offer me any physical reward and in my opinion, it is just a waste of time and energy (especially when arguing with a person that has not done their research). It is really difficult to argue with someone that only has read the cover of the book whilst you actually read the whole book and have the right knowledge. As mentioned before, everyone is entitled to their own opinion and I think that we should respect this opinion to the extent where the opinion you have does not affect my future or the future of the country. If this 50% want to live in denial than it is simply their choice. However, they need to understand that their are contributing to the mess Brexit is making in this country and not helping to clean it or at least organise it."
Medium.com,Society,Air Afrique: the African dream that never reached cruising altitude,World,https://medium.com/swlh/air-afrique-the-african-dream-that-never-reached-cruising-altitude-35cbe001ef7e?source=topic_page---------705------------------1," As a child, I didn’t have a clue on how airlines operated. I simply knew that people sat in those flying machines and they traveled very far and very fast. But the first time I heard about Air Afrique, it ignited such a strong sentiment in me. I didn’t even know who owned the firm, but the name reassured me that it was truly African. I was captivated by Air Afrique because whenever I watched their commercials on T.V., I saw pilots and crew members who looked like me. And I found their posters fascinating because they depicted an Africa that I was familiar with. I was so infatuated with Air Afrique that at that age, I thought it was a much bigger airline than Air France and KLM, the only other carriers I knew. Each time the engines of an aircraft roared through the skies, I pictured a black pilot in command with the beautiful flight attendants whom I loved. Was Air Afrique that glorious or was it a fantasy that I had as a child? Indeed, most Africans who knew Air Afrique would agree with me that it was an airline that made them proud. A truly multinational firm owned mostly by African states. Nevertheless, the 41-year lifespan of Air Afrique wasn’t that splendid in many aspects. Besides its early years when the company quickly grew its operations, Air Afrique’s history was underlined by a visionless leadership, an opaque management, and constant power-plays. Air Afrique was principally owned by a consortium of francophone African countries that interestingly, were also either former French colonies or protectorates. Sierra Leone was the only anglophone country shareholder and it joined much later in 1978. During the Treaty of Yaoundé on March 28th, 1961 in Cameroon, 11 African countries established Air Afrique. The countries that signed the treaty were: Congo, Central African Republic, Cameroon, Côte d’Ivoire, Gabon, Benin, Burkina Faso, Mauritania, Niger, Senegal, and Chad. It wasn’t until in 1968 that Togo and in 1992 that Mali, officially held a participating stake in the firm. The African countries had a 66% share in the venture while Air France and Union Aéromaritime de Transport (UAT) held a 16% stake each. Over the years, Gabon, Cameroon, and Sierra Leone disposed of their equity in the firm, leaving 11 members. The table below from an AfDB report, lists the shareholders of Air Afrique in 1999. The states increased their shares to 70.40% after the other members exited. Air Afrique was established during a period when African countries — mostly colonized by the French — were gaining their independence in a rapid sequence. From 1957 to 1961, out of the 24 African countries that gained their independence, 15 were former colonies or protectorates of France. Hence, the firm was born from the heydays of the independence years in those countries. It was clear that the Air Afrique project was driven by a strong desire of some African leaders to have a common identity. They found this identity in an airline they would own, and which would ensure the transportation of their people within their borders and beyond; an airline that could eventually compete against the airlines of countries that just yesterday, besieged them. Some people argue that Air Afrique was less of a pan-African dream — as depicted — and more of an opportunity that the leaders identified to exploit a commercial activity for the benefit of their newly independent countries. I disagree. Given the period in which the company was launched, leaders in the newly independent countries were looking to make a statement that, united, they could accomplish great exploits. Furthermore, the Organization of African Unity (OAU) was also created in 1963 and it is a strong indication of the pan-African sentiment that was present in Africa during that period. Despite some internal disagreements among member states, Air Afrique was off to a remarkable operational start. The firm scaled rapidly by leasing new aircraft, opening new agencies, and flying new routes. In October 1961, it began its first long-haul flights between Africa and France. By April 1965, Air Afrique had a fleet of nine aircraft and it managed 2,500 employees. At its height, Air Afrique employed over 5,000 people and served 30 destinations in Africa, Europe and North America. The company even flew Pope John Paul II from Ghana to Côte d’Ivoire and from Côte d’Ivoire to Rome in May 1980 when the Pope toured Africa. In retrospect, the fate of Air Afrique was inevitable from the get-go. Besides the disappointing leadership, one can also point to a few other external factors that contributed to the firm’s downfall. But in my opinion, all these reasons were simply the consequences of a leadership that lacked vision and a bad operational execution. Although internal conflicts and inadequate management were present since the inception of the pan-African airline, the outcomes only began to manifest in the operations of the firm during the 1980s. The visionless leadership that I refer to extends beyond the leadership of the firm. It included political leaders who wanted to have things done their way at Air Afrique. Remember, Air Afrique regrouped 11 countries and political leaders quickly saw an opportunity to reward allies through nominations and promotions and punish foes through layoffs. Leaders also manifested their ego. For example, there was a bitter debate between a few state leaders regarding where the headquarters of the pan-African firm should be. It was finally inaugurated in Côte d’Ivoire, but the tussle had already damaged the comradeship among the political leaders. Many countries had even established their own airlines with a couple of planes. They eventually went bankrupt. In another example, some country leaders were quite upset that there weren’t many people from their countries in management roles within the firm. As trivial as this may seem, this caused some countries such as Cameroon and Gabon to exit Air Afrique. Political leaders weren’t the only guilty ones. At the operational level, executives, branch managers, and other decision-makers engaged in behaviors and decisions that one could only qualify as a suicide mission for Air Afrique. There are first-hand accounts that some high-ranking executives were suddenly struck with the urge to run for top-level political positions in their countries. They were emboldened because they were running a pan-African firm which was also very political. As a result, they focused more on nurturing their political ambitions and less on sustaining the airline. This also put them in conflict with their country leaders who were not to be challenged by people they nominated. In the past, I had the opportunity to speak with a few people who were either related to or knew people who had worked at Air Afrique. They narrated stories of family members and acquaintances of high-level personnel of the firm who flew regularly for free with Air Afrique. Some housewives became business women overnight and started selling fresh vegetables and African food in Europe. A few years ago, during a conversation with a friend, he revealed to me that he knew a woman who regularly traveled from Togo to France to sell okra and other spices. She didn’t hide the fact that she traveled gratis. The Air Afrique segment of her business was so lucrative that she began to neglect her other activities in Togo. There were reports of Air Afrique flight attendants who were involved in commerce and they stuffed their luggage with merchandise. Business was booming for many people because of Air Afrique. Evidently, there’s no such thing as free lunch and somehow, someone had to pick up the tab. In this case, it was Air Afrique who was liable for the expenses. The company struggled to pay its creditors and the African states desperately injected cash on multiple occasions to keep the company afloat. The situation only worsened with cancelled flights and excessive tardiness. Some flights even reportedly departed earlier than scheduled, leaving passengers stranded and confused. To top it all off, between 1987 and 2000, there were six reported incidents with Air Afrique’s flights. Clearly, in a highly competitive industry, customers would begin to choose alternative airlines whenever they could. In 1994, France devalued by 50%, the value of the common currency that 10 of the 11 African countries used: the CFA franc. Mauritania had its own currency. Regarding Sierra Leone, it didn’t use the CFA franc and I couldn’t find data on this, but I believe by 1994 the country had already exited Air Afrique because the civil war began in 1991. I published an article which explains the history of the CFA franc currency and why France even had the right to devalue a currency that African nations utilized. The consequences of the devaluation were quite damaging to Air Afrique. The firm earned in local currencies but paid for the lion’s share of its expenses in dollars. It also affected the firm’s customers in the countries which used the CFA franc. Their purchasing power decreased as a result of the devaluation and planes tickets became theoretically 50% more expensive for them. I reckon that traffic from Europe to Africa increased on the other hand, helping to offset some of the losses in domestic flights. It is my view that too much weight shouldn’t be given to the devaluation of the CFA franc in Air Afrique’s demise. By 1990 and 1991, it was clear to all decision makers — therefore to Air Afrique’s executives as well — that the CFA franc would soon be devaluated, and that it was the only option that France and the Bretton Woods institutions expected. Had Air Afrique maintained strong financial results during the prior years and implemented very efficient operations, it could have weathered the storm. Unfortunately, by 1994 the firm’s financial health had already deteriorated and the devaluation simply put it into a coma that it was never able to recover from. By the mid-1990s, the firm’s debt almost doubled in the wake of the currency devaluation. In 1993, total debt was about 142 billion CFA francs. In 1994, this amount ballooned to 237 billion CFA francs. It did however manage to reduce the total entity debt to 176.49 billion CFA franc ($229 million) by 1999. It was reported that by the beginning of 1997 with a new CEO, Air Afrique was paying off 300 million CFA francs (> $500,000) of debts every week. By reducing its debt, Air Afrique significantly reduced losses in 1997, but this came at a very steep price. Firstly, Air Afrique handed over four of its Airbus aircraft to creditors, significantly reducing the number of international routes (Africa-Europe-Africa-North America) that they served. Secondly, the company was paying off so much debt that it didn’t have much retained earnings left to invest into revenue-generating activities. Consequently, the firm’s finances were still in the red and by 2001, Air Afrique had accumulated 332 billion CFA francs ($431 millions) in debts. Below is an image of Air Afrique’s P&L statements from 1989 to 1997. It’s in French, but you can see the negative net income starting from 1993. Also, note the significant increase in expenses starting from 1994. Most likely due to the devaluation of the CFA franc. Multiple meetings were held between heads of state, ministers, shareholders and finance institutions, all in the goal of saving the pan-African airline. Many emergency plans resulted from these meetings. In my opinion, whenever an organization begins to initiate many emergency plans, it means the organization was too late in implementing strategic plans that would have helped it to avoid emergency situations in the first place. Efforts to save Air Afrique were unsuccessful. Even the World Bank tried its luck. With Air Afrique’s board of directors’ mandate, in January 2001 the World Bank designated the former CEO of Trans World Airlines (TWA) Jeffrey Erickson, to become CEO of the firm during its restructuring efforts in the hopes of privatizing it. His tenure was marked by many layoffs, strikes, and misunderstanding with his team. He didn’t speak a word of French. The antics lasted for nearly a year before the World Bank threw in the towel. The most serious attempt to revive Air Afrique occurred in August 2001. Air France discussed with the states its plan to increase its stake to 35% in Air Afrique by injecting fresh capital (€19.06 million) and re-branding the new firm Nouvelle Air Afrique, meaning the New Air Afrique. Consequently, African states were to reduce their share to 22%, giving Air France a controlling stake in the firm and giving it more flexibility to implement restructuring plans. Why was Air France adamant in keeping a doomed airline alive? The African countries maintained the rights to the routes in their countries and this constituted an asset that Air France did not want to lose. In any case, this plan was scraped like many other ones for a couple of important reasons. Air France wanted to acquire the rights to Air Afrique’s routes. The states didn’t want this because some of the countries had already established their own airlines and they didn’t want Air France to have exclusive rights to their routes. Also, at that point the member states were simply exhausted from the challenges that the airline faced, and they no longer had the initial urge to run a unified enterprise. On February 7th, 2002 news agencies around the world reported during an extraordinary board meeting in Côte d’Ivoire, that the 11 states decided to file for bankruptcy, unable to find a viable solution for the $464 million debt that the firm owed to creditors at the time. Overnight, 4,200 Air Afrique employees became jobless. The debt chapter was over, and it was simply the end of the Air Afrique novel. Most of the employees were left to fend for themselves and for many of them still, the book remains because they’re still fighting for their severance packages. Following the liquidation of Air Afrique, the African state shareholders tended to their airlines and others established their own. Toumaï Air Chad, the flag carrier airline of Chad, was established in 2004; Compagnie Aérienne du Mali launched in 2005; Senegal Airlines was relaunched in 2009. The newly-created and revamped airlines didn’t last for a few reasons. Firstly, they transposed the same bad management and visionless leadership to the state-owned airlines in the hopes of a different result. Secondly, the airlines industry is a historically competitive industry where margins are quite low. As a result, profitable airlines rely on economies of scale and operations efficiency to stay afloat. The state airlines hurriedly leased a few planes and they were in service. Some even had only a couple of aircraft in their fleet. Clearly, they weren’t going anywhere far. Air Togo for example, was only in service for two years with two aircraft before it finally went bankrupt. It was a similar fate for the other airlines. The firms that survived over many years were dependent on constant cash injection or they ceded much of their capital to bigger western airlines. Finally, although Africans increasingly traveled by air over the years, air travel still represented a small portion of transportation mediums for Africans. Airlines which found success in Africa used hubs to increase capacity on their flights because the market is so fragmented. The state-owned airlines didn’t have the scale to establish these hubs and they struggled with empty seats. The situation hasn’t changed significantly today. This wasn’t the case during the early years of Air Afrique because there were 11 shareholders and by pooling their capital together, they could add many more aircraft to their fleet. They also shared routes, reducing some of the regulatory obstacles that smaller airlines faced. When you observe the airline industry in Africa today, the best regional airline is arguably Asky Airlines. The firm is based in Lomé, the capital city of Togo. Interestingly, Asky received a lot of political backing from most of the states that were shareholders of Air Afrique. The main difference was that most of the shares were owned by private investors. I think the states and other investors learned a lesson from Air Afrique and they wanted to avoid states’ interference in the new airline. When you analyze Asky Airlines further, you’d realize that Ethiopian airlines has about a 40% stake in the firm. Ethiopian airlines is in turn wholly owned by the Ethiopian government and it is the best and most efficient airlines in Africa and one of the best in the world. This is to say that a partial ownership of governments in an airline is not intrinsically a bad strategy. In fact, most flag-carrying airlines have as shareholders, countries or investment vehicles in which countries have a sizable share. This means Air Afrique didn’t fail simply because African countries owned shares in the firm. It failed because of bad management and a lack of vision. Ethiopian airlines is a government entity, but with a clear vision and a sound management, the firm has become the poster child of successful African airlines. Perhaps though, a single government has more flexibility to dictate policies for a state entity whereas multiple countries would result in many more conflicts of interest. Maybe single-party systems work better than multi-party systems in state entities (parties denoting countries). In the next few years, competition will intensify in the air transportation industry in Africa. Regional airlines such as Asky have a better chance of surviving or even thriving than most national airlines. In the recent past, countries such as Senegal and Côte d’Ivoire have relaunched their airlines. It’s important to remember that all the national airlines of the “11” have all went bankrupt. The ones that are currently operating have been through at least one bankruptcy proceeding and are new airlines created from the ashes of the old ones. Even with a resolute management, the industry is a lot more competitive than ever and these national airlines will struggle to survive. I envision that to stay afloat, some of the airlines will sell a bigger portion of their shares to private and institutional investors. They will also collaborate more than before, with their technical partners. In this case, Ethiopian airlines would be a great technical and strategic partner for these state airlines. It’s even possible that Ethiopian airlines sometimes in the near future, creates another entity which will acquire, merge, or own majority shares in some of the smaller state airlines which are strategically located in order to create more regional hubs."

Part 1: Homegrown Terror: The Birth of the Japanese Red Army
Part 2: Blood on the Snow: The Horrifying Implosion of Japan’s United Red Army It was February 19th, 1972, and Muta Yasuko, wife of the caretaker of the Asama-Sanso lodge near Karuizawa, Nagano Prefecture, was terrified. She lay against a wall, her hands and legs tied, as the five ragged men went about the business of ransacking the lodge whose upkeep she had put so much work into. They had ripped up the tatami flooring and upended the furniture, using every available item of size to barricade the doors and windows. One of the intruders had commented on the copious foodstuffs found in the lodge’s pantry; it was clear they were here for the long term. Twenty-five-year-old Bando Kunio, who had taken on the most active role amongst the harried bunch, had been relieved to find no one else in the lodge. He and the four others from his group were erstwhile revolutionaries, members of Japan’s most violent far-left radical student group, the recently christened United Red Army. Their organization had been born in the heady and chaotic days of the late 1960s amongst the rapidly radicalizing Japanese far left student movement. Enraged by curtailments on the new democratic rights granted to Japanese citizens following World War II, and frustrated by Japan’s tacit involvement in American-led imperialistic military action in Vietnam and other parts of the world, hundreds of thousands of young Japanese university students had taken to the streets. At first there was mass support from the Japanese population for these large-scale protests, but as violent clashes with the police ensued, police crackdowns resulted, and many far-left student groups were pushed underground. The Red Army Faction — the URA’s parent organization, and brainchild of the international revolution-minded Shiomi Takaya — had made a name for itself in this era by attacking police officers and engaging in Japan’s first airline hijacking, dramatically commandeering a Japan Airlines flight and forcing it to fly to North Korea. Notoriety led to greater police surveillance and rounds of arrests, and the Red Army Faction found itself left in the hands of the hapless Mori Tsuneo. A need for hard-to-find weaponry led to Mori merging his crew with a separate violent leftist group led by the sadistic Nagata Hiroko. Amongst the growing pains of their new joint group, the United Red Army, one of the Mori’s best and brightest, Shigenobu Fusako, left Japan to form an international terrorist wing of the Red Army in Lebanon. Back in Japan, Mori and Nagata convened a training camp for their radicals at an isolated cabin in the depths of the snowy mountains of Gunma Prefecture, a location partially to hide out from police. There, amidst the heightened emotions and intensive rhetoric of self-criticism, meant to inspire revolutionary zeal, something unbelievably grotesque had occurred. The gathered United Red Army members had committed a heinous and horrific purge of their own membership, torturing and killing twelve of the twenty-nine individuals there assembled. With their comrades now buried in cold, shallow graves, the surviving core membership of the Red Army had fled the encroaching police, taking flight into the mountain passes on foot. Bando’s crew included Sakaguchi Hiroshi, recently spurned husband of United Red Army leader Nagata, who had just announced her intended marital union with her co-leader, Mori, only days before the two were arrested attempting to link up the rest of their fleeing entourage. There were also the two surviving Kato brothers, who had participated in the murder of their older brother in the URA bloody purge, and had split off from the rest of the fleeing URA survivors as they neared the border with Nagano Prefecture. The police had been close behind. Bando and Sakaguchi had spied officers clambering through the snow in the pass below them, and had unloaded bullets in their direction before continuing their flight. Nearing the mountain resort town of Karuizawa, Bando had thought to steal a car at gunpoint, but the sight of a strange, almost fortress-like building had changed his mind. When he and his men had entered the three-storied, arrow-shaped lodge and discovered only Mrs. Muta to be present, Bando’s decision had been made. There could be no better spot for a last stand than a fortified building clinging to the side of a mountain which, like some medieval castle, commanded the heights. In the valley below, the police were amassing. The officers they had shot at had clearly called in reinforcements, and the revolutionaries’ intrusion into the lodge had not gone unnoticed. Unknown to Bando or his crew, not only had the leaders of their movement just been arrested in Gunma, but four of those who they had fled with had just been apprehended at a nearby train station — the stench and bedraggled appearance of the rugged radicals had caused a newspaper stand owner to connect the dots to the stories in the papers she sold. The police arrived shortly after she called them. Back at the Asama-Sanso lodge, tensions were rising. There were now well over a thousand specialized riot police who had gathered at the scene, standing in long, dark rows, the black of their helmets and flack jackets contrasting with the white snow. Armored trucks had managed to snake their way up the mountain path as well, creating a natural barrier behind which the police could take cover. Sharpshooters had been stationed on the ridges, and roadblocks had been set up to prevent any possible escape. Then there were the news crews, covering what was becoming an unbelievable story. The images they streamed into Japanese living rooms almost non-stop would go on to have great effects on Japanese society; iconic images of the waiting riot police slurping down instant ramen is even believed to have helped popularize the food as an emergency foodstuff. Occasionally, gunfire would ring out from the lodge as the police encroached too near. The hostage’s husband watched it all with mounting anxiety; he had been out showing the lodge guests around at the time when the United Red Army had chosen his hotel to make their last stand. He worried for his anemic wife, and begged time and again to the police to let him switch places with her. But the radicals in the lodge never responded. The unchanging monotony of the standoff was soon shattered. Tanaka Yasuhiro, a young snack bar owner from neighboring Niigata Prefecture, had been moved by the near-constant media coverage of the ongoing hostage crisis. Inspired to action in a way that seems almost manic, he made his way to the scene, where he attempted to push his way through the police line. The police, of course, would have none of this civilian interference, and arrested him. But when he was released later that day, Tanaka simply decided to try a different method. Climbing the slopes north of the lodge, he ran onto the scene, and managed to sprint through police barricades before they could stop him. He bore with him a bento box, perhaps hoping to open a line of communication with the radicals by ingratiating himself with them; alas, he had seriously misread the situation. As he tried to push the box through a small opening into the building, a shot rang out, and he staggered backwards. He had been shot in the head. The injury proved fatal, and Tanaka, who had perhaps dreamed of somehow becoming a hero, instead became the first casualty of the Asama-Sanso Incident. On the third day of the hostage crisis, February 21st, the police were becoming anxious. Little progress had been made, and the radicals had managed to kill one manic civilian and shoot two police officers non-fatally. The entire Japanese public was watching, waiting for them to act. The lodge’s heat and water, which had formerly been left on for the sake of the comfort of the hostage, was cut. As the interior of the lodge became more frigid and inhospitable, the parents of some of the radicals were brought in (unknown at the time was that the child of one of these parents had already been killed in the purge). The parents, horrified by what their progeny were engaged in, used loudspeakers to implore their children to come to their senses. No response was forthcoming. On the fourth day, the police began to use force. Two armored vehicles moved in on the lodge, and the police crouching behind them fired tear gas through the building’s windows. The hostage-takers, holding rags to their mouths, fired at the police, who took cover as bullets whizzed by and ricocheted off their vehicles. The police backed off, but by night they began employing a new tactic: psychological warfare. Loudspeakers blared disturbing noise, preventing sleep; recorded sounds of chainsaws, protests, sirens, and more. The sounds would persist and then suddenly stop, only to start up again once enough time had passed to allow the targets to perhaps drift to sleep. (This sort of sleep torture is reportedly still being used as a Japanese police interrogation method — which may help explain high conviction rates in the country). Later, they would employ floodlights to turn the night skies to day, as well as a baseball pitching machine that would pelt rocks at the building to keep the occupiers from getting any rest. The next morning, an attempted invasion by a brigade of policemen was foiled when untimely winds blew their smoke screen cover away. They switched out their initial plan for one in which high-powered water hoses were aimed at the the living quarters of the lodge. The jets of water burst forth, smashing through windows, knocking over barricades, and inundating the rooms. Tear gas canisters followed, whose noxious fumes pushed the hijackers deeper into the recesses of the building. As night fell and the water inside the lodge froze solid, the assault of sound and noise began again. Finally, the morning dawned on February 28th, the tenth day of the hostage situation. The loudspeakers blared a few final pleas to the radicals to lay down their arms. As always, there was no response. Ambulances had arrived at the scene in preparation for what was about to ensue. Protective sandbags had been piled high into the air, and a net had been strung in front of the building entrance to prevent the throwing of grenades from within the lodge. At last, the final order came in, and the assault commenced. As the police approached, the radicals let loose a volley of bullets; the police took cover as water jets were shot back into the building. Next came the wrecking crew. A crane was moved laboriously into position, from which it swung its wrecking ball directly at the entrance of the building, completely demolishing it. Other police leapt forward with chain and hacksaw, creating openings in the lower floors. A special police task force brought up from Tokyo entered through the newly made openings, facing no opposition on the first, ruined floor. As the Tokyo police made their way to the stairs, a shot rang out from above, though not aimed at them. One of the radicals had spotted a police superintendent in the valley below who had been motivating his men from outside of cover. The revolutionaries had shot him squarely in the eye. The United Red Army had killed its first police officer. As the officers inside the lodge cleared the second floor and ascended to the third, another officer was shot dead as he peered around a corner. His fellows now un-holstered their guns. The assault had now lasted five long hours. In homes across Japan, viewers sat on the edges of their seats, awestruck at the country’s first ever marathon live television broadcast. By 6:26 PM, viewership rankings for the broadcast would reach an unheard of 89.7% of houses with televisions. The entire country stood in rapt attention. A handmade incendiary exploded near the invading police, injuring over ten of them, although not fatally. Finally, the officers on the top floor breached the last of the barricades, managing to apprehended one of the Kato brothers. The remaining four radicals were buried under a pile of protective futons in the final room, still brandishing weapons. As the police approached them, Bando shot the closest officer in the eye. The man staggered over, but incredibly, he would survive. In the chaos, the other police leapt at the radicals. When the dust had settled, all five hostage-takers were in handcuffs. The siege of Asama-Sanso had ended. Muta Yasuko had been saved. So ended the dark saga of the United Red Army. The organization spawned by the mind of the founder of its parent organization, Shiomi Takaya would cease to plague Japan. By the time the bodies of the twelve purged youth had been discovered at the foothills of the mountains in Gunma, popular sentiment in Japan had been turned away not only from violent activists, but also from political activism in general. The JAL hijacking, the purges, the siege of Asama-Sanso — all shook Japan to its core. It was clear that there was to be a great deal of soul-searching in the offing. Japan’s Minister of Education spoke up following the disinterment of the bodies, harshly criticizing the teachers and professors of Japan for failing their youth by creating a system in which such violence had been allowed to be fostered. Universities were no longer to be a place of radicalization; rather, they were to take their intended form as a stepping stone to careers and life employment within the ordered system of Japanese society. In the eyes of the public, the judicial sentencing that soon followed for the radical perpetrators of these crimes befitted the evil that had occurred. Nagata, Mori, and Sakaguchi were all sentenced to death. Mori committed suicide a year later, strangling himself with a bed sheet in his prison cell. The other two had trials and appeals that continued for decades and held off their final days of judgment. Nagata passed away of brain cancer while still imprisoned in 2011, four decades after she led her grisly purge. Her husband, Sakaguchi, remains alive. As of 2019, he is still awaiting execution. Bando Kunio, who led the five invaders into the Asama-Sanso lodge, and who killed a policeman in the ensuing battle, was spared death, but still received an extremely long jail sentence. His father, upon seeing confirmation that his son had been one of the hostage-takers on TV, immediately committed suicide. Despite his jail sentence, Bando’s days in the revolutionary field were far from over. The hostage from the Siege of the Asama-Sanso Lodge, Muta Yasuko, returned to her daily life. Despite the national fame her captivity granted her (her picture had been broadcast innumerable times during the event, and she had broken the previous modern Japanese record for hours spent hostage many times over), she declined all requests for interviews after her initial rescuing. She claimed her captors had treated her kindly, despite tying her to a bed — one had even given her an omamori, a temple charm, that he said would help keep her safe. With the vast majority of their core membership dead or imprisoned, and having lost even an ounce of public support, the United Red Army ceased to exist. With an increasingly militarized, skilled, and vigilant police force, and with no public backing, groups like the URA could no longer functionally operate in Japan. After twenty years, the mass student movement in Japan had come to a horrifying, distressing end. The youth of Japan remain apathetic to politics, and their civic engagement remains low. The shock caused by the URA is just one amongst many phenomena that led to these trends, but one that is hard to ignore. And yet, despite all this, the movement that began with the Red Army Faction had not yet been snuffed out. In faraway Lebanon, Shigenobu Fusako was still fighting for her cause, more passionate than ever. Soon she would have a small militia of hardened, trained revolutionaries to call her own. Escaping the chaos and self-destruction of the United Red Army in Japan, Shigenobu was about to emblazon the name of her movement across the world. She would do so by turning to terrorism of a type her revolutionary brothers and sisters back in Japan could barely imagine. For the next two decades, she would make the imperialist world fear the name of the Japanese Red Army.

Then, a tall, young, and handsome man dressed in an Arab Thawb (garment) emerged and walked down the steps accompanied by his equally good-looking and a youthful brother. Abubakar Mohamed, a popular Somali social media cleric, and his brother Omar Mohamed were greeted on the tarmac by another boyish-looking Somali official, Abdinur M. Ahmed, Director of Communications — Office of the President. Abdinur, as he is popularly known, greeted and hugged Abubakar and his brother, and then the trio walked to the airport’s VIP waiting room. This unique airport reception for a visiting cleric was an example of a clear government policy to latch into popular religious celebrities, co-opt them, and use them to serve like Roman Praetorian guards who would vigilantly defend the government. In the past few months alone, the Ministry of Religion and the Ministry of Sports and Youth have sponsored and supported public lectures by Abubakar and Sheikh Kenyawi, both from the diaspora, at Mogadishu’s Konis (now renamed Engineer Yariisow) Stadium. Sheikh Kenyawi spoke about the theme of forgiveness and Abubakar delivered a speech about the role of youth in society. The hype of these lectures was just a crude form of Mogadishu performance art. And then, there was the April 2019 conference in Mogadishu for Somali clerics sponsored by the Ministry of Religion. Abubakar: A Millennial Preacher Abubakar Mohamed, a Somali resident of the Netherlands, emerged on social media several years ago. He has no religious training, nor does he serve as an imam of a mosque. His topics are mostly spiritual and relate to self-help. The range of his religious lessons is at best limited and at times redundant. Mostly, he gives short talks on social media and has a tendency to appear occasionally with other clerics, depending on where he is visiting. He travels a lot and claims that he is running three separate businesses. He has written a self-published book in Somali, Ku Raaxeeyso Noloshaada (Enjoy Your Life) and was a guest at the Mogadishu Book Fair (MBF). The book, as its title indicates, is specifically geared to a wider audience and explains that one can solve problems — any problem — if certain steps of self-improvement are taken. Abubakar has a laid-back and encouraging personality. His approach of preaching, in short, can be summarized as, “Don’t worry, be happy.” Abubakar talks a lot about love. While traveling, he preaches about the importance of love in one’s life and the joy of the beautiful faces of people he meets. “I swear by God, I love you,” he says. The audience, who are mostly impressionable youth, applaud and cheer. In Mogadishu Stadium, he told his audience they were “the most beautiful people in the world and not even in China and America can people like you be found.” However, Abubakar’s emphasis on love has raised eyebrows among some people because of his marital status. He is single. While visiting Britain, an interviewer asked Abubakar why a handsome, healthy, and religious young man like him is still single. Abubakar giggled nervously and then fumbled for words. “You know, I am asked this question four or five times a day,” he responded. It was obvious he did not want to answer the question and he spent a minute or two beating around the bush. “I am having difficulty making a choice among many women,” he mumbled, smiling. Then the interviewer came to his rescue and asked if wanted to marry a pretty woman or a religious one. “A religious one,” Abubakar said bashfully. Abubakar elaborated on the type of woman he would marry: “Someone who is kind, pretty, and makes me smile when I see her from two kilometers away. A woman whom we can understand each other.” Subsequently, what followed was an alarming statement which had a whiff of narcissism to it, or perhaps it was youthful hubris. “I want someone who likes what I like, hates what I hate, and who will take care of me,” he said. While in Mogadishu, Abubakar and his brother met senior government officials, including Prime Minister Hassan Kheyre. They also visited schools, the Grand Mosque of Is-Bahaysiga, and Lido Beach. Their presence in the capital was a publicity stunt for the government because the duo are popular with the youth — inside and outside the country — and they are preachers known for talking about safe topics. Abubakar and Sheikh Kenyawi will not talk about hard-hitting subjects such as corruption, security lapses in Mogadishu, the thousands of Somali youth who have left the country, risking their lives in search of a better life in Europe, and the ever-growing disparity between the privileged few and the masses. Like any social media phenomenon, Abubakar’s rise might be ephemeral and, hence, the star that burns so brightly could get extinguished quickly. A Conference for Clerics On April 21, 2019, the Somali federal government sponsored a conference for a limited number of Somali clerics. President Mohamed Farmajo opened the gathering and Prime Minister Hassan Kheyre closed it three days later. It was an environment suffused with self-congratulation. Somalia, like any Muslim country, has a coterie of clerics close to the government. These clerics provide legitimacy to the regime, especially when the main, virulent opposition group in the country is Al-Shabaab, an organization with radical religious ideology. The terror group contends that the federal government is un-Islamic and, hence, must be violently removed. Participants in the Mogadishu conference were mostly clerics based inside the country, although two clerics from Minnesota (Hassan Jaamici and Abdirahman Sheikh Omar) were also invited. The goal of the conference was to show the public that the religious scholars are in congruence with the government in a) the war against Al-Shabaab, b) the dispute between the federal government and regional states, and c) the political stalemate between the government and opposition groups. Figures like Sheikh Bashir Ahmed-Salad Warsame, Sheikh Nur Barud Gurxan, Sheikh Ali Wajiz and Sheikh Somo were in the forefront. These clerics have historically supported the government, regardless of who has been the head of state. As a result, Al-Shabaab targets these clerics and, hence, the government houses, feeds, and protects them. Last year, one of these clerics, Ali Wajiz, was giving a Friday sermon at the mosque in Villa Somalia when the sermon suddenly degenerated into a shouting match. An opposition lawmaker had interrupted Wajiz for spewing venom against government critics. Wajiz went on a tear and asked the lawmaker to shut up. Then, the cleric accused the lawmaker of “taking bribes from the United Arab Emirates.” The clerics at the April conference vowed to resist Al-Shabaab and called the group heretical. Sheikh Abdirahman Sheikh Omar from Minnesota warned the terror group that he and the other clerics would wage an all-out war against them “if the terrorists do not repent and lay down arms.” Sheikh Hassan Jaamici, also from Minnesota, declared that he and other clerics were willing to go to Al-Shabaab and negotiate with them. If not, “I am willing to put on a military fatigue and fight them,” he added. His willingness to fight the group astounded Abdirahman Baadiyow, an advisor of the prime minister, who exclaimed: “Are you serious?” Jaamici answered, “Yes, I am serious.” Sheikh Jaamici said he is an avowed supporter of President Farmajo’s government and his party’s slogan, N&N, which stands for “Nabad & Nolol” (Peace and Life). Then the cleric turned to the president, who was in the audience, and told a story about a government critic he had spoken to who was surprised that Jaamici was a supporter of N&N. “Do you know that N&N is in the Quran — specifically in Surat Qureish,” he said. Jaamici added that if Muslims followed the Sharia, they would get peace and life. Suddenly, there was an awkward silence and the statement set off sirens in some heads. Farmajo must have felt embarrassed because the wrench in his eyes was noticeable. No one in his government ever thought of linking the Quran to his party’s slogan of N&N, not in a million years. Unfortunately, the cleric’s dubious assertion, perhaps straining credulity, negates the real conditions of Mogadishu where neither peace nor viable life are far from being attainable. Paradoxically, Jaamici’s statement pointed to a far more insidious problem: the extent some clerics would go to in aligning themselves with the government. In a way, clerical criticism of the government is in short supply these days. Several years ago and during the presidency of Hassan Sheikh Mohamoud, Sheikh Nur Barod Gurxan stood in a public gathering and lashed out at President Mohamoud for hiring “the worst kind of government officials.” The president, a hard-nosed, thick-skinned politician, smiled and remained unfazed. Mohamoud, with all his failings, was a different president who regularly met with the press, held public gatherings in which he was often taken to the cleaners, and did not eschew meeting with his subjects. These days, Sheikh Gurxan, though still a supporter of the government, dares not criticize the government publicly. The intersection between politics and religion is not a new phenomenon. What is odd is when political power, as is manifested by the government, becomes beholden to glitzy social media where it is all style and no substance and where the government’s main function of protecting and serving its people is relegated to the background."
Medium.com,Society,Death of female Iranian soccer fans puts FIFA and Asian soccer body in the dock,World,https://medium.com/the-turbulent-world-of-middle-east-soccer/death-of-female-iranian-soccer-fans-puts-fifa-and-asian-soccer-body-in-the-dock-3491de5c1aef?source=topic_page---------713------------------1," By James M. Dorsey A podcast version of this story is available on Soundcloud, Itunes, Spotify, Stitcher, TuneIn, Spreaker, Pocket Casts, Tumblr, Podbean and Castbox. When Sahar Khodayari this week set herself alight in front of a Tehran courthouse, she indicted world soccer body FIFA, its Asian regional group, the Asian Football Confederation (AFC), and their presidents, Gianni Infantino and Sheikh Salman bin Ebrahim Al Khalifa. Messrs. Infantino and Al Khalifa have been selective in their support for women’s soccer rights. Mr. Infantino was in the White House to urge US president Donald J. Trump to endorse equal pay for male and female players on the same day that FIFA expressed regret at the death of Ms. Khodayarí, but did nothing to force Iran to lift its ban on women attending male sporting events. The statement called on Iranian authorities “to ensure the freedom and safety of any woman engaged in this legitimate fight to end the stadium ban for women in Iran” but failed to exert a price for continued maintenance of the ban. Dubbed Blue Girl, a reference to the colour of her favourite, storied Tehran soccer team, Esteghlal FC, Ms. Khodayari, put herself on fire after hearing by-standers speculate that the Revolutionary Court could that day sentence her to two years in prison for “openly committing a sinful act by appearing in public without hijab” and “insulting officials.” Ms. Khodayari was charged after being stopped by security in March as she sought to enter Tehran’s Azadi stadium dressed as a man to watch Esteghlal play an AFC Asian Cup match against the United Arab Emirates’ Al Ain FC. Ms. Khodayari’s disguise is standard practice for activist female soccer fans in a football-crazy country that has the questionable honour of being the world’s only nation to bar women from attending male sporting events. Saudi Arabia, the only other country that long maintained a similar ban, abolished the restriction in 2017 as part of Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman’s social reforms. In a wave of outrage on Twitter under the hashtag #Blue_Girl, Iranian deputy telecommunications minister Amir Nazemi thundered: “The death of #blue_girl is a conviction for all of us.” Mulanim, another tweeter, went a step further, pointing fingers at FIFA. “Sahar Khodayari burnt herself to death in protest. When would you actually do something? @FIFAcom #fifawwc,” she tweeted. Taken together, the two tweets put responsibility on the Iranian government for its discrimination of women and on global and regional soccer governors for allowing Iran to get away with it. FIFA announced this week that it was sending a delegation to Iran to monitor Iranian moves to allow women to attend World Cup qualifying matches. The problem is that FIFA has exerted punitive pressure only regarding World Cup matches rather than threatening to ban Iran from all international soccer events if it fails to completely lift the ban. FIFA’s push on World Cup matches could open the door to a complete lifting of the ban. Past experience, however, suggests that Iran could well treat granting women fans access to World Cup matches as an exception that confirms the rule. FIFA and the AFC are missing an opportunity to potentially force Iran to lift the ban given that barring Iranian participation in international tournaments would add to the government’s woes at a time that it is struggling to dampen the impact of harsh US economic sanctions designed to persuade Iran to renegotiate the 2015 agreement that curbed the Islamic republic’s nuclear program. The sanctions were imposed last year after Mr. Trump withdrew from the agreement. Speaking to reporters, government spokesman Ali Rabiei suggested that a threat by FIFA to exclude Iran from international matches could push the country’s rulers over the hump. “The government’s general view is to allow women to enter football stadiums, and infrastructure is needed for women’s presence in stadiums,” Mr. Rabiei said. Ms. Khodayari’s self-immolation alongside the refusal by an Iranian judoka to withdraw from the 2019 Judo World Championships in Japan on orders of the government sparked a Twitter hashtag, #BanIRSportsFederations, that this month has been used tens of thousands of times. Taking the call for a ban on Iranian participation in international tournaments and their qualifiers literally, Ali Karimi, a past Asian footballer of the year and top Iranian player opted to lead the way and set an example for FIFA and the AFC. Mr. Karimi advised his 4.5 million followers on Instagram that he would boycott soccer matches in protest against the ban on women. His post was liked more than 100,000 times in less than 30 minutes. Amir Etemadi, a liberal activist, seconded Mr. Karimi’s decision, tweeting that “it is time to boycott Iranian sports globally and domestically.” The , #BanIRSportsFederations hashtag constituted a protest against government interference, a no-no under the rules that govern global sports governance and insist on maintaining a largely fictitious separation of sports and politics. The online protest was sparked when top-ranking judoka Saeid Mollaei said he feared for his safety because he had rejected a demand to withdraw from the tournament in Japan to avoid the risk of having to face an Israeli athlete. Mr. Mollaei was spared facing the Israeli after being defeated in the semi-final. Iran extends its refusal to recognize Israel to barring its athletes from competing against Israelis in international tournaments — a violation of rules governing those competitions. “State interference in sport competitions is not acceptable. But, somehow IslamicR(epublic). has been practicing it for many years without facing its consequences,” tweeted Iranian sculptor Azin Sadati-Schmutzer. Said Human Rights Watch: ‘FIFA’s long delay in enforcing its own rules means the ban continues and leaves the brave women and girls in Iran who challenge the ban exposed to harassment, beatings and arrests by the Iranian authorities.” Dr. James M.

Medium.com,Society,The truth behind Queen Elizabeth’s white ‘clown face’ makeup,World,https://medium.com/@libbyjanecharleston/the-truth-behind-queen-elizabeths-white-clown-face-makeup-c0507a178bd5?source=topic_page---------714------------------1," Almost 500 years ago Queen Elizabeth was struck down with a violent fever. What happened next would change the course of history. When Queen Elizabeth I was 29, in 1562, she was struck down with what was believed to be a violent fever. Ordered by doctors to remain in her bed at Hampton Court Palace, it was soon clear that her illness was more than just a fever — she had the dreaded smallpox. Smallpox was a feared, deadly, viral disease that was highly contagious. There was no cure and no treatment. As recently as the 1960s, around 12 million people caught the disease and around two million people died every year. Small pox was eventually eradicated by immunisation in 1980 but the story behind the vaccine is fascinating. What began as an illness led to a rash that developed in small blisters or pustules that would split before drying and forming a scab that left scars. It was 457 years ago that Elizabeth came close to death but the aftermath of the disease that nearly killed her led to the iconic makeup style, that makes Queen Elizabeth one of the most recognisable monarchs of British royal history. The Dreaded Pox In the early stages of smallpox, the Queen refused to believe that she could possibly have contracted such a dreadful disease. Author Anna Whitelock wrote in The Queen’s Bed: An intimate history of Elizabeth’s court that a notable German physician, Dr Burcot, was invited to the Queen’s sick bed. When he diagnosed smallpox, the Queen sent him away, accusing him of being incompetent. Apparently the word “fool” was uttered from the royal lips too. However, as Elizabeth’s health declined further, Dr Burcot was asked to make another visit to the Queen where he diagnosed small pox a second time. “’Tis the pox,” he replied, at which Elizabeth moaned, “God’s pestilence! Which is better? To have the pox in the hand or in the face or in the heart and kill the whole body?’” Eventually, the Queen became so ill she could barely speak and seven days into her sickness, it was feared the she was going to die. Her ministers hastily discussed a succession plan. Since the Queen had no children, there was great concern about succession if Elizabeth suddenly died. The risk of Elizabeth losing her battle with smallpox was high, as around 30 per cent of those with the disease would die from it and very few escaped the illness without dreadful scarring from the skin lesions. At the time of her illness, Elizabeth’s most likely heir was Mary, Queen of Scots. But due to Mary being a Catholic, many British Protestants were concerned about the repercussions of having a Catholic on the throne. But the issue of succession was put aside for another time, as Elizabeth did recover. And, while her face was scarred, she wasn’t terribly disfigured. Spare a thought for her loyal lady-in-waiting Mary Sidney, who spent hours by the Queen’s sick bed, making sure she had plenty of water and tea and being a constant comfort for her. It was no surprise that Sidney caught “the dreaded pox”, leaving her disfigured for life. Restoring the Queen’s beauty When she eventually rose from her sick bed, Elizabeth set about ensuring her beauty was restored. She had always been celebrated for her glamour, her elaborate clothing and her white flawless skin. But, after her brush with death via smallpox, the Queen was left with a lifelong reminder of her illness; she was devastated when she realised that her skin would always bare the scars of the disease that almost took her life. It must have been soul destroying for a woman who believed that much of her power was due to her beauty. So, she began by covering her pockmarks with heavy white makeup. She used what was known as the “venetian ceruse”, a mixture of vinegar and lead; a potential killer. Author Lisa Eldridge wrote in her book Face Paint that archaeologists have found traces of white lead in the graves of upper-class women who lived as far back as ancient Greece. It’s also believed ceruse was used in China in the ancient Shang Dynasty (1600–1046 B.C.) At the time of Queen Elizabeth’s reign, women strived for a totally white face because it symbolised youth and fertility. It’s been argued that the desire for a white face had nothing to do with racism and everything to do with class — if a woman had a white face, it was a clear sign that she has never had to work outdoors. So how did the ladies achieve the look that writer Inkoo Kang described as being “perilously close to Ronald McDonald cosplay”? Most ladies slathered the Venetian Ceruse across the face, neck and décolletage. Clearly, the major problem with this makeup was due to the lead ingredient and, if used over an extended period of time, caused illness and/or death. Here’s a popular YouTube makeup tutorial that recreates the Queen’s iconic look: If the makeup didn’t kill you or make you ill, it would make your skin appear grey and wrinkled once the makeup was removed. To make it worse, the white makeup was left on the skin for a very long time without being washed. Ladies left it on their face for at least a week before cleaning themselves. But, even the ingredients in the commonly used facial cleanser had the potential to kill — rosewater, mercury, honey and even eggshells were used. The ladies might have felt this concoction left their skin feeling soft and smooth, but the mercury meant that the cleanser was actually eating away their skin. To top off the look, Elizabeth also used bright red pigments on her lips that contained additional heavy metals. It was also fashionable to line your eyes with black kohl, and use special eyedrops known as “belladonna” which dilated the pupils. Eyebrows were plucked until they were thin and arched, creating the appearance of a high forehead, which supposedly made women look not only intelligent but from the upper class. Plants and animal dyes were used for rouge, making the cheeks glow. Public image of the Queen Elizabeth was highly aware of the importance of her appearance in public and went to great pains to achieve the look she believed suited her the best, making her not only attractive but clearly regal. She also insisted on being in control of her official portraits which is why a recent exhibition at London’s Queen’s House in Greenwich has found a way to undo Elizabeth’s carefully crafted image. The art installation explores the “other face” of the Queen, showing her face stripped of makeup. It’s the face of a woman looking vulnerable as she exists in a patriarchal world where she was only safe if she could hold onto her power. It’s fascinating to see what she looked like without her mask of makeup and many believe it was the lead in her foundation that led to her death at the age of 69, on March 24, 1603. While the exact cause of Elizabeth’s death is debatable — possible causes include blood poisoning, pneumonia, or cancer — she lost most of her hair and was said to be highly fatigued as well as suffering from memory loss and digestive problems; symptoms of lead poisoning. What’s not up for debate is the fact that, as she aged, she applied more and more layers of makeup to her face; the never-ending bid to disguise oneself using the deadly “mask of youth”. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XZB9ymvzSW8"
Medium.com,Society,“Multi-million spike in pageviews”: The company behind TikTok is now shaking up news aggregation,World,https://medium.com/whats-new-in-publishing/multi-million-spike-in-pageviews-the-company-behind-tiktok-is-now-shaking-up-news-aggregation-7ad80db372cb?source=topic_page---------715------------------1," The MIT Technology Review called it “the insanely popular Chinese news app that you’ve never heard of.” The app, Toutiao (Chinese for ‘headlines’) is one of the largest news aggregation apps in China. It is installed on over 250M monthly unique devices. Toutiao is the flagship product of Bytedance, the world’s most valuable startup ahead of global successes like Uber, Airbnb and SpaceX. In October 2018, Bytedance completed a $3B investment that raised its valuation to $75B. The investors included SoftBank, KKR and General Atlantic. The company is now looking at dominating the international market with the English version of Toutiao called TopBuzz. The app is quietly climbing the charts and making its presence felt by driving substantial traffic to Western publishers. Toutiao aims to develop more AI-focused services, and to expand internationally. The ultimate goal is to become the world’s number-one online content destination, eclipsing the likes of Facebook and Twitter, as well as the likes of the New York Times and Buzzfeed in their own markets. Will Knight, Senior Editor at MIT Technology Review TopBuzz grew from 1.8M monthly active users in November 2017, to roughly 23M active monthly users in October 2018 globally (except China, where Toutiao is available instead), according to Tubefilter. These are the latest available figures for the app. ByteDance does not regularly release official user numbers for its apps. Global news aggregators, like Toutiao and SmartNews, are beginning to dramatically increase their traffic referral footprints in the US, according to Parse.ly. Nick Lioudis, Content Manager at Chartbeat credited TopBuzz for “a multi-million spike in pageviews” across their publishers late last year. He wrote that in December alone, the app referred nearly 34M pageviews across Chartbeat publishers worldwide. This was a 36x increase from January 2017. Half of this traffic came from the US. The company also noted increasingly significant share from countries such as Brazil, France, Germany, Italy and the UK. Currently, TopBuzz ranks at #8 among top free news apps on Google Play Store (US), above Flipboard, Fox News, Washington Post Select, Daily Mail Online, CNN and even Google News, according to SimilarWeb. On iTunes (US), it is at #26, ahead of BBC News, Washington Post, Flipboard and The Economist. Here’s a quick look at TopBuzz: TopBuzz is similar to Toutiao which uses artificial intelligence to create personalized feeds of news and videos based on users’ interests. It’s like Facebook without the social element. The app does not need users to follow any publisher to display content. Instead of seeing posts by friends, users see an endless feed of articles and videos when they launch the app. The app uses machine and deep learning algorithms to create personalized feeds of news and videos based on users’ interests. While Facebook and Twitter also use machine learning to refine recommendations, they rely more heavily on social connections. When a user first opens Toutiao, the system uses basic data like location, age etc. to create the feed. It shows a wide variety of articles to learn about the user’s preferences. Over time, the app learns through usage including taps, swipes, time of the day the user reads, time spent on each article, pauses, comments, interactions with the content and location. Toutiao combines data from three key areas to create an engaging feed. These are: The algorithms then identify the strongest statistical match between a user’s profile, its own content profile, and context to create the feed. The matching is meant to optimize the percent of articles a user reads (clicks on), and the percent of articles he completes. Over time, as the app collects user information, its recommendations get further refined. It learns quickly and for most users, takes less than 24 hours to learn their interests (indicated by 80% read rates). This leads to a high degree of user retention (>45%). Toutiao uses a text classification algorithm to determine if an article is fake news, uses clickbait titles, or doesn’t meet quality standards. The system also leans on user moderators to flag fake articles, and employs human moderators to arbitrate on disputed reporting. Toutiao Lab’s mission is to push the boundaries of machine learning and AI and to transfer that into products. Lei Li, Research Scientist and Director at ByteDance AI Lab Li also said that Toutiao’s way of surfacing content is less of a filter bubble compared to Facebook. He explained that the recommendation algorithms has been designed to offer some content outside the range of a user’s preferences. “Our [machine learning] models will try to expand your horizons, your interests,” he emphasized. Toutiao makes money through advertising by inserting an ad every three or five pieces of news. As the app learns about the reader, it can provide targeted advertising that is very relevant to the consumers. The system encourages individuals and media organizations to create their own official accounts for self-publishing. Toutiao has more than 1.2 million registered content publishers on the platform, from businesses and media outlets to bloggers. TopBuzz has also officially partnered with 200,000 publishers and independent creators to syndicate, license, and distribute their works. Some of its partners include Hearst, CNN, The New York Times and BuzzFeed. YouTube creators can sync their channels to TopBuzz. Bloggers can publish directly via its own content management system or deliver their content through RSS. We don’t see ourselves as competitive with other creator platforms, but rather additive. For a creator thinking about joining TopBuzz, the opportunity is to reach new and relevant audience through our global content ecosystem. Mitch Rotter, Head of English Content Operations at TopBuzz With TikTok, TopBuzz and several other apps, ByteDance is looking to grow in overseas markets including the US. This has been a trend among China’s technology firms for the past few years. Here’s Bloomberg’s coverage on ByteDance’s global expansion strategy and the challenges it faces: Arjun Kharpal, CNBC’s Senior Technology Correspondent based in Guangzhou, China writes, “Mobile applications developed by some of China’s biggest technology firms have been catching on with US consumers in the past few years, underscoring how companies in the world’s second-largest economy are expanding beyond their domestic market and Asia.” According to data compiled by Sensor Tower for CNBC, apps developed by Chinese firms, or by companies with large Chinese investors brought in revenues of $674.8M in the US in the first quarter of 2019. This marks a more than 67% YoY rise in revenue compared to the same period last year. Chinese app publishers are becoming more adept at understanding what resonates with US consumers, whether it be carving out a new niche in social media with apps such as TikTok or capitalizing on hot trends among Western gamers with battle royale titles including PUBG Mobile. Sanders Tran, Data Analyst at Sensor Tower Changing names and branding have helped Chinese apps succeed with American users. Hanish Bhatia, Senior Analyst at Counterpoint Research told CNBC, “Overall, there is low awareness about the origin of these apps. At the same time, it is important for these apps to connect with users in the premium markets.” Chinese tech firms and apps are continuously making efforts to get rid of the Chinese tag. The idea is to position themselves as a global player. Hanish Bhatia, Senior Analyst at Counterpoint Research Tran adds, “They have also greatly expanded their understanding of user acquisition in the U.S. market, which has allowed them to mount much more effective marketing campaigns. They’ve also backed these up with substantial spending, frequently topping the advertiser charts on Facebook and other mobile app install networks.” Last year, ByteDance was recognized as a top AI innovator by CBInsight which included the company on its AI 100 List. Fast Company ranked it at #16 “for nosing out the news,” in its 2018 World’s Most Innovative Companies list. Bytedance has spent the last year-plus acquiring and investing in apps around the world where its AI can improve the experience, from U.S.-based Flipagram and Musically to Europe’s News Republic. Most Innovative Companies 2018, Fast Company It’s short video app TikTok is already very popular worldwide. The app hit 500M monthly active users globally in July 2018. Between December 2017 and 2018 it added 75M new users — a 275% YoY growth. People now talk about a new crop of companies that are coming up. TMD is the new acronym that you’ll be hearing a lot about. Toutiao which is an AI driven news site which is massive. The actual company is Bytedance but their flagship product is Toutiao. Meituan is another which is a sort of online services platform. And finally D stands for Didi Chuxing which is like the Uber of China but on steroids. Kaiser Kuo, former Baidu Director in the documentary New Money: The Greatest Wealth Creation Event in History (2019) ByteDance has done what was thought to be impossible in China and that is breaking the dominance of Baidu, Alibaba and Tencent (BAT). It also has Google and Facebook’s attention. Recently, TechCrunch reported that Google is developing a Toutiao like news app for China. Facebook launched a TikTok clone called Lasso late last year. It is yet to take off. By Faisal Kalim"
Medium.com,Society,Rich? You Need a Bacon Necklace,World,https://medium.com/goods-services/rich-you-need-a-bacon-necklace-73d42ed5f7d8?source=topic_page---------716------------------1," Millions of dead pigs are beginning to have a major impact on the food security of 1.4 billion Chinese. One year ago, China confirmed its first case of African Swine Fever (ASF), a deadly pig disease that is devastating to pig herds and extremely challenging to contain, but thankfully harmless to humans. The presence of ASF in China is particularly dire because Chinese people eat more pork than everyone else in the world (combined) and raise more pigs than the rest of the world (combined). This situation has been simmering for a year. Recent data from the Chinese government is causing it to boil over. In July, Chinese government data indicated that the Chinese herd fell by 33% since last year, which will cause a pork shortage of 10 million metric tons this year alone. This shortage cannot be alleviated by imports because fewer than 10 million metric tons of pork are sold internationally annually. Ten million metric tons translates to 20% of annual Chinese consumption. And this number is conservative since the Chinese government tends to massage data to fit its narrative. After the government data was released in July, the price of Chinese pork increased by 23% between July and August. That brings the year-over-year total to 47%. With demand and fear rising, pork is selling for $4.92 per kilogram in China, compared to $ $3.74 in the United States. In China, pork inflation is a major factor in overall consumer inflation (CPI). The Chinese Academy of Social Sciences estimated that pork prices accounted for 10% of the monthly CPI reading in 2010. Historically, when pork prices go up, overall inflation increases. A rapid rise in pig prices because of ASF could spread to other parts of the economy. Experts today believe that the weight of pork inflation on the CPI has declined to 2%. One reason is that pork consumption has stabilized in recent years. If incomes keep rising, people can purchase other items, diversifying the CPI basket. Also, in urban areas, people are eating more beef and seafood. Again, reducing reliance on pork. These factors might mean that this pork price spike might not be as bad for the overall economy as previous ones. The fear of economic slowing caused by higher pork prices has caused the Chinese government to take action. First, the Central Bank eased monetary policy, to make borrowing cheaper and to stimulate the economy. This is a major reversal from the last few years when the Central Bank was in a period of tightening, trying to deleverage the economy. High debt levels will continue to be a concern, but now the government must address the immediate problems caused by high pork prices and not worry about a possible debt bubble in the future. In addition to easing monetary policy, China is taking other actions to keep its citizens fed and keep pork prices manageable. However, none of these solutions are silver bullets. The government is offering incentives to farmers and businesses willing to invest in new pig operations, most notably low-interest loans. This is a typical tool used by governments, however, it is less effective in this situation for two reasons. First, ASF is not contained. The disease is in every Chinese province and it is still claiming new operations. In some cases, after farms get infected by ASF, they clean the farm and then get the disease again. Second, breeding sows are also dying from this disease, not just pigs for slaughter. Before new pigs can be put into these new operations, the breeding herd needs to be replenished. This takes time. A breeding sow will be pregnant for 3 months. It takes her female offspring 18 months before they reach reproductive maturity. Then they will have to be pregnant for 3 months before they have new piglets. Pigs that are born that will not become breeding sows will be raised on a pig operation for 5–6 months before they reach market weight. Meaning, the fastest pigs can be restocked with current sows is 5–6 months. That’s a significant lag time. In the 1970s, the Chinese government started keeping pork reserves in case of a crisis, like the current situation. Governments are putting these pork reserves into the marketplace to increase supply. The reserves will help, but they are small, an estimated 1 million tons. Imports cannot solve this problem, because the 2019 shortage is higher than the amount of pork traded on the international markets in a year. Plus, Vietnam and the Philippines (two major pig producers) are also battling ASF, and pork from the United States faces a 62% tariff. Buying U.S. pork will address food security concerns but will not help the inflation issues. Higher prices will reduce demand. People will not be able to afford as much pork and demand will decline. The government is trying to further reduce demand through an educational campaign. A recent article was titled, “Pork, it’s better for you to eat less,” highlighting the health benefits of eating less pork. The government hopes that these efforts will further decrease demand. Some provincial or local governments are subsidizing the price of pork so consumers pay less at the store. Others are offering additional aid specifically to low-income residents. The situation is critical. The severity is still unknown. It could be a serious supply-side disruption or it could drastically impact global protein prices and food security for 100s of millions of people around the world. The best thing that will come out of ASF is better biosecurity in China and globally. The Chinese pig sector is extremely diverse, with various sizes and levels of quality management systems. This event will eliminate small scale farmers. Large, well-managed and highly capitalized farms will dominate the Chinese pig industry."

Medium.com,Society,Have you heard what’s happening in Northern Ireland?,World,https://medium.com/@kathryn.gaw/have-you-heard-whats-happening-in-northern-ireland-264205d04425?source=topic_page---------719------------------1," In April this year, I took meetings with a series of national newspaper editors. As a Belfast-based freelance journalist, I had one big story to pitch — the rise of paramilitary activity and fear in Northern Ireland. One by one, the editors passed with the feedback that their readers were not interested in Northern Ireland — at least, not until the new wave of terror made its way across the Irish Sea. A week later, journalist Lyra McKee was murdered during a paramilitary-backed riot in Derry. Since then, we have witnessed attempted bombings, punishment shootings, attacks on the police, more riots, and the shocking return of the balaclava-wearing paramilitary, face-to-camera, promising to “attack crown forces” at the Irish border. When I speak to friends in England, they are shocked to hear the extent to which Northern Ireland’s fragile peace has been chiselled away, even before the wrecking-ball of Brexit swoops in to finish the job. But is it really a surprise? Northern Ireland is woefully under-reported in the UK press, and in many ways this is understandable. We are far away — or at least, farther away than the other members of the United Kingdom — we number just 1.8 million people, and we have the smallest economy in the British Isles. We do not have significant Labour Party or Conservative Party representation, giving the vast majority of Westminster politicians no reason to pander to the NI electorate. Among our elected MPs, half (Sinn Fein politicians) refuse to take their seats in Parliament, while the other half (DUP politicians) claimed just 36 per cent of the overall vote. And then there is the local media. While Northern Irish people still love a physical newspaper, a lack of resources has left local papers woefully under-staffed and with little-to-no budget for freelance reporting. This means that the majority of the stories being printed in the local press are derived from press releases, social media trends, police updates, and reader tips. There are scores of hugely talented journalists and editors who are chained to their desks, unable to afford the financial and time-bound cost of investigating the stories of corruption and terrorism that pose a genuine threat to our existence. When I moved from London to Belfast five years ago, I was excited about the opportunities I could see in Northern Ireland. Belfast was a vibrant, cosmopolitan, artistic city where the cost of living was ludicrously cheap, and the craic was ninety. Already, the mood is changing. Stormont has been shuttered for almost three years, leaving Northern Ireland without any active leadership in an era where leadership is desperately needed. Despite voting against Brexit, we are being forced to accept the worrying inevitability of a hard border, and all the implications that go along with it. Northern Ireland feels different now, and yet there is something very familiar about what is going on. Bombs, bonfires, shootings, riots — these are rapidly becoming a daily occurrence. But unless you live here, you’d never know. As the turmoil in Westminster continues to eat up all the headlines, it’s time we remembered the human cost of political bluster and indecision. In the absence of media attention and democratic norms, we need to find another way to give ourselves a voice. Thank goodness for Medium…"
Medium.com,Society,"US Aid to Central America’s in Flux, But Deeper Issues of Accountability Remain",World,https://medium.com/@alysedinapoli/us-aid-to-central-americas-in-flux-but-deeper-issues-of-accountability-remain-c4638eb6527c?source=topic_page---------720------------------1," The Trump administration’s decision to hold off on a previous request to freeze foreign aid to Central America has been met with a sigh of relief, as much of the funding is earmarked for economic development and humanitarian programs. But although the original proposal faced nearly unanimous opposition by both Congress and administration officials, the accountability surrounding foreign aid- security funds in particular- still faces its fair share of criticism. The percentage of aid allocated for security assistance- funding that trains and equips military and police forces- constitutes an increasingly larger share of spending. According to data from the Security Assistance Monitor, in 2010, about $457 million was spent on economic aid in the region, with an additional $108 million spent on security. In 2019, $184 million in economic aid was allocated with an additional $266 million going towards security. “The chunk of security assistance that [the Defense Department] funds and implements has been increasing in the last 10 years. There is definitely a lot more going through the Department of Defense as opposed to the State Department, so we are seeing a lot more of a militarized approach across the board in regards to aid,” said Christina Arabia, Director of Security Assistance Monitor, in regards to the global trend of foreign aid. Even though funding for some State Department programs has increased, the amount allocated to the agency overall has been on a downward trend over the last few years. “But that doesn’t mean security aid is going down. It’s just leaving the State programs and going through more Defense programs,” she mentioned. Security aid is meant to train a recipient country’s military and law enforcement, and while the US provides these funds to countries all over the world, the assistance provided to Latin American countries-such as the Northern Triangle countries of El Salvador, Guatemala and Honduras- is often provided within the context of combating the drug war and gang violence. But a highly militarized law enforcement has not necessarily led to peace and prosperity. “There’s a big concern about the role of military and policing in Central America. ..that’s not going in the right direction in most of these countries, and that’s a serious issue,” according to Lisa Haugaard, Executive Director of the Latin America Working Group. Much of the US security aid is part of the Central American Regional Security Initiative (CARSI), which broke off from the Mérida Initiative, a 2008 agreement largely between the US and Mexico to stem the production and flow of illegal drugs. Mérida in turn was partially modeled off of Plan Colombia, the 2000 aid package that helped the Colombian government fight FARC troops and drug-trafficking cartels. While often touted by leaders as successful, many activists and civilian groups claim that the steady flow of weapons and training from the US to corrupt Colombian leaders and military personnel led to heightened violence and human rights violations. This included the notorious “false positives”, in which Colombian soldiers were rewarded for capturing and killing FARC guerrillas, thereby incentivizing a system in which innocent civilians were incorrectly labelled as rebels and subsequently murdered. The killings are estimated to have taken over 3,000 civilian lives, with the bulk occurring between 2002 and 2008. Largely inspired by Colombia’s violence, Leahy’s Law was enacted in the late 1990s, which prohibits the US from providing security aid to military units that have documented cases of human rights abuses. Certain Colombian units faced cuts in funding until they demonstrated internal improvements, and the law has also been used in some cases in Honduras and Guatemala as well. But because it targets particular military units, it’s usually difficult to apply. “It really gets enforced when there’s a lot of pressure and enough specific information about assistance going to specific units. So you can have pretty serious human rights violations going on, and that might mean some specific unit gets held up but not many other units that are involved in human rights violations,” Haugaard said. This approach also makes it difficult to address systemic corruption that often precedes these crimes. Many believe that narcotrafficking and politics are so intertwined that it’s nearly impossible to separate the two. The brother of Honduran President Juan Orlando Hernández has been indicted on drug trafficking charges, and recent court documents allege that the President himself also received drug money to fund his campaign. Two years ago, the son of former president Porfirio Lobo was sentenced to 24 years in prison for conspiring to import cocaine into the US. And the Northern Triangle countries have consistently ranked towards the bottom of Transparency International’s Corruption Index rankings. But the issue with corruption is not just politicians wanting to get a cut of the lucrative, albeit illegal, trade. The Honduran government has also been involved in numerous human rights abuses. A UN Human Rights report confirmed that, during the controversial 2017 presidential election, the country’s military police used excessive force in attempting to quell protests, which led to the death of 22 civilians. Yet, while the amount of US economic aid to the country has increased over the past 10 years, the percentage of aid going towards security assistance increased from approximately 9% in 2010 to 28% in 2017. In addition, collusion between corporations and state security forces in displacing or intimidating indigenous populations and activists remains commonplace. The 2016 murder of the Honduran environmental activist Berta Cárceres made international headlines, especially when it was revealed that executives and employees of the mining company Desarrollos Energéticos SA (DESA) collaborated with public security officials to assassinate Cárceres and intimidate the indigenous group fighting to protect the lands from corporate control. But according to Haugaard, the activist’s fate is unfortunately not so unique. “It’s a huge problem in Honduras and Guatemala. There’s a real mix of security forces and companies that want to use natural resources often without consulting the communities in which resource extraction is taking place,” she said. “There are constant death threats against communities who are defending their right to not have a dam or a mining project in their communities, and there is often involvement of official security forces or the local mayor.” However, in addition to Leahy’s Law, each agency, such as the State Department and Department of Defense, put into place a list of conditions that Central American governments must adhere to. Aid conditions worked in certain circumstances-such as the funding freeze in response to Colombia’s extrajudicial killings- but because the rules are quite vague, it typically requires immense pressure from outside organizations or other agencies in order to hold back the funds. The State Department, for example, faced backlash when they certified that Honduras had met the necessary standards in 2017, the same year that the military police were found to have been responsible for the civilian deaths during election protests. Members of Congress and oversight committees also add an extra layer of accountability when the State and Defense Departments fall short, but their rhetoric is oftentimes more symbolic than substantive, according to Arabia. “Occasionally you’ll see a member of Congress who will put something in the appropriations bill that specifically conditions aid to one country or to one unit or one program, but it’s not consistent…So it can be more of a political statement or a slap on the wrist more so than actually holding someone accountable,” she said. But some members have made a point to be more vocal about the issue. California representative Norma Torres slammed the State Department in April after they provided Congress with a vague and incomplete list of corrupt government officials in the Northern Triangle. And in honor of the slain activist Cáceres, Georgia representative Hank Johnson re-introduced a bill in March that would suspend military aid to Honduras until the government makes serious investigations into their security force’s human rights violations. Yet, the issues surrounding security aid and accountability still have a lot of room for improvement. After all, the number of Guatemalans and Hondurans crossing the US-Mexico border have increased by roughly 400% and 700% since 2015, respectively. “I wish there were more of a linear progression in the right direction. Overall there’s often too much focus on counternarcotics objectives at the expense of everything else, which usually doesn’t result in very good counternarcotics policy either,” says Haugaard. “That’s a constant problem that affects both Democrat and Republican administrations. You need to talk about rule of law and human rights and that’ll help various problems in a deeper way.” Originally published at www.mattersandminds.com."

he trade hostilities that have emerged since last year have dragged down the global growth and will probably play a big role if there is a resulting recession. If only there was a way to measure this uncertainty and how it has evolved over time. If you are interested in finding out how rising trade tensions are cause for concern for global growth, check out the IMF’s World Economic Outlook. Talking about IMF, researchers at the global financial institution (Hites Ahir & Davide Furceri) along with Nicholas Bloom of Stanford University have constructed a World Trade Uncertainty index for 143 countries with the data going back all the way to 1996. It is a broad-based measure based on the Economist Intelligence Unit (EIU) country reports. The EIU reports provide a sense of credibility from a single reputable source with the standardized process & structure they follow, thus providing accurate & consistent data. There are existing measures of trade but they are narrowly focused on either a few countries or regions like the index of BlackRock or the indexes by Sandile Hlatshwayo. The construction of the index involved searching the EIU reports for the terms “uncertain,” “uncertainty,” and “uncertainties” for each country & quarter and appearing near the following words — protectionism, North American Free Trade Agreement, tariff, trade, United Nations Conference on Trade and Development, and World Trade Organization. Making the WTU index comparable across different countries involved scaling the raw counts by the total number of words in each report. As per the details provided in the index description, The index is associated with greater economic policy uncertainty (EPU), stock market volatility, risk & lower GDP growth. Here are some of the key findings from the WTU index in 3 charts: The Index shows that after relative stability of 20 years, it spiked 10-fold from the previously recorded highs (Figure 1). The increased uncertainty started to jump around the third quarter of 2018 when a series of tariffs were imposed by the United States on China. The decline in the fourth quarter coincided with the announcement of a deal between the two countries. The truce proved temporary as a new series of tariffs went into effect on March 01, 2019. With trade talks set to resume again in October, the WTU index is sitting at an all-time high. Based on IMF’s estimates the trade uncertainty recorded in Q1' 2019 could be enough to reduce global growth by up to 0.75% point in 2019. While it is true that the two biggest economies, the U.S & China have been embroiled in a trade dispute, high levels of uncertainty have been recorded among their key trading partners & countries geographically closer to these two countries — Canada, Mexico, Japan, and large European economies (Figure 2). Countries like Japan & South Korea are also embroiled in a trade spat of their own."
Medium.com,Society,What the (Western) World Got Wrong about Hong Kong Protests,World,https://medium.com/@iscyang/what-the-western-world-got-wrong-about-hong-kong-protests-350356dcc567?source=topic_page---------723------------------1," The ‘world’ in the title really just refers to the Anglophone world. This is a series of articles written in response to the grossly biased and one-sided coverage of this year’s Hong Kong protests in Western English-language media based on legal, economic and socio-historical analysis, and my living experience of witnessing the escalation of the political crisis as a former university student in Hong Kong in 2014 — 2018. As a believer in liberal democratic values, I do not side with either Beijing or the protesters on this particular issue, but only facts, logical coherence, and open discussion. The current unrest is about much more than the extradition bill. It is deeply rooted in Hong Kong’s unique history, political and economic structure, and cultural identity. This article mainly introduces the legal technicalities surrounding the proposed amendment itself, whereas upcoming articles will seek to address the broader issues facing Hong Kong and causes thereof. M
any seem to assume that the Chinese government was behind the initial proposition of the bill despite the total lack of evidence suggesting such. On the contrary, at a recent closed-door meeting with a group of Hong Kong business elite, Carrie Lam admitted This is not something instructed, coerced by the central government. This is out of a good intention, myself and some of my key colleagues to try to plug legal loopholes in Hong Kong’s system, very much prompted by our compassion for a single case, and this has proven to be very unwise given the circumstances. according to a recording obtained by Reuters. Hong Kong currently has extradition agreements signed with 20 jurisdictions around the world. In contrast, for example, the UK has pacts with 28 European jurisdictions under part 1 of the Extradition Act 2003 and 116 territories under part 2 of the Act, including UAE and a number of Latin American and African countries. The proposal was ostensibly prompted by the murder of a pregnant Hong Kong woman by her Hong Kong boyfriend in Taipei, who fled back to Hong Kong after the alleged crime. Without an extradition arrangement between the two jurisdictions, the killer was unable to be extradited to Taiwan to stand trial. This is, without denial, a major ‘legal loophole’, and it is not hard to imagine how Hong Kong may have served a haven for fugitives from many other jurisdictions in the world, including mainland China, for the same reason. As Grenville Cross QC, former Director of Public Prosecutions of Hong Kong, said, the bill was ‘an important initiative in terms of international criminal justice’ and ‘Hong Kong undoubtedly has an international obligation to help other jurisdictions to combat crime’. The proposed amendment was not directed at mainland China or Taiwan either, but rather to allow for extradition on a case-by-case basis with any place in the world not already covered by mutual agreements. 2. The main purposes of the Bill are to: … (b) amend the Mutual Legal Assistance in Criminal Matters Ordinance
(Cap. 525) so that arrangements for mutual legal assistance made
between Hong Kong and any place outside Hong Kong (including any
other part of the People’s Republic of China (“PRC”)) may be given
effect. Admittedly, Carrie Lam may well have had in mind the goal to add a political achievement to her tenure that would be well appreciated by Beijing. It nonetheless will remain a groundless presumption that Beijing instructed her to propose the amendment for the purpose of eroding Hong Kong’s legal independence until compelling evidence suggests so. To attribute the indeed ‘unwise’ proposal to Beijing’s prerogative not only is presumptuous but also constitute an apparent conspiracy theory to stir up the already growing anti-mainland sentiments in Hong Kong, especially among the youth, which directly led to the initial eruption of protests. Such speculatory accusations have been given the effect of facts in Western media’s coverage, which is hardly surprising given the assumption that China is the biggest enemy of liberal democracy in current Western political discourse. 2. ‘The Bill, if passed, would have allowed Beijing’s perceived dissidents to be sent to the mainland and subject to arbitrary sentencing.’ It
suffices to make three points on this widely spread misconception. a) The mainland criminal justice system may not be as gruesome as it sounds. China certainly does not have a proud record in terms of the rule of law. Nonetheless, as Cross points out, over 50 countries, including nine EU countries ‘who have signed up to every human rights treaty’, have signed extradition treaties with the country. Among them are Spain, France, Austria, and Belgium, which are some of the freest countries in the world. Their willingness to enter extradition agreements with China is testimony to the progress that has been achieved in China’s legal system, as noted by Cross in an article written for South China Morning Post Much comment on the mainland’s legal system has been deliberately erroneous, giving the impression that it is unchanged since the Cultural Revolution. However, since the 1980s, when former paramount leader Deng Xiaoping said “we must build a modern legal system for China”, reformers have greatly improved things, often after studying the Hong Kong paradigm.
Until about 20 years ago, mainland judges had little legal training; but all this has now changed. Anyone who wants to be a judge — or a prosecutor or lawyer — must now pass the difficult National Unified Legal Professional Qualification Examination. Many of the new breed of judges and legal officials have studied law abroad, and are familiar with Western notions of criminal justice. Since last year, professional judges, when trying criminal cases, sit with people’s assessors, who are similar to Hong Kong jurors and can provide independent scrutiny, with cases being decided by majority voting. It is understandable that many in Hong Kong would fear the legal system operating in mainland China, given that a large proportion of the population fled lawless chaos that embroiled China during the Cultural Revolution to Hong Kong as refugees. Even the young people on the streets today may have heard horror stories from their parents and grandparents. That being said, there certainly is a lack of understanding of the significant differences between today’s China and China in the old era. b) There are multiple safeguards in the proposed law to ensure criminal justice. Firstly, only 46 categories of serious offences were included in the original amendment and nine types of mostly white-collar crimes, including some related to bankruptcy, tax, and securities and futures trading, were later struck out due to the business sector’s lobbying. (Hong Kong being the heaven for capitalism, what else would you expect?) The finalised list looked like this Murder or manslaughter, including criminal negligence causing death; culpable homicide; assault with intent to commit murder. Aiding, abetting, counseling or procuring suicide. Maliciously wounding; maiming; inflicting grievous or actual bodily harm; assault occasioning actual bodily harm; threats to kill; intentional or reckless endangering of life whether by means of a weapon, a dangerous substance or otherwise; offences relating to unlawful wounding or injuring. Offences of a sexual nature including rape; sexual assault; indecent assault; unlawful sexual acts on children; statutory sexual offences. Gross indecency with a child, a mental defective or an unconscious person. Kidnapping; abduction; false imprisonment; unlawful confinement; dealing or trafficking in slaves or other persons; taking a hostage. Is it really unreasonable to ensure that fugitives of grave offences receive the punishment they deserve? Secondly, for an offence to be extraditable, it must be punishable by at least seven years’ imprisonment, whereas, in the 20 fugitive surrender arrangements that Hong Kong currently maintains, the restriction is only one year. Additional conditions must also be met, namely the offence in question is a crime in both Hong Kong and the requesting jurisdiction the offence in question is not of a political character, and the offence is not punishable by death Right before the first reading of the bill in April, Secretary for Justice Teresa Cheng confirmed that political fugitives would not be transferred under the proposed law. This condition would have effectively guarded against political persecution that protesters allege to be Beijing’s motive behind the bill. How many of them, though, are even aware of the existence of this safeguard? c) There are numerous further safeguards built into the extradition process, as summarised below If the justice department determines that the conditions are met, then it goes before Hong Kong’s chief executive, who can decide whether to veto or proceed with the extradition request. At this point, the suspect can apply for judicial review, with a right to appeal in the city’s highest court. If the request proceeds, an arrest warrant is issued, after which the subject is immediately barred from leaving Hong Kong. Once the subject is arrested, the case moves to the courts, where a preliminary hearing is held. Once the court decides that there is no political motive behind the extradition request, and that there is sufficient prima facie evidence that there is a possible case, it can then make an order of committal. At this point, the suspect can appeal. With the judicial process over, the request goes back to the chief executive, who can again decide to deny the extradition request on humanitarian grounds. Here, the subject can petition the chief executive to oppose extradition. Should the chief executive decide to proceed with the extradition, an extradition order is given. At this stage, the suspect can again appeal to the courts to stop the extradition. If the suspect decides not to appeal, or if the appeal is unsuccessful, the suspect is extradited. The process could take years, which is typical of extradition proceedings. The Basic Law, Hong Kong’s de facto constitution, guarantees the separation of executive, legislative and judiciary powers, as is the case in most common law jurisdictions. Hong Kong’s judicial independence has remained in good shape since the 1997 handover, with Hong Kong ranked 16th worldwide by the WJP Rule of Law Index 2019, just trailing behind Australia and the UK and ahead of France and the US. The Court of Final Appeal, having replaced the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council in London as the final appellate court of Hong Kong, boasts highly distinguished jurists from across the common law world. The majority of non-permanent judges are from other jurisdictions. Most of the ‘local’ judges also hold foreign passports. To think that such a judiciary would bend under Beijing’s political pressure, risking jeopardising their own professional reputations, is rather senseless. On the contrary, on numerous occasions, Hong Kong courts have ruled much to Beijing’s dismay. In one case involving an alleged assault against a so-called pro-democracy activist by several police officers during the 2014 protests, the court found the defendants guilty, causing an outcry on Chinese state media."
Medium.com,Society,UK in Turmoil as Boris Johnson Struggles To Control Brexit Plan,World,https://medium.com/citizen-truth/uk-in-turmoil-as-boris-johnson-struggles-to-control-brexit-plan-a71d58f4cef5?source=topic_page---------724------------------1," Since winning an inter Conservative Party election to replace Theresa May as party head and Prime Minister of the United Kingdom (UK), Boris Johnson has taken over responsibility for Brexit negotiations with the European Union (EU). However, Johnson hasn’t found any success in finding a resolution suitable to all parties involved. The most recent events have seen Johnson’s Conservative party spectacularly rebuke his decision making. “Britain’s House of Lords endorsed a measure Friday that would block Prime Minister Boris Johnson’s plan to leave the European Union next month without a deal in place, giving final approval to a bill the House of Commons passed earlier this week,” said National Public Radio (NPR) in reference to a September 6th vote in Parliament. “The House of Lords’ passage was widely expected after the bill won approval in the House of Commons on Wednesday. The legislation now proceeds to royal assent — a formality that will result in its becoming law.” The new measure replaces the Cooper Bill, reaffirming that the UK cannot leave the EU without a specific deal in place, making it more likely a second referendum is held to decide whether Brexit moves forward or not. If a deal isn’t reached by October 19th, it would require Johnson to ask the EU for an extension to the current October 31st deadline. Johnson reacted in a bullish manner to the vote. “Boris Johnson has expelled 21 Conservative members of parliament, including two former chancellors and Winston Churchill’s grandson from his party, after they helped inflict a major defeat on him in his first House of Commons vote as prime minister,” Business Insider reported. Those 21 members of parliament and having the Conservative Whip removed means that Johnson is now leading a minority government — a move not well received within the party according to reporters covering the situation in the UK. Johnson’s struggles extend past his party according to The Guardian, “Boris Johnson would trigger a legal and constitutional crisis that would force his resignation as prime minister if he failed to obey a law mandating him to seek another extension to Brexit, according to high-level legal advice obtained by Labour.” Along with the Social Democratic opposition leading Labour party, the Social Liberal, Liberal Democrat party has also backed the concept of Johnson having to resign if he disobeys the law. “If the prime minister refused to comply with this order, then, while we would be in historically uncharted political territory, the legal position would remain clear — the prime minister would be in contempt of an order of the court and would be exposed to a full range of sanctions,” Matrix Chambers’ lawyers stated when speaking to reporters at The Guardian. After pushing for Prorogation, the dissolving of Parliament between sessions, Johnson has undergone massive pressure to recall government back to session. Leading opposition parties have taken to legal means in an attempt to force the issue, “Labour, the SNP and Lib Dems all demanded an urgent recall of parliament to allow scrutiny of the government’s Brexit plans, after Scottish appeal court judges ruled against Johnson’s decision to suspend parliament in the run-up to the October Brexit deadline,” reported The Guardian. “I am going to be discussing this with others; but there is an argument that that judgment now stands, and that the prorogation is illegal; and until it’s challenged and a new judgment is made in a higher court, the prorogation has no legal basis,” said Labour MP Clive Lewis. “This is really unprecedented what’s happening to our democracy. It’s positive the court has ruled today that this is unlawful. There is one reason why Boris Johnson has prorogued parliament and that is because he wants to force through his no-deal Brexit without having scrutiny, without having to obey the normal rules that a prime minister has to obey by,” said Liberal Democrat leader, Jo Swinson about the suspension of Parliament. Johnson’s administration states they have not broken any laws by continuing through with prorogation, yet the legal and political battle will continue over the next several days.

Medium.com,Society,How Britain Plunged Into Its Worst Constitutional Crisis in 400 Years,World,https://gen.medium.com/how-britain-plunged-into-its-worst-constitutional-crisis-in-400-years-11ec694264b8?source=topic_page---------725------------------1," he news hit like a shockwave across British politics. On Wednesday morning, three of Scotland’s most senior judges found that the government had unlawfully suspended its own Parliament in a desperate attempt to force through an extreme version of Brexit. It was, without hyperbole, the most shocking legal decision in the modern history of British public law. The logical conclusion of the ruling was that Prime Minister Boris Johnson had lied to the public, lied to Parliament, and, most shocking of all, lied to the queen. It looks like a frenzied political battle over Brexit. But the beating heart of this story is not Brexit. It is the question of where power resides in British politics. The U.K.’s constitutional system hands sovereignty — supreme authority — to Parliament. That power is derived from the people. The public votes for who they want to represent them, and those people sit in Parliament as MPs. The government, composed of the prime minister in Downing Street and his ministers, ultimately answers to them. The MPs can vote for or against the laws the government puts forward. But the 2016 Brexit referendum changed everything. The vote to leave the European Union was a new development. It wasn’t representative democracy. It was direct democracy. This was a completely new source of democratic legitimacy emerging from the womb. The trouble with the vote was that it offered only a broad demand — leave the EU — but no details about how to pursue it. Should Britain pursue a soft Brexit, which stayed aligned to the EU economy? Or a hard Brexit, which pushed away from it? Or even a no-deal Brexit, which accepted no arrangements with the EU whatsoever? The referendum offered no answers to these questions. The government responded by adopting a tried-and-tested sleight of hand much loved by authoritarians throughout history. The government claimed that it, and it alone, could interpret the referendum result. It represented the “will of the people,” which was whatever the government said it was. In fact, this was all opportunist nonsense. Leave voters were not unanimous in what they wanted, and neither, for that matter, were Remain voters. There was no will of the people. It was a fiction, a lie that pretended that a mad scramble of different voices was uniform and homogenous. But if the government could claim there was such a thing, it could tap into a rich new well of political legitimacy and ignore Parliament. It would make itself more powerful than ever. So, for the past three years, the government has pursued a variety of Brexit strategies, all the while branding those in Parliament who tried to hold it to account as traitors who were trying to “undermine” the will of the people. That process has now reached a crescendo. Britain is now in the most serious constitutional crisis since the Civil War in the 1600s. On August 29, Boris Johnson asked the queen to prorogue Parliament. This is a standard procedure in which the legislative agenda is reset and MPs disband for a couple of weeks. Johnson pretended it was a run-of-the-mill event. Nothing could have been further from the truth. It was unprecedented for the government to attempt prorogation in the heart of a major political event. And Britain was currently embroiled in the most serious event of our lifetime. On October 31, the country would fall out the EU by automatic operation of the law. Johnson’s intention was to leave with no deal — the most extreme possible interpretation of the Brexit vote. The length of the prorogation was also unheard of. It was far longer than normal. The conclusion was obvious: Johnson wanted full government control. With Parliament suspended, MPs would be powerless to stop him from doing whatever he wanted. The queen accepted. There was nothing else she could do. The monarch has no real individual role in British politics — it is all ceremonial. She had to take the prime minister at his word. And then all hell broke loose. In their last week before prorogation, the MPs launched a form of constitutional guerrilla warfare against the government. They took control of parliamentary business and started pushing through a piece of rebel legislation, completely independent from Downing Street, that would force the prime minister to extend Britain’s membership of the EU if there was still no Brexit deal by the end of October. Twenty-one MPs in the governing Conservative Party joined the fight against their own government. They were not seasoned rebels. All but one of them had held ministerial posts. They were the entirety of the party’s statesman class. In an insane act of self-sabotage, Johnson told them that any act of rebellion would see them exiled from the party — a practice known as “removing the whip.” The threat was clearly designed to scare them into submission. But it didn’t work. They rebelled anyway. Johnson promptly sacked them—by text message—and eradicated his own majority. He had made good on the warning but by doing so dismantled his own capacity to govern. The rebel MPs helped the opposition pass the legislation into law. Johnson’s no-deal strategy was in tatters. As the minutes counted down to the disbanding of Parliament, a series of extraordinary scenes played out, the likes of which no one had seen before. Johnson had one last gambit. He could demand a general election. But without a majority, even this pathway was lost to him. British law requires a prime minister to secure a two-thirds majority in the Commons for an election outside of the normal five-year timetable. But opposition parties weren’t going to play ball. They would only allow an election after they were certain the October deadline had passed and a no-deal Brexit was ruled out. Johnson tried twice to pass a motion for an election but was defeated on both occasions. It was a humiliation. He sat dejected in the House of Commons. It was checkmate. In the early hours of Tuesday morning, as the minutes counted down to prorogation, a series of extraordinary scenes played out in Parliament, the likes of which no one had seen before. MPs attempted to physically hold the speaker of the Commons down in his chair so prorogation couldn’t take place. “I recognize that our presence is desired by our Majesty the Queen’s commissioners,” the speaker said, grudgingly. “They are doing what they believe to be right, and I recognize my role in this matter.” In response, opposition MPs shouted, “Shame on you,” at the government benches. Conservative MP Andrew Stephenson screamed at the speaker and stormed out the chamber. The speaker replied, “I don’t care if you don’t like it. I require no response from you, young man. Get out, man. You will not be missed.” Opposition MPs held a protest in the chamber, holding up signs reading “Silenced.” But none of it worked. None of it could work. The queen had accepted Johnson’s request for prorogation. The suspension came into effect. And then, Wednesday morning, the Scottish court case blew everything wide open again. Three first division judges ruled that the prorogation was an attempt to silence Parliament. “The court will accordingly make an order,” they said, “declaring that the prime minister’s advice to the queen and the prorogation which followed… was unlawful and is thus null and of no effect.” The consequences were astonishing. The prime minister was judged to have unlawfully suspended Parliament. And it got worse even than that. The prorogation request had to go through the monarch, meaning Johnson had lied to the queen herself about the purpose of the suspension. Opposition politicians immediately called for MPs to return. “Get back to Parliament,” Labour Brexit secretary Keir Starmer said. “Open those doors and get back in.” But in truth, the ruling is just the advance battle before the war. Next Tuesday, the Supreme Court will rule on a government appeal in the case and that of other cases concerning the prorogation, which had been decided in the government’s favor. That will be the deciding moment. What is being decided here is not just about Brexit. It is about the biggest constitutional question you can ask in any country: Who holds legitimate political power? Is it the people, or Parliament, or the government? For centuries, there was a settled answer. Parliament held the power by virtue of votes from the people. The Brexit referendum provided the government with a mechanism to sidestep that arrangement and portray itself as the voice of the people independently from Parliament. The events of the next few weeks will show which of those visions is victorious. The stakes couldn’t be higher."

Medium.com,Society,Why Is Everyone Ignoring My Black Eye?,World,https://humanparts.medium.com/why-is-everyone-ignoring-my-black-eye-2d82cee669ef?source=topic_page---------727------------------1," Okay, so I play rugby. In the 15 years that I’ve played, I had somehow always miraculously avoided getting a black eye. But hey, presto, last match, I finally got one. A pretty decent and visible one (although admittedly not the best one I’ve ever seen). In any case, I was quite excited about it: I’d be able to boast about playing female rugby — a sport I love and wish more people knew about or played. A sport that even people like me — a 39-year-old mother of two, and a successful, respected career woman — can play. The timing was “ideal,” so to speak, for it to be a conversation starter. It happened two days before the start of the new school term, just as everyone was coming back to work from holidays. But… it simply didn’t happen. Everyone just ignored it. As I dropped the kids off at school, I met countless other mums and dads who I know well, more or less. Everyone said hello, some chatted (“Did you have a nice holiday?” “Which class are your kids in?” “Are they still doing the same after-school activities?”). Everyone looked at my eye — rather awkwardly, too — but not one person asked about it. The more people ignored it, the more that reaction intrigued me. When I got to work, a handful of very close colleagues who know I play rugby took one look at me and just said upfront: “I hope that’s a rugby injury.” Everyone else, on the other hand, pretended not to see it, instead chatting about holidays, or getting right back to business: What to expect from the new Commission, state of play of the papers we’re working on, and so on. Day two in the office was the same. But the more people ignored it, the more that reaction intrigued me. What if I had been beaten up? What if I was in a violent or abusive relationship and needed help, advice, or someone to talk to? The message I received came loud and clear: no one wanted to know. In the end, I asked one male colleague if he hadn’t noticed my black eye. Blushing, he told me he’d seen something was wrong, but he didn’t want to embarrass me in case it was a “bad makeup” incident. I also typed “reacting to a black eye?” in Google. One of the first hits that turn up is this one: “How to react professionally when a colleague comes to work with a black eye?” The most common responses were suggestions to “completely ignore it,” “If they don’t bring it up then don’t mention it,” and “If it’s not affecting their performance, it’s not relevant.” Hold on. Whaaaaat? Hello! If that person is dead next Monday because she’s in an abusive relationship, it will affect her work! Okay, it might seem like I’m taking things a bit far here, but it’s not actually that extreme. According to (shockingly limited) available data on gender-based violence in the European Union, some 3,500 women are killed by their partners each year in the EU, while as many as one in three women has experienced physical and/or sexual violence since they were 15 years old. In the latest Eurobarometer study (November 2016) on the issue, 74% of respondents said they thought domestic violence against women was common in their country. Only one in three respondents said that they would speak about it to the person involved. The main reasons given for not speaking up was that it was “none of their business” (26%), lack of proof (18%), they didn’t want to create trouble (16%), or that circumstances weren’t clear enough (16%). Meanwhile, 6% said that whatever they saw did not appear serious enough, and 23% said there was no reason to do so. Sure, in the case of my black eye, some people did ask about it. But if I were suffering from abuse, that may not have been the case. Domestic violence and social isolation often go hand in hand. There’s a reason that only about half of domestic violence incidents are ever reported to the police. Helping victims to speak up means daring to ask uncomfortable questions. The EU says it wants to do more to eliminate gender-based violence in Europe. But how will it do that if everyone is just burying their head in the sand when faced with the signs? I’m not saying a full-on interrogation is needed every time you see a friend with a bruise or black eye. But maybe a simple “I can’t help noticing that bruise, and are you okay, or do you want to talk about it?” is enough. Talking about violence against women has been taboo for too long. That became more than apparent with the #MeToo movement and other correlated campaigns. The taboo is going away, as more women have come forward to share their stories. Despite that greater awareness, however, lasting change is hardly going to happen without good, current data about domestic violence and violence against women, which won’t happen if we keep pretending it isn’t really happening. Helping victims to speak up means daring to ask uncomfortable questions. Anyway, that’s what I would do."
Medium.com,Society,Saudi Arabia is Planning to Enrich Uranium… Just Like Iran,World,https://medium.com/citizen-truth/saudi-arabia-is-planning-to-enrich-uranium-just-like-iran-fc5374cdb329?source=topic_page---------728------------------1," While attending a conference in Abu Dhabi on Monday, Saudi Arabi’s energy minister, Prince Abdulaziz bin Salman, told attendees that Saudi Arabia was “cautiously” proceeding ahead with plans to enrich uranium to use in two planned nuclear power reactors. “We are proceeding with it cautiously … we are experimenting with two nuclear reactors,” Reuters quoted Salman as saying at the 24th World Energy Congress. Saudi Arabia has long looked toward the possibility of nuclear power as a solution for its growing energy demands. However, in the highly volatile Middle East, enriching uranium for peaceful purposes opens the door to further enriching uranium up to weapons-grade levels, a plausibility that brought the end of Iran Nuclear Deal in 2018. Most nuclear reactors are light-water reactors that use uranium enriched between three and five percent. The same technology used to enrich uranium for energy purposes is used to enrich uranium to weapons-grade levels which typically use uranium enriched to 80% or more. Under President Trump, the U.S. pulled out of the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA), commonly known as the Iran Deal, originally signed in 2015 under President Obama. Under the deal, Iran agreed to limit enriching uranium to 3.67% as well as to reduce stockpiles of its enriched uranium. President Trump was a fierce critic of the Iran Deal calling it “horrible” and “incompetent,” while also claiming that Iran was frequently in violation of the deal and enriching uranium beyond the deal’s limits. Yet, Trump and the U.S. have never offered any proof that Iran was in violation of the deal. In fact, the agency responsible for monitoring the Iran Deal, the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), confirmed in 15 consecutive reports that Iran was in compliance with the JCPOA. Now Saudi Arabia is looking to enrich uranium likely to the same levels that Iran was enriching uranium to when the U.S. pulled out of the JCPOA. However, there is one crucial difference between the two nations’ nuclear programs. Unlike Iran and the U.S.’ volatile relationship, the U.S. and Saudi Arabia have long been fervent allies (an alliance first formed under Nixon) thanks to a bond over oil, weapons and shared Middle East goals. Iran and the U.S. have a complicated history beginning with the U.S. and U.K.-led coup and overthrowal of Iran’s democratically-elected Prime Minister Mohammad Mossadeq in 1953 and the subsequent 1979 Iranian Revolution that overthrew the U.S. backed monarchical rule of Mohammad Reza Pahlavi. So while the U.S. has often condemned and cast a leery eye toward Iran’s nuclear power program, now, in the face of Saudi Arabia building its first two nuclear reactors, the U.S.’ reaction seems almost the polar opposite. In March, the Daily Beast reported that the Trump administration had already secretly okayed six American companies to conduct nuclear-related work in Saudi Arabia. The month prior, the House Committee on Oversight and Reform opened an investigation into the Trump administration’s approval, looking into whether it rushed the sale of sensitive nuclear technology to Saudi Arabia and violated U.S. law by bypassing the required congressional approval. According to the House report, under the Atomic Energy Act (AEA) “the U.S. may not transfer nuclear technology to a foreign country without the approval of Congress, in order to ensure that the agreement reached with the foreign government meets nine specific nonproliferation requirements.” As Yasmeen Rasidi previously wrote for Citizen Truth, the congressional report said it was written in response to several whistleblowers who spoke up about the White House’s efforts to advance the transfer of sensitive nuclear technology to Saudi Arabia. “The whistleblowers who came forward have warned of conflicts of interest among top White House advisers that could implicate federal criminal statutes,” Representative Elijah Cummings, the Democrat chairman of the committee, wrote in a letter to the White House in February of 2019. Similarly, Trump has forced through the sale of billions in weapons to Saudi Arabia also bypassing or vetoing the necessary congressional approval. In July, Trump vetoed three bills passed by both the House and Senate which prohibited the sale of arms to Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates. Previously, in May, Trump declared an emergency in order to bypass Congress and speed up the sale of weapons to Saudi Arabia. In order to move forward with supporting the Saudi Arabian nuclear reactors and uranium enrichment program, the U.S. is likely to insist that Saudi Arabia sign the “123 Agreement” — an agreement that binds the signatory to using its nuclear program for peaceful purposes only. Such an agreement would allow U.S. companies to remain in the running to build and work on Saudi Arabia’s nuclear projects. According to Reuters, Dan Brouillette, Deputy Secretary of the U.S. Department of Energy, said as much at the Abu Dhabi conference. “It’s important for us, with regards to U.S. technology, we’re going to pursue a 123 Agreement,” Brouillette said. “We would like to see a 123 Agreement accompany any agreement to transfer U.S. technology or use U.S. technology in Saudi or any other place,” he added. However, the same Reuters report claimed that progress on signing the deal has been limited because Saudi Arabia does not want to entirely rule out the possibility of enriching uranium to higher levels or reprocessing spent fuel — both potential paths to nuclear weapons. The 123 Agreement has also been tossed around as a possibility for negotiating with Iran. Senator Lindsey Graham told the Daily Beast in early August that he urged President Trump to put the 123 Agreement on the table with Iran. “I told the president: Put the 123 on the table with the Iranians. Make them say ‘no,’” Graham told The Daily Beast. “I think the Iranians will say no. And I think that will force the Europeans’ hands.” So far, no such offer has been made. In March of 2018, Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman told CBS News in an interview that if Iran builds a nuclear bomb, so will Saudi Arabia. “Saudi Arabia does not want to acquire any nuclear bomb, but without a doubt, if Iran developed a nuclear bomb, we will follow suit as soon as possible,” MBS stated in the televised interview. While Saudi Arabia’s true nuclear weapons ambitions are unknown, Saudi Arabia is aiming to build as many as sixteen nuclear reactors by 2040 — a lucrative contract for any nuclear tech company.

Medium.com,Society,Why Canadians Suddenly Trusted Justin Trudeau,World,https://medium.com/strong-and-free/why-canadians-suddenly-trusted-justin-trudeau-c542f6df6f7e?source=topic_page---------731------------------1," In
2015, Justin Trudeau went from the leader of the third party to Prime Minister of Canada with a majority government. The Conservative Party of Canada was in power for a long time and, Justin found himself leading a party that was prime to form a majority and govern the country. The Conservatives were in power for 9 years and seemed stale. The economy, however, was humming along. Canada made it out of the 2008 Global Economic Recession relatively unscathed. While the Conservative Party was in power, fiscal restraint was its raison-d’etre. Cost-cutting measures were routinely announced, as with investments in infrastructure. Stephen Harper, then Prime Minister would regularly boast about the savings his government had found or new jobs created. But the Party did a poor job communicating investments in healthcare, education and supports for marginalized groups. The deafening sound of silence on these issues was perceived as an attack of sorts on these sectors. At the same time, the cost of living was increasing and the perception of life being unfair was clear. The Liberals saw their opening. If Justin could prioritize people first, voters just might turn. And they did. It seemed to happen overnight. In July 2015 approximately 18 percent of Canadians trusted Justin Trudeau to manage the economy. By October of the same year, this number grew to 31 percent, outpacing the governing Conservative Party. In a matter of weeks, Trudeau was seriously being considered for Canada’s top job. What could explain this shift from Leader of the Third Party to the Leader of the Governing Party? In 2013, Martin Goldfarb summed it up best: [Trudeau] needs to define his promise, his values, his attributes. What will he do to make us a better country? What is the big idea that he wants to challenge the country with? By understanding this, we will have a good sense of the likely drivers of his decision making. Justin Trudeau had to embody the values of what it meant to be a ‘Liberal’ in Canada in 2015. This meant supporting international bodies like the United Nations and the UN Security Council. Liberal supporters very much saw themselves and the country as an extension of being a global citizen. Not only were they global citizens and had a moral duty to speak out in the face of oppression; so too did their Prime Minister. While Stephen Harper was vociferous in his 2011 address to the United Nations calling upon more countries to act in the face of terrorism, Liberals saw the greatest actor being the international institutions themselves. Through these bodies, true diplomacy and lasting peace can be achieved. And Trudeau had to believe this. Trudeau also saw the opportunity to be a champion of the new wave of political correctness: openly admitting his Feminist stance, attaining a gender-balanced Cabinet and righting the wrongs of history through apologies. Saying sorry went a long way. Many Liberals believed this to be a core principle of the Leader of the Party. Past wrongs of turning away boats of Jewish immigrants during the Holocaust. Or, apologizing for the tragedies undertaken by the federal government towards Indigenous peoples. Suddenly, voters who were left-wing saw some of their values eschewed in the Liberal leader, a party known to be centrist. Would left-wing voters be sacrificing their ideals in voting for Trudeau? Maybe not. Stephen Harper on the other hand, never openly discussed these issues. And if he did, many did not remember. Again, Trudeau was unapologetic in his approach: he heard from many about the need for governments to recognize past injustices and apologize. Uniquely, given his relatively young age as Leader, Justin Trudeau also had to be seen as a grassroots organizer appealing to the College/University students and capturing their votes as well. The left-wing New Democrats who were in official opposition status stand to risk the most from Trudeau’s brand image. Justin could erode the base of support from the NDP. Dabble with a few left-leaning policies and gain trust amongst undecided NDP voters. It was genius. Justin also had to distance himself from his Father’s name. To some, Pierre Trudeau was an incredible leader. To others, he was alienator-in-chief. The Senior Trudeau was known for hanging out with celebrities, late-night Rendez-Vous with prominent females, and rubbed elbows with Socialist Dictators. Justin had to show he supported women’s rights and the #MeToo movement, without saying so. He also had to distance himself from Socialist sympathizers as much as he could. It is incredible what the power of physical appearance does to people. Stephen Harper was, to many, a leader who spent too much time reading policy documents or in the backroom making deals happen. He was older, grey-haired and had a terrible sense of style. Justin Trudeau was the complete opposite. He was younger. Full head of hair. And wore impeccable suits. His shirts, ties, pants were all tailored. He exercises regularly. He was the living embodiment of the Liberal brand. And he knew it. You could say that Justin Trudeau was the right leader at the right time. The Liberals came out of a devastating loss in the 2011 federal election, which saw the Party’s worst showing ever. The Party elected its fewest MPs and many were questioning their efficacy to rebound. Party Brass probably saw that the Conservatives were occupying most of the political space in the centre. Stephen Harper was not a right-wing ideologue as much as people thought he would be when PM: but he was not left-leaning at all. And the Liberals saw that pushing the yardstick to the Left could occupy space traditionally held by smaller left-wing Parties like the New Democrats. Will Canadians trust Trudeau again in 2019? It’s hard to say. A lot has happened in 4 years, both good and bad for Trudeau and the Liberals. But by pushing the yardstick further left, the Liberals might be alienating their support from centrist voters. Timing is everything, and many political pundits are very unsure how the October election will play out. After all, we’re only beginning to understand the success of Justin in 2015. It may be years before we truly understand the results of the 2019 election."
Medium.com,Society,How People Perceive Color Around the World,World,https://modus.medium.com/how-people-perceive-color-around-the-world-8d20dc0b32fa?source=topic_page---------732------------------1," ow are different colors perceived from one country to the next? That’s what we set out to learn in our recent color survey sent to 2,200 people around the world. We wanted to get a more personal insight into color theory and how it varies across regions and nationalities. We were also curious about the way different colors are perceived and the emotions attached to them. This is where color theory really lives — not in the saturation, hues, and tones (though these are also important), but in the feeling and meaning they transfer. The process with which we see color is a little complicated (yes, color is a science!). Our eyes have light receptors that transmit messages to the brain. The human eye sees the light, then tells the brain what color it is based on familiar sensations from that color. Which is to say, we’re not born inherently knowing that grass is green and water is blue. We train our brains to recognize these colors and their different hues. It’s basic memorization, which makes sense when you think about all those color games children play. To tap into how people describe colors and what they mean, we sent a survey to entrepreneurs in 50+ countries and asked them to describe eight different colors in one word."
Medium.com,Society,Brexit Will Tear the United Kingdom Apart,World,https://medium.com/@Thomas_Brown./brexit-will-tear-the-united-kingdom-apart-7a3624402e6c?source=topic_page---------733------------------1," I didn’t understand the risks — My Brexit mea culpa I confess that, while I was never really on board with Brexit, the breathless warnings from the pro-EU camp were enough to push me into the pro-Brexit side. I thought that the Remainers’, rather condescending, argument boiled down to little more than “PANIC! Without the EU, Britain will fall into the sea!” I am no great fan of the tremendously elitist European Union either and also thought the Leavers’, similarly condescending, argument amounted to little more than “Brussels is the 4th Reich and we must resist now or lose our identity as Britons!” At the end of the day, I argued, Great Britain will do just fine whether or not she is a member of the European Union. There is too much money to be made on both sides of the Channel, too many financial and cultural threads connecting the United Kingdom and Europe, for a real, permanent disruption. The people voted, I said, quit the fear-mongering and get it over with: whatever the hell you’re going to do, just do it so everyone can get on with their businesses and their lives. I’ve changed my mind. Brexit is a terrible idea and a new referendum is more than justified and prudent, it is absolutely necessary. I misunderstood the nature of the Brexit risk. The EU is not the union I should’ve been watching. I understood the problems posed by the Irish border, and even that reunification of Ireland with Northern Ireland was becoming more of a political possibility. What took me by surprise was how seriously Scots are discussing independence. Splitting from Europe now means the potential dissolution of Britain itself. The EU has for 20 years been an overly bureaucratic organization, with remarkable disregard for the local political and cultural challenges of member states. But it is also a demonstrably effective organization when it comes to helping out the smaller states. My home of Malta has grown more in the fifteen years since joining the European Union than it had almost in the four decades since independence from Britain. I barely recognize some parts of the island; so much development, so much investment, so many people living and working there from all over the continent and world. I love it. But I lived in Germany during the EU transition, I remember the cleaning we got during the Deutsche Mark to Euro changeover. We called it the Teuero (teuer is German for expensive). The Euro was supposed to be exactly twice the value of the Mark, what cost 2 DM should now cost 1 Euro. Instead what we got was a bunch of storekeepers (especially gas stations, restaurants, and supermarkets) just changing the DM sign to Euro, effectively doubling the price. German politicians took way too long to acknowledge it was happening and never held the EU to account for the inflation obvious to everyone except economists in Berlin and bureaucrats in Brussels. Ever since I’ve had a love/hate relationship with the EU. I understand why Brexit happened. Even with my misgivings on Brexit I found the apocalyptic Remainer rhetoric distasteful. Britain has been around for centuries, she is integral to the global economy, her culture is one of the most recognizable, loved, and marketable the world has ever seen. Britain’s economy may lag a bit (probably lag a lot) for a while but she’ll emerge just fine. There’s too much money to be made in and with the United Kingdom for any economic slump to be anything but temporary. However, I now think that Brexit is not merely a bad idea but is a phenomenally, unprecedentedly, historically bad idea. I didn’t understand the threat. Brexit can end three hundred years of a united Britain and that is unacceptable for this Anglophile and Commonwealth citizen (I know, not technically a thing but it’s how I feel). Scotland is quite ready to tell the rest of Britain to piss right off. I didn’t get that. I didn’t understand that the Scottish independence referendum five years ago failed largely because remaining British was thought to be the only way to stay in the EU. I was in Scotland last month for the Fringe Festival (if you haven’t been you’re missing out. I’m already planning to be there again next year.) and I’ve since been reading up. The Scots are fed up and willing to go it alone. They’re ready to join a different union as an independent nation and are preparing for a second independence referendum. The Scottish conservative party is in disarray and London can in no way count on their support in such a referendum. And that should be scary to anyone with a love for Britain. I don’t want the Kingdom to no longer be United. Not being part of the EU will cause temporary economic problems in GB, definitely. Which is nothing compared to the lasting cultural, political, military, and economic consequences of a less great Great Britain. The Kingdom has been United since 1707. Risking that is insane. I have few real doubts that Scotland would do just fine by itself. I have few real doubts that what remains of Great Britain wouldn’t eventually also do just fine. But I don’t want Scotland out, I don’t want the Union Jack to have to be redesigned: I don’t want one of the most influential political institutions in human history to dissolve over something as silly as this. The Remainers stoked a bunch of unnecessary fear about how poor Britain would become without the EU, which was bollocks. But the Leavers are bullshitting everyone now about what else may happen. If there is any chance at all that Britain will fracture and weaken itself (make no mistake, Scotland leaving will make Britain weaker. For years to come.) then they should reject Brexit.

Medium.com,Society,Bolsonaro: Dismantling Environmental Protections Since January 1,World,https://medium.com/@claptonjonsson/bolsonaro-dismantling-environmental-protections-since-january-1-87418be41863?source=topic_page---------734------------------1," “W
hen it comes to environmental pollution, it’s just to poop every other day, which will make our lives that much better,” Brazil’s president said after a reporter asked how the country could grow economically while preserving the environment. Ludicrous statements such as this one have given the president a reputation as hostile to environmental considerations, especially after the fires in the Amazon forest became a prime story in international news last month. The hostility, however, is not just talk. On January 2, one day after Jair Messias Bolsonaro took office as President of the Republic, the new administration published a series of decrees that made its intentions clear regarding land and environmental policy. The decrees transferred the power to demarcate indigenous territory from the National Indian Foundation (Funai) to the Ministry of Agriculture. The latter also received the Brazilian Forest Service from the Ministry of the Environment, which — in addition to forestry and restoring vegetation­­ — is tasked with managing the Rural Environmental Registry (CAR). CAR is a digital registry to which all rural properties must be reported by its owners, its purpose being to facilitate regularization of these properties in accordance with environmental laws and land regulations. The Secretariat of Climate Change and Forests, a department under the Ministry of the Environment, changed its name to be “of Forests and Sustainable Development” — a move seen by some as reflecting Bolsonaro’s ambiguous position on climate change (a phenomenon his sons openly question). Any mention of deforestation was removed from the ministry’s portfolio. Its head, Ricardo Salles, defended the changes by saying that they would provide more efficiency. Ricardo Salles, Bolsonaro’s Minister of the Environment, was previously state secretary of the environment under São Paulo’s former governor, Geraldo Alckmin, who resigned to run for president in the 2018 election. Salles was condemned in December last year for administrative misconduct, having put pressure on staff to circumvent legal procedures and modify maps of protected areas in favor of businesses wanting to exploit the land. He was sentenced to a fine and suspension from public office for three years but remains in government pending appeal. Salles defended himself by arguing that environmental policy should be formulated with “ideological detachment.” The minister’s party, Novo, excluded him in August after the Amazon fires became an international crisis. Novo motivated the exclusion by referring to Salles’s “divergent conducts” in regard to the party’s environmental program, citing examples such as “scorning scientific data” and “firing qualified professionals.” Little more than a week after the Bolsonaro government was instated, the Special Secretary of Land Affairs, acting under the Ministry of Agriculture, said that a “wide survey” was needed “to see the real situation of land regularization.” Speaking to the newspaper Estado de S. Paulo, Luiz Antonio Nabhan Garcia claimed that there were “irregularities” in many of the organs tasked with regulating land rights and that during past years these organs had been steered by political ideology. “The political and ideological contamination is complete,” he said, emphasizing that everything had to be analyzed “without the interference of NGOs.” Six days later, Ricardo Salles suspended all of his ministry’s NGO contracts––including those of its administrative arms Ibama (Brazilian Institute of the Environment and Renewable Natural Resources) and ICMbio (the Chico Mendes Institute for Biodiversity Conservation), both tasked with safeguarding protected land and its environment. The ministry would go through all the contracts, Salles explained, and maintain those that were “correct” — implying without evidence that some contracts had circumvented proper procedure. The suspension would last 90 days. Some of Brazil’s foremost environmental organizations released a joint message clarifying that, according to law, contracts can only be suspended after an administrative process has been opened where the party accused has the full right to defend itself. On January 7, the then president of Ibama, Suely Araújo, asked to be dismissed after both President Bolsonaro and Ricardo Salles had questioned on Twitter a contract for acquiring vehicles, to the cost of BRL 28.7 million (almost USD 7 million), with Bolsonaro calling it “irregular.” The organ declared in a message that the accusation attested to “a complete ignorance” of its “magnitude and its functions.” The message explained that the contract provided 393 trucks — adjusted to surveillance, intelligence, and enforcement activities, in addition to combatting forest fires and other environmental emergencies — to cover the whole country (the world’s fifth largest). Bolsonaro deleted his message shortly after having published it, while the Minister of the Environment said that he had simply highlighted “the high price.” The following month, Ricardo Salles dismissed the Ibama superintendents of 20 states and the Federal District (Brasília), leaving only six states with their leadership intact. It was the largest collective dismissal in 30 years. One month later, the head of Ibama’s Air Operations Center was discharged, the only one of his rank to be so. He had fined Bolsonaro BRL 12,000 (about USD 3,000) in 2012 when the then-deputy had been caught fishing illegally in a protected area. On May 25, Ibama released a statement informing about upcoming surveillance and enforcement operations against illegal deforestation and mining, effectively giving heads-up to those involved in such activity in these areas. Until Bolsonaro came to power, information of this kind was kept under wraps. In early July, Ibama agents were attacked during an operation against illegal loggers on indigenous land in the state of Rondônia. The loggers had cut down trees to block the road for oncoming vehicles and the Ibama agents could not receive aerial support. The agents had to abort the operation and retreat under the threat of being injured. Close to where this encounter took place, an Ibama truck with helicopter fuel was set on fire the day before. As late as last year, unsafe operations of this kind were carried out by Ibama’s elite unit instead of regular agents. Two weeks after the confrontation, Folha de S.Paulo reported that Minister Salles had arrived in the region. He was applauded by loggers as he directed himself to what he called “the good people that work in this country and that are here represented by you.” The plight of the loggers — that logging on protected land is illegal — was “unfortunately,” according to the minister, “the result of years and years and years of public policy producing laws, rules and regulations that are not always related to the real world.” According to the newspaper, Ibama servants saw this as the defining “big moment” of the organization’s future course under the current presidency. The next month, the newspaper reported that Ibama’s surveillance and enforcement operations had fallen by 58% nationally between January and April compared with the year before. In the Amazon, they had fallen with 70%. Environmental fines had been reduced by 23%. On April 13, Ricardo Salles opened an administrative process against public servants at ICMBio in which he alleged that they had not shown up at a meeting, attended by agribusinesses and farmers, where Salles had spoken. Speaking to Estado de S. Paulo under anonymity, the servants said that they had never been invited to the event. The head of ICMBio, who had attended the event with Salles, asked to resign shortly thereafter for “personal reasons.” Several federal employees in the environmental sector released a letter two days later condemning Salles for his “declarations and postures” against environmental protection policies and the public servants carrying them out. Among some of the examples given of Salles’s confrontational style was a post on social media where he wrote that he would reinforce ICMbio with “serious and competent” people, implying that current employees lacked these qualities. The Ministry of Agriculture announced at the end of June that it would legalize 42 new pesticides, increasing the total amount of pesticides legalized under Bolsonaro to 239. According to Greenpeace at the time, the pesticides constituted either new combinations of old formulas that had not yet been tested or prohibited products allowed to re-enter the market under new names. One product was completely new and had still not been tested in Europe, while an estimated 30% of the other pesticides were prohibited within the European Union. The National Institute for Space Research (INPE) reported on July 1 that deforestation in the Amazon during June had increased by 60% compared with the same month last year. The numbers had looked about the same as in 2018 until April, when they began to rise radically. The publication of those numbers irritated President Bolsonaro, who fired the institute’s director, Ricardo Galvão, one month later. Bolsonaro had publicly aired the suspicion that Galvão could be “at the service of some NGO” after INPE released the data. He motivated Galvão’s firing by saying that “there was no longer a climate [for the director] to continue, even if he could have proven that the data was even correct.” On
August 6, INPE reported that deforestation in the Amazon in July had increased by 278% in comparison with the same month the year before. Two weeks later, Brazilian skies turned black by smoke from a burning Amazon forest and Bolsonaro accused, without evidence, environmental NGOs of having started the fires in revenge for withheld resources. The Amazon soon thereafter became a hot topic in international news and was introduced into the G7 meeting with little prior notice — a rare occurrence for a gathering where the agenda is usually set months in advance. Facing both international and domestic pressure, Bolsonaro eventually made a televised statement where he expressed concern for the Amazon and announced that he would dispatch the military to take care of the situation. The military and “anti-globalist” factions within the government, as well as Bolsonaro himself, expressed distrust toward foreign countries wanting to “meddle” in Brazilian affairs. The generals in the government argued that it violated Brazil’s sovereignty, while Foreign Minister Ernesto Araújo described the “environmental crisis” as a leftist plot. The domestic pressure to ease international concerns came from agribusinesses who feared reduced exports in case their image was tarnished. On the campaign trail, Bolsonaro said he would fuse the Ministry of the Environment into the Ministry of Agriculture — an announcement that provoked an outcry among environmental groups. He reneged on this promise once in power, again due to agribusiness pressure, and the Ministry of the Environment remained. Ironically, it seems as if the sole party within Bolsonaro’s government concerned with adhering to international climate commitments is the very agricultural lobby that initially was seen as, perhaps, the principal threat to the environmentalist agenda. Judging from Ricardo Salles’s actions so far, it does not seem as if the Minister of the Environment shares those concerns."
Medium.com,Society,Screaming into the void,World,https://medium.com/@laineypage/screaming-into-the-void-bd3d17f576bf?source=topic_page---------735------------------1," My Facebook feed is usually a mix of feminist and academic memes, birthdays, climate change articles and pictures of cats. This past week, however, my feed more closely resembled the research I do. Even now, every third post is someone sharing a news article about one of the MANY women and girls who have been abducted, murdered and/or raped. In no particular order. The vast majority of the posts come from the women I am friends with. They decry the state of violence in our country. They question their own safety. They appeal to the men in their lives to do something — anything — to help make them feel safe again. Some of the posts do come from men. I follow some great allies who lend their voices to these issues whenever we have a weekend like the one we just had. One of the women in the news is a 19-year-old Uyinene Mrwetyana, a UCT student who had been missing for just over a week. After an extensive search by the police, a man was arrested. He admitted to bashing her head with a scale in after she went to pick up a parcel at a post office. He has since been charged with rape and murder. Another post informs me that the sister of Courtney Pieters, a three-year-old toddler who was raped and murdered in 2018, has been missing for two days. A few days later, we find out she is safe. Next, I read about a woman whose body was found cut up in a shed. Then I see a R2 million ransom is being demanded for a kidnapped Grade-R learner. She is luckily safely returned a day or two later. And I see outrage. A lot of it. My research doesn’t focus too much on the murder of women in South Africa. I look at rape and the prevalence of it in the country — specifically our university campuses. So, I look at these articles and I wonder what needs to happen to change our society. To change the state of gender-based violence in our country. Hell, in the province of the Western Cape. I see the collective outrage and the national triggering of all the women living in South Africa and I wish I know what to say. I watch as women and men I know who have largely remained apolitical and shied away from feminist conversations sharing images and statues with #menaretrash and #amInext? It becomes clear to me that we no longer have the luxury of remaining silent. We are a nation full of scared women who are forced to be strong and defiant in the face of a culture that lets us be raped and murdered. I see two petitions spreading online. One to bring back the death penalty. Another to declare a state of emergency in the country over GBV. In my grief I sign the latter. It’s a kind of desperate move to ask that anyone in power please just acknowledge the crisis we face. But neither one of those petitions hold the answers. The death penalty was declared unconstitutional with the turn to democracy in South Africa — and for good reason. Apart from the obvious flaws and failures of the death penalty, I have another reason for opposing this option. Plainly, no one believes women when they say they are raped so how will it actually help us? With regards to implementing a state of emergency, I quickly realise that the author of the petition probably does not know what a state of emergency entails. Yes, we as a nation face a crisis when it comes to gender-based violence. However, I don’t think giving our government extraordinary powers is the answer. The South African government does not have a good track record when it comes to handling delicate and important matters. I do not trust them to handle this. So, death penalty and state of emergency aside, what are we to do? Clearly the problem lies in the beliefs, practices and ideas that permeate through society. Having the levels of femicide and rape that we see in South Africa doesn’t happen in isolation. The culture allows for it. The rape jokes and everyday sexism that are tolerated in communities and on campuses are a part of the problem. The all-too-common dismissal of women and their reports of rape or interpersonal violence is a part of the problem. We cannot only voice our outrage after a woman has been killed. We must do a better job of believing and supporting women when they find the courage to come forward and share their stories in a society that does not make it easy to do. I do not pretend to have the answers to any of the societal ills in our country. All that I know is that this week I was sad. Right now, I am hurt. I mourn collectively with the women around me. We as a nation are failing when half of us are hurting. Dying. Begging desperately to be believed and be protected."
Medium.com,Society,Retailers wake up to deforestation risk — will Italy’s leather trade raise its game?,World,https://medium.com/global-canopy/retailers-wake-up-to-deforestation-risk-will-italys-leather-trade-raise-its-game-4c8a8293175f?source=topic_page---------736------------------1," Aynur Mammadova and André Vasconcelos The recent forest fires in the Amazon have focused attention on the Brazilian cattle industry and its global supply chains. Leather is an important export commodity for Brazil, with an average annual turnover of US $ 2 billion, and Italy is the second biggest market for Brazilian leather exports, after China. What are the Italian leather industry’s links to deforestation? And what can leather companies do to ensure they are not contributing to the deforestation in the Amazon? The most recent satellite data show that deforestation has sharply increased in Brazil, with the current forest fires in the Amazon highlighting the issue. It is also widely recognised that cattle ranching is the main driver of deforestation in the country. While demand for beef occupies headlines as the main culprit commodity, the role of bovine (adult cow) leather consumption is not discussed enough. Some within the industry argue that leather is not a primary product of cattle ranching. The narrative that leather is a “waste product” is often used, perhaps as an excuse for the leather industry’s failure to acknowledge and act upon these important risks in its supply chain. But this is changing. Some major global brands have taken the lead, announcing their concerns about what is happening in Brazil and its highly biodiverse ecosystems. VF Corporation officially announced a provisional ban on Brazilian leather until it could “…have the confidence and assurance that the materials used in [its] products do not contribute to environmental harm in the country.” Major fast fashion retailer H&M has also declared a similar ban on Brazilian leather. And it is not just companies in the fashion industry that are sending a signal that the leather industry should move towards more sustainable sourcing. Car manufacturers BMW and Volkswagen have both also stated privately that sourcing sustainable leather is on their agenda. Furniture retailer IKEA is working on extending its in-house traceability system to ensure that it sources from farms without deforestation risk. Leather tanneries can usually trace their products from the slaughterhouse where the leather originates. In very rare cases, if required by their clients, they can make sure that their sourcing slaughterhouse also has a traceability system in place. But this seldom includes the start of the supply chain (i.e. the farms that mostly specialise in breeding). Even the most advanced slaughterhouse traceability systems only cover the farms that they source from directly, i.e. the farms which specialise in rapid fattening of animals ready for sale. From there, hides are directly exported to other countries (as semi-processed leather) or sent to states further south for further processing and finishing before export. Brazil exports around 80% of its bovine hides and leather, while only around 20% of beef gets exported. Aside from the difficulties of tracing leather supply chains, the regulatory environment is also a factor. Although Brazil has some of the most advanced laws regarding forest conservation and land management in Latin America, weak enforcement, changing baselines and the frequent pardoning of illegal activities creates a climate of impunity. This situation has got worse since the election of President Jair Bolsonaro whose rhetoric encourages more deforestation, and whose actions have resulted in weaker environmental protection, and the dismantling of environmental agencies. Italy is the second biggest import market of Brazilian bovine leather, after China, accounting for 27% of Brazilian exports (Figure 1). But much of the leather exported to China ends up in European and the United States markets as manufactured products, such as car seats, furniture, and clothing. Your purchased leather product could say Made in Italy, but the origin of the hides might not be Italy or even Europe. The main raw materials used by the Italian tanning industry are adult cow hides, which account for 71% of Italy’s total production, and Brazil is the biggest source for the Italian industry. The Italian leather industry makes up around 65% of the European and 22% of global leather production. Some 75% of Italian annual production is exported as finished leather, with Europe as the main destination (51%), followed by China, including Hong Kong (16%), and the US (14%). In 2018 around 10% (US$ 15 million net value) of Italy’s imports of semi-processed leather came from the Amazon region, including the Amazonas state, which recently declared a state of emergency due to the spike in forest fires. Almost half of these (US$ 7 million in value) come from the state of Pará which has the highest level of annual deforestation according to Brazilian National Institute for Space Research (INPE) (Figure 2). However, this doesn’t include leather that originated in the Amazon but was processed in the south of Brazil before being exported to Italy — a common route as most of the specialised tanneries are in that region. It is currently challenging to trace this supply chain due to a lack of transparency which makes it difficult to estimate the total extent of deforestation risk in the Brazilian-Italian leather trade. Brazilian cow leather is generally considered most suitable for upholstery and furniture, and most of the tanneries serving these markets are clustered in the Veneto region (north-east of Italy). The majority of shipments from Brazil supply tanneries or logistics companies located here. As a result, major clients of these tanneries face a risk that they could be purchasing leather from deforested lands in the Amazon. When assessing the leather trade between Brazil and China, Global Canopy found that major companies involved in this trade were unlikely to be able to guarantee that their supply chains were deforestation-free. But this does not have to be the case for those in Brazilian-Italian trade. China may have the power of market size, but Italy can also exercise power in this market by investing in supply chain development and engaging with the producers to encourage greater sustainability. While boycotts are a crisis response to the critical events we are experiencing, they do not provide a long term solution, and can result in black market transactions. The European leather industry needs to be more proactive by acknowledging the existence of the deforestation risk, putting full traceability systems in place and sending out clear market signals that deforestation is not tolerated, and that sustainability is valued. Aynur Mammadova is a PhD Candidate at the University of Padova in Italy. Her research topic focuses on analysing the deforestation risk in leather supply chains through conceptualization, discourse and trade data analysis. The focus of her research is Brazilian-Italian leather trade. André Vasconcelos is a Latin America researcher at Global Canopy"
Medium.com,Society,The Supreme Court's hearing on prorogation,World,https://medium.com/@chrishanretty/the-supreme-courts-hearing-on-prorogation-ceb08ce694ae?source=topic_page---------737------------------1," Earlier this morning (Wednesday 11th September), the Inner House of the Court of Session ruled that the prorogation of Parliament, which took place on Tuesday morning, was unlawful. All three judges agreed. The decision follows a previous ruling by a Division Court of the High Court of England and Wales, composed of the Lord Chief Justice, the Master of the Rolls, and the President of the Queen's Bench division. The unexpected decision from the Court of Session now presents the Supreme Court with an almighty headache. Senior judges in two different jurisdictions have now disagreed on the correct interpretation of UK law. The first decision that the Supreme Court (or more accurately, the President and Deputy President of the Court) will have to make concerns the size and composition of the panel which will hear the case. In a forthcoming book on judicial behaviour on the Supreme Court (A court of specialists: judicial behaviour on the UK Supreme Court, OUP, out sometime in the space year 2020), I look at both panel size and composition. For panel size, I find that: For panel composition, I find that: What does this imply for the hearing on Tuesday? In terms of panel size, this is a case of the highest importance which involves the government, and where the judges that have heard the case are split 3:4 (three judges from CSIH versus the three judges in the High Court and one judge in the Outer House of the Court of Session). Because these cases are so recent, I can't create the same measure of importance I use in the book, but I would be surprised if the decisions were not reported in all of the reports I have just mentioned. It's therefore difficult to see the Supreme Court sitting in a panel smaller than nine. It's not clear to me whether the Supreme Court would sit in a panel of eleven, which it did for the Miller case. It suited the internal politics of the court to sit in eleven for Miller, because the court was one member short. The court cannot sit as twelve (it must have an odd number of judges), and so if the court were to sit in a panel of eleven, it would necessarily leave out one judge. That might make a panel of eleven an unappealling choice. On the other hand, the division of opinion in Cherry/Miller no. 2 is greater and more concentrated than any divisions in Miller no. 1 — though obviously we still need to see the full text of the reasons of the High Court and Court of Session. Panel composition is obviously a lot easier when the panel is made up of eleven judges, because the choice becomes a choice about which single judge to leave out. Seniority would suggest leaving out the most junior judge, but since Lord Sales (who became a Justice of the Court in January 2019) has more experience in public law than Lord Kitchin(October 2018), it may be that Lord Kitchin is left out. If the panel was a panel of nine, then a logic of specialisation would suggest that Kitchin, Briggs and Arden might not make the cut."
Medium.com,Society,Towards a common approach to data…,World,https://medium.com/@SmartLondon/towards-a-common-approach-to-data-2d72375c82a?source=topic_page---------738------------------1," Chief Digital Officer for London Theo Blackwell sets out City Halls take on how Whitehall finally needs to develop common approach across government departments to data, dealing with current challenges like public trust, poor data-sharing, and the public utilities. Earlier this year the Department of Culture Media & Sport issued a ‘call for evidence’ for a proposed National Data Strategy. London’s City Hall responded highlighting to Whitehall some of the opportunities and challenges when the real work gets underway. As the strategic authority for London, we strongly support the principle of a national data strategy to improve data-sharing with local and devolved government and make recommendations on how that might be progressed. As a regular user and interface with government data, we are also are well placed to give a perspective on Whitehall’s use of data across the departments and agencies we regularly work with. London & data London arguably differs to other cities in terms of its scale and the range of its partnership working with many more parties than other cities in the UK. The GLA sits within a complex data environment on account of its relationship with central government; 32 boroughs and the City of London; London-wide public services (including Transport for London, the Metropolitan Police and other emergency services); research institutions and wider civil society. The GLA’s use of data revolves around strategic analysis and performance management where we need timely access to detailed extracts of individual records for policy purposes. Through the London Datastore, the GLA has developed greater expertise in open data, data-sharing and use of personal data over last decade. The Datastore is a free and open data-sharing portal where anyone can access data relating to the capital. It was set up and is managed by the GLA to make London’s data more accessible. Established in 2010, in was winner of the Open Data Instiute Open Data Publisher Award in 2015 and now contains of 3,000 files, receiving up to 70,000 visitors per month. In addition to data for download, it hosts two blogs and over 300 webpages, providing commentary, interpretation, guidance, tools and data visualisations. The Datastore also enables the GLA to make complex issues more visible to policy makers, the public (e.g. Schools Atlas, Digital Connectivity Map, Cultural Infrastructure Map) or for specific users (Infrastructure Mapping Application). City and local government are custodians of large amounts of data and personal information. It is important that the public trust us both to secure their data and when we share data. We believe it is part of our city leadership role to provide transparency and assurance to the public and other users about how their data is held and used. A commitment to open data is a necessary first step. The Greater London Authority is a recognised leader in open data, with the London Datastore and Transport for London’s Unified API enabling significant innovation in policy development as well as civic benefit through apps like Citymapper. Increasingly the scope of city and local government — and the advance of smart technologies — enables the pooling of personal data, which goes beyond open data, raising questions about how we store and share ‘non-open’ data. This requires us to develop new structures, processes and engagement to provide appropriate assurance. Data-sharing across the city Using the technology behind the Lancashire & Cumbria Information Sharing Gateway, the London City Data Analytics Programme is building a document repository into which any existing data sharing agreement can be uploaded for view by partners and the public, and the documents can be easily searched and retrieved. Stage 2 of the initiative will then be to agree a set of data sharing templates that comply with all information governance principles. These templates would be ‘pre-approved’ as acceptable for use in any data sharing arrangement. The GLA is currently developing the next iteration of the Datastore — beyond open data — as a central register for key London datasets and to provide secure access to wider datasets. Mobile data The advent of 5G and the Internet of Things introduces a challenge around large volumes of live data (e.g. around citizen movement), but mobile data is already here. Following a pilot in 2016, TfL tracks mobile signals as people complete their journeys. The data leads directly to improvements in how the tube runs and operates, by giving the transport body a much more detailed insight into customer behaviour than has previously been available. Data Trusts The GLA worked with the ODI to pilot a data trust. In March the ODI has published their findings on how London can create and manage city data trusts. They scoped how a data trust pilot would work with our Sharing Cities teams working in City Hall and the Royal Borough of Greenwich. We believe there is a public expectation for transparency and assurance to users about how their data is held and used by public authorities. While data-sharing between public bodies is seen as important to improve public services, there is work to do to reassure residents that this can be done safely and securely when sharing data is appropriate. In general, we perceive a willingness by the public to allow data to be shared if it is done so for an acceptable reason and it is clear who data is being shared with and how. This is balanced by a concern that the public sector does not always hold data securely or that ‘bad deals’ may be struck between public bodies and third parties, to the benefit of the third party and not the citizen. Further research should be undertaken with the public in the development of the National Data Strategy to give a clearer picture about these questions. As holders of significant amounts of personal data, and places where the latest technologies are being piloted and introduced, it is important for city government to adopt a more active role in discussing data ethics with citizens. The GLA has conducted several engagements with Londoners to assess their views and appetite for data-sharing and sensors: · In May 2018 (to coincide with the introduction of GDPR) we polled of 1,097 Londoners on their views about data and sensors and conducted an online discussion on data and sensors through Your Commute and Talk London. · The GLA also surveyed the views of local representatives in London on their views about data-sharing and sensors. · The GLA currently works with the OneLondon health and social care programme to understand patient expectations around data sharing between the NHS and local government. · TfL commissioned work on collecting Wifi data on the Underground network in their pilot to inform the full service, launched this year. In developing this TfL considered guidance and engaged Information Commissioners Office (ICO). TfL adopted the ICO’s advice when informing customers that it was collecting WiFi data and the benefits from doing so. TfL updated customers about this activity using in-station posters, press releases, a Metro newspaper article, social media, and a dedicated webpage where they told customers they could opt-out by switching off their WiFi. More consistent approach to data between all the departments and devolved government In our experience, current data-sharing arrangements and practice between Whitehall and GLA varies significantly (see below). Where there are examples of good practice, there are numerous cases where data sharing is more difficult or the experience across government departments is inconsistent. Where this occurs, it is often a burden on local authorities and the source of frustration. Examples of Good Practice · The Department for Education (DfE) have created several important and useful datasets. One example is the National Pupil Database (NPD) which allows the GLA to produce pan-London school rolls projections that in turn inform many £millions of school construction each year. The NPD combines data from a range of different sources to produce a clean consistent dataset, which crucially includes longitudinal information. This allows tracking over time and (for instance) means that flows between primary schools and secondary schools can be understood consistently across London for the first time, as well as tracking education outcomes. Access to individual records is provided through a thorough and transparent application process, and data is supplied to authorised researchers through the ONS Secure Research Service. · Access to a wider range of detailed personal or corporate data for accredited researchers is available through secure areas for researchers (for instance, Office for National Statistic’s Secure Research Service) and is invaluable for a range of economic and social questions. · Information Sharing to Tackle Violence is a programme co-ordinated by the Mayor’s Office for Policing & Crime (MOPAC) and was originally funded through the Home Office Innovation Fund. It allows crime and community safety analysts to measure violent assaults that are presented to London’s 29 Type 1 A&E departments that may not have been reported to the other emergency services. This allows the identification and policing of violent hotspots that are not reported directly to the police. The programme has developed more effective data sharing between Community Safety Partnerships, health and other partners, using a new approach to collating and analysing anonymised ED data to inform community safety strategies and resourcing decisions across partner agencies. Examples where practice could be improved · Where central government requests data from local councils and other bodies — but then does not make it available it is often difficult for regional government/combined authorities to request this data as authorities feel that they have already provided it once. · Access to sufficiently detailed data from DWP benefits and HMRC tax services. The GLA receives access only to aggregated data from each department not individual records. There is a need for access to record level data for strategic analysis to assess the impact of initiatives (e.g. to more detailed DWP data to cost TfL’s vehicle scrappage scheme or Universal Credit on Londoners). · Better linked data across services i.e. linked National Insurance Number (NINo) data to understand experience of both out-of-work and in-work poverty, among other issues. · Regional government and the new combined authorities have a need to combine local data from constituent districts/boroughs on regular basis (in London’s case the 32 Boroughs and City of London). Some government departments only release one-off snapshots of data or highly aggregated data, making it difficult for cities to carry out analysis in these policy areas. This leads to local organisations commissioning their own data gathering exercises or carrying out surveys. · There are examples where the GLA has resorted to Freedom of Information requests to get the level of detail we need from government departments, for example on migration data from Home Office. Devolved government should not have to use this route for basic statistics. A more consistent approach to data sharing in our relationship with Whitehall is important for public policy in two new areas: Skills devolution The Mayor of London is taking over responsibility for the £306m Adult Education Budget from the government starting in the academic year 2019/20. The devolution provides an opportunity to focus the provision to local needs and innovate. Access to data linking performance at school, employment status, benefits claims and previous accessing of skills training (known as ‘LEO’) would greatly enhance the design of the programme — providing better outcomes and better value for the public purse. Violence reduction The GLA’s new Violence Reduction Unit (VRU) is bringing together specialists from health, police, local government, probation and community organisations to tackle violent crime and the underlying causes of violent crime. In order to reduce violence using a ‘public health approach’ the Unit will need to bring together and develop advanced analytics across a whole range of government services requiring better access to central government public health, NHS and criminal justice service data for London alongside more localised data on social services and emergency service performance. The government should address data sharing with regulated utilities The GLA’s work to bring together future investment, context, capacity, and existing asset data from the water, gas, electricity, transport, and digital connectivity sectors has revealed several barriers to effective data sharing. Utilities are an important part of the picture for our city and it is critical for cities to plan for growth strategically, and for our work on climate change. Proactive infrastructure data-sharing supports a number of outcomes. Sharing forward investment plans with one another allows utilities to identify joint street works collaboration opportunities, which can reduce road network congestion. Sharing utilities’ capacity information with the GLA allows the public sector to ensure strategies are in place to pre-empt potential capacity issues resulting from planned development. Better information on existing network capacity can result in improved design outcomes for developments — e.g. more efficient connections — which could be more strongly encouraged via the planning authority. We can also identify opportunities where utilities can coordinate, by expanding projects such as the London Infrastructure Mapping Application. Current data-sharing arrangements are not adequate, regulators do not have sufficient powers in this field and the business model of infrastructure providers themselves effectively disincentivises investing in their own data capabilities, these include: · addressable concerns about access to the data · difficulty ensuring data accuracy · costs of processing and preparing data for sharing · lack of up-to-date systems for storing and sharing data · challenges around regularly updating the data · multiple parties that require consultation within utilities to prepare and release the data Given digital connectivity is now considered the ‘4th utility’, the National Data Strategy should address obvious gaps such as limited data and poor information-sharing to the government and Ofcom from competing digital infrastructure providers. The current system, which relies on self-reporting to Ofcom, provides an incomplete picture of need and consequently undermines government investment decisions. Finally, a new approach to utility information will encourage better city resilience planning for climate change and identify and reduce problems such as water pollution incidents. In conclusion, we think there should be a common approach across government departments to sharing data. We suggest this includes: · Managing public sector data as an asset, providing evidence to inform policy at national and local level. · Proactively negotiating access to data with departments in way that local organisations are currently not able to, and clarifying the legal status of devolved administrations and cities in relation to data access — often currently caught between central and local government with no access to data held by either. · A comprehensive Application Programming Interface (API) for organisations to access data directly (including authorised ‘attribute exchange’ where specific answers are supplied rather than access to a whole database). · A common approach to applications for central government data, to make this more efficient and reduce the burden as different departments have different approaches. · Make full use of the provisions in the Digital Economy Act for better data sharing. Provide secure access to individual records for all departments and develop longitudinal and linked outputs that can be made available through the ONS Secure Research Services. This is an overdue discussion for government — we’d be interested to hear the views of data users, institutions and Londoners generally on how we can shape this approach further."
Medium.com,Society,Playing politics: Trump and Netanyahu risk sparking nuclear arms race,World,https://medium.com/the-turbulent-world-of-middle-east-soccer/playing-politics-trump-and-netanyahu-risk-sparking-nuclear-arms-race-2e86f647ac8a?source=topic_page---------739------------------1," By James M. Dorsey A podcast version of this story is available on Soundcloud, Itunes, Spotify, Stitcher, TuneIn, Spreaker, Pocket Casts, Tumblr, Podbean and Castbox. Afghan president Ashraf Ghani may not be the only one to have welcomed US President Donald J. Trump’s cancellation of peace talks with the Taliban. Probably, so did Prime Minister Binyamin Netanyahu in the run-up to this month’s Israeli elections. The cancellation likely reduces fears harboured in recent weeks by Mr. Netanyahu and the Israeli intelligence community that the US president may reverse his hardline on Iran and seek to negotiate a resolution of differences with his Iranian counterpart, Hassan Rouhani. Israeli fears were sparked by Mr. Trump’s repeated expression of interest in meeting with Mr. Rouhani, talks on the margins of last month’s gathering of Group of Seven leaders in Biarritz between French president Emmanuel Macron and Iranian foreign minister Mohammad Javad Zarif, and Mr. Trump’s last-minute pullback in June from launching a military strike against Iran. Mr. Trump reiterated his willingness to talk to Mr. Rouhani a day after the cancellation and hours after Mr. Netanyahu sought to prove that Iran had been violating the 2015 international agreement designed to curb it’s nuclear ambitions. The president told reporters that he had no objections to negotiating face-to-face with Mr. Rouhani. “Sure, anything’s possible. They would like to be able to solve their problem. We could solve it in 24 hours,” Mr. Trump said. Mr. Netanyahu probably saw Mr. Trump’s firing on Tuesday of his national security advisor John Bolton, one of the Israeli leader’s foremost soul mates in the administration when it came to Iran, as another worrisome sign. International Crisis Group Iran expert Ali Vaez voiced Mr. Netanyahu’s worst fears by describing Mr. Bolton’s departure as “an opportunity for de-escalation.” Nevertheless, Mr. Netanyahu and Israeli intelligence were likely to draw two conclusions from the cancellation of the Taliban talks. If Mr. Trump’s withdrawal in May of last year from the 2015 nuclear agreement, despite a consensus that the Islamic republic was abiding by the accord, convinced Iranians that the United States could not be trusted to honour its commitments, cancelling talks with the Taliban has highlighted the risks of engaging with the US president. As a result, Mr. Rouhani, a strong proponent of the nuclear accord who was weakened by Mr. Trump’s withdrawal and has since been on the defensive against Iranian hardliners, is likely to be even more hesitant to engage with Mr. Trump. That is what Mr. Netanyahu, betting on Mr. Rouhani’s track record in recent weeks, will count on. Mr. Rouhani initially last month expressed willingness to meet Mr. Trump without preconditions, but subsequently toughened his position by insisting that the United States first lift harsh economic sanctions imposed on Iran after the US withdrawal from the nuclear accord. Mr. Rouhani told the Iranian parliament a day before Mr. Trump’s latest overture and on the same day that the US president cancelled the Taliban talks that Iran’s response to American advances would “always be negative.” The cancellation is also likely to reinforce Iranian supreme leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei’s deep-rooted distrust of the United States. Mr. Netanyahu and Israeli intelligence are likely to draw a second conclusion from the cancellation prompted by the Taliban’s continued attacks despite peace talks that last week killed a US soldier and 11 others. Mr. Trump’s declaration that the talks were ‘dead’ raised the spectre of a president reluctant to embroil the United States in further military conflict ramping up operations in Afghanistan to counter anticipated Taliban activity. In an effort to fortify his perceived, regained advantage and distract attention from setbacks in his electoral campaign, Mr. Netanyahu charged in a short, televised address on Monday that Iran’s ‘duplicitous’ regime had been secretly developing nuclear weapons at a hitherto unknown site near Abadeh, south of the city of Isfahan. Mr. Netanyahu asserted that Iran had destroyed the site once it realized that Israel had discovered it. Mr. Zarif, the Iranian foreign minister, denied the Israeli allegations. Analysts charged that Mr. Netanyahu was recycling dated information in a blurring of the lines between his electoral needs and Israel’s true security concerns. “In the way Netanyahu presents things…there is a whiff of manipulation; contrary to what one might understand from his remarks, this was an Iranian violation from the period before the nuclear agreement, which went into effect in January 2015,” said Amos Harel, a columnist for Haaretz newspaper. In attempting to persuade the Israeli electorate that he is the Israeli leader with the security credentials needed to protect Israel from the likes of Iran, stiffen US resolve to force Iran on its knees, and convince other nations that Iran is the source of all evil, Mr. Netanyahu risks not only escalating tension in the Middle East but also sparking a regional nuclear arms race. Mr. Netanyahu’s assertions threaten to reinforce Saudi resolve to match whatever advances Iran may make. Saudi Arabia’s newly appointed oil minister Prince Abdulaziz bin Salman, in his first remarks since being appointed this week, said that the kingdom wanted to push ahead with the full cycle of its nuclear program, including the production and enrichment of uranium for atomic fuel. Iran in recent weeks has gradually breached the limits set on its enriched-uranium stockpile by the nuclear agreement and installed advanced centrifuges in a bid to force Europe to take effective steps to shield it against the full impact of US sanctions and prevent the collapse of the accord. Turkish prime minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan, in an indication that a regional nuclear arms race could spiral out of control, this month demanded the right for his country to develop a nuclear military capability. Not to mention that a nuclear arms race could prompt Israel, the Middle East’s so far only, albeit undeclared nuclear power, to enhance its capabilities to maintain its strategic edge. Said Gulf scholar Luciano Zaccara: “With its ill-advised policies in the Gulf, the Trump administration is not only encouraging a nuclear race in the region…but it is also undermining the international non-proliferation regime…. In the current volatile situation in the Middle East…the lack of a robust non-proliferation agreement will encourage a nuclear race in the region and increase the chances of pre-emptive military attacks that could lead to large-scale war.” The same could be said for Mr. Netanyahu’s approach.

Rajaratnam School of International Studies, an adjunct senior research fellow at the National University of Singapore’s Middle East Institute and co-director of the University of Wuerzburg’s Institute of Fan Culture"
Medium.com,Society,Bahamian Refugees Rejected From US Rescue Ferry Over Visa Confusion,World,https://medium.com/citizen-truth/bahamian-refugees-rejected-from-us-rescue-ferry-over-visa-confusion-9ae412b02ab2?source=topic_page---------740------------------1," Hundreds of Hurricane Dorian survivors were told to disembark a ferry in Freeport, Grand Bahamas bound for Fort Lauderdale, Florida on Sunday after days on the devastated island with limited water, food, and power. While almost 1,500 Bahamian refugees were ultimately processed in Florida by Customs and Border Control on Saturday, the incident Sunday represents confusion over the official policy on welcoming Dorian survivors. At least 44 people were killed by the category five hurricane with thousands estimated to be missing and at least 70,000 people left homeless. Customs and Border Patrol blamed the ferry company for telling the Bahamians to evacuate, according to Brian Entin, a reporter who witnessed the situation: “If those folks did stay on the boat and arrived, we would have processed them,” an official told Entin. “They were not ordered off the boat by any government entity.” The private ferry company, however, said U.S. authorities told them that visas would be required for entry into the U.S., according to Entin. “At the last minute like this,” Renard Oliver, a Bahamian refugee with his child, told a reporter with the Miami television station WSVN, “It’s hurtful because I’m watching my daughters cry, but it is what it is.” On Monday Acting Customs and Border Control head Mark Morgan sought to comfort distressed Bahamians after the incident: “This is a humanitarian mission,” said Morgan. “If your life is in jeopardy and you’re in the Bahamas … you’re going to be allowed to come to the United States, whether you have travel documents or not.” He said the processing would be handled expeditiously. President Trump seemed to contradict Morgan’s assurance later the same day, arguing that “very bad people” could exploit the process and warned against welcoming Bahamians. “We have to be very careful,” Trump said. “Everybody needs totally proper documentation. Because, look, the Bahamas had some tremendous problems with people going to the Bahamas that weren’t supposed to be there.” “I don’t want to allow people that weren’t supposed to be in the Bahamas to come into the United States — including some very bad people and very bad gang members,” Trump added. Florida Senator Rick Scott urged officials to clarify the rules on visas and respond to the crisis in a rapid and organized manner. “As hundreds of thousands of Bahamians seek refuge or start to rebuild after Hurricane Dorian, we cannot have the kind of confusion that occurred last night in Freeport,” said Senator Scott. Scientists have long warned that climate change will increase the intensity and frequency of extreme weather events. Studies have shown that the relatively poor global south will face harsher consequences than the wealthy global north, exacerbating refugee crises and political polarization. Critics argue catastrophic storms like Hurricane Maria in Puerto Rico, Cyclone Idai in Mozambique, and Hurricane Dorian in the Bahamas represent some of these intensified storms and warn they will continue to destroy vulnerable societies, leaving victims at the mercy of wealthy governments.

Higgins. Both share a love of ancient Greek poetry and alternated reciting lines from the same poem until Mr Johnson broke off in silence. Boris Johnson’s love of classics began early in his life, and he went on to study ancient history and literature at the University of Oxford. After graduating, he took up jobs as a journalist, a political commentator, an MP, Mayor of London, Foreign Secretary and now Prime Minister. It is a rise that would satisfy a young Boris Johnson who sais his life’s ambition was to be ‘world king’. It was a route to power, however, beset by scandals, including conspiring to get a journalist beaten up, racist and bigoted remarks, and accusations of a lack of competence, work ethic and seriousness. None of those accusations held him back from reaching his goals. But the downfall of Boris Johnson may be only a few weeks away."

Medium.com,Society,Boris Johnson’s Biggest Mistake,World,https://medium.com/@francisjrtaylor/boris-johnsons-biggest-mistake-cc41e496ce8c?source=topic_page---------746------------------1," In the last few weeks, Boris Johnson has said and done a great number of outrageous things. He’s launched a successful bid to suspend parliament, expelled 21 Conservative MPs for defying the party and called the opposition leader Jeremy Corbyn a “chlorinated chicken”. And yet, it is one of his more reasonable actions that might prove his downfall. In his recent meeting with the Irish Prime Minister Leo Varadkar, Johnson admitted that a no-deal Brexit would be “a failure of statecraft”. He also softened his rhetoric on the matter of the Irish backstop — a mechanism that prevents a hard border between northern and southern Ireland. Even though he considers the backstop “anti-democratic”, he maintained that an open border in Ireland was necessary. But to many Brexiters, this came off like an unacceptable concession. Nigel Farage, who leads the right-wing Brexit Party, criticized the Prime Minister for dialing back his aggressive approach. Claiming Johnson wants to hive off Northern Ireland from the rest of the UK, he argued that a “clean break Brexit” was the only way forward. This sentiment was echoed by thousands of people over social media. And there is reason to believe this outrage won’t stay confined to Twitter. The Conservative base largely consists of people who want to leave the European Union. Several polls indicate that nearly 75% of these voters support a no-deal Brexit — that is, a result that would force the UK to leave the EU’s single market and customs union overnight. Johnson’s do-or-die attitude to Brexit can definitely be credited for winning them over. On several occasions he’s declared his willingness to leave the EU without a deal if a compromise can’t be reached by the 31st of October. And so far, this has allowed him to peel away voters from the Brexit Party. But Johnson’s recent comments imply a shift towards a Brexit deal much more in line with Theresa May’s original proposal. And such a decision would cost him dearly in the polls. The former Prime Minister’s plan, which involved a customs arrangement with the EU, was deeply unpopular with Brexiters. If Johnson’s plan so much as resembles it, he will lose a considerable chunk of the electorate."

However, instead of enjoying a celebratory mood, the band was met by an incredible campaign of misrepresentation and misinformation lead by religious figures in Lebanon calling for the cancellation of the concert due to ‘blasphemous’ content in the music and the band’s support for gay rights (the band’s lead singer is openly gay). The campaign, coupled with the reactionary nature of most Lebanese — reinforced and propagated by Lebanon’s confessional system — led to threats of violence against would-be concert attendees and band members themselves including direct death threats. Citing these threats, Festival organizers decided to cancel the show. Many hoped that the Lebanese state would interfere on the side of the band and put an end to these wild accusations. Instead, the band members were asked to come in for questioning around two songs they released several years ago and implemented an internet ban on a set of their songs. The band was also asked to apologize for causing offence and inciting religious ‘friction’. Furthermore, security forces made no statements regarding general security in response to threats against concert-goers or band members. The reaction to both the state’s handling of the situation and the Festivals decision to cancel was swift. Dutch group Within Temptation cancelled their scheduled performance at the Festival in solidarity with Mashrou’ Leila, and international Cello player Yo-Yo Ma played a tribute to Mashrou’ Leila during his performance at the same festival. International organizations such as Human Rights Watch and Amnesty International also came out with statements condemning the Lebanese State with failing to uphold principles of freedom of expression. Protests also ensued and a ‘protest concert’ was scheduled and put on in Beirut in support of the band with many people also taking to social media to voice their discontent. A month after this episode, however, and all seems to have been forgotten, those initially galvanized have become silent. It would be too easy to say that no one wants to do anything beyond securely protest on a screen, but this would be fallacious. With the absence of a sustained political or social campaign towards greater freedoms, individuals have nothing to stand behind but sudden and reactive campaigns of support. It’s also important to remember that this is not the first time that the state has acted in a manner that either allowed for or directly led to the suppression of the voice of minorities in Lebanon. Last year, Beirut Pride was cancelled after the detention of one of its organizers. It’s worth noting here that Beirut Pride was intentionally slated as a series of events and workshops in an attempt to fly under the radar and avoid the sensitivities of the state which would not be so easy to do if a pride parade, as is the norm elsewhere, was scheduled. We would also be remiss to forget the water cannons, tear gas, and arrests used in 2015 to completely smother protests and other forms of direct action taken to protest against the garbage crisis. State suppression is not just aimed at Lebanese citizens. While the Mashrou’ Leila fiasco was unfolding, the Lebanese parliament also passed a new labour law that effectively stripped the rights of Palestinian refugees to work in Lebanon. This came as a consequence of Lebanon’s crackdown on illegal foreign labour mostly aimed at demonizing Syrian refugees who have already had to deal with years of racist ‘Cerfews’ imposed by several Municipalities. It’s not always the state doing the suppression, just as in the case of Mashou’ Leila, threats of violence did not come from the state but from thuggish followers of the political parties who supported the claims made against the band. This is not too dissimilar from an event that took place a few years ago where a protester was killed by an organized mob of party supporters sent out to intimidate those participating in an anti-Iran protest. The same dynamics were also seen in the 2015 garbage crisis protests were roving groups on mopeds harassed protestors. Many may not see a clear line connecting all of these examples, but they are all cases of the state — and the different factions that make up the state — exerting its influence to maintain its position of power. Indeed, one cannot understand the ruling class without understanding the interlocking of religious institutions with political parties which have emerged as the status quo since Lebanese independence. This interlocking needs to be seen as part of historical progress where the current system of confessional power-sharing known as the ‘national pact’ is seen as emergent from colonial uses of confessionalism to exert influence on the region. Where colonial use of confessionalism was used to extract resources from Lebanon, contemporary confessionalism is used by the ruling class to partition and distribute local resources among itself. It is for this reason that any threat to religious institutions is seen as a threat to the state system as a whole, and why what seems as contradictions between the responsibility of the state and individual actors within the state — such as mob violence — are not only permitted and tolerated but at times encouraged. After Mashrou’ Leila’s concert was cancelled they released a song by the name of Radio Romance. The music video for the song opens with the line ‘love is resistance’. This sentiment is not novel to Mashrou’ Leila, it is a slogan that has been used across the world mirroring the ascendance of right-wing parties and xenophobia. The concept, however, remains nominally liberal and abstract. ‘Fighting hate with love’ means nothing to those being immediately suppressed and subjected to violence. Although it may inspire perseverance in the sense that ‘so far as we continue to love, hate has not won’ but it is, in this same way, passive and defeatist in that it offers little in how to fight against suppression and violence itself or how to bypass it altogether. additionally, it depends on the duality of suppression to even mean anything at all. This passive and nonconfrontational perspective of ‘resistance’ can also be seen in the overall liberal reaction to confessional politics that emphasises the use of parliamentary politics to wrestle with the system. Here, several contradictions emerge. The first is that these movements recognize the existence of a ruling class, yet somehow continue to appeal to the machination of this ruling class — the government — to help uphold rights that contradict its interest. The second is the belief that by engaging the general population through electorism and on the terms set out by the ruling class that change can be achieved. Attempts at this have so far been disastrous with what little galvanization achieved during the 2018 elections, and the cheap attempt of unification of ‘civil society’, completely dissipating. What this strategy has been successful in doing, though, is revealing the existence of this ruling class and their willingness to work together to neutralize any threat, something that directly contradicts individual party claims of preserving minority power positions. This is not to say that electoral politics should be abandoned altogether, rather, that electoral politics should be one component of a multifaceted strategy that engages directly with the material needs of individuals in a strategy that understands that democracy does not start and stop with elections. By engaging directly with the material needs of individuals on a local level, a movement can build grass-root power bypassing both the need to engage/seek approval from the state and build solidarity that defuses the effectiveness of state suppression. No doubt building such a movement in and of itself will be seen as a threat to the ruling class and violence will be utilized par the course. This means that for this movement to be successful, it will also need to drop any fear of confrontation and adopt values of defensive violence. Only then can the solidarity needed to support those like Mashrou’ Leila and other minorities be possible. But what would building this movement entail? and what should be placed at its centre? The movement should be built on two key ideals, democracy and solidarity. Democracy is key to rebuilding the efficacy of a disenfranchised population and the building of a parallel system of self-governance. It will also help shed the current elitism and classism displayed by the so-called civil society. Solidarity, on the other hand, will help redraw social dynamics away from confessional lines and along the economic lines found between the ruling class and all the people including other minorities such as foreign workers. Solidarity would also mean recognizing the alignment of interests when spontaneous mobilizations — such as road closures due to power outages or other problems — occur and identifying them not as backward activities, but as reactive cries of frustration similar to the outbursts witnessed after the cancellation of Mashrou’ Laila’s concert. In short, then, a sustained movement needs to be built on a political dedication to absolute democracy running in parallel to the current state apparatus, and a social principle of solidarity that seeks to consolidate diverse outbursts of revolt and expressions of frustration into a sustained movement."
Medium.com,Society,Xenophobia: This is not a time to play ‘big brother’ by Oke Umurhohwo,World,https://medium.com/@stalyf/xenophobia-this-is-not-a-time-to-play-big-brother-by-oke-umurhohwo-8e113dc37296?source=topic_page---------750------------------1," The gory pictures coming from South Africa are disheartening and disturbing. South Africa that many Africa nations fought hard to free from the firm grip of apartheid are now hounding those nationals in violent attacks that are spread across the country. Many Nigerians in that country have been displaced and had their shops looted by the rampaging arsonists. Some were unlucky to escape the xenophobic attacks and have their bodies brutalized or even killed. That is the sad fate thousands of Nigerians in South Africa have suffered in the last few days. But this isn’t the first time such barbaric acts are happening. 11 years ago, precisely 2008, South Africa launched a massive xenophobic attack on foreigners, with the aftermath of the incident leaving thousands of people displaced and more than 60 people killed. Ever since then, South Africa has made it a habit to unnecessarily spill the blood of foreigners and their government has done little or nothing to protect those targeted for violence because of their geographic origins. But why the violence? Their reasoning is as shallow as their despicable acts. They hinged their unreasonable action to foreigners taking up jobs that should have gone to them. However, what they failed to accept, is that it’s their laziness that is robbing them of opportunities and not the hardworking foreigners who are contributing to economic activities that are sustaining their country. Worst of is the disproportionate spread of the violence. To the South Africans, most of whom are of Zulu ethnic stock, black foreign nationals in their country are parasites and should be pushed out with force but migrants of other continents are welcomed. What a retarded and absurd line of thought? Is this the same South Africa that blood, sweat, and resources were committed to in order to end apartheid and enthroned self-rule. From the poor responses of the government, especially the Police, it’s unmistakable to conclude that the South African authorities are culpable in this xenophobic violence. Arsonists and criminal elements flag the streets with dangerous weapons to kill, maim and destroy but you hardly find law enforcement agents doing anything to protect foreign nationals who are prone to attacks. At times, the South African official’s disposition to xenophobic violence emboldened their nationals to keep up with the dastard acts. Look at the unabashed rhetoric of the South Africa High Commissioner to Nigeria, Bobby Monre, that the xenophobic attacks in his country were ‘sporadic acts of violence’. In essence, he was trying to play down realities that black foreign nationals were hounded and attacked by his people as he maintained that businesses belonging to other South Africans were also affected in the violence. He probably believed he could explain away the atrocities being perpetrated by his kinsmen or he was counting for weakness, the simplicity and generosity of Nigeria to other African countries. Since Nigeria got her Independence in 1960, it has been a strong pillar of support for other African countries, including South Africa where Nigeria spent over $61 billion to get it and others out from the grip of apartheid. Beyond monetary contributions, Nigeria fought its erstwhile colonial master, the British government, over its support for apartheid rule in South Africa and took over the assets of British Petroleum, which had at that time control nearly 70% of Nigerian upstream sector. This was in 1979 and the then Head of State, Olusegun Obasanjo, took the action on behalf of Nigerians to help our African brothers and sisters who were subjected to oppressive rule and humiliating treatment by white supremacist regime in South Africa. But they turnaround to accuse the same Nigerians of “stealing” their opportunities and chase them across streets in South Africa with knives, guns, and destroying their properties, leaving them either dead or displaced. If anyone should talk about ‘stealing’ opportunities from them, it’s Nigerians and not the other way round. Take a look at Nigeria, South African companies dominate critical sectors. From MTN controlling a larger share of Nigeria’s telecommunication market to MultiChoice monopoly of the digital television market. How about ShopRite and Stanbic IBTC Banks? They are South African owned franchises that repatriate billions back to their country yearly. Yet, Nigerians have shown understanding and increasing patronisation of these businesses despite the limited opportunity their dominance leaves for Nigerians operating similar businesses here. The truth is, South Africans are exhibiting their undying appetite for violence and looting because their excuse of anyone ‘stealing’ their opportunities is as ludicrous as their feeble minds. While the response of President Muhammadu Buhari to the attacks on Nigerians have not been too encouraging but there is still enough time to make things right by getting justice for victimized citizens. And the president should not hesitate in exploring punitive measures and options available to him that would guarantee the safety of Nigerians not only in South Africa but elsewhere as the time to play ‘big brother’ is not now.

The rights group suggested that those killed in the airstrikes were pro-Iran Shiite militants and that the military force responsible for the airstrike is still unknown. The airstrike occurred in eastern Syria but no further details were reported, said the group in a statement released Monday. Late on Sunday night, the Al Arabiya TV’s English-language website reported that the Shiite Lebanese militant party of Hezbollah claimed responsibility for gunning down an Israeli unmanned drone that hovered outside Ramyah, a town in southern Lebanon, Monday’s unknown airstrike comes as tension in the region has mounted following last months Israeli air raids in Syria and Iraq. Israel claimed the raids thwarted imminent attacks by Shiite militias, backed by Iran’s revolutionary guard, known as the Al Quds Force. One of the Israeli raids killed two Hezbollah operatives and prompted a limited Hezbollah retaliatory attack on northern Israel earlier this month. Hezbollah claimed that it fired a rocket on an army vehicle inside an Israeli army post. Israel responded with tens of tank shells on southern Lebanon, with no causalities reported on both sides. On Monday, the Israeli online English-language newspaper Haaretz reported that the Israeli army identified a number of failed rocket fires launched from Syria on Sunday towards Israeli territories. The army believed that the launches were carried out by the Al Quds Force, which belongs to Iran and that the Shiite elements operated from the outskirts of Damascus. The online newspaper noted that a statement by the Israeli army held the Syrian regime of President Bashar Al Assad responsible for any such attacks from Syrian territories. American-owned Fox News reported last week that a new Iranian military base, called the Imam Ali compound, was being constructed at the Iraq-Syrian border. Fox News said it independently verified the claim by working with a civilian satellite company to obtain images of the base construction. The base is located near a key Iraq-Syria border crossing. Over the past several weeks, Israel is believed to have carried out multiple airstrikes in Syrian and Iraqi territories targetting alleged pro-Iran military facilities, but Israel has not claimed direct responsibility for them. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has, however, hinted at Israel’s responsibility for the attacks, referring to Israel’s readiness to foil any actions that are intended at the state of Israel and that Israel could expand the scope of its actions in the region.

But such concerns are missing the bigger picture — that while we’ve created a new currency powered by electricity, billions of people still can’t get access to enough energy for the simple things in life, like the power to run a refrigerator, start a business, or create a decent job. The real story — the one about real people — is the mind-blowing chasm of global energy inequality. The debate over bitcoin’s energy use heated up this summer. A German research team calculated the total energy consumption for bitcoin at about 48 terawatt-hours (TWh) per year — or more power than what 3 million Americans use on average. This total was more or less in line with estimates from the International Energy Agency, a Paris-based intergovernmental group considered an authority on energy policy. However, the popular Bitcoin Energy Consumption Index from Digiconomist has pegged bitcoin-related electricity use at a whopping 73 TWh last year. And, if cryptocurrencies become more popular, their energy consumption will rise too. Whatever the right figure, we can thank Ben Geman in Axios for providing some eye-opening context. He argued that carbon emissions from bitcoin mining aren’t likely to matter much since global electricity consumption growth was 900 TWh in 2018 alone. So even if bitcoin is of questionable social and economic value, it’s not a major climate change worry, right? The controversy over the impact of cryptocurrencies, however, highlights a bigger issue around the disparity in the availability of energy between wealthy countries and the rest of the world. According to the California Energy Commission, that state’s residents use about 5 TWh each year just to power their TVs, and another 5 TWh running hot tubs and pools. Using that same report, the New Scientist reported recently that energy consumption for online gaming in California is already at 5 TWh and is expected to spike to 11 TWh by 2021. That’s just for gaming, and just in California. According to the California Energy Commission, that state’s residents use about 5 TWh each year just to power their TVs, and another 5 TWh running hot tubs and pools. The usual way to think about all of these fun activities is that they’re just a rounding error in a vast, modern, energy-intensive economy, which is true. A different takeaway could be that Californians’ pools and video games actually consume more electricity than many entire countries. Here’s a small sample."
