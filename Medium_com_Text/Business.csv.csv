Medium.com,Industry,Why companies fail at Machine Learning,Business,https://medium.com/@pchojecki/why-companies-fail-at-machine-learning-cd4459e00668?source=topic_page---------0------------------1," The key to success with AI is learning what it is and how it works. That doesn’t just include machine learning, but also artificial intelligence, data science and data analysis. Without an understanding of them, it will be difficult to ensure your business is prepared for the future. It still can be difficult to predict the exact outcome of a particular AI scenario, but you’ll be better equipped. A key part of understanding how machine learning works is understanding what a machine learning model is. Here we go: A machine learning model is a set of rules that allow computers to analyse data and then make predictions. Now that we have the basics here’s what machine learning or AI is good for: Now AI can’t be really creative right now — it’s coming but it stills many years away — so if you really want to get something practical for your business where you can save money or boost your profits, you should think about the most boring tasks at your companies. You have the advantage in AI development since you are already working on it, and the less complex things you write the better. You should try to find out what is the most boring tasks you do. Here are the ones I think you should focus on in the first place: • Customer Service (chatbots, automated emails, voicebots) • Sales (cold-calling, sourcing information) • Technical Support and Helpdesk (managing queries) • Logistics and Supply Chain Management (optimization, routing) • Legal and Compliance (sorting documents) • Accounting and Financial Reporting (extracting informations, looking for freuds and anomalies) Those are the basic machine learning tasks you can experiment with at any company. If you’re already there, then a natural step would be progressing in to RPA systems — Robotic Process Automation — which are all about building a more complex automation systems. They can automate almost completely junior-level jobs related to digital tasks. But that’s a different story. Now if you want to start on a data science path, the best way would be ask for help from an expert. This will help you to get started quickly. The process of hiring and developing expert AI engineers is an important part of your business. Before you can hire an expert AI engineer you will need to get a complete technical description of the problems you are trying to solve. This will help you to find out what areas of your system need to be redesigned and how you can best use the AI engineer in your organisation. There are several AI solutions that will help you to build more effective solutions. For companies that are just starting out with AI, it’s a great time to build your team with an AI expert. If you want an external help you can start by writing to me on LinkedIn. I’m running a semi-research consulting business ulam.ai, and I’d be happy to help!"
Medium.com,Industry,The US opens investigation into TikTok’s parent company ByteDance,Business,https://medium.com/@themillennialsource/the-us-opens-investigation-into-tiktoks-parent-company-bytedance-604a614f4e8?source=topic_page---------1------------------1," The US government has launched a national security investigation into TikTok’s owner ByteDance Technology regarding its $1 billion acquisition of the US social media app Musical.ly. ByteDance, a Beijing-based technology giant, acquired Musical.ly in November 2017. At the time, Musical.ly had an estimated 60 million users in the United States and Europe. Less than a year after the acquisition, ByteDance merged Musical.ly with its own similar social app TikTok, which is now one of the world’s most popular social apps with more than 1 billion downloads globally. Although the acquisition took place two years ago, US lawmakers are now raising national security concerns, especially regarding the Chinese company’s possible content censorship and collection of data from its US users. On October 24, US Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer and Senator Tom Cotton requested a national security probe in a letter to Joseph Macguire, acting director of national intelligence. According to Reuters, ByteDance did not seek clearance from the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States (CFIUS) for its acquisition of Musical.ly, which gives the US security panel scope to investigate it now. CFIUS is a government agency that reviews deals with foreign companies to identify potential national security risks. The details of the probe could not be learned due to its confidential nature. Founded in 2012, ByteDance now owns a range of news, video, and selfie apps, most of which are used in China. Thanks to investment from powerhouses such as Japan’s SoftBank Group, ByteDance is now the world’s most valuable startup, with an estimated valuation of more than $75 billion. In the first half of this year, ByteDance reported revenue of $7 to $8.4 billion, according to Reuters. TikTok’s acquisition of and subsequent merger with Musical.ly paved the way for its growth in the US market. According to Apptopia, TikTok’s monthly active US-based users increased by 30 million in the three months following the merger. TikTok is currently the fourth most popular social media app in the US Google Play Store and App Store, following Facebook, Instagram, and Snapchat. The app currently has 26.5 million monthly active users in the US, 60% of whom are between the ages of 16 and 24. Although a Chinese company owns the app, TikTok isn’t available in the Chinese market. Instead, ByteDance operates a separate Chinese version of TikTok, called Douyin. ByteDance stated that TikTok’s operation in the US is independent of its parent company in China. However, TikTok US General Manager Vanessa Pappas told the Washington Post that her manager and Musical.ly co-founder Alex Zhu reports directly to Yiming, ByteDance’s founder. The line of reporting raises the question of whether TikTok is truly free from Beijing’s influence. In 2018, the Cyberspace Administration of China announced a new policy that required detailed logs on users from any internet platform that could be used to “socially mobilize” or lead to “major changes in public opinion.” One national security concern raised is whether the Chinese government has access to the personal data of millions of US TikTok users. According to the Washington Post, ByteDance has said in a statement that US user data is stored domestically. The company also said it had hired US consulting firm Special Counsel to analyze TikTok’s app and where it sent user data. Douglas Brush, who led the analysis for Special Counsel, said that TikTok’s user data, including their names, dates of birth, and other information, was stored exclusively on servers in Virginia and Singapore. Brush added that during his three-month review from July to October this year, which included interviews with TikTok employees and a review of the app’s code, the Special Counsel team found no way TikTok could send data to China during those months. In February this year, TikTok received a $5.7 FTC fine over allegations that its precursor, Musical.ly, illegally collected names, email addresses, pictures, and other data from children younger than 13. ByteDance and TikTok are not participants in the Global Network Initiative (GNI), a collection of companies that have pledged to resist unlawful or unreasonable requests from governments to access user data. The GNI does an annual audit of its members to ensure they’re keeping their promises. ByteDance and TikTok are not subjected to this investigation. In September 2019, the Guardian published leaked internal company guidelines that instructed TikTok moderators to ban videos and topics, similar to the Chinese government’s censorship policies. Among banned topics are the “distortion” of historical events such as the Tiananmen Square incidents, criticism/attack of countries’ policies or social rules, including the socialism system, and discussion of highly controversial topics, which the rules said included the independence of Tibet and Taiwan. According to the Washington Post, ByteDance retired this set of rules in May this year, after the app reached 100 million downloads in the US. The company said that the rules were a relic of TikTok’s early days when they took “a blunt approach” to minimizing conflict. In a press statement, TikTok said that their content moderation policy is not influenced by the Chinese government and that their California-based content moderation team only adheres to the company’s policies for the US. “Let us be very clear: TikTok does not remove content based on sensitivities related to China. We have never been asked by the Chinese government to remove any content, and we would not do so if asked,” the statement says. “TikTok does not operate in China, nor do we have any intention of doing so in the future.” TikTok’s content moderation policy is not public. According to the Washington Post, some former TikTok employees said that the strict content rules would minimize the anger and negativity often seen on social media. TikTok wanted to remain a place for light and positive videos, where political disputes were banned, and social discussions were fun. However, the app still raised censorship concerns after news reports highlighted that the Hong Kong protests were rarely mentioned on the app and that TikTok moderators were told to censor videos that featured political themes, not just those related to China. Among content being censored are videos featuring scantily clad women, suggestive dancing, heavy kissing, vaping, and political content — even if it includes constructive discussion unrelated to Chinese politics. Former TikTok employees told The Washington Post that flagged videos were either deleted or blocked from appearing on the streams where most videos are seen and shared. In October, TikTok said in a press statement that it was working with the law firm K&L Gates on its moderation policies. The NY Times reported that the Trump administration and many US lawmakers saw Chinese companies’ success in the US market as a threat to national security. As a result, they have set up barriers to prevent Chinese firms from acquiring American data and technology. Last year, the US blocked the merger between Moneygram and Alibaba’s payment affiliate Ant Financial. President Trump has also blocked Huawei and other Chinese tech firms from purchasing American products due to national security and human rights concerns. Additionally, he has also imposed tariffs on more than $360 billion of Chinese products in a trade war."
Medium.com,Industry,Is Walgreens doomed? — Market Mad House,Business,https://medium.com/datadriveninvestor/is-walgreens-doomed-market-mad-house-86c75379c533?source=topic_page---------2------------------1," Drugstore Goliath Walgreens Boots Alliance (NASDAQ: WBA) scared Mr. Market with hints of going private last week. To explain, the rumor mill claims Walgreens CEO Stefano Pessina has been talking to private-equity firms about a leveraged buyout (LBO) of the world’s largest drugstore operator. Barron’s speculates that Pessina has hired a banker to handle the LBO. MaretWatch estimates the potential value of a Walgreens LBO at $70 billion. However, Yahoo! Finance estimated Walgreens had a Market Cap of $55.561 billion on 11 November 2019. Thus, a Walgreens LBO could be one of the biggest deals in years on Wall Street. Bloomberg claims private equity giant KKR & Co is offering $70 billion for Walgreens. Bloomberg estimates the KKR & Co offer for Walgreens could be the biggest private LBO yet. Thus, Pessina, Walgreen’s largest shareholder, could make money from that deal. Pessina could be interested an LBO because he thinks Mr. Market undervalues Walgreens stock. The company’s share price is low. Traders paid $62.25 for Walgreens (NASDQ: WBA) shares on November 11, 2019. Pessina; the largest Walgreens shareholder, is 78 years old so he could want to retire. In particular, Pessina could be sick of pharmacy industry headaches such as falling prescription prices, political pressures, and popular anger at high drug prices. Troubles Pessina could want to escape include; the never-ending Brexit nightmare in the UK, and rising demands for single-payer healthcare (Medicare for All) in the United States. Currently, Walgreens Boots Alliance owns 2,465 stores in the United Kingdom and 9,244 drugstores in the United States. Walgreens’ troubles in the United States are growing. Notably, the company plans to close 200 American drugstores, CNBC claims. CNBC describes the closures as a “cost-cutting move.” Dramatically, The Washington Post accuses Walgreens of distributing 13 billion oxycodone and hydrocodone pills across America between 2006 and 2012. To clarify, oxycodone and hydrocodone are highly addictive; opium-based, painkillers critics blame for America’s opioid crisis. Tellingly, in 2013, Walgreens paid a $80 million fine to the Drug Enforcement Agency (DEA). The Post claims, the DEA accused of Walgreens of knowingly selling oxycodone and hydrocodone to criminals who sold it on the black market. Walgreens is a defendant in a federal lawsuit against opioid distributors in Ohio. In the suit, two county governments accuse Walgreens and other companies of knowingly flooding their communities with opioid pain killers. Tellingly, Walgreens is not participating in a settlement between two Ohio counties and opioid distributors. Walgreens denies the allegations. However, Walgreens stopped the internal distribution of controlled substances; including opioids, to its drugstores in 2014. It’s easy to see why Pessina could want out. The drugstore business is increasingly unpopular and controversial. However, Walgreens (NASDAQ: WBA) makes money from its drugstores. Walgreens reported a quarterly gross profit of $7.227 billion on 31 August 2019. Walgreens made that gross profit off quarterly revenues of $33.954 billion. However, Walgreens’ quarterly revenues were down from $34.591 billion on 31 May 2019. Yet, Stockrow estimates Walgreens revenue growth rate at 1.53% for last quarter. On the other hand, Walgreens’ income is falling. For instance, Walgreens; quarterly net income fell from $1.025 billion on 31 May 2019 to $667 million on 31 August 2019. In addition, operating income fell from $1.218 billion on 31 May 2019 to $983 million three months later. In contrast, Walgreens’ cash flow is growing. Walgreens’ operating cash grew to $2.379 billion in August 2019 from $2.02 billion in May 2019. Plus, the free cash flow grew from $1.567 billion to 1.923 billion in the same period. However, Walgreens had just $1.023 billion in cash and equivalents on 31 August 2019. Thus, Walgreens has a low margin of safety and falling levels of cash. Interestingly, Walgreens is losing value. The value of Walgreens’ total assets fell from $70.434 billion on 28 February 2019 to $68.586 billion on 31 May 2019 to $67.598 billion on 31 May 2019. Meanwhile, Walgreens reported total current liabilities of $25.769 billion and total debts of $16.836 billion on 31 August 2019. Thus, Walgreens’ assets are losing value while its debts are growing. Thus another reason Pessina could think of selling out is that he thinks pharmacies are less profitable. Notably, that profit is falling when Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN) is stepping up its game. Amazon already directly competes with Walgreens in categories like cosmetics, perfumes, toiletries, and cleaning supplies. Now, Amazon is eyeing the drugstore business with its PillPack subsidiary. PillPack ships prescriptions to customers. Moreover, Amazon is offering free one-day delivery on $2 items, Money claims. Hence, Amazon is trying to compete directly with neighborhood retailers like drugstores. Tellingly, the free shipping items at Amazon Money describes sound like a Walgreens’ shopping list. Items you can now order with free shipping from Amazon include: a $1.54 box of Huggies wipes, a $1.83 tube of Colgate toothpaste, a $2.48 package of Extra gum, and a $3 bag of cotton balls. Walgreens sells all those items. Hence, Amazon Prime customers no longer have any reason to go Walgreens’ and other neighborhood stores. Consequently, one of Pessina’s big fears could be a large drop in foot traffic because of Amazon. Many investors like Walgreens (NASDAQ: WBA) because it has historically been a good dividend stock. For instance, Dividend.com estimates Walgreens dividends have grown for 43 years straight. Correspondingly, the next scheduled Walgreens dividend is 46₵; scheduled for 15 November 2019. Walgreens’ investors received a dividend yield of 3.12%, an annualized payout of $1.83, and a payout ratio of 33.55% on 11 November 2019. In the final analysis, Walgreens is a good low-cost dividend stock. Hence, Walgreens is a value investment, but it is a company that shows how unstable and risky the retail environment has become. Amazon is disrupting the entire retail ecosystem and threatening historically-stable brands that have been long term money makers. Hence, investors need to be careful with retail stocks these days. Even the best retailers face disruption and doom in the Age of Amazon."
Medium.com,Industry,Why Aspiring Luxury Brands Should Try to Fake It Till They Make It,Business,https://medium.com/better-marketing/why-aspiring-luxury-brands-should-try-to-fake-it-till-they-make-it-c2ece88c8416?source=topic_page---------4------------------1," You might notice from niche to large brands tend to become more expensive over time. What once was a clothing label for everyone, slowly becomes more and more out of reach for the average consumer. That may in part be due to rising costs of running their business. Otherwise, it’s because they are becoming more popular and are just reflecting that fact in their prices. So the law of supply and demand applies. But another reason can be that they are intentionally repositioning their product so that they can get the most out of their brand. This isn’t always a bad thing since they will have to continue to focus on quality or nobody will believe they are a real luxury. But the good thing is that brands don’t have to be big to gain traction as a more exclusive brand. There is a good argument for even small companies to use the luxury angle. This allows them to focus on quality — especially when starting out — while still keeping their profit margins. In this article, I will go over some of the research and ways companies can transition to more exclusivity or provide a temporary increase in short term revenue. People’s brains are wired to want things that are rare or harder to come by. We are triggered by some ancient design to have the most beautiful, richest, and charismatic partner we can get. That same logic extends to material objects we can attain. Brands everywhere know this, and they can use it to signal to the customer they are the best. The crux of the signals that expensive luxury brands send to the customer is: our product is difficult to possess and is, therefore, more desirable. So then can a company transition into a more luxury brand preception? It depends on how well known the brand is. One study tested this tactic to see if it were at all possible. They did this by measuring an estimate of sales of new cars. They categorized them based on their market share: cheaper or average brands. They both had a high market share since their lower price makes them more available. Luxury brands held the lower take of the market overall. For the products that had an average market share and were non-premium products, advertising the product to seem more luxurious did improve their short term sales. However, If the product was non-premium, but it had a high market share, then it would actually decrease the short term sales. That makes sense since probably nobody believes that they are being straight with them The author’s aims weren’t to get into why this might be happening. One possible reason, however, is that high market share is related to a higher perceived value. Since most people need value in their car, making the most popular vehicle seem more exclusive might not work to their strengths. If the aim is to provide better quality, then a shift in your pricing to become more exclusive will help. It will eventually, over time, no matter what your share of the market is. You could make the argument that this is what happened with Mcdonalds. When I was a kid, the meals were really cheap and very unhealthy. They are still unhealthy, but they got rid of the play places that smelled like plastic vomit. So, updating the look and adding a coffee bar makes you feel like the price increase makes sense. In some of the various fashion companies that I have worked in, retail prices would go up, and we were expected to lead with marketing accordingly. For example, getting into bigger fashion shows and sending out ads in more exclusive publications. That was all part of refocusing on a new segment. It was also to make sure our pricing was in line with our ads and quality. These are all key aspects to consider when you are scaling up your brand perception. With long-term advertisements that held the luxury angle, positive brand perception rose with higher-priced products, but not for low priced products. That follows the previous research in that area but also makes perfect sense. This argument could be made: that the effect happening with brand equity is that eventually, people will adopt the idea that a product is more luxurious. I can personally attest to this by simply sitting in economy plus. Flying used to be all about the business or first class. But on a recent company trip to Budapest, I was amazed to see how into economy plus people were. They were really getting into the wine tasting and were in heaven with the extra legroom and extra slight recline. There is a legitimate sense by some that they have moved up in the world. To some extent, they have, but credit is due to airlines that quiet negative perceptions that we were all talking about just a few years ago. The smaller and less market share a brand holds means a higher benefit in the short term from marketing their product as a luxury. If the transition isn’t met by actually making it worth the extra prices, then only expect a short term boost in sales. If, on the other hand, your product already holds a pretty high market share, then there isn’t any benefit. It might even hurt your sales. That all makes sense at face value and also shows that smaller brands have more agility to grow into themselves."
Medium.com,Industry,The Original Impact Investing: Faith-Based Funds,Business,https://medium.com/swlh/the-original-impact-investing-faith-based-funds-factor-tilt-or-marketing-ploy-89416b076d54?source=topic_page---------5------------------1," F
aith-based funds were founded in the past few decades by a wave of social-financial entrepreneurs to help religious folks, a group who has struggled to find belonging in the capital markets, navigate financial markets. These companies have increased their assets under management (AUM) by over 33% in the past five years; this while AUM for active managers as a whole have declined. Moreover, the returns of these church-going, Shariah-compliant investors have outperformed their benchmarks year-to-date by over one-thousand basis points (ten percentage points) in some cases. Institutional investors looking for the next outperforming factor might just need to take a leap of faith. But questions remain whether faith-based investment strategies are as differentiated as they say they are from traditional, secular strategies. The debate rages whether faith-based strategies act under their fiduciary responsibility to the client to provide a values-based approach to stewardship or if they purely focus on maximizing returns; moreover, if faith-based investing even provides actual alpha over their benchmarks or whether it actually take on more risk because their holdings are less diversified. These social-financial entrepreneurs could just be wolves in sheep’s clothing selling snake oil to gullible investors. Ultimately, finding answers to these questions might give us a deeper understanding of other forms of mission-focused, values-based, impact investing strategies that have captured the attention of the world. Professor Cleveland Justis, who teaches Social Entrepreneurship at Berkeley-Haas School of Business, says that impact investing is at the forefront of social entrepreneurship — shaping both the future of social enterprises and social financial entrepreneurship. This topic hits at the core of what social entrepreneurship is and its limitations thus far. If “Social Entrepreneurship is an[y] innovative, social-value-creating activity,” according to Jane Wei-Skillern, a Senior Fellow at the Berkeley-Haas School of Business, what does the data tell us about the social-value-creating impact of faith-based investing? First, a little history. Faith-based investing was the original impact investing. Its roots stem from the colonial era when Quakers and other puritanical sects sought a way to align their stewardship with their values. Since then, faith-based investment managers have increased their assets under management to $28 billion across 150 funds, according to InvestmentNews. These funds have done good for their investors over the past year. Ave Maria Rising Dividend Fund (AVEDX), which claims to invest in high-dividend-yielding businesses that are Pro-Life, has increased 21.73% year-to-date. The equivalent benchmark tracked by Lipper was up only 11.9% year-to-date, according to Investment News. Amana Growth (AMIGX), a fund that invests in Shariah-Compliant businesses, was up 29.8% this year, the top performer on Morningstar’s list of best-performing Shariah-Compliant Funds. Source: Saturna Capital Saturna Capital, an investment company that manages both secular mutual funds and those adhering to Sharia Law, reported a $484 million increase in assets in fiscal year 2019 with 95% of that increase coming from investments following Islamic principles, according to Saturna’s 2019 Annual Report. This more than 10% increase in assets under management follows a year of significant outperformance on the part of Saturna’s four Amana funds. This increase in assets under management also benefits from larger, secular trends. According to PwC, “Perhaps the single most important factor behind the powerful growth of the Shariah-compliant funds industry lies in the simple fact that Muslims represent about a quarter of the world’s population,” yet less than 1% of financial assets are Shariah-compliant. As young Muslims in developing countries begin to save, Shariah-compliant funds have the potential to grow between 15–20% a year. At
a cursory glance, the outperformance is justified. Companies that are values-oriented have a good rapport in the communities they operate, which reduces employee turnover and increase ability to execute on strategic change and make long-term investments. When constituent companies outperform, funds with a larger percentage of their portfolios invested in these stocks also outperform — in theory. Source: Maks F. S. Faith-based funds have actually underperformed their benchmarks over the past decade. Amana Growth (AMIGX), the biggest outperformer on Morningstar’s list of Shariah-compliant funds last year, has lagged the S&P 500 by 150 basis points (1.5 percentage points) per year over the past 33 years. Cumulatively, that 1.5 percentage point underperformance has cost its investors $860 for every $100 invested over the 33-year life of the fund. In an industry as cutthroat as investment management, the Amana funds are just one example of the stickiness of faith-based assets. In periods of outperformance, faith-based assets attract capital. In periods of underperformance, faith-based assets rarely decrease in assets for two primary reasons: 1) faith-based investors are typically retail investors who are “less-sophisticated,” and 2) advisers and managers are able to explain away the underperformance as the cost of being missions-oriented. “If people are really interested in faith-based investing, a difference of 10 or 12 basis points is not that much if you’re avoiding things you don’t want to invest in,” said Shane Morrow, managing partner at IronBridge Wealth Counsel, an advisory firm that offers clients “mission-driven” portfolios alongside traditional strategies. The second reason is more pernicious because a couple basis points of underperformance snowballs into a lot of money over these investors’ investment horizons. Moreover, there is reason to believe these funds aren’t even delivering on the mission they’ve set out to do. Impact investing is about aligning values and investment decisions. It’s about constraining the investment universe to businesses that adhere to a certain mission. In faith-based investing, that social mission is supposed to align with the values and principles of that faith. The mechanism by which these funds follow a missions-focused investment strategy can be as simple as excluding certain “sinful sectors” from their investable universe and as complicated as creating proprietary scores for certain principles, such as usury, likeliness to support the sale of pork, and manufacture and support alcohol consumption. Herein is where I have problems. To what degree does a company’s faith-adhering actions outweigh that company’s investment merit? Many funds won’t invest in Apple because its CEO is gay or American Express because they briefly changed their logo to rainbow colors for Pride Week. Taking this “degree question” to its ultimate extreme, some people will make the argument that just buying U.S. treasury bonds supports certain national political agendas in conflict with non-Christian values — LGBTQ lifestyle, abortion, divorce rights, etc. Who determines what is biblically responsible or Shariah-compliant and what is not? Furthermore, who is enforcing whether fund managers immediately sell their position in a company that does something “non-Christian”, even if the company is still cheap, profitable and beneficial for the client to own? Perhaps making these decisions is what the fund manager gets paid to do. However, I’m skeptical of their actual ability and/or purpose in doing so. Second, the fees for investing in a faith-guided fund are perhaps 90–100 basis points higher than investing in a passive index fund. The Human Rights Campaign has an annual Corporate Equality Index (CEI) that rates how progressive and sensitive 851 public companies are to LGBTQ lifestyle. A score of 100 means that a company is sensitive to LGBTQ people, and an index of less than 30 means that a company isn’t doing enough for LGBTQ people. For faith-based fund managers, an easy way to find eligible investments could be to just buy those companies that are well-capitalized (so they aren’t at risk of bankruptcy) and have a CEI of less than 30. Source: A Trivial Knot I found companies that scored above a 70 CEI that these managers overweighted like Costco, which the Huffington Post reported was the LGBT community’s best-perceived brand, and Honeywell, which the Human Rights Campaign called one of “The Best Companies for LGBT Equality”. In the majority of cases, personally, I couldn’t find a second reason for owning the companies that these managers had bought for if it wasn’t because of their low CEI rating. Back-testing several firms, I found a large correlation between low CEI rating and large weighting in Biblically-Responsible Investment (BRI) funds. If managers are merely buying companies on the Human Rights Campaign list — without doing very much extra work finding value for their unitholders — I see no reason why investors should be paying extra management fees for these managers that often lag their benchmarks. If you believe Milton Friedman, the only direct responsibility companies have is to earn a profit for their shareholders. In this pursuit for profits, the company may find it advantageous for its brand name, recruiting prospects or their customers to invest and foster positive community values. A company with absolutely no moral values will destroy the community that it serves, erode its customer base and ultimately destroy shareholder value (think Vale or BHP Billiton in the Samarco dam debacle). Thus, the best option for companies is to make large investments in the communities they operate in and care for their customers. This just sounds like good business sense. However, most companies cannot choose the community nor the culture in which it operates. The company must therefore contribute to the community in ways that do not offend any specific demographics nor divide the community. For small companies, this public scrutiny is negligible; however, for larger companies — with many operating markets, thousands of diverse employees and a need to maintain strong company-wide codes of ethics — they cannot selectively support or undermine certain causes. It is important to note that small companies who want to become large companies are also best advised not to offend their customers. Most companies cannot be partial to a certain religious perspective if they’re large businesses with representative workforces. Chances are then that these companies overextend many religious principles that faith-based fund managers say they try to screen out. What product are these faith-based managers actually peddling if the investments they make don’t ultimately screen out these companies? Moreover, having scanned the top holdings of many of these outperforming faith-based funds, I noticed that more than 50% of their holdings are in technology and healthcare stocks. The largest holdings are Apple, Amazon, Google, and Qualcomm. Most people can find instances of official company policy from all of these businesses that contradict both Christian and Halal principles. Source: Great Lakes Advisers Secular millennials and hippy-types alike have caught wind of a missions-based approach to stewardship. Companies like Fidelity, Pax World Fund and T. Rowe Price have cropped up to service the demand. These market their funds to investors as financial products that only invest in businesses that rank highly on ESG (Environmental, Social, Governance) scores. ESG-focused funds, similar to Faith-based funds, are funds created to address a social issue or create social value for certain groups. The problem, as we explained above, is measuring a company’s ESG execution is difficult. Nevertheless, assets under management at ESG-focused funds recently surpassed $12 trillion dollars, which towers over the $28 billion invested by ESG’s more conservative cousins. In addition to mutual funds, companies like Orthogonal, which has the stated mission of only investing in companies that benefit people and the plane; Ellevest, which is an investment platform designed to invest in and for women; and, Acumen, which is investing in companies that will change how the world tackles poverty are also capitalizing on the broader awareness and willingness to invest but invest responsibly. ESG funds have also outperformed in recent history; however, that outperformance perhaps comes from a concentration of risk in new-wave, technology companies, which have the cash flows and employee momentum to institute ESG-friendly policies. This could lead investors in ESG funds to experience the same long-run underperformance as investors in Faith-Based funds have experienced. Moreover, the concentration of risk is concerning given the increased political pressure on tech companies to pare down their often monopoly-like statuses. Faith-based funds, in many ways, have defined how we understand impact investing for social benefit.These social-financial entrepreneurs have started businesses that have thrived, while their clients have not. While these funds have outperformed their benchmarks in recent history, they have significantly underperformed benchmarks over the past ten years. For investors sympathetic to a missions-based approach to stewardship, the long-run is all that matters. Faith-based AUM has grown significantly because the nature of a dual-mandate approach to investing means that the non-financial mandate serves as a marketing ploy during good years and often an excuse for underperformance in bad years. For a whole host of measurement and execution problems, faith-based investing portends similar long-run underperformance on both their mission and financial mandates to investors. As impact investing increases in academic and empirical presence, the public will have to brace itself for an onslaught of social entrepreneurs and charlatans alike peddling these missions-based investment opportunities. Approach these opportunities with caution and skepticism."

is a theme of recent high-profile, tech IPOs that founders keep control of their company through the use of share classes even after they go public.

Medium.com,Industry,"When You Work For Yourself, You Work For Everyone",Business,https://medium.com/@aarondinin/when-you-work-for-yourself-you-work-for-everyone-45dacf610802?source=topic_page---------7------------------1," Once a week I have a student tell me he wants to be an entrepreneur in order to: “Be my own boss.” Students who tell me this don’t realize it, but they’re buying into one of the most popular myths of entrepreneurship: the myth of freedom to control your own actions, your own schedule, and perhaps even your own destiny. I totally understand the appeal. In fact, when I was building companies, I often justified my 16-hour-days by arguing that at least I was working according to my own schedule. Surely you see the paradox. When you’re working a 16 hour day, it doesn’t really matter who’s schedule you’re following since you’re filling every waking minute with work. In retrospect, I’m not sure how I fooled myself into believing I had freedom. Regardless, I genuinely believed I was in charge of my own destiny until, finally, I took a job at a big company (well… a university… close enough). Yes, I have a boss now. I no longer “work for myself.” However, the biggest difference isn’t that someone else can control what I work on. The biggest difference is that only one other person directs my work. In contrast, when I was working for myself and running my own companies, I had thousands of bosses… I just never recognized them for what they were. You’ll work for your employees Running my own company meant my employees were my bosses. While they technically worked for me, in reality, I spent every day working for them. They would tell me what they needed in order to be successful accomplishing the work they’d been assigned, and then I’d spend most of my time trying to provide those resources. This was particularly true when running venture-backed tech companies which were largely pre-profit. Since the companies operated at a loss, we constantly relied on venture capital to keep the lights on and pay salaries. If I couldn’t raise more money, people had to be fired. Did I want to spend weeks at a time fundraising? No. But I was doing it because that’s what my company (and its employees) needed me to be doing. You’ll work for your investors Since I was running venture-backed tech companies, my investors were my bosses. They were my bosses because they sat on my board and could, theoretically, fire me. Granted, investors always want to avoid firing their CEOs, but it was certainly a possibility. Regardless of whether they were or weren’t going to fire me, my investors were my bosses because they regularly made demands on my time for updates, board meetings, reports, and so on. When they did, I had to stop what I was doing and serve their needs. Did I want to create report after report and slide deck after slide deck to explain what was happening in my company to people without day-to-day knowledge of the business? No. But I was doing it because that’s what my investors needed me to be doing. You’ll work for your customers While employees and investors are important, my most important bosses were my customers. Ultimately, I was operating a company for them. It was my job to figure out what they needed and deliver it. If I didn’t, they wouldn’t hesitate to fire me. When customers needed things my employees couldn’t provide, I was the person who got the call. Depending on the value of that customer to the company, it could mean running point on a critical new feature or flying across country at a moment’s notice to save a contract renewal that was looking shaky. Did their needs align with what I wanted to be working on? Never. Did I work on what they needed instead of what I wanted? All the time. We’re always working for other people Yes, I officially have a boss now. Yes, he can tell me what to do. For example, during the summer he said I looked overworked and told me to take a week off. What a jerk, #AmIRight? When I was my “own boss,” can you guess how many times I told myself to take a week off? Never! And when I did take time off, either for sickness or because my car broke down or even for “vacation,” I never truly unplugged. Instead, my “time off” always stressed me out because “vacation” just meant having to stay up late into the night doing all the work I couldn’t do because I spent the day “relaxing” and “enjoying myself.” Yeah right… you try relaxing and enjoying yourself when your company is burning money faster than it’s making it, you’ve got employees expecting paychecks, and you haven’t hit the metrics you need to raise another round of funding. In contrast, now that I only have one boss, I look back on my time “being my own boss” and I chuckle. How could I have been so naive? When I was my own boss, I never got to work on the things I wanted. I never even had time to do things like write this article. Worst of all, every minute I spent not working on my company felt like I was letting down the people who — theoretically — worked for me."
Medium.com,Industry,WeWork Dropped the Best Idea They Had,Business,https://medium.com/swlh/wework-dropped-the-best-idea-they-had-bd37d087f24b?source=topic_page---------8------------------1," The initial emphasis of WeWork was not property but shared services. The idea was this — all over the world, startup founders are trying to figure out some very specific things — how to roast the best coffee beans, how to use AI in BtoB, or any other myriad of generally very focused problems. On top of this, they all have to deal with the same set of standardised issues — managing a P&L, sorting payroll, staying on top of their sales activities. And for many of them, they are facing these issues for the first time. The initial pitch for WeWork was that, as well as a shared office space, the company would centralise some of these services and offer them to tenants. Imagine being a tenant in a building with an amazing accountancy firm, an amazing HR consultancy, and a best in class law firm, all of whom know your business and take care of all those issues for you for a flat fee, allowing you to focus on those coffee beans you’ve been importing. Ultimately, they doubled down on the real estate element of the business. This makes sense with what we now know about Adam Neumann — chasing the maximum possible valuation, it made sense to focus on the business of property rather than the business of complex business services. Obviously, things haven’t gone so well for WeWork. Arguably, this focus on the bricks and mortar element would have made sense if they hadn’t been so ambitious with their valuation — they built a great brand and had some good margin, so probably could have built a single-digit billion-dollar business with only a paired back version of their strategy. But I also think they could have been wrong to abandon the shared services element. The initial insight — that so many small businesses grapple with services that are neither a core competency nor need reinventing for each entity — seems like one with legs. How many businesses have failed, not because they didn’t have a great idea, but because they didn’t know how to accrue revenue properly? Or PR? Or build a website? It also would have allowed them to build the software element of their business. They have been widely mocked for their attempts to pitch WeWork as a tech company, but imagine if the shared services side of their business included software — maybe an acquisition like LawPath, or maybe just revenue share deals with companies like Salesforce — they could have figured out entirely new ways to automate these services and show significant margins alongside the property side of their business. I broadly subscribe to the Andreessen Horowitz view that as time passes, software will take over more and more businesses that were thought of as needing human intervention. We’ve seen elements of sales taken on by companies like Salesforce, accounting by Xero, and now even more human heavy industries like legal are being automated. I think WeWork had a truly unique opportunity to leverage their network of tenants to lead this process of automation whilst also offering a helping hand to their tenants as they each scale. I also think we’re going to see the rise of consultancies founded on this very premise — assistance with the management of core business services, with a strong preference for automation. WeWork might have missed their chance. But it’ll be interesting to see if anyone else takes on the challenge."
Medium.com,Industry,Americans Losing Their Trust in the Tech Industry,Business,https://medium.com/dice-insights/americans-losing-their-trust-in-the-tech-industry-84674486fa69?source=topic_page---------9------------------1," Americans trust tech companies less, according to data from the Pew Research Center. That has potentially big implications for tech firms of all sizes, from giants such as Google all the way down to tiny startups. Four years ago, some 71 percent of Americans thought that tech companies had a positive impact on the United States; that number has now plunged to 50 percent. Over that same period, negative views of tech firms has climbed from 17 percent to 33 percent. There’s also a political element to all this. “The gap between Democrats and Republicans is relatively modest when it comes to technology companies,” Pew reports. “Democrats and Democratic-leaning independents are 10 percentage points more likely than Republicans and GOP leaners to say these firms have a positive effect on the way things are going in the country (54 percent vs. 44 percent).” Other surveys have also confirmed this rising negativity. In May, for instance, we asked readers whether they trusted Facebook in the wake of the social network’s massive data scandals (such as Cambridge Analytica). A full 86 percent of respondents told us that they did not trust Facebook. In another survey earlier this year, we asked if the big tech companies should be broken up (which you can take as a barometer of negative or positive sentiment toward tech’s largest firms). Some 44.2 percent said that all large tech companies should be broken into smaller entities. This is a pretty big deal for tech professionals, because widespread negative sentiment toward tech companies obviously makes it harder to get many things done. For example, if you build an app that requires a user to give up their personal data for optimal service, they might be less inclined to do so, given the generalized worries about how the tech industry handles folks’ information. Pew has also shown that Americans distrust particular tech products. Last year, the organization conducted a survey in which 80 percent of respondents said they had a negative impression of chatbots; another 17 percent said bots are used for “good purposes.” Only slightly more than half (53 percent) said they were fine with bots being used to answer customer-service inquiries. For tech professionals trying to build apps and services, what’s the solution here? It’s complicated, but “transparency” is usually a good tactic to take. Whenever you roll out a new feature of some sort, make sure that the consumer-facing documentation (whether a pop-up window, FAQ, or website) explains clearly what’s going on and what kind of data is being collected/used. And if consumer sentiment turns against you, make sure to pivot and adjust as quickly as possible. It’s very easy to lose trust… and extremely hard to earn it back."
Medium.com,Industry,Netflixing the sport: The DAZN model,Business,https://medium.com/@theconsultancygroupswitzerland/netflixing-the-sport-the-dazn-model-dd1466e34790?source=topic_page---------10------------------1," Over the top (OTT), media services provider Netflix is by far the biggest name in the streaming world. They have paved the way for a new generation of movies and series, burying the “Blockbuster model” (DVD and VHS renting service) once and for all. Founded in 1997, the company started by renting DVDs via regular mail, before finally moving into the streaming business in 2007. The model as it stands is pretty simple: pay a monthly fee (around U$S10 depending on the country) for an all-you-can-watch subscription. The general public has bought into the simplicity of the model, and the growth of the customer base has been exponential. In 2017, they hit 125 million subscribers worldwide. From acclaimed television series to Oscar-worthy movies, the platform lets users watch (almost) anything they want, wherever they want. The success has been so monumental that Netflix is now producing its own movies and series, absorbing the production market to increase profit margin. With the success of Netflix upon us, many of us have started to wonder how feasible it would be to replicate this model in sports? Would it be possible to propose a service of this magnitude to sports fans worldwide? We foresee two main difficulties. The first one is that a sporting event, conversely to a movie, almost always involves watching an event live. This changes the perspective from a technological standpoint: if you are watching Game of Thrones, and the connection falters, it doesn’t really matter, because you know the show will resume briefly. But if you are in the middle of the Wimbledon final, you would be absolutely furious to miss the winning point! Maintaining a live connection, no matter what would be a difficult feat to achieve considering individual differences in Wi-Fi speed, bandwidth, etc. The second difficulty is the fact that sports rights for television are even more difficult to obtain than for movies. Let’s take the fanciest example of all, football. In 2015, the bidding war between Sky Sport, the pan-European satellite broadcasting company, and BT, a subscription-based television service, led to a rights-holding increase of 70% for the 2016–2019 cycle, leading to a splitting of the rights between those Sky Sport and BT. It means that if you want to showcase the Premier League games just in the UK for 4 years, you will have to spend the enormous amount of £5.1BN. It is challenging to compare with Netflix, but let’s examine two examples: Netflix paid U$S118M to acquire the entire TV series Friends, which was a television classic for a whole generation. They also budgeted U$S50M to produce every season of their Emmy award-winning series Orange is the new Black. Of course, the offering has to be wider for movies and series, but the public is also much larger than for sports. To enhance the comparison, four seasons of the Netflix series would cost approximately U$S200M to air, not much compared to billions… Until a few years ago, two existing sporting models stood out: the TV broadcaster and the League. The TV broadcaster model is best presented by ESPN. The US-based, global, paid-television sports channel, created 40 years ago, quickly became a reference in the sports industry, making a fast transition from a classic TV channel to an all-around sport content distributor. One of their extensions is WatchESPN, an Internet television website and mobile application that allows clients (mainly US) to watch their favourite sports, live from a computer or a website. The League model, on the other hand, is a smart way for some of the most well-known sports leagues in the world to generate additional revenue. Let’s take the NBA League Pass, the basketball package that allows its subscribers to watch up to 40 out-of-market National Basketball Association games per week. Videos of the games come from local stations and regional sports’ networks. This feature allows the NBA to sell exclusive games to their fans worldwide, increasing their own database at the same time. One of the keys to cracking the sport streaming code is definitely money. The companies able to make the biggest moves, from this point of view, are also some of the wealthiest, together known as FAANG: Facebook, Apple, Amazon, Netflix and Google. Let’s remove Netflix from the equation, since it doesn’t seem to be interested in live streaming, and replace it with Twitter, which is actually stagnating when it comes to users and looking for every available opportunity to keep up with its fellow tech giants. Quietly, these companies have started acquiring sports rights in the US and elsewhere: Twitter bought rights to the NHL’s and MLB’s weekly games, the PGA Tour, and the list goes on. Facebook went even bigger, purchasing the rights to live stream the UEFA Champions League (through a partnership with Fox Sports) in South America, as well as a large part of the NCAA basketball tournament And that’s not all. Zuckerberg’s company got ahead of BeIN Sports and Fox Sports Asia to finalize its largest — if not its smartest — deal a few months ago, securing about £200M worth of exclusive rights to broadcast live Premier League matches in South-East Asia from 2019. This is a huge win, not only because the English Premier League is one of the most prestigious in the world, but also because the rise of viewership in the last 15 years has boomed in this region (thanks in part to the major European teams’ summer tours). Speaking of Asia, tech giant Alibaba is also on the move in Europe, eager to get its hands on the sports business. The enterprise created by Jack Ma will team up with Suning Co Ltd, a retail conglomerate with an annual revenue of around U$S22 billion, which owns Italian soccer club Inter Milan and is fast securing the rights to air Europe’s top league matches in China. While these clearly calculated moves are definitely changing the sporting landscape, it doesn’t come close to offering sports fans a service as convenient and centralized as Netflix. Is it possible to merge most of these sports into one integrated package and to give sports fans the streaming service they deserve? One company seems up to the challenge… DAZN (pronounced “Da Zone”) was created in 2015 by Perform Group, a global, sports media company, based in the United Kingdom and operating across a wide range of digital platforms. The concept is quite simple: to build the Netflix of sports, with the same monthly subscription model. It is a tough road, but they are working their way toward their objective. At the moment, the platform offers more than 8,000 sports events per year, with a wide range of prestigious leagues such as Premier League, Bundesliga, La Liga, NBA, NFL, MLB, WTA, Six Nations, Formula One and UFC. Born from the merging of Premium TV Limited, an event sports broadcasting network, and the Inform Group, a digital sports rights agency, Perform Group has an established relationship in the world of sports broadcasting, making it ideally suited to grow rapidly in this new market. But still, how could they possibly acquire the holding rights for big leagues like the NFL? The answer is pretty simple for now: the NFL on DAZN is distributed in only a few countries like Germany, Austria, Switzerland and Japan, where viewership is low. The NFL is probably happy to gain some added visibility in countries where American football is relatively unknown, on the off chance that viewing rates increase and the sport gains a new, unexpected fan base — a win-win for both the NFL and DAZN. Since Perform Group is investing heavily in European football, DAZN seems to be going all-in in Italy, where they decided to challenge the colossus Sky Italia on the bidding rights for the Italian football league Serie A. They recently announced that they obtained a three-year deal to broadcast 114 Serie A matches per season, which, in terms of degree of change, is considered a revolution for this league. Even if the exact price of the deal remains a mystery, the Financial Times estimated the cost for this amount of time at €600M. Based on this example, DAZN will probably pick its battles carefully. Considering what they’re up against, can DAZN become the Netflix of sports? Only time will tell. In the meantime, their objective remains clear, as Perform Group CEO Simon Denyer stated on an article of the Guardian a few months ago: “Netflix and Amazon have proved that large numbers of people are willing to pay a reasonable amount per month [for streaming services]. Prices have come down while the quality and quantity of content has dramatically increased. We want to do the same for sport.”"

Medium.com,Industry,Will Venture Capital Vetting Change After WeWork’s Failed IPO?,Business,https://medium.com/swlh/will-venture-capital-vetting-change-after-weworks-failed-ipo-86d00e97bbf1?source=topic_page---------12------------------1," WeWork’s failed IPO is certainly one of the biggest business debacles of 2019. It can be argued that the company would have had a difficult road to reach profitability, even if the series of events that led to the failed IPO had never happened. In an odd way, the failure of the company to deliver upon its large-scale vision early on is a good thing for most investors (i.e. anyone who was thinking about buying the stock post-IPO). Still, it’s scary to think that the world’s largest venture capital groups — the ones with the most money, time, and resources on the line — didn’t see the red flags until it was too late. SoftBank (now majority shareholder at 80%), J.P. Morgan Chase & Co, T. Rowe Price Associates, Wellington Management, Goldman Sachs Group, the Harvard Corp., and Benchmark all bought into WeWork’s vision. WeWork isn’t the first company to make mistakes and cancel an IPO. Nonetheless, the buildup about the company’s potential and the quickness of its decline are unparalleled among unicorn companies. For better or worse, startups looking for seed funding to Series E and beyond should know that WeWork’s failures have already begun to influence the world of venture capital. Let’s be real. WeWork’s valuation was largely based on hype, not potential. There is a key difference. The hype of WeWork wasn’t based on what it could offer people in the near future. Rather, it was based on what it could offer if the company underwent a complete metamorphosis. The best example of this is the company’s pivot from WeWork to The We Company. The high valuation was based on the ability to become a real estate conglomerate and much more, not just a company offering office space rentals. Sure, the company had opened a grade school, two apartment buildings, and three fitness centres. However, it’s important to see that these were and still are largely experimental business verticals. It’s possible that the company could have expanded The We Company ecosystem to more cities, similar to how it did with WeWork offices. Brand recognition can be hard to quantify, but business leaders wildly overestimated anyway. Just because The We Company can expand its ecosystem, but that doesn’t mean that brand recognition gained from WeWork somehow equates to a large customer base in other verticals. One of the biggest takeaways from evaluating The We Company’s business model is that the company was spreading itself too thin. By trying to make a play at multiple business verticals at once, WeWork was neglecting how it could optimize its most established vertical: office rentals. Many successful businesses have been around for a long time because they focus on a single niche. This doesn’t mean there isn’t room for some innovation. For example, international restaurant chains often optimize their menus based on what people like to eat in a particular country or region. At the end of the day, people still recognize the brand and generally know what to expect. Unless the occupancy rate at WeWork offices is close to 100% in every location, there should have been a greater focus on how to attract more entrepreneurs, freelancers, and larger companies. If the company knew that this business model was doomed to fail, it should have made the pivot to other verticals long before starting the groundwork for an IPO. Billions of dollars in losses are all too common among startups today. Uber, Peloton, and WeWork are just a few examples. It’s always been common practice for startups to raise capital before profitability. However, the number of years to reach profitability appears to be getting drastically higher. — Amazon was founded in July 1994 and reported its first quarterly profit in 2001. — Google was founded in September 1998 and became profitable in 2001. — Facebook was founded in February 2004. In September 2009, it turned cash flow positive for the first time. — Uber was founded in March 2009 and is still not profitable at the end of 2019. — Peloton was founded in February 2012 and is still not profitable at the end of 2019. — WeWork was founded sometime in 2010 but is still not profitable at the end of 2019. Notice the difference? Do venture capital groups have to wonder what has caused the shift away from well-known startups being able to reach profitability within ten years? Is it caused by an over-reliance on a high growth mentality that doesn’t focus enough on profits? Is it just that the ideas, business models, and technology of new startups are too untested to predict if or when profitability can be reached? In July 2019, news outlets reported that CEO and Co-founder Adam Neumann cashed out more than $700 million through a mix of stock sales and debt. Neumann’s ability to cash out early was a selfish decision that started WeWork’s decline. This brings into question whether VCs should add legally-bounding requirements for when founders can cash out on equity. While troubling, it didn’t completely derail the company’s IPO plans. The problem was that this wasn’t enough for Neumann. Resigning on September 24, he received an approved compensation package worth nearly $1.7 billion. As part of the deal, SoftBank went from a 29% shareholder to an 80% shareholder. In November 2019, former WeWork employee Natalie Sojkatook filed a proposed class-action lawsuit against Neumann. Smaller shareholders who didn’t have the option to cash out early like Neumann saw the company’s value plummet by 87%. On November 8, 2019, WeWork announced plans to divest all non-core businesses and cut jobs. Medina Bardhi, Neumann’s former chief of staff, is also suing him for pregnancy discrimination. The fate of the company is mostly unknown. Can the company ever recover under the majority leadership of SoftBank? How will the court rule on Neumann’s discounted stock sale to SoftBank? Will WeWork be forced to close offices that are further away from profitability? Does the vision of a true multi-vertical ecosystem fade away? Throwing money at a company just because of a grandiose vision or belief in its founders isn’t a real strategy. WeWork’s story presents a message to all venture capital groups about the importance of getting back to valuing companies based on fundamentals, not fairy tales."

nilever was recently under fire for an ad campaign run on Pornhub by its male grooming product brand, Dollar Shave Club. In an interview with Mi3, Dollar Shave Club’s Creative Director had explained the controversial decision behind the ad campaign as being strategic, highlighting the significant impressions and exposure it has delivered. However, Unilever was quick to issue an apology, reassuring the public of its commitment to be more responsible in its marketing activities. There is hardly any big brand that has not encountered public criticism over a misjudged campaign or a brand blunder at some point in time. But why does Unilever’s latest mishap ring an alarm bell for those in the Boardroom to take note? Marketers today are increasingly under pressure to deliver tangible results. A resounding focus on number-driven outcomes, often stemming from the Boardroom, could, however… …end up with miscalculated damage to the brand reputation. Poor decisions, stretching ethical and moral judgment at times, are often justified by quantifiable results. This is not about choosing short term gains over long-term outcomes (although that in itself is a conundrum that begs attention). But it is more about the dilemma of delivering tangible results at the expense of intangible damage to brand image and reputation. So… why did Unilever react so quickly to address its Dollar Shave Club incident? After all, the website in question was just another medium to effectively reach the brand’s consumers. And the brand’s male audience is probably amused by its witty ads on the website. So, was the media and the general public overreacting? Well, it’s much more complicated than that and Unilever’s reaction may be more far-sighted than a simple reaction to overcome public outcry. Here’s why. Brands worldwide spend billions of dollars every year on brand ambassadors, influencers, sponsorships and tie-ups so that they can influence their consumers’ perception. According to a report by the University of California, Davis, sponsors of Tiger Woods lost approximately $12 billion with eroded shareholder value during the 2 weeks that followed his infamous 2009 scandal. Powerful associations help brands differentiate and positively influence their consumers. This is why according to Forbes, big brands like Nike and Coca Cola paid an estimated total of $53 million to pro basketball player LeBron James. This is also why the popular musician — The Weeknd — severed ties with H&M early last year after its ad campaign came under fire for racial insensitivity. Positive associations are especially helpful during a PR crisis… …when a brand needs to leverage on all that it has to strengthen the perception of integrity, accountability and ethical conduct to rally support. These give more than one reason for Unilever to severe its links with the controversial website. Brands within a portfolio is more inter-twined than it may seem. Consumer perception of one brand could affect that of others within the portfolio. This is especially true when they are all nestled under a powerful corporate brand. Half the top ten online search results for ‘Dollar Shave Club + Pornhub’, for example, directly displays Unilever in the headlines. That’s the strength of a powerful corporate brand. That’s also the risk attached to a powerful corporate brand, the impact of which would inevitably trickle down to others within the portfolio. In addition to the reputational damage that it could potentially cause the other brands within the portfolio, there is also the risk of alienating the diverse consumer segments. In 2011 Unilever experienced this first hand when its Lynx ad campaign was criticized for objectifying women. This eventually led to its ban by the Advertising Standards Authority — a heavy price to pay for a company that promotes self-esteem for women and girls through its Dove brand. Avoiding the alienation of diverse consumer groups within a brand portfolio is not easy in a practical sense. One way to avoid this… …is by ensuring that all brands respect and align with the corporate brand’s purpose and values. A brand’s failure or success does not simply lie in the hands of its consumers. For a brand to succeed, it needs to consider how it manages engagement with the entire stakeholder ecosystem. This means all its stakeholder groups — from employees and communities to the investors and media — have an important say on its brand image and reputation. So, if the Dollar Shave Club consumers are amused and the others are offended by its controversial ad campaign, the brand definitely needs to take note."

These advanced algorithms are capable of transforming organizations to derive multi-fold business value. Organizations have started investing in data science teams to lead the digital transformation journey to be at the top of their game. Are most of the organizations geared for speed to market for digital transformation? Let us explore why… This attempt to explore why data science solution fails to meet desired outcomes is based on my own personal experience, validated from other world experiences and with contributions from my better half Arshad. I am sure there will be other point of views which I am open to learn. Before diving in let me briefly explain data science Data science is a multi disciplinary field to draw relevant insights from structured and unstructured data by understanding the data patterns to predict the future. Data science is an art and science that uses mathematics, machine learning, computer programming, statistical modeling, data engineering and visualization, pattern recognition and learning, uncertainty modeling, data warehousing, and cloud computing. Do we know with fidelity the business pain points we are trying to solve? Most of the data science projects start with high-level objectives without sufficient clarity of specifics. Let’s examine with an example High level objective - increase the sales of a business unit or a particular product assortment. Once we have the clarity on why we need a data science solution for a business problem, we then start to design the solution to work on what and how. For data science solutions to be successful, we use Extreme Collaboration approach Extreme Collaboration: Continuously moderate collaborative problem definition, solution designing along with prioritization of business objectives with highest business value with all stakeholders Business/end-users have pain points or an expectation they want the data science solution to address. We need to understand the expectations from different stakeholders even if the needs are in conflict. This includes the end-users, anyone closely associated with the problem and also includes the leadership team. We need to deliberate all the needs of stakeholders using extreme collaboration methods like interviews with different stakeholders to get different perspectives, understand customer journey by observing them and conducting designing workshops. These are mentioned in detail in tools and techniques to be employed to understand business needs below. At times, stakeholders may have unrealistic expectations. Expectations need to be reset to set the right scope and success criteria. All stakeholders should be in agreement on the scope and success criteria. On certain occasions, we may figure that a small business process change solves the problem rather than an elaborate data science solution. Hence this is a very critical step to set the right direction. After all, stakeholders have common and clear expectations, prioritize the pain points or expectations. This needs to be done collaboratively with all the stakeholders which I refer to as extreme collaboration. Extreme collaboration is building on each others ideas, and strengths to achieve a common goal or an objective. After identification of business objectives, prioritize pain points or desired outcomes with the most business value, business value can be defined in terms of the When prioritizing collaboratively, we need to also consider issues like Who is best suited to moderate business expectations and prioritization of business objectives? This exercise is best done by someone who has an understanding of business, can talk their language without getting mired with technology details. Has a good understanding of the data, have a detailed knowledge of the data science and can talk the technical language. Mirroring the usage of the business terms when talking to business is the key and similarly mirroring usage of data science terms to data science team is helpful to bridge the gap. What are the tools and techniques can be employed to understand business needs? Explore customer journey to understand the current problem and their expectations from the solution. This can be done by Advantage of the extreme collaboration are multitude Are their any rules of the engagement with different stakeholders? Collaboration eliminates the assumption, builds the trust among different teams and team members and creates an environment for building on each others strength Always go for small, incremental, and iterative solution development Short, quick, iterative incremental cycles to get data insights with business makes data science solution on steroids. This is a fail fast and correct immediately approach This approach helps two folds : Business gets a clear picture of what will be accomplished, the data insights into changing market trends. Data engineering team gets a better understanding of what is the relevant data that needs to be provided to the data science team and data science team can build multiple models and then decide which model performs better for the problem at hand. Attitudes for successful data science solution execution Failure is a good thing as it teaches you what you are missing. With every iteration understand what is working and what is not working for the solution. Conduct brainstorming discussions on what should be the next steps for improvements. Failure is not fatal but failing to acknowledge and learn from failure is definitely fatal “Success is not final, failure is not fatal: it is the courage to continue that counts.” — Winston Churchill Continuous learning, monitoring and improvements are the key to success. Failures are just stepping stones to success. Continuous learning for all stakeholders on the data science fundamentals, data and model improvements to achieve success criteria. When setting the expectation for a data science solution or being part of data science solution “Ignorance is not at all a bliss”. It would be good for business to understand areas where data science could be leveraged. Similarly, it is also very important for the data engineering, data science and data visualization team members to have a solid business understanding. All stakeholders on the data science solution need to understand and talk the same language. This ensures that everyone on the team understand each other with clarity which is very critical to success."
Medium.com,Industry,Riding Dirty: Waymo and the Climate Cost of Autonomous Mobility (as Currently Conceived),Business,https://medium.com/@joseph.wildey/riding-dirty-waymo-and-the-climate-cost-of-autonomous-mobility-as-currently-conceived-9fa34b4f76f4?source=topic_page---------16------------------1," Let’s consider some numbers: 10 billion miles. That’s how many miles Waymo claims to have driven in simulation. Here’s another number: 10 million miles. That’s how many miles Waymo claims to have driven in the real world as of this past summer. Those are the numbers that Waymo publicly touts to emphasize the scale and market supremacy of its autonomous vehicle testing program. But here’s one number you’ll never see Waymo publicly acknowledging: 4,000 metric tons of carbon dioxide, which would require planting 102,700 urban trees to offset. That’s the approximate total carbon emissions that Waymo is responsible for by using their own “10-million-mile” metric.* In 2016, Waymo (formerly known as the Google Self-Driving Car Project) formed a partnership with Fiat-Chrysler Automobiles (FCA) “to integrate its self-driving system, including its sensors and software” into the Pacifica Hybrid. At the time, Waymo’s CEO John Krafcik said that “the Chrysler Pacifica Hybrid minivan is well-suited for Google’s self-driving technology.” By this he presumably meant its size and large traction battery (16 kWh) that could be repurposed to power his company’s likely power-hungry self-driving technology. In 2018, Waymo further committed to its partnership with FCA by announcing it had plans to purchase up to 62,000 additional Pacifica Hybrid vans for use in its burgeoning robotaxi fleet operations. This announcement included additional information about future licensing agreements between Waymo and FCA and raised the possibility of FCA later selling consumer vehicles with some of their self-driving technology. As was reported shortly after this announcement, Waymo (or, more likely, its parent company Alphabet) stands to financially benefit from this arrangement because the combined purchase of up to 62,000 of these vans could net the company nearly half a billion dollars in federal tax credits. This is because the consumer version of the Pacifica Hybrid van is eligible for the full $7,500 federal electric vehicle tax credit, and this credit can be claimed by individuals and corporations — and there’s no cap on the total amount that can be claimed. According to the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) Internal Revenue Bulletin 2009–48, in order for a vehicle to be eligible for the federal electric vehicle tax credit, the vehicle manufacturer (FCA in this case) must certify the vehicle is eligible. Vehicles must meet requirements specified by the IRS, including having a battery that is primarily used to propel the vehicle. The purchaser (Waymo in this case) can then rely on that certification to claim the credit. What makes this situation different is the unique partnership between the certifying manufacturer (FCA) and the purchaser (Waymo). In this case, Waymo is not buying, and FCA is not selling, a consumer version of the Pacifica Hybrid. The van is so significantly different from a hardware and software standpoint that it could conceivably bear a new moniker to set it apart from the consumer version; some could even argue it’s a new model (i.e., one that is not eligible for the federal electric vehicle tax credit). The federal electric vehicle tax credit’s insistence on having the onboard battery propel qualified vehicles makes sense: The goal of the tax credit and the law that enabled it is to reduce carbon emissions, and that is done by incentivizing the purchase of vehicles that run on electricity rather than gasoline or diesel. In fact, a 2012 Congressional Budget Office report on the law, titled “Effects of Federal Tax Credits for the Purchase of Electric Vehicles,” assumed that some percentage of plug-in hybrid electric vehicle miles driven would be all-electric miles. In their report the CBO noted that “[i]ncreasing either the frequency with which plug-in hybrids were recharged or the size of their batteries would raise” the percentage of miles that these vehicles could operate on all-electric power, thereby reducing their gasoline use and attendant emissions. Since FCA is building these vans to Waymo’s specifications, they differ significantly from the consumer versions (as evidenced by the dorsal lidar backpack and other gizmos covering the exterior). As a result, FCA’s certifying that the onboard battery propels the vehicle is a violation of the spirit — if not the letter — of the law originally passed to help curb carbon emissions and not advance autonomous vehicle technology and associated companies. Since I last wrote about this issue in 2018, additional information has emerged regarding the propulsion and energy requirements of Waymo’s modified Pacifica Hybrid vans. In April 2019, The Arizona Republic reported that a whistle-blower had complained that operators were instructed by Waymo to leave the engines running while refueling, which is generally not recommended and nearly all gas stations have signs warning motorists against it. The whistle-blower filed the complaint with the Chandler Fire Department. After some back and forth, the fire department issued a statement saying that it had reached out to Waymo and that the company would be changing its policy after the complaint. This is an odd story for several reasons, so let’s start from the top. First, nearly all hybrids/plug-in hybrids on the road today have sufficiently large batteries and sophisticated hybrid drivetrain systems that allow the vehicles to shut off the engines while stopped or operating at lower speeds (try it with any Prius). It’s incredibly rare for a modern hybrid vehicle’s engine to remain running at idle or stops unless the onboard battery is significantly depleted to the point where the engine must continuously operate to supply it with power. This can also happen during cold weather, which is likely not the case in Arizona. If the vehicles’ gasoline engines were indeed kept running continuously, then that would seem to indicate that Waymo’s autonomous tech places significant power demands on the onboard electrical system and battery. So much so that shutting down the vehicle’s gasoline engine would shut down all of the autonomous tech (computer included). From a continuous operations standpoint, this would be a huge potential downside for Waymo’s bottom line if or when they launch a commercial service to the public. The minutes the vehicles require to “reboot” after power is terminated while refueling add up when spread across up to 62,000 vans and however many riders they plan to serve. Charging, if it did happen, would require even more downtime. Waymo is probably banking on its sensor and computer technology improving enough to reduce the operational energy requirements of its vehicles before the public catches wind of the carbon cost of its rides. Waymo is also shifting the public’s attention to the still-in-testing all-electric Jaguar I-Pace; however, Waymo has publicly committed to purchasing far fewer of these all-electric vehicles (approximately one-third as many as compared to the Pacifica) and hasn’t been using them in most of its early rider programs to date. Importantly, Waymo is not currently required by law to disclose any internal metrics related to vehicle fuel economy or energy consumption. However, Senator Elizabeth Warren has introduced a bill, The Climate Risk Disclosure Act of 2019, which would require every public company to disclose “its direct and indirect greenhouse gas emissions.” Such a requirement would require Waymo/Alphabet to reveal the environmental impact of its autonomous vans and service. Consumers have a right to understand how companies like Waymo are contributing to climate change since transportation is the largest contributor to greenhouse gas emissions in the United States. This is especially critical in light of recent news that more than 11,000 scientists have signed on to a statement that we’re in the middle of a “climate emergency.” It’s cold and flu season, and consumers are reminded by every cleaning product they purchase that “[i]t is a violation of Federal law to use this product in a manner inconsistent with its labeling.” As unlikely as enforcement seems, the message is simple: Use this product as intended. Waymo, in close partnership with FCA, is using the Pacifica Hybrid and the federal electric vehicle tax credit program in a manner inconsistent with its “labeling.” The intended purpose of the federal electric vehicle tax credit program is to reduce carbon emissions, but Waymo, by operating the Pacifica Hybrid without ever charging it, is contributing to a net increase in carbon emissions and limiting the use of the credit by future consumers in the process. Separately, the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) may be cracking down on tax credit scofflaws. Recent reports have cited an audit from the Treasury Inspector General for Tax Administration that pointed to approximately $82 million in tax credits given to individuals and corporations between 2013 and 2017 that should have been disallowed. That sum pales in comparison to the nearly half a billion dollars in tax credits that Waymo may claim if it follows through on its plans to purchase up to 62,000 vans from FCA. Change and transparency will likely come not from regulators but from consumers or, in this case, riders who demand more information about how their “cool” ride in a robovan affects the environment. It’s not asking much of Waymo to add this information at the point of purchase (e.g., telling passengers how much carbon their ride produces in the app). Waymo could also make general facts and figures available to the public via their website, including carbon offset efforts, if any. It’s because of the well-known carbon cost of flying that “flight shaming” is now a thing. Considering Waymo and its parent company Alphabet are eligible for federal electric vehicle tax credits ostensibly designed to foster a reduction in carbon emissions, voluntarily disclosing more information about the environmental impact of their operations is really the least they could do while racking up millions of miles and emissions — and possibly hundreds of millions of dollars in tax credits. *I say approximate because publicly available information about the fuel efficiency, charging cycles, and energy requirements of Waymo’s custom-built Chrysler Pacifica Hybrid vans that now operate across the United States is either nonexistent or hard to come by. I used the TerraPass carbon calculator and selected the standard consumer version of the Chrysler Pacifica (non-hybrid). I selected the non-hybrid version because the information available to date (as described here) suggests the Waymo vans’ engines operate continuously and do not turn off when the vehicles are in operation. Further, it is likely Waymo’s vans are even less fuel efficient than the standard consumer version of the Chrysler Pacifica given the added weight/aerodynamic drag and continuous energy requirements of the onboard autonomous technology."
Medium.com,Industry,What’s a dba and do I need one?,Business,https://medium.com/sprout-legal/whats-a-dba-and-do-i-need-one-2027141d6751?source=topic_page---------17------------------1," Ever wonder what a fictitious business name is, or a dba? Wonder no more. Read on and discover what it is and decide whether your business needs one. The acronym “dba” stands for “doing business as” and all it means is that the name a business uses for its day-to-day interactions with the public is different from the legal name that it puts on all its formal paperwork. A “dba” is also known as a “fictitious business name” and it’s a perfectly permissible construct regularly used by companies. Here’s an example. Let’s say there’s a little café by the pier called “North Shore Crab Shack.” That’s the name painted in bold letters on the side of the building, and the name that appears at the top of the menus. It’s a great business name. Its regional, its descriptive, everyone understands what it is and what it does. But it’s a little business and according to the owner’s CPA, there’s really no need to create a corporation and do all that extra paperwork. Instead the owner — Joe Marino — is using a fictitious business name. He filed a simple document with the local county clerk’s office (or something similar depending on the state) declaring his intent to use a fictitious business name or dba. All legal paperwork relating to the business, such as his lease, his checks, his employment agreements, will all read “Joe Marino dba North Shore Crab Shack.” Does my business need a dba? Maybe. If your business name is simply your name plus a word or two describing the nature of your business, no formal dba filing is required. For example, “Joe Marino’s Crab Shack” would not require a dba filing because it merely describes Joe Marino’s business. However, there are plenty of times and reasons for a business to use a dba. Maybe Joe Marino didn’t like the name “Joe Marino’s Crab Shack.” Maybe the business was formerly owned by Shivani Balasubramanium and nobody could pronounce his name anyway, and he thought an eatery called “North Shore Crab Shack” would be much easier to remember than “Balasubramanium Eats.” The bottom line is that even businesses need nicknames sometimes and when they do, they file a dba or fictitious business name registration so people can verify who they really are (you know, so you can get tax bills and such). Is a dba the same as a trademark or service mark? No. A trademark is a brand name used to distinguish the goods of one seller from those of others. A service mark is similar, but instead of distinguishing goods or products, distinguishes the services of one provider from those of others. A business may use a number of trademarks for different products. For example, The Coca-Cola Company using the trademarks Coca-Cola, Minute Maid, and Sprite for different drinks it sells. You see those “marks” and can recognize that the products come from a different source than the store brand they sit next to. A dba, on the other hand, relates to an entire business instead of just a product line. Is a dba the same as a corporation name? No. A corporation is a legally structured entity created under the laws of a particular state. It has its own specific rights and obligations separate from that of the owners of the company. Creating and using a corporation for conducting business has certain benefits in terms of limited liability and other matters that a dba does not provide. If you do business using a dba, its still just you that has to pay the bills and pay taxes on your profits. If you have a corporation, it works a bit differently. A dba can be used by a corporation, though. For example, “Marino Family Business, Inc. dba North Shore Crab Shack.” In this example, Marino Family Business, Inc. is a legally organized corporation that is calling its business “North Shore Crab Shack.” The reasons for a corporation are the same as for an individual; there’s some reason why you want to use a nickname. Do you have to register a dba? Usually, yes. As you might imagine, it wouldn’t make much sense to allow businesses to use nicknames without some type of paperwork trail. However, registering a dba for your business is a simple process. You need to file out a simple form with your local County Clerk’s office identifying your (or your business’) legal name, the dba or fictitious business name you intend to use, pay a small fee, and follow simple instructions regarding publication of your fictitious business name in a designated newspaper in the area. Do a google search with your county or city name and “fictitious business name” or “dba” and you should easily be able to find where and how you need to file. It is usually the same office where birth, death, and marriage certificate records are kept. Most offices will allow you to search existing dba filings so you can see if someone else is using the same or very similar name before you file your paperwork. What if someone else is using the dba I want to use? You won’t be able to file for use of the same dba as some other business, but you really wouldn’t want to anyway. Your business should have a distinct name so that people who love your products and service can find you and refer you to their friends. Furthermore, if another business with a similar name has a bad reputation, you don’t want your potential customers to confuse you with them. Naming your business is an important decision, but just like with people, someday it may need a nickname."
Medium.com,Industry,Rev Slashes Minimum Pay for Gig Workers,Business,https://onezero.medium.com/rev-slashes-minimum-pay-for-gig-workers-10baf9b68c54?source=topic_page---------18------------------1," he popular transcription service Rev has reportedly cut the pay of its freelance workers who produce transcripts for pennies a minute. Rev launched in 2010 and has received millions of dollars in funding. Like many rivals, it offers automated transcriptions using speech recognition software, but also has a separate service for transcriptions that are “performed by humans, not A.I.” Users submit audio files to the service — interviews or recordings of meetings, for example — and contractors return a transcript within 12 hours. The company stands out for its accuracy and affordability — just $1 per minute of audio — but all of it comes at a human cost, say Rev gig workers. Li Zilles, a Seattle-based contractor for Rev, tweeted on Monday that the company slashed its baseline rate for transcription workers on Friday, calling it “yet another example of a gig economy startup brazenly mistreating its workers.” On Wednesday, a representative for Rev posted to an internal company forum that its minimum pay would drop from $0.45 to $0.30 per minute transcribed. A Rev worker, who asked to remain anonymous for fear of losing their job, sent the post to OneZero. It frames the policy shift as a way to “fairly compensate” its “best Revvers” who take on harder transcription jobs — audio files containing noise or multiple speakers, for example — which could earn workers rates of $0.80 per minute. In an update to its announcement, the company clarified that “the goal is NOT to take pay away from Revvers.” “For this round of pricing changes, 30 [cents per minute] will be the starting price for a very small number of jobs,” Rev’s post states. “On the other hand, some jobs will now start at 80 [cents per minute], and these jobs will still be able to increase in price from there.” OneZero spoke to several Rev freelancers who said the payment change was only announced on the company forum. “I wasn’t even aware of the forums’ existence until just now,” Andrew Marsden, a U.K.-based contractor for Rev, told OneZero. “That doesn’t seem a suitable announcement vehicle for such a major change. It didn’t appear in a pop-up on login, even though Rev requires a reacknowledgement of their confidentiality agreement seemingly weekly.” Rev doesn’t publicly say how it determines these rates, but people who say they’ve worked for the company allege that much of its workflow is managed by algorithms. Transcribers can choose more time-consuming projects with higher rates, though it’s unclear whether these jobs are worth it. The company did not respond to OneZero’s request for comment. Zilles explained that an industry standard for transcription is four minutes of work for every one minute of audio. This amounted to $6.75 per hour under Rev’s previous rate, and now equates to a payout of $4.50 per hour. Rev workers began to organize against the pay cut as soon as the change went live. Transcriptionists would claim the higher rate jobs, and then unclaim them, leaving a note of protest for the next person in line. A similar protest tactic was used by Instacart contractors during a recent strike. Human transcribers have reason for concern. There are a growing number of speech-to-text services that use A.I. for transcription and cost less than Rev’s premium offerings, suggesting that these jobs are becoming more automated, threatening to put contractors out of work entirely. Rev requires freelancers to take a grammar quiz and submit a transcription sample before approving them to work on the platform. Workers can then select jobs based on pay rates and deadline. Zilles used to net $1,500 to $2,000 per month from Rev, which pays its freelancers via PayPal. “For the most part, we haven’t been able to organize because the only place we have to communicate en masse right now is the internal forum,” Zilles says. “People are scared, some are still hoping to appeal to the company rep on the forum.” Have a tip about Rev?

The idea is simple and makes sense: offer iPhones under a de facto leasing system, whereby in exchange for a monthly payment, devices are exchanged for new models. Such a system already exists in the business world, where company rent their computers, replacing them regularly with more powerful machines, were it to take off in the consumer sector could see greater homogeneity, as well as helping with recycling and reusing materials, which would greatly enhance Apple’s green credentials. For consumers, this is undoubtedly the best way to keep our smartphones permanently updated, as well as accessing the latest models. For Apple, the approach would likely translate into greater customer loyalty. Throw the added value of Apple’s commitment to privacy into the mix, and the idea could definitely appeal to a substantial number of people. Apple already has two-year credit plans that allow customers to trade their old model in for a new one after a year, given that we are now seeing “new” models launched at that rate. Apple has steadily been moving toward seeing itself as a services provider, and it now markets apps, insurance, storage, paid services and music, as well as games, series, movies or television content. The company’s latest results show, once again, a small decline in revenue from its flagship iPhone product and a significant increase in the category of services. We are clearly in the middle of a transition from owning stuff to renting it or paying a subscription to access transportation, music, movies, holiday homes, yachts, or whatever. Such a model is arguably more efficient and will hopefully clear our homes of all those old cellphones and computers that still work and never get put to good use or even recycled. As long as the economics make sense, many people would probably welcome no longer having to buy a computer or a smartphone, only to consign it to a drawer within a year or two. At the same time, there a plenty of people out there who love buying and owning stuff, even if the pleasure is short-lived. Will we soon no longer own smartphones, but instead lease them for a monthly fee until we exchange them for the next model? If so, and in an era of flat data rates, wouldn’t it make more sense if the company leasing us a device provided us with the data contract, thereby challenging the hegemony of the telephone companies, which used to offer subsidized devices with phone contracts. Nothing stays the same for long."

But dealing with the failures of our teammates can be even more frustrating. In the past, when members of my team failed to achieve their objectives, I often went quiet and said something like, “It’s okay — don’t sweat. I’ll look after it.” I could tell when they felt bad, and I didn’t want them to feel any worse. Over time, I ended up with more and more on my plate. The team stopped using their initiative because they knew that I’d pick up the slack. It left me feeling overwhelmed. In my heart I knew I was being too soft on them, but what was I supposed to do? Yell and shout? How are you supposed to be hard on people if you have a big heart? My wake-up call came about a year into my last venture. I was raising money from a number of different investors and I’d sent an out-of-date financial model as part of the due diligence. When I opened my inbox, each of the investors had responded with a series of tough questions about the model. My stomach sank. I began to sweat. A surge of adrenalin and urgency rushed through me. How was I going to solve this issue? And more importantly, how could I ensure that it never happened again? Now imagine what would have happened if the investors had just said, “Don’t worry about the model. I’ll fix it later.” Would I have felt the same sense of urgency or ownership? Would I have been as proactive? Looking back on my career, the sum of those “oh shit” moments has had a massively positive effect on me. They’ve made me stronger in the face of failure, forced me to take more responsibility for my actions, and helped me become a much more proactive planner. Sweating is part of taking responsibility. In trying to reduce my team’s discomfort around failure, I ended up reducing their sense of responsibility at the same time. If I wanted my team to feel responsible, I needed to get comfortable with their discomfort. By stopping my questions when it got uncomfortable, I wasn’t helping my team to grow and learn. In the example above, the investors didn’t shout at me, blame me, or make it personal. They just asked tough questions that made me abundantly aware that I’d made a mistake. Questions are like flashing a light into a particular area of your mind. Sometimes, it can reveal a monster hiding in the shadows — something you’ve forgotten about, an assumption you’ve made. Asking tough questions is part of what holding someone to account is all about. By stopping my questions when it got uncomfortable, I wasn’t helping my team to grow and learn. Here are some of the questions I ask my team now after a failure: I resist the temptation to answer for them, and I try to hold the silence long enough to allow them to think before they speak. It’s particularly easy to let new employees off the hook for their mistakes. Everybody wants to make a good impression early on, and we might rationalize our leniency with thoughts like, “They’re probably just getting into the swing of things. I’ll give them the benefit of the doubt.” However, missing these early opportunities to ask tough questions makes it much harder to hold people accountable later. When I was hiring my last sales team, a new sales exec showed up on his first day completely unprepared. I took him aside and asked him to explain how he’d prepared for this new job. I kept asking questions to further reveal his lack of preparation. In the end, I said, “Listen — if you’re not better prepared tomorrow, you’re not going to last until the end of this week.” I remember seeing a sweat come over him. But what happened next was an incredible turnaround. He had the best second day of anyone in the company. And six months later, when it was time to promote members of the sales team to managerial positions, he was easily the best choice. Early feedback had a huge impact on him. He ended up taking his job far more seriously and became more successful as a result. To be a great manager, you have to get comfortable with allowing your team to take the pressure. Delegating responsibilities is how you help people grow and learn. If watching other people struggle is uncomfortable for you, think of it like this: It’s an opportunity for you to get out of your comfort zone by getting your team out of theirs."

What is impressive, is that 70% of the sales came from low-tier regions, the ones that are usually harder to reach with a traditional off-line retail strategy. Of course, the event began as entirely Chinese, but what’s new is that it’s going global: after Alibaba’s acquisition of Singaporean platform Lazada, it quickly spread out in South East Asia. So chances are that it will become the first real example of marketing export from China. Also this will be a sign of the Chinese new Soft Power. Of course, this event began as a huge discount opportunity, but it’s now shifting towards a moment in which brands show off their innovations. And it’s not just about Chinese companies. In the list of the most wanted products from abroad, Japanese ones lead the ranking, followed by American ones — with Nike accounting for a major stake — then Korean, Australians and even Europeans, with Germany always on the first spot. So, how to secure a place in this humongous sales event? The most successful business cases deal with a mix between online and offline activities, with a mutual exchange involving physical stores and social marketing, and in both cases they need engagement and interaction. Innovation doesn’t mean just product, but also marketing: so whether you want to set up a Casino mini-program in WeChat as Michael Kors (who also developed a pretty centered “Bags are better than boyfriends” slogan) or you may leverage on a perfect alignment between your online community and social media campaigns as Uniqlo, the main suggestion is that you approach this event in a strategic, rather than tactic, way. Thus, tackling it very early. For instance, right now, for the coming year. Watch this article video about 11.11 on Asialize YouTube Channel: https://youtu.be/18DgBTuuqNY"

Medium.com,Industry,Microsoft vs 996 and the Game Coder’s Grind,Business,https://medium.com/@lancengym/microsoft-increased-productivity-40-with-four-day-week-cce1fd55ee80?source=topic_page---------28------------------1," Tech employees all over the world are complaining of burnt out. Can Microsoft’s four days work week experiment change mindsets? I’
ve always quipped, if you find yourself working long hours all the time, either you are being exploited, or you are unproductive. China’s tech titans would probably not agree with me. Many developers by now would have heard of China’s ‘996’ culture — a reference to working from 9am to 9pm, six days a week. The fallout from Chinese tech employees suffering bad health and personal problems caught the attention of western media throughout 2019 — with the likes of Bloomberg, Forbes, New York Times and the BBC all covering the 996 culture. Github (the online mecca of coders) even had a top trending campaign on it, resulting in an anti-996 movement to ban companies accused of the culture from using open source code on Github. In a time of intense US-China trade war, this was a strange show of solidarity by western programmers with their Chinese counterparts. In a somewhat timely twist, news broke out in early November 2019 that Microsoft had conducted a four days work week experiment in its Japan office in August 2019. Offices were closed on Fridays for that entire month. It resulted in a 40% increase in productivity. Microsoft also imposed a 30 minutes limit on all meetings and encouraged remote communication. By the end of the month, the experiment also resulted in 23.1% savings on electricity and 58.7% reduction in printing paper. In reality, Microsoft was just one of many companies and academic studies that found that a shorter work week often led to happier employees and higher productivity. Is the theory proven then? An Ohio University study found that out of a typical 8-hour work day, the average employee spent almost three hours of it doing frivolous activities like reading news, surfing social media and chatting with colleagues on matters unrelated to work. Interestingly, 26 mins of it were spent looking for new jobs! This phenomenon isn’t necessarily because workers are lazy. The reality is, many research also showed that the average person can only work productively for up to six hours a day. Beyond that, concentration and productivity starts to fall off. Hence many would try to while away the time since they are obliged to stick around. I have a wide variety of professionals — almost 28k individuals now — from all over the world in different industries connected to me on my LinkedIn account. Over the past years, I have noticed a substantial number of corporate employees viewing and reading my posts during office hours. (Some companies consistently rank in the top three…so I’m pretty certain their productivity must also be consistently quite low…) Before we all rush out to scream for 6-hour days or 4-day weeks, consider this: most of the positive surveys on shorter hours or work days involved office workers. Indeed, in some professions like nursing, reducing work hours or days definitely leads to happier employees. But it could also result in higher cost for the company if pay remains the same. An experiment in Sweden with retirement home workers confirmed this. The home had to hire more workers to make up for the shorter shift hours. So businesses that need to operate 24x7 are out unless workers are prepared to take less pay. From the anecdotes and research that has been done, I would further posit that to introduce shorter or more flexible hours successfully, the following prerequisites should exist: I love Hasan Minhaj’s ‘Patriot Act’ series on Netflix. In each episode the comedian takes a dig at important issues with well researched materials. In one episode he exposed the slave driver ways of the gaming industry. Game publishers had gotten into a habit of imposing tight deadlines on their developers, and then firing them if the company doesn’t do well. This is possible for game publishers because there are no lack of willing young coders hoping to earn a prestigious name on their CV’s; and the glamorous lure of the industry’s big payoffs if a game strikes gold. The same could be said for many other domains within the tech industry that has the same sort of labor supply dynamics and glam appeal. Tech is also especially susceptible to this ‘chew and spit’ workforce culture due to the intense pace and competition within the industry. Innovations come hard and fast from all over the world. Barriers of entry for tech startups are low, since the business is mostly driven by intellectual property. The fight for market share moves rapidly and companies want to develop products and releases asap. So is there a dilemma here? The practical need for speed vs the exploitation of workers? In startup hubs across the world, young people work long hours to achieve their dreams of rapid growth and building the next big startup name. Would they complain about long hours? No, they thrive on it! There’s no contradiction between long hours and worker satisfaction. The link here is productivity vs rewards. Startup founders are willing to work long hours because they are fighting for their own dreams of big payoffs. Given ownership and the rewards associated with it, people who are willing to go after it will work harder. The converse is also true. If a person values work-life balance more, then he must be prepared to accept lower returns if his productivity does not create the sort of value needed to justify high returns. So honestly my own take is this: the number of hours spent working isn’t the debate here. It’s about what you want vs how productive you are. When there is a disconnect between the two, then there is definitely cause to re-examine both yourself and your choice of work. That said, may I also give everyone out there another piece of advice. A lot of us tend to ignore the “health is wealth” dictum when we were young. I was also guilty. There is no point becoming successful if you’ve spent your health to acquire the wealth. Success should be enjoyed, not lamented. Work smart, not hard."

Medium.com,Industry,Facebook Empowers Racism Against Its Employees of Color,Business,https://medium.com/@blindfb2020/facebook-empowers-racism-against-its-employees-of-color-fbbfaf55ab76?source=topic_page---------30------------------1," Facebook still has a black people problem. And a problem with individual contributors who are not white. This week, hundreds of African-American Facebook employees embarked to Menlo Park, California to be part of its annual Black@ event. This event was a global event, allowing us to hear directly from Mark Zuckerberg and Sheryl Sandberg about the importance of inclusion and empowerment, and meeting with colleagues who we may rarely see outside of the hectic day-to-day of the business. Many of us will then go to the AfroTech event in Oakland to share stories, network, and meet up with other engineers, designers, and leaders in the industry. We may be smiling. We may post on Instagram with industry influencers and celebrities. We may use the IG “Share Black Stories” filter and be featured on marketing pieces. We may embrace each other and share how happy we are to have the opportunity to work with a company that impacts nearly three billion people. On the inside, we are sad. Angry. Oppressed. Depressed. And treated every day through the micro and macro aggressions as if we do not belong here. Since Mark Luckie’s brave post nearly one year to this day highlighting the patterns of aggression against black employees, not much has changed. There may be a few more posters on the wall. There may be an effort to recruit diverse talent. But not much has changed to ensure that people are recognized, empowered, and overall treated equitably by their managers and peers. In fact, things have gotten worse, as will be illustrated here through the below incidents that have occurred over the past six months. The problem is not just with black employees of different genders. The below incidents are also reflective of behaviors against Latinx and female Asian employees. The experiences highlighted here invoke how we, the twelve Facebook employees present and past who are sharing our stories here anonymously, have been made to feel as employees by Facebook managers, HR business partners, and their immediate white colleagues. To avoid positively identifying the individuals involved, we will not name the people or business units involved. However, all of the below incidents are factual, with witnesses corroborating the behaviors, and have been thoroughly documented. Racism, discrimination, bias, and aggression do not come from the big moments. It’s in the small actions that mount up over time and build into a culture where we are only meant to be seen as quotas, but never heard, never acknowledged, never recognized, and never accepted. By contrast, our colleagues in the majority populations have been elevated, celebrated, and promoted for doing less than the work we have been tasked to do. We are remaining anonymous because Facebook creates a hostile culture where anyone who is non-white is made to feel fear for their job and their safety to report any bad behaviors. There is little to no equity in terms of responsibilities, ratings, and reviews. Bad behaviors from non-POCs are elevated while normal actions from POCs are treated as aggressive, angry, and abnormal. Even positive ratings are shared with a negative, threatening tone. If this post gets any outside attention, the response will be met by M team as “we view diversity as important”, “this behavior is not acceptable,” and “we will increase our efforts to make things better”. And then the cycle will repeat. Facebook is not doing the best it can, and it will continue to be hostile to POCs as long as middle managers and ICs in majority groups are not held accountable. The result of this negligent, hostile, and aggressive behavior from Facebook managers and representatives in HR has caused a significant decline in our physical and mental health and made it significantly difficult, if not impossible, to continue working. Unfortunately, as long as impact at all costs remains the theme at Facebook, nothing will change. We fear for our safety, our career prospects, and the potential spotlight, lest we be given media attention that we do not want or asked to testify to a Congress that will not take action. We simply do not have the resources to take action against Facebook. We cannot afford to be vulnerable externally because Facebook has made us a vulnerable target internally. The only thing we can hope for in this cathartic exercise is to influence change by sharing our stories and hope that no one else experiences the same discriminatory behaviors that we have. Because even when you try to shut us down, our voices matter. And no one will listen unless we speak."
Medium.com,Industry,Instacart Removes Worker Bonus After Shoppers Strike,Business,https://onezero.medium.com/instacart-removes-worker-bonus-just-days-after-shoppers-strike-625aa71cf6b4?source=topic_page---------31------------------1," nstacart told its workers Thursday that they will no longer receive a $3 “quality bonus” for every five-star rating they receive from customers. The company announced the policy shift in an email shortly after a three-day strike in which workers protested changes to how they are paid. Instacart’s decision reflects the unstable income of gig economy contractors — some of whom are now fighting technology companies for basic workers’ rights. “Over the last several years, we’ve experimented with numerous versions of the quality bonus, in addition to other boosts and incentives,” says the email, which OneZero reviewed. “During the last year, we offered a new version of the quality bonus and found that it did not meaningfully improve quality. As a result, we will no longer be offering the quality bonus beginning next week.” But a group of workers has accused Instacart of having a different motivation. The group received a tip implying that the company had moved up its timeline for the change from January 2020 to next week. “This is clearly a retaliatory act,” the group wrote in a Medium post titled “Instacart Has Retaliated Against Us,” which was later removed by the platform after it was “found in violation of the Medium rules.” A spokesperson for Medium, which owns OneZero, declined to comment on the post’s removal. The Instacart workers group later published an edited version of the post, which is still available. November’s strike, which ended on Tuesday, marked the fourth consecutive year that Instacart workers walked off the job over pay. In 2016, the app’s suggested 10% tip was replaced with “an identical-looking” service fee that went directly into Instacart’s coffers, not to shoppers, Instacart workers wrote in an open letter to Instacart founder and CEO Apoorva Mehta. The letter stated various ways that Instacart, which is valued at nearly $8 billion, has made negative tweaks to its tipping system and reduced wages. The app currently suggests a 5% tip atop a 5% service fee, which does not amount to a livable wage, say workers. (Customers can tip more if they choose.) Participants in the November strike took actions ranging from turning off the app to accepting jobs but not completing them (which slows down delivery), wrote Motherboard’s Lauren Kaori Gurley. Protesters demanded the company reinstate its suggested 10% tipping rate, which Instacart did not acknowledge, Instacart shopper Vanessa Bain tells OneZero. “We made a very targeted demand that would be virtually absurd to not comply with,” Bain says. Instacart declined to comment on the record about its removal of the bonus or its workers’ allegations. Bain, who has been an Instacart shopper for four years and is a representative of the labor movement, says the group was not told by Medium why its first post accusing Instacart of retaliation was removed. The updated version omitted the names of 628 people mentioned in the original who Bain said were corporate Instacart employees found on LinkedIn. Next to these names were questions such as: “How do you sleep at night knowing so many of us can’t afford our own groceries?” The growing insecurity Instacart shoppers report is a common refrain among gig economy workers, such as ride-share drivers and Amazon delivery contractors. Instacart has aggressively courted single parents and caretakers to enroll as shoppers — people who have a hard time securing alternative work, says Bain. And because many Instacart workers are independent contractors — a classification that regulations such as California’s Assembly Bill 5 are trying to change — their collective action is not protected by federal union laws. “Sometimes we’re given concessions while something else is simultaneously taken away,” Bain says. “This is the first time that something has only been taken away.” Have a tip about Instacart?

It was adored by investors, consumers, and the government…. *spoiler alert! Ofo is basically dead now.* On its surface, Ofo is one of the fastest-growing startups, acquiring new users at a speed that’s never heard before. But in reality, all Ofo has done is stockpiling a f**k on of shitty bicycles that end up in landfills. * More like a huge oof than Ofo* In a way, it sounds like my uncle, who got into one of those multi-level marketing schemes and packed his garage full with off-brand protein powders. Ofo was started by Wei Dai and his friends at Peking University, where they were able to achieve 4,000 uses/day within 2 months and received its seed funding of $1.5 million (9 million Chinese Yen). Soon after that, Ofo reached 200,000 users/day and went through 5 rounds of funding, totalling $200 million. VCs were literally fighting each other to get a chance to invest in Ofo. Even Alibaba invested in Ofo, it was INSANE. Ofo’s bike was actually quite innovative in terms of its technology. It beautifully combined the power of mobile payment solutions, such as Alipay and Wechat Pay and affordable wireless network access in China. Each bicycle has a QR code that can be scanned with Ofo’s app to unlock the bike. The bikes are also equipped with a GPS that tracks and displays where the bike is. This means you can leave the bike anywhere you want and start to ride any bike on the street you want. Hop on, hop off, anytime, anywhere. It was game-changing. On the other hand, it seems like shared bikes are profitable. When Ofo first started, it charged a 200RMB ( ¥200) deposit to start. Each bike costs roughly ¥650 to put on the market and ¥0.6/day in operating costs. Ofo was bringing over 10 new users for each new bicycle Ofo puts out. So if we maintain the same growth rate, and put out 1 million bicycles, Ofo will make: Deposit: ¥200 * 10 users/bike * 1,000,000 bikes = ¥ 2,000,000,000 Cost: 1,000,000 bikes * ¥650/bike +1,000,000 bikes * ¥0.6/ day * 365 days = ¥ 869,000,000 The Chinese Prime Interest Rate is 4.68%, meaning you are making at least ¥2,000,000,000 * 4.68% = ¥93,600,000 a year on the deposit. Ofo also charges for usages — roughly ¥1 for half an hour and Ofo bikes on average are used 3.5 hours/day, and 300 days/year. So, each bike also brings in ¥7/day. That’s ¥7/day * 1,000,000 bikes * 300 days= ¥2,100,000,000/year! In theory, Ofo would bring in over 1.3 Billion RMB Per Year! WTF?! Ofo has the technology, the capital, and a great business model, but how did Ofo go from 🦄 to 💩? Prior to Ofo and the sharing economy boom, China has seen a steady consolidation of its tech industry. A lot of investors got richer, but new investment opportunities became scarcer. There simply wasn’t much to invest in. Then, Ofo showed up pulling impressive numbers only seen from the likes of Facebook and Uber. The investors went full bananas…. While Ofo was the first to popularize the idea of a dock-less bike-sharing platform, it is far from being the only player on the market. Mobike, an almost carbon copy of Ofo, was founded shortly after Ofo by a group of former c-suite executives in the automobile and tech industries. These two companies quickly established a duopoly and controlled 90% of the bike-sharing market. *Too bad for those who love third-wheeling* But VCs want only one winner in the market, so they pushed both Mobike and Ofo to aggressively scale and focus on driving (cough, cough, or cycling) the other one out of business. Yeah, who needs a business model if you can get yourself a monopoly? Both Ofo and Mobike engaged each other in a fierce price war and scale war. *Yeah! Chinese biker gangs, with VCs and Tech!* For them, whoever can put out more bikes wins. Ofo waived the 200RMB deposit and pushed its price to as low as 1 RMB per month ($0.15/month) for unlimited rides. And Between 2016–2017, Ofo and Mobike put out over 40 million shared bikes all across China, that’s roughly 45 Amsterdams worth of bicycles. Wait, so we are essentially giving out bicycles for free….. It only gets worse from here. Let’s do some math. Ofo’s bikes cost around $100 and “designed” to have a 2-year useful life. But the reality is that Ofo bikes are so poorly designed and manufactured, they last less than 2 months. In other words, mathematically, Ofo will lose $100/24 months *22 months lost = $91.7 for every bike it puts on the market. Yeah….. not great…. On the other hand, Mobike’s design was a lot more robust and it does last a lot longer (8–12 months). BUUUUUT, for some reason, Mobike’s CEO disclosed that their bikes cost over $1000 to produce…. That claim was later dropped to a more reasonable $300, but that’s still three times more expensive than Ofo’s… Oh, remember the 1.3 billion/year profit figure? That’s a lie. There was no way that Ofo and Mobike can maintain the same level of utilization rate and user acquisition rate as their initial phases. There are only so many people who need bicycles and so many cities that have a transit problem. Eventually, the growth rate for bike-sharing will flat out, and the tires run flatter Let’s adjust the rates to something more reasonable and account for the price war. ¥0 deposit, and still a ¥650/bike fixed cost and ¥0.6/day operating cost, then each bike only brings in 5 new users (which is still a lot), and each user only pays a ¥1/month subscription. For every 1 million bikes: Cost: 1,000,000 bikes * ¥650/bike +1,000,000 bikes * ¥0.6/ day * 365 days = ¥869,000,000 Revenue: ¥1/month * 12 months * 5 new users/bike * 1,000,000 bikes = ¥ 60,000,000 So Ofo will lose ¥869 million-¥60 million = ¥809 million for every 1 million bikes, and Ofo put out 20 million bicycles by themselves…. So they burnt 16 billion RMB in a year….. on bikes that barely last a season….. That’s almost as fast of a burn rate as Uber…. but on bicycles… Do you think that’s all? NOOOOOO. It wouldn’t be Chinese enough if it just ends here. Ofo should have roughly ¥4 billion in security deposits sitting in a bank making interests, but surprise! That’s gone too! Ofo decided to use those security deposits to buy more bikes. You see, every bike you buy will bring in more riders, and they bring in more deposits. It is like a pyramid that keeps growing….. On that note, I will end this week’s Wacky Business Review here. Ofo had amazing potential and a great mission, but it was, in a way, murdered by greed and impatience. You could also say that Ofo bikes are better at being recycled than being cycled。。( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)"
