Medium.com,Industry,Investigating institutional betrayal in the wake of #MeToo,Work,https://medium.com/@rebrunksal/investigating-institutional-betrayal-in-the-wake-of-metoo-b22e377d87ba?source=topic_page---------0------------------1," I first learned of the impact our institutions can have on our wellbeing in 2015, in a 150-person lecture hall and a class on neurobiology. We were learning about the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis and it’s role as the stress control centre of the body[1]. These three structures in our body - the hypothalamus, and the pituitary and adrenal glands - communicate together when we experience stressful stuff. They pour us a hormone cocktail while our brain conducts risk assessments to try to understand whether we are safe or whether we are going to die. We are learning machines, so when these structures are used regularly they respond quicker, stronger and more attentively. They are primed and ready for an environment that has proven itself to be dangerous. When the system becomes maladaptive, they respond more frequently than we need them to. This often can occur in response to post traumatic or chronic stress [2]. It’s only through feelings of safety that we can retrain these muscles — this is why the support our workplace gives us in response to experiences of harassment, discrimination and abuse can be critical to resilience and recovery. It was here I was introduced to betrayal trauma [3], a concept that changed the way I looked at trauma and ultimately led me to pursuing this PhD. In our life, not all stress is experienced equally. We suffer more when we are betrayed by someone we trust. Interpersonal violations from family or friends cause more severe psychological and physical health outcomes than from strangers. This phenomenon has been documented in the childcare system, in the military, universities, churches, and others throughout scholarly research [4], especially in regard to sexual violence. Like betrayal trauma, institutional betrayal comes from the wrongdoings committed against us by an organisation or system we thought was there to keep us safe."
Medium.com,Industry,Are You Ready for a PhD?,Work,https://medium.com/@mina.mekhail/are-you-ready-for-a-phd-150a3835861?source=topic_page---------1------------------1," I don’t regret doing a PhD, but I do regret not having a clear sense of what I wanted to do next. I had vague ideas of ‘I will get an industry job after’, and ‘I will be graduating from a top ranking university, so I will be set’. I discovered later that I was not alone; many other PhD candidates were also unsure about their career paths, and even those who started with one conviction, ended up changing their mind. In one study it was shown that only 60% of new PhD graduates in STEM had a plan for post-graduation. That means 40% had no concrete plans regarding their future! This is why I am writing this article, to challenge you to begin with the end in mind. A PhD is a vehicle to get you somewhere, so know where you’re going, and know what tools you need to get there. I have asked many graduate students this question over the years and I have gotten diverse answers. From “I want to become a professor”, “I love doing research”,“9–5 jobs are not for me”, and — my personal favorite — “it will improve my social status and thus my marriage prospects!” What I found out, however, is that very few people who do a PhD know exactly what long-term career path they plan to pursue. The majority adopt the attitude of “I will cross that bridge when I get there”. Nothing could be more damaging to your career post-PhD than being complacent and ignorant about the future. You will be spending 4 to 7 years of your life obtaining a PhD, don’t you think it’s worth knowing how that investment will pay off? Universities have been advertising the diversity of careers that can be pursued by PhD graduates in order to attract student talent. However, presenting multiple career paths post-PhD can sometimes give a false sense of security about the future. Having more career choices can actually be harmful! Barry Schwartz, a renowned psychologist, illustrates in his TED talk that having many choices can lead to regret, continuous obsession with opportunity cost, escalated expectations and self blame. Therefore, knowing that there are many options should not make one feel safe and complacent. There should be a somewhat clear answer to the “why PhD?” question, which will dictate what career path to pursue afterwards. So take the time to dig deeper, self reflect, and be very honest with yourself. I found this article about why people want to become entrepreneurs very insightful, but you can easily replace ‘entrepreneur’ with ‘PhD’ and it still holds. I strongly agree with the author when he says: Uncovering and understanding those deeper motives is the first step toward becoming a successful entrepreneur [PhD] or discovering that you are not cut out for its punishing demands — the personal sacrifices, inevitable setbacks, relentless work, crushing time pressure, financial uncertainty and sleepless nights faced by 99 percent of entrepreneurs [PhDs]. You need to know whether your motivations are strong enough to carry you through an experience that can certainly be exhilarating, but also exhausting, calling on your deepest reserves of personal strength. (Emphasis added) If your motivation is honest, objective and clear, you will know what post-PhD career path you will want to take. Knowing ‘why’ will also give you the energy to keep going when the going gets tough. And believe me, it will get tough. If you have examined your motives, and have decided to pursue a PhD, then here are some suggestions to improve your chances of success following your studies: Beginning with the end in mind will not only enable you to accomplish your career goals but will also enrich your PhD journey and give you the much-needed drive to endure. This is your future, and ultimately you are responsible for your success. Take ownership of your career early, know what you want, and plan accordingly."

Medium.com,Industry,Project Manager: Leader or Administrator?,Work,https://medium.com/management-matters/project-manager-leader-or-administrator-77e95fa544eb?source=topic_page---------5------------------1," Is the project manager role viewed as a leadership or an administrative one? I’ve always believed that Project Managers are leaders, but I don’t know if I am alone in that belief. On the surface people will say it’s a leadership role, however as I’ve watched how people behave, I would say they truly don’t respect the role as a leadership one. Now, that also has a lot to do with the Project Manager themselves but I believe they get caught in this weird space that causes them to feel like they are nothing more than an administrator with all the responsibility of a leader. Usually, Project Managers don’t have any authority over those who are on their project. Having people on a project that report to others can be really confusing and difficult when it comes to leading a team to a productive and positive outcome. This can have a varying impact, so I thought I would list the top four issues as it relates to Leadership and Project Management and how to overcome them. The lazy or resentful team member. This “lazy” person is usually assigned because it’s the only person available to do the work. Sometimes those who are more capable have been assigned to other seemingly more important projects. You can also get the person who really doesn’t want to be on the project for whatever reason. I have found that putting the effort into getting closer to this person and understanding what motivates them as quickly as possible is the best technique. Building a bond of trust and encouragement as soon as possible is the key to getting them engaged. Get over whether or not you should “have to” motivate or get close to your team. If you feel that way, then you will always struggle with people on your project. The other thing I find that works is short milestones and checking in. Don’t confuse that with micromanaging. You aren’t telling them what to do, however, you are engaging often to ensure they are making progress. Not only does that help with trust and motivation, but it also builds their self-esteem as a valuable member of the project team. The team member who feels they know more or better. This person can be an extremely valuable person on the team if you can get them over their headiness. Instead of immediately bristling, lean on them for their expertise however make sure you do your due diligence that the information is accurate and not just the advice from someone who wants to sound or be important. It’s most likely this person has not been heard in the past whether it’s his own manager or the previous PM, so you have some trust to build. Also, it’s important to make sure this person can listen to and build on ideas. A project team works best and is the most productive when the team forges ideas, plans, and approaches as one. That means you need to make sure that one person isn’t bullying the team to be right and that others speak up to share their thoughts and concerns. The ultimate decision comes down to the technical lead, you and the board of the project but I would much prefer showing up with a well rounded and thought through game plan. So, use these people for their experience, let them know you count on them for their technical knowledge. That too builds trust and will most likely loosen their attitude. (As an aside, when I say technical knowledge I don’t mean IT. I mean the person who has the understanding and most technical knowledge of what you are trying to accomplish.) The team member who is assigned to many other projects or pieces of work. This is probably one of the most common hurdles you will face as a PM. I find the best way to lead through this is to build relationships with this person’s manager (who they directly report to) and other PM’s. Most PM’s I’ve come across spend a lot of time bitching about this situation and not much of any time trying to resolve it. The best way to lead through this issue is to take a two-pronged approach, so let’s take one at a time. First, building a relationship with their manager. This is more than just niceties. You want to be able to sit with them and understand how you can relieve that manager’s situation of having too many project requests thrust on them at once. You want to have a discussion about timings and agreements with the other PM’s. For example, maybe they have allocated your person 30% to another project, but you know they’ve hit a snag that is going to take some time to resolve but the PM is being greedy for fear of losing this person’s time when they need them again. That means you have a bit of negotiation to do with the other PM. Building relationships with managers is good as well because they start to lean on you for information on how their people are performing. Once you become a trusted confidant, then you become a priority for future projects. Two, building relationships with other PM’s. Sometimes you need to really negotiate these other PM’s and you can’t do that if you haven’t started to build that relationship. As in the earlier example, you could discuss with the PM that you have an urgent need and you know that they in a bit of a holding pattern. Negotiate that you will take advantage of their 30% allocation and promise to release this person as soon as their project is ready to go again. Having someone sitting on the bench is silly, so work on your negotiation skills. Also, nothing kills a relationship by not following through on your promises. So, if you promise to release him by a date…then release him. The stakeholder that goes around you. This is a tricky one and very similar to managing up. In my opinion, this is done in a two-pronged approach as well. First, you need to have a good dynamic with the project team so they will inform you when they are being pushed by someone else. Even if it’s still in line with your scope, you need to know that someone is interrupting. That means you need to thank them for informing you and not do something that puts them in hot water by speaking up. You want transparency, so you must act in a way that allows for that to happen. Second, you need to speak to the stakeholder. Explain that there are processes in place for a reason and that your purpose is to deliver a project that is in scope, on time and under budget and their involvement can risk those. Even those who are well-meaning can disrupt the flow of communication and then you might have one team trying to deliver two different things because there’s been mixed communication. That miscommunication will take time and potentially money to rectify. I do find that it’s more often someone is trying to help rather than taking over, but that doesn’t mean that protocol shouldn’t be followed. Usually, when you explain things simply and calmly, they get it. There are so many skills and qualities that make a Project Manager an excellent one. The key is to find the balance of leading and directing. While the PM ultimately does not make the large decisions, they do create and craft the best options for the Board to make the right decisions. That in itself is leadership. Leadership is also solving and leading teams through situations that can de-rail a project like problematic team members and stakeholders. If a PM can do those things, they are definitely a leader, not an administrator. Be a Connected Leader"
Medium.com,Industry,How to Remember What You Read: My Readwise Review,Work,https://medium.com/@blakereichmann/readwise-review-96604b4dee9?source=topic_page---------6------------------1," Have you ever read a book that inspired you to take action, only to have your motivation fizzle out a few days later? Or have you ever tried to explain a concept you recently read about only to discover that you can’t recall more than a few vague ideas? For the number of hours it takes to read a book, you would hope to have a better return on your investment. But books are, without a doubt, still useful for learning new concepts and developing new skills. So why is it so difficult to remember what you read? Perhaps the issue isn’t the books you read, but rather, it’s the passive process of reading that makes learning inefficient. If your objective is to optimize for understanding, then reading is still valuable, but it’s only one piece of the process that comprises your reading workflow. According to Readwise, transforming what you read into actionable knowledge and creative insight requires you to follow these steps: While you can perform all of these steps manually, Readwise is a tool specifically designed for avid readers who are seeking to get the most out of what they read. If you’re a casual reader who prefers only fiction for entertainment purposes or if you think e-books are a disgrace to the medium, then Readwise may not be for you. But before I explain what all Readwise can do, let me break down my reading workflow both before and after I started using Readwise. In the first step, I am only concerned with selecting information I consider to be the most interesting or useful. My traditional way of capturing ideas was by marking up a physical book with a highlighter and pen. While not the most efficient, it was an effective way of filtering for relevant information. Thankfully, capturing has become more efficient due to the invention of e-books. Reading books on a Kindle or another e-reader device has made highlighting passages as simple as a swipe of the finger. While this feature alone has greatly improved my capture efficiency, the note-taking function on the Kindle still leaves a lot to be desired. My capture phase also isn’t exclusive to just physical books and e-books. I am also interested in capturing ideas from the articles I read online and even audiobooks. But pulling notes and highlights from multiple media can be messy when done manually. Readwise helped solve this problem by becoming the sole platform for aggregating highlights from all of my information sources while creating as little overhead as possible. Let me explain what this looks like: The next step is to review the information I’ve captured. After all, what’s the point of investing a lot of time highlighting and taking notes if I never plan to do anything with it. But going back through a book to review it is tedious work and where I usually fail. My original review process was flipping through a book a week or two after I had read it to jot down any highlights I still found valuable onto flashcards. As you can guess, reviewing a book took serious time, effort, and self-discipline. It wasn’t long before I started to neglect this process by pretending that I had absorbed all of the necessary information I read while moving on to my next book. My review process provided a lot of value, but it was too much work to maintain on a consistent basis. The friction to review was too high so my system became useless since I wasn’t following through. “Much of the battle of building better habits comes down to finding ways to reduce the friction associated with our good habits and increase the friction associated with our bad ones.” ‒ James Clear Readwise solved this problem by simplifying my review process down to something I could easily stick with. It makes reviewing books easy (and fun) by sending daily emails of past highlights (more on this feature later) so the highlights I care about find me instead of me having to go search for them. I customized the email feature to send me a daily email of five highlights from past books I’ve read with an additional bonus highlight of a book I might find interesting. The highlights are hyperlinked to their location in their respective e-book so if I need more context, I can click on the highlight to return to the page its found on. The final step is interested in transforming the ideas you read about into tangible knowledge you can use. Originally, my only process for integration was taking the books I found most valuable and writing a summary of their ideas for my Book Notes page. Writing a summary of the ideas forced me to grasp the concepts so I could effectively communicate it back to my readers. Writing books notes has vastly improved my retention of the ideas read about, but it takes several hours to review one book. Due to the heavy time commitment, I have to be highly selective of what books I choose to review since I don’t have time to review every book I read. Books that don’t make the cut are likely to be mostly forgotten since I had no other effective method for integrating their ideas. Readwise improved my integration phase by providing additional methods for transforming the ideas I consume into useful bits of knowledge. Their most powerful method for integration is their Mastery feature which turns my highlights into digital flashcards that utilize active recall and spaced repetition for optimizing retention. The Mastery feature makes it easy to integrate any book I read since it takes a fraction of the time it would take to write a book review. Since I have control over which highlights become flashcards, I can focus on the ideas that are the most important to me. Readwise is software built on top of existing reading platforms — such as Kindle, iBooks, and Instapaper — that allows you to conveniently capture all of your highlights so you can review them later. While these reading platforms have their own highlighting feature built-in, Readwise’s features are designed to improve every stage of your reading workflow. Let’s dive into what some of these core features are and what they do: Here is a quick rundown of some of Readwise’s features: Readwise syncs all of your highlights into its dashboard in a matter of seconds. Instead of having to search for past highlights by flipping through every page in a physical book, you simply open the web app and are two clicks from having all of your highlights organized before you. This feature alone will save countless hours of review time. Being two clicks away from all of your highlights also reduces any friction associated with following through with the review process. Readwise gives you the power to organize and connect your highlights with it’s tagging feature. Use the search function on the dashboard to find a highlight instantly, give it a tag, and even add your own notes to it. This feature is particularly useful for performing a deep dive on a particular subject when you need to organize ideas across multiple books and articles. No more having to search for a specific idea by jumping between multiple books and web pages. If you’re a fan of Evernote, then you will be pleased to know that all of your highlights can be exported directly into Evernote. I use Evernote for creating outlines for future blog posts by taking notes alongside my imported highlights. Having my highlights saved in Evernote has helped streamline my idea creation phase since I have all of the information I need right in front of me. Readwise helps you stop forgetting what you read by surfacing your best highlights for review with their automated email feature. To help you stick with your review process, Readwise gives you direct control over how often (if ever) the emails are sent, what time they are sent, and even how many highlights you want to be displayed in each email. The highlights in each email are chosen by their resurfacing algorithm of “probabilistic spaced repetition” to maximize your retention. The Mastery feature combines the learning principles of active recall and spaced repetition to your notes and highlights. Used together, these two principles will significantly improve your memory of the ideas you read. Readwise incorporates active recall by converting your highlights into Q&A and cloze deletion (aka fill-in-the-blank) digital flashcards to maximize retention (think Anki, but automated). Once you have reviewed a highlight using an active recall method, it will prompt you to select how often, if ever, you wish to review the highlight again. Having the ability to manipulate the frequency of each highlight ensures you’re reviewing more of what matters most. You can also manually tune how often you see notes and highlights from each article and book you’ve read. I’ve been using Readwise for a year now, and it has quickly become one of the few emails I open and read every time. Knowing that my Kindle highlights will resurface in the daily email has encouraged me to be more proactive with my highlighting and note-taking. As a result, I end up retaining more of what I read while simultaneously being able to organize the concepts and ideas I’m interested in learning. While Readwise has become one of my favorite productivity tools, it is not without its flaws. As of this published date, Readwise does not have an app for Android (it does for iOS) but it does appear that they are in the works of adding it in the near future. If you’re only looking for a way to resurface past highlights, then the built-in highlighting features in Kindle or iBooks should suffice. But if you’re looking to improve your entire reading workflow to make the most of your self-education, then I recommend you check out Readwise for yourself."
Medium.com,Industry,People vs Resources — How your language fails your team,Work,https://medium.com/@maria.kucheryavaya/people-vs-resources-how-your-language-fails-your-team-428f522ba168?source=topic_page---------7------------------1," “We don’t have the resources to do this,” replies a product manager to a senior executive when asked about a new project. Everybody in the room, myself included, know perfectly well what type of resources he is referring to (for those not in the know “resources”=engineers). “We don’t have the people to do this,” I jump in and correct him. Everybody stares at me blankly for a second or two, one person coughs politely and the conversation moves on from “no resources” to “getting the resources.” I don’t intervene anymore, as the only other thing I dislike more than people being referred to as “resources” is long meetings. However, this exchange pushes me to reflect how managers’ words impact the remit and credibility of their teams. First, let’s look at the meaning of the word “resource.” By definition, a resource is someone without any form of individual identity, brought in to fill a specific need and disappear in the abyss of office plankton. Resource is someone mechanic, identical and interchangeable and meant to do as they told by someone who’s not mechanic, identical and interchangeable. “But don’t you hire people to fill a specific need?” I hear someone say. Well, maybe when I hire a handy man to paint my ceilings, yes, but not when I hire engineers, or product managers, or marketeers. I’m looking for people with passion, drive, and energy who are capable of much more than dutifully executing what someone else has written in their job specs. Now this is where I feel most managers would nod their heads and agree with me. We all want our teams to be motivated, creative and driven because we want our companies to be successful, relevant and strong. We spend hours putting together clever job specs to lure in people, weeks doing interviews with good people, and months onboarding and coaching the best people. We know they are ready, we believe in them, we spend a lot of time and energy to make them autonomous and empowered. And then we get into a room full of senior execs and routinely call our best people resources. And just like that, our top individuals, full of creative potential and ideas, have become interchangeable and mechanic, expected to do as they’re told. Months of hard work we put in evaporated. Teams morale and possibilities to do great things and offer new ideas significantly reduced. For anyone who’s still not convinced the language makes any difference imagine referring to your CEO as a resource. Does it feel right? I doubt it. P.S. To be clear my purpose here is not to shame anyone who’s referred to people as resources. I am guilty as charged and this lingo is industry standard. My purpose is to reflect and hopefully get others to reflect on the impact something as simple as language might have on the teams we manage."
Medium.com,Industry,10 Quick Life Hacks For Catapulting Your Career,Work,https://medium.com/@nicolascole77/10-quick-life-hacks-for-catapulting-your-career-87574380da11?source=topic_page---------8------------------1," We all have the same 24 hours in a day. When you see certain individuals achieve a level of unimaginable success, it’s not because they have more hours in the day than you. It’s because somehow they’ve figured out how to deploy those hours in a way that is more effective and more productive, and allows for compounding results. Whether your goal is to take your career to the next level or to just have more control over your personal schedule, these are the 10 life hacks you absolutely need to implement in your daily routine: I know I’m not the only person who lives by the mantra, “If it’s not in my mobile calendar, it doesn’t happen.” Success tends to be the result of being able to manage more with less–meaning you can handle 10x the responsibilities of most people, but with the same (or even less) effort. This goes back to the idea of working smart, not hard. So, with an increase in responsibilities, you can’t expect yourself to remember everything. In fact, it’s a waste of brainpower. Just set reminders and show up when you need to. It’s that easy. Building on the above, if someone emails you requesting a call–or if you email someone to schedule a call–always, always, always send a Google call invite. Not only does this ensure you don’t forget, but it ensures the other person won’t forget either. And more than that, it shows you’re on top of your game. You’re organized, and you’re going to be there when you say you’re going to be there. Do you have tons of calls this week? See if you can move them all to one afternoon, back to back to back. Do you have a bunch of video editing to do? Do it all in the morning, instead of doing some now and then some later. Do you need to think through a big pitch for a potential client? Block off an evening to focus on that and only that. By performing related tasks one after the other, you’re able to move so much faster. The reason is that you get in your flow for that one specific type of activity. Whereas, if you have a call, then try to edit a video for 40 minutes, then respond to two emails, and then hop on another call, by the time it’s 2 p.m. you’re going to be brain-dead and exhausted. Most entrepreneurs that live by this golden rule. When you start your day by checking your inbox, you immediately put yourself in a reactive state. You’re reacting to the day, to other people’s requests, instead of setting out to get done what you know you need to get done, first. Instead, start your morning with a tough task. Work through the hard stuff earlier on, and save the mind-numbing email tasks for lunch or later in the day. But don’t waste those precious morning hours responding to other people’s requests. They can wait. (And that’s not out of disrespect–just an awareness of protecting your time.) This is a severely undervalued professional life hack. I am a firm believer in doing free work in exchange for the opportunity to learn. Most people don’t think this way. They reach a certain level of success or status within their career and refuse to play that “intern” role ever again. I’ll be an intern for the rest of my life if it means learning the things I want to learn. I would much rather sacrifice a short-term financial gain for a long-term knowledge gain. Even today, there are people I work with for free purely because they know things that I want to learn, specifically from them. And you know what’s funny? If you’re good at what you do, that free work almost always leads to bigger and better opportunities. Most people don’t task risks–personally and professionally–because of money. For example, a lot of people don’t leap from your 9 to 5 to do something they really enjoy purely because they can’t stomach the financial risk. They don’t have enough saved up to make that sort of decision comfortably. OK, why don’t you have enough saved up? Probably because you spend more than you save. Having money in the bank is what allows you to take risks, build bigger ideas, and ultimately live a more fulfilling life. So, by any means necessary, work toward a lifestyle that allows you to save more than you spend. This, in itself, will change your outlook on life. Do you want to know the single most powerful professional life hack out there? Having a personal brand. When people know who you are, they reach out to you. When people know what you’re all about, opportunities come your way. When people know what value you can provide, they want to work with you (and only you). And all of those things come as a result of sharing what you know and putting yourself out there–a.k.a. building a personal brand. Whenever I explain this concept to people, the majority see it as a cost. “But it will take a long time for people to know who I am and what I do,” they say. And they’re right. It’s definitely an investment. But it’s an investment that pays returns you will never see by continuing to approach business one coffee conversation at a time. Building a personal brand allows you to scale your knowledge. And that’s power. Having commitments from 8 a.m. to 7 p.m. is not realistic. And it’s also not sustainable. A better long-term model (to ensure you don’t burn out, crash, and then spend a week recovering) is to deliberately schedule time to relax. If you have calls all morning, give yourself an hour to go grab lunch uninterrupted. If you have a crazy week, spend your weekend doing something to recharge. Laddering up in life means playing the long game. If you value an hour of your time at X, then anything below that cost, outsource. Delegation is one of the only ways you can really scale your time. And a lot of people struggle to delegate for two reasons: If you want to be a one-person show, then by all means, keep doing everything yourself. But if you want to scale your time and build something bigger than yourself, then you’re going to have to let go of some of that emotional attachment. Here’s a life hack most business people never talk about. Let’s say you start achieving a ton of success in your life. You go from being that young and hungry entrepreneur to an industry superstar. Now what? For most people, this is where ego gets involved. They start seeing themselves as better than everyone else. They take fewer meetings, answer fewer calls. They distance themselves from the world, because they feel like they have nothing left to prove. That’s a fast track to closing doors of opportunity. The bigger you get, and the more success you find, the more you have to work to stay open and humble. Continue to say, “Sure, I’d love to grab coffee” with people who reach out (assuming you can realistically make the time). Continue to answer calls, hop on smaller podcasts, share what you know, and give back. Giving, in itself, is a life hack that people forget exists. The more you give, nine times out of 10, something good comes back. This article originally appeared in Inc Magazine."
Medium.com,Industry,How Do I Know if Entrepreneurship is Right for Me?,Work,https://medium.com/@kristiandrus/how-do-i-know-if-entrepreneurship-is-right-for-me-7b8c27870fd1?source=topic_page---------9------------------1," Seven Ways to Know for Sure There’s a lot of hype about #entrepreneuriallife. Some of it’s real, some is a myth, and some of it, no one says out loud. I think that’s because it’s aspirational to a degree, and there are so many paths to success (or failure, as the case may be). Or maybe it’s because people think of themselves as having an entrepreneurial spirit or not, that you must cultivate a particular skill, or know some secret to success. There are seven key differences between being an entrepreneur and being an employee. Read through them and do a quick self-audit — does this context make entrepreneurship more or less enticing for you? If the answer is more, maybe making a strategic change is in the cards for you in 2020. Imagine getting up, working out, taking the dog for a walk, then waking the kids up, having breakfast as a family, dropping them off at school, kissing hubby as he heads to the office, and then diving into your day. Not frantically playing catchup to 368 cc’d: emails, but following your agenda, at your pace, scheduled ideally to your energy levels, your priorities, and focused on high-value, high-return, next-level strategies and business initiatives. Maybe you put in 2–3 hours of focused work, take a client call and a lunch break, get in 30–60 minutes in the garden, run to the market to pick up ingredients for dinner, pop by the spa for a quick facial, then create some content, engage with a few followers, and edit, then hit publish on something you’ve been working on for a few days. Then, you pick up the kiddos, watch a webinar while they play in the backyard, have dinner as a family, take your time through tucks, and read something inspiring, map out your next day, and outline your next post before you get 8 hours of sleep. There’s something priceless about doing what serves you on your time — when it’s best for your body, your brain, when you feel limitless and in the zone, when you are at your most productive and accurate, when you aren’t scrambling, but creative and invigorated. There’s also something incredibly valuable about scheduling appointments and errands when you need to, or when it’s your lull time, when you don’t have to commute, get coverage, or feel like you are dropping the ball on something else. And finally, there’s something genuinely evolutionary about spending time with your family every day, consistently being there, being present, intentional, and patient without feeling torn. All of that adds up to a better you = a more rested, more mindful, more fulfilled person who can give fully because her cup overflows. You may have a team or a co-founder, but for most entrepreneurs, you start as a solopreneur. While that doesn’t mean you don’t have support, outside influence, or a network to lean on, it does mean that most of the day-to-day decisions are your own. Depending on the size and complexity of your corporate organization, this can be a dramatic change. In most corporations, unless you are in senior leadership, you’re rewarded for specialized skills and decisions by committee. The better you get at something, the more it benefits your company for you to focus on that one thing, and to get buy-in before proceeding. That’s not to say you can’t and shouldn’t be aware of how your job fits into the bigger picture, or that you won’t be required to collaborate or lead, but your lane is your lane, and there is always oversight. In a startup, you wear many hats, but what’s that mean at a tactical level? It means that you must choose what is going to move your business forward at any given moment. Then when you break that strategy down into steps or goals, you must also decide which of those you can accomplish on your own, which it makes sense to outsource, and somehow identify what you don’t even know. Any of these things can take you down a rabbit hole and who knows where you’ll end up or how many of your minutes/hours/days will disappear. It’s imperative to not only set boundaries and hold yourself accountable, but you’ve also got to know your strengths and abilities and be able to quickly assess where you’re headed, what will make the difference, whether or not you can do it on your own, and how long you’ll allow yourself to work on it before you live with the results or move on. Those can be emotional decisions. There’s no one to run it by. You can’t run down the hall and ask someone to give you a quick gut-check reaction. And, for those of you used to having vast departments full of resources (and the budget to back up their initiatives), it’s all you: the budget, the execution, the vision. Now, before you run away from that level of responsibility, know this: If you have had the benefit of seeing that level of complexity in action, you know how to re-create it. And, even more importantly, you know what’s bureaucracy and unnecessary vs. what’s essential and efficient. You don’t have to recreate exactly what you had, and you shouldn’t. Build your ideal. Know what works in the context of what serves you, your vision, your clients, and your future. Huge. In Corporate America, there are a few different ways to make significantly more money. First, earn a promotion. Second, take a step up by moving to another organization. Third, start a side hustle. And all these options are limited to some degree. You might have topped out without someone leaving an opening. You may not see a future for yourself on your current trajectory because the role higher than yours isn’t a good fit. You may not be in a season where it makes sense to take more on. Your benefits may keep you tied to your current employer. There are a lot of reasons for stagnancy, complacency, and perhaps even contentment. Have you mapped it out? Sat down and modeled reasonable projections to know if you’re ever going to get where you want to go? I bet most of you haven’t, and it’s not because you don’t want to know, it’s because your hunch is you can’t get there on your current path, and the thought of starting over is too overwhelming. That may feel like an impossible situation and it’s keeping you stuck. If that’s your reality, I challenge you to look at the upside instead of the downside. Measure the gains, not the gap. How fast could you grow your own business? How many clients would you need to take on? What could you reasonably charge for your services? How much more income would you have to make to offset the benefits you would be giving up? Entrepreneurship isn’t a get rich quick scheme, it’s an opportunity to get paid what you’re worth and that can be very empowering and lucrative. When you are an employee, your employer expects that you’ll return more value than your salary to the company. The number I’ve heard thrown around is four times your salary. What if you started there? Imagine earning four times your salary for the value you deliver. Would that be a game-changer? In the same way that flexibility means freedom, time is relative because the lines between work and life may blur, but in a very different way than work/life balance. Work/life balance is compartmentalizing your life. It’s saying, “this is how much I can invest in my career before I feel like the other aspects of my life that are important to me feel neglected or begin to fall apart.” Likewise, “this is how much bandwidth I have for my family, health, friendships, or passions before my career starts suffering or takes a nosedive.” It’s a flawed approach because life is not a zero-sum game. You already know I don’t believe in that. Entrepreneurship is an opportunity to change your approach, but it’s not a given. Many, many entrepreneurs have the best intentions, but still trade time for money, and still get caught up in time traps. For example, if you don’t automate certain aspects of your business, when you aren’t working, progress will halt. That’s scary. The primary way your relationship with time can change is because you’re passionate about your work, and your work doesn’t feel like work. You’re excited, anticipating your future, investing in yourself, building something you believe in, learning things that move you forward, and taking on clients and projects that are personally and professionally rewarding. The second way your relationship with time can change is that you can commit to compounding activities. It means you do what you must do to see exponential growth, exponential results, to make exponential leaps forward. Even the most innovative, progressive, leanest companies struggle to move like that. No matter how excited you are about your vision, how visionary you are, or how ripe the market it for your idea, it will take quality fundamentals to execute. I’m torn frankly on whether or not you should get some experience before you go. Here’s why: When you’re young, you’re idealistic, and you can see solutions in a way that you can’t when you have the experience that came in the form of challenges, hurdles, and unfortunate realities. With age comes wisdom, but also fear, and the doubt that springs from knowing the myriad of obstacles that will inevitably get in your way, or fully appreciating how much you have on the line. When you’re young, you have a sense of anticipation, motivation, and enthusiasm that can propel you to great heights quickly. You also know what you know, and you don’t feel like you must know everything about everything to move. You’re agile and focused by default. Roadblocks may pop up, but not derail you. On the other hand, don’t overlook the very real, very potent advantages of maturity and expertise. When you’re young, what you don’t know may be what keeps you from succeeding. Over time, you’ve likely seen what works, what doesn’t, evaluated your strengths, overcame your weaknesses, and developed a broad perspective that makes it easier for you to assess your options in context. You know how to go from point a to point b or even point z without drama, false starts, without wasting time or money. You probably have perfected processes and activities that you can rely on to create and achieve things your younger self won’t develop for years. You trust yourself, have strong self-awareness, and have situational-tested skills to apply to your advantage. So, when it comes to your path, what’s your instinct? Do you have a single-minded purpose and does confidence come naturally? If both are true to a high degree, go for it now. You can always shift gears or hire experience when it comes to that. If you want a little seasoning, or are looking for a broader perspective, go the corporate route first, but don’t just go to go. Don’t look for a specific compensation package or a brand-name to put on your resume. Set a long-range agenda. For example, I was looking for world-class branding experience, inspiring senior leadership to learn from, international presence to appreciate global perspective, and real-life exposure. By real-life exposure, I mean I wanted experiences, access, and opportunities that were brand new to me and unachievable on my own. It was worth it for me to trade my time and talents to get that. But set a time limit. Get what you came for and stick to your deadline. Getting out may be the biggest trick of all. A company’s culture is the sum of all the behaviors of everyone is an organization, but when you are the entire organization, you embody the culture. Culture flows from the top, and it starts on day one. It actually starts from when you’re daydreaming about your mission and client user experience. It isn’t just about your behavior, what you stand for, or how you want your customers to feel when they use your product or service; it’s much broader. It’s your worldview. What do you believe about the world, what change do you want your company to influence, and how can you bring to life that vision and transformation through engagement with your brand? I worked in sports and media for 20-something years. 100% of the organizations I worked for or with, as an employee, client relations manager, or key account affiliate had the best intentions. They had grand visions, inspiring missions, and legitimate plans to be change-makers, to be all about the game or all about the story, to attract and retain employees and clients that were doing the right thing. And 100% of them failed. Their businesses didn’t fail; their culture did. At times, they lost sight of their why, and became about something else. It happens. Your “why” is a super-buzzy objective and impetus, but it’s also a vital northstar for your actions, decisions, and outcomes. Make sure it’s transcendent enough to take you the distance. Oh, and by the way, for those of you who just want to make money and don’t have a bigger game to play? That’s your prerogative, but I don’t buy it. This. This is crucial. 1) Time is our most valuable commodity, and all the money in the world cannot replace time. 2) Limited time means limited impact. 3) Building authority increases the value of your time. 4) Some aspect of your business must be digital to take full advantage of time. 5) If you don’t know how or what you want to spend your time on, you’ve got work to do, and I’m not talking about productivity or output. What are the people, places, passions, and opportunities that light you up? What will you regret not seeing, doing, or experiencing when you’ve run out of time? I’ve never added it up, but it’s highly likely that I’ve made more than 1 million dollars over the years. But because it wasn’t $1 million in one lump sum or $1 million for one project or creation, it didn’t feel like $1 million. I probably spent some of it wisely. I probably wasted some of it. I was perhaps intentional with some of it and clueless too. All that to say, earning is not definitive. Value means more. Impact means much, much more, and time means everything. Instead of setting up income goals and knocking them down, why not countdown your bucket list? Or measure the milestones of your life? You’ve got to get to a place where the world rewards you for being you, where what comes easily or naturally to you is invaluable, and what you want to bring forth in the world is also what people want to pay you for. It’s the only way to break the cycle of trading time for money. Entrepreneurship might be the answer."
Medium.com,Industry,Redefining Work Life Balance,Work,https://medium.com/across-the-line/redefining-work-life-balance-405b1e3ae25b?source=topic_page---------10------------------1," Work life balance has become one of the main factors for people when it comes to evaluating job opportunities. It has always been synonymous to sensible working hours and the balance is measured by the time spent inside and outside of work. I recently started to form a different view about work life balance because I think the balance is not about the hours, but it’s about something much deeper. In a work life context, we tend to view balance as equal and we are happy with splitting half of our waking hours between work and leisure. However, I think in a general sense balance doesn’t necessarily mean equal. Balance simply means that the proportions are correct and that is where the difference comes in. Let’s take cooking as an example, if we want to cook a dish with balanced flavours, we are not adding equal amount of all the ingredients, but a correct amount of each that works together to form a balanced flavour profile. I see work life as being the same, if we seek a balanced lifestyle, we need to find the correct proportion that works for us. This is a little trickier to define because it is largely subjective and it differs from one person to the next. That’s why I believe the way we have been viewing work life balance is not quite adequate for this generation of talent and new ways of working. I want to redefine work life balance and hope that we can change the status quo with an alternate perspective towards the matter. Having a siloed life with clearly defined time slots for work and leisure is not balance, it is at best organised. In order to achieve balance, we need to integrate different aspects of life and have them working in harmony with each other. While the siloed approach might have been acceptable in the industrial working era, it shouldn’t be accepted in this modern digital world. We spend a significant amount of time working and it would be a real shame if we left it compartmentalised. What I mean by integration here might look quite different from person to person. For some, it can still be a fixed window of working but for some, it can be much more flexible. The key here simply is that a well balanced work life is one where we can work in a way that doesn’t significantly limit how we want to live. This current 9 to 5 working style is a relic from the past where factories ran at specified hours and everyone had to start and finish work the same way. It was designed that way to maximise efficiency since work was largely manual at the time. If we can all recognise that we are no longer in the past and the nature of our work has changed significantly since then, we must also recognise that we need to update our definition of work life balance. So let’s explore what balance looks like in this new world. Because the new work life balance is personalised, we can no longer measure it simply by working hours. We have to look at our ways of working as a whole and here are some key aspects that I think are important for me and how I would go about finding balance. There are many different ways for people to work together and you won’t fit into all of them. It’s important to find people that share similar values and styles so they will understand your needs. It is not about finding an echo chamber, but to find your tribe that can compliment your working style and support your needs. For example, if you need to work remotely for personal reasons, you should find a company that encourages remote work rather than just tolerates it. Some people prefer to be connected 24/7 with their work and some people prefer to be away outside of working hours. But the convenience of emails and text messages has pushed this balance all to one side. It is important for us to set boundaries with our colleagues and have a mutual understanding of how each other would like to work. This doesn’t just apply to communications, it also applies to other work “obligations” like team meetings and after hour social events. It’s ok to say no to those and companies need to understand and respect that boundary. In order to create full integration between life and work, we need to engage fully in both activities. The best way to find the balance is to find a job where you are motivated to do, engagement has nothing to do with the role or the job, it has everything to do with you. Finding an environment where you are excited to do your best work is key and when we are spending time with full engagement, the hours no longer matter. People change and their balance will change with them, it is important to stay flexible when it comes to finding balance and re-evaluate your needs from time to time. Work life balance needs to be a dynamic state that both the individual and the company work together to find constantly. There will be times where work requires more from their people and the balance shifts one way, and there will be times where individuals require more from their work and it shifts the other way. The key is to keep the balance in check most of the time because that’s what makes work life sustainable. So what can we do to get there? I think work life balance requires a collaborative effort from both the employers and the employees. Work life balance is not a perk for the employees, but a way for employers to show their staff that they matter to them more than just a number. We have built massive systems in the past and somehow when we shifted our needs from organised factory workers to innovative individuals, we forgot to change the rigid working systems to accommodate that. I hope to see some of the following changes in the future. Companies need to start recognising the individuality of their people rather than seeing them as interchangeable parts of the system. I am not against systematic approaches, but we need to recognise that people are individuals. We cannot simultaneously ask them to ditch all of their individual quirks and be part of the machine and at the same time demand creativity and innovation from them as individuals. If we truly believe that people are the most important part of business, then business leaders need to start shaping their systems around them. When we can finally see people as individuals rather than systems, we need to foster an environment for collaboration. Collaboration is a give and take process between people and companies need to encourage that rather than get in the way. Everyone has their own preferred ways of working, some people might need to work from home more and some might need to start their day later. It is difficult to build a system that suits all the needs, but the point is that a system doesn’t need to exist in the first place. People are great at finding ways to work with each other and all that companies need to provide is an environment for them to do so. Let go of useless rules and processes and focus on what you want your people to achieve. There are many ways to fail and only a few ways to succeed. While management is important, it should only be used as a way to support the leadership. You can’t manage people out of a crisis, you can only lead them out of one. Business leaders need to start thinking more about what they want to achieve and letting go of unnecessary management processes that dictate how people should work together. Trust your people as we are born to socialise and collaborate with each other. This new work life balance we talked about is not hard to achieve, as a matter of fact, it probably takes less effort to implement. It hasn’t been done because it has always been “easier” to manage people by the numbers while killing any individuality in the process. By redefining work life balance, we are trying to acknowledge that each and every single employee is a person with different needs. It is a nightmare for a system to handle that differences, but lucky for us, we actually just need people to work with each other and collaboration is part of our nature. As employers, we need to start rethinking what is important to the business, people collaborating with each other and working towards the company goal? Or people coming into work at a certain time every morning? As employees, we need to stop settling for a job that doesn’t give you the balance that you want. We need to vote with our feet and find an environment that appreciates us as individuals and encourages us to bring our full engagement to work. Life is too short to have a third of the time doing something that doesn’t excites us. I hope that one day work life balance is no longer a “perk” that companies advertise on their job descriptions, but it is the status quo because it should have been all this time."
Medium.com,Industry,"Mean, Median and Mode",Work,https://medium.com/@shefaliohara/mean-median-and-mode-c1d681df3fae?source=topic_page---------11------------------1," As a young boy, a friend of mine, let’s call him William, was trying to choose a career. He decided he had three options — a chef, a rock musician or a computer geek. He enjoyed cooking, playing his guitar and programming and he knew he was at least reasonably talented in all three. I asked him how he made up his mind. “I chose programming because it was the most practical,” he said. “Do you ever regret your choice?” “Not really… and I’ve kept up the cooking and playing guitar as hobbies.” “When you were making your decision,” I said. “Did you use mathematics?” “Well, I did look at average salary…” “Ah,” I said. “But did you look at mean, medium or mode?” I laughed at his puzzled look, though of course a few seconds later he got it. The reality is that when comparing, say, a career as a rock musician vs. a career as a programmer, if you just look at the mean, you might think the compensation is very similar. That’s because the mean is what most people consider average. Let’s put this in concrete terms we can all enjoy… Let’s say that you have 10 people who are rock musicians, 10 that are computer programmers and 10 that are chefs in fine restaurants. Furthermore, let’s assume these are representative samples of their respective fields. What might the distribution look like? For the numbers below, I loosely referenced sites like Glass Door. Among rock musicians, we’ll have everything from the guys who play for tips in your local bar to Steven Tyler. Doing a quick google search, we find that Tyler drew a salary of $13 million last year, but the guys playing for tips might be lucky to clear $20 a night. So here’s a possible distribution of annual rock musician salaries, assuming we also have some who make a decent living playing gigs at weddings and high school dances: $900, $1500, $1800, $2200, $15000, $26000, $33000, $48,000, $160,000, $13,000,000 Among computer programmers, the distribution is much more symmetrical. Typically a kid fresh out of school starts off making about $60,000 a year and someone with 10 years experience tops off around $120,000, with a few specialists making significantly more. Let’s say the annual distribution looks like this: $57,000, $60,000, $63,000, $71,000, $82,000, $90,000, $98,000, $110,000, $125,000, $160,000 Finally, among chefs — I hate to tell the aspiring cooks out there, but chefs are known to work long hours for relatively low compensation. However, a few do become executive chefs, who earn more, and some may sell books, own restaurants or catering businesses. A rare few become celebrities. For the celebrity salary, I plugged in Ina Garten. The distribution is probably more like that of the rock musician than the programmer: $23,000, $26,000, $34,000, $42,000, $53,000, $60,000, $62,000, $92,000, $120,000, $5,000,000 If we only considered the mean for these three careers, then we might decide becoming a rock musician is the way to go, since the mean salary for is $1,328,840. The mean salary for a programmer, by contrast, is just $91,800. Meanwhile, the mean salary for a chef is $551,200. So looking only at the mean, it seems my friend made a horrible decision by becoming a programmer… yet things look very different when we consider the median. The median is the half-way point. If you line up a group of numbers from lowest to highest, the median is the number in the middle. Since I went ahead and decided on 10 people per occupation, the median would will be the mean of the middle two numbers. So, for rock musicians, the median salary is the mean of $15,000 and $26,000, or $20,500. For programmers, the median salary is $86,000 (the mean of $82,000 and $90,000) and for chefs, the median salary is $56,500. This gives us a much more realistic look at what the compensation might look like in these three disparate fields. It also shows us how much one outlier can skew the mean. For someone thinking about a practical career path, it seems pretty obvious that while you are unlikely to make millions as a programmer, you are guaranteed to make a good income, assuming you can get a job. However, chefs make a salary that is at least a living wage, with some sliver of a chance of making it big. However, salary is not the only thing to consider when choosing a career. We also could look at things like working conditions and work/life balance, job prospects, flexibility and so on. I know one lady who is a classically trained French pastry chef. Originally from France, she now runs her own cafe here in the Austin suburbs. She does not make as much money as she might have if she’d chosen to be a programmer, but she is able to leave work at 2 pm every day so she can be home with her child after school. Her cafe is only open through lunch. She prefers this type of flexibility to a job that might pay her more but not allow her as much time with her family. At the other end of the spectrum, being a musician can play havoc with family life. Bruce Dickinson of Iron Maiden solved this by piloting the band’s own plane, which carries not only band members and crew but also their families. Everyone knows the family that rocks together stays together… Getting back to the math, I haven’t really gone into mode. I think once you have the mean and median, you have a pretty good grasp of what different careers might pay you. However, mode might be a final useful metric. It tells you the most common number to show up in a list. Looking at my salary distributions above, we don’t see any any repetitions, however we can see clusters. For rock musicians, it seems that the largest cluster is at the lower end of the range. For the programmers, there is a more progressive distribution. For chefs, it seems pretty scattered. Hopefully using these three formulas for “average” will help you when you are making crucial decisions, and hopefully this article has shown you how you can use mathematics to glean more information from the facts at hand."

Part of it commuting. But more than 70 percent (some stats are as high as 85 percent) of workers hate their jobs, and/or their managers or bosses. Most managers don’t know how to manage people. Who can blame them? They are never taught how to. Many companies are not investing in training their managers at all. Companies promote employees to this new position and then leave them out to dry — one of the most critical positions in a company. So things are stacked against you in this regard. What is your job costing you? What are you having to give up or sacrifice because of the job you hate? Sleep, your health, money, time, relationships, advancement in your field, co-worker friendships, etc. How many times have you heard about people who end up physically sick, depressed, divorced, or abusing substances because they’re miserable with their careers? I was one of those people, https://medium.com/@spage7/how-i-survived-a-life-sucking-job-d2a7d6bf865b. What if they liked their jobs instead? Couldn’t significantly improving attitudes toward work have a significant impact on the health and welfare of our society? If you are working in a negative or toxic workplace, or are dealing with a workplace bully, then your job is really costing you some valuable things. Versus bringing value to your career and life. The latter is obviously what any sane person would want. Ok, so you realize that your job is costing you more than you would like, then why are you afraid to leave it? If your job was your boyfriend, why haven’t you dumped him yet? Here are some reasons why we fear leaving a job. You may be looking at or even interviewing for new jobs. However, you are afraid of new tasks, new people, a new boss that you don’t know, or a new environment. We can often feel that the bad things we are dealing with now, at our current job, will exist anywhere we go. Or, that they might be even worse somewhere else. And, the devil we know is better than the devil we don’t know. Well, there are ways to overcome this. Review the job description, skills, and tasks required, really well, so that you know what you’re getting yourself into when you first take the job. After the fact, you need to look at what things you are good at? What things do you need to work on? Make a plan to improve yourself for your current position, or a new one. Ask lots of questions about a potential new job. It’s ok to ask to meet the team. It’s ok to ask about the physical work environment. After all, this is where you will be spending the next however many years working. Then, at some point, you just have to take a leap of faith that whatever the new job entails, you will be able to handle it. And, if you did your homework, it will, at the very least, be better than what you have now. As mentioned before, you may be afraid of new tasks (rejection, criticism), new challenges, and new expectations that you think you might not be up to. But there are lots you can do in this area. Reach out to people you may know in the same job area and get advice from them. Take training in what you will have to be doing to make sure you know it inside and out. Take training in other general areas like critical thinking, leadership, writing, remembering, etc. to be a better employee. There are also tons of resources now to learn anything online, for cheap. There’s Udemy, Lynda, Udacity, Edx, and Coursera, to name a few. You can read some books like “The 7 Habits of Highly Effective People”. You might be afraid of doing well and what comes with that. How it may change things for you. For example, people expecting more from you, and you’re not sure if you can deliver. But that’s the point of progress, or getting promotions. Continually moving forward with bigger and better challenges. And, you do your best to overcome the next challenge. And then the next. To get to the next level, you use what you’ve learned and experienced in your past positions. Do your research and be aware of what will come next in your career path. What is the next set of requirements and expectations? Or, you might not feel you deserve success because you have been the receiver of a lot of negative feedback over the years. In this case, you have to work on your self-esteem and believing in what you know, can do, and have achieved. This is always hard for a lot of people. Everyone wants more money and benefits, but they are unsure of how to ask for it, or how to explain why they deserve it when asked. (14 Tips For Getting A Raise When They’re Not Handing Them Out) You need to be able to speak up and advocate for yourself. You should be able to provide a list or description of what and how you have been able to overproduce or overachieve in your job over the past year, or whatever time period is appropriate. You need to be able to provide “evidence.” An example from my past is when I was working on a database team. There were supposed to be four of us. That number quickly went down to three, then two, then just myself. I had to work a lot of overtime to keep up, and needless to say, I was not happy. I expressed this to my company, and they asked me to hang in there. I continued to do my job well and kept up with everything. As time went on, I documented all the major things I had achieved or took care of, and all the extra time I was putting in. I put this information in my self-evaluation and let my manager know via email. And, as the customer was happy with my work, I asked them to send emails to my manager and me indicating this. You have to be willing to ask for proof of positive feedback. This is so important. When the end of the year came, I received a $5,000 bonus AND a $5,000 salary increase. It paid off! And we got more people. So the long hours were not going to continue. Yes, you probably will. This means you will have to get out of your comfort zone and learn new things, get better at other things, and maybe speak in front of people and present to people. Again, know what will come with the new territory and prepare for it. This is a given. If you want more respect and more money, then you should be able to do things at a higher level than what you were doing previously. You want to feel valued and desired by your company. You want them to fear losing you. Sometimes, it may even be plain laziness. But some people just don’t like change. We are actually, by nature, programmed to resist change. But it’s how we manage change that makes the difference. We can choose to embrace a new job as a new beginning. In this situation, you just have to again look at what you are giving up, and decide if it bothers you enough to do something about it. Some people just like to complain and feel like the victim. But at some point, you have to take action; otherwise, you are your own problem. Some people will just never leave. There are things that are learnable, and above all, doable, to overcome these fears and get a better, more fulfilling job for you. This, of course, assumes that you want to advance in your career. There is a great book on change called “Who Moved My Cheese?” Think of it like this. Are you getting recognition? Advancements? Are you getting raises? Are you getting adequately paid at all? Do you know why you didn’t get a raise or a promotion? Are you getting trained by your company? Are you being set up for success or failure? In general, your job should be getting you somewhere in life. Unless you are comfortable with doing the exact same thing for the same amount of money (actually less over the years). This is outside of whether or not you are dealing with a toxic workplace. But it becomes even more of an issue if you are. The negativity can cause you to slide backward, either because you cannot perform at your best, or because someone you’re experiencing negativity from is blocking you from achieving all you can. They may be directly in the way of a raise or promotion if it’s your boss or supervisor. For me, moving around a bit between jobs has actually benefitted me well. Now granted, I am considered a contractor. So, the time at most of my positions has been determined by the contract I’m working on. It may have been for a year, or it may have been for three. Sometimes it might have been for three years, but then the customer decides it doesn’t want to continue with the contract after the first year. So there can be a lot of moving around from job to job. But, it has been from a good job to a better job. And from good pay to better pay. And I don’t have a degree. But, I always put a lot of thought and work into my next desired position. And, surveys are showing that this moving from job to job, is becoming more the norm. So you shouldn’t be worried about it looking bad on your resume. Especially if you can explain it well. You also have to really be able to negotiate on your own behalf, as I mentioned above. You have to be able to highlight your best features and justify what you’re asking for. To do this, you need to create a plan. This requires that you get out of your comfort zone, do some research, and do some work. There’s no way around it. If you want a better situation, you’re going to have to work for it. No one is just going to hand you your dream job without a boss to report to and making $500,000 a year. Unless you start your own business. But that’s a topic for another day. So, I talked about your fears holding you back from leaving a negative or even toxic job and achieving more in your career. I have just scratched the surface here of what one can do to leave a bad job. Let’s help each other break out of our fears and our comfort zones to be able to achieve what we deserve and more, in our careers. Life is too short to waste time sitting back. By sitting back, you are losing money, opportunity, and, most importantly, your health. We need to take action now so that our jobs don’t become a “life sentence.” http://gettingaheadatworklife.com/"

Medium.com,Industry,"Sometimes, Being a Programmer Sucks",Work,https://medium.com/better-programming/sometimes-being-a-programmer-sucks-7be2696dc09f?source=topic_page---------16------------------1," We’ve read the stories and watched the videos about people going into work late and leaving early while only writing a few lines of code. They talk about how excited they are and how the horrible world they used to know no longer exists. They're making good money now, going into work late and leaving early, and eating free lunch every day. Sounds like the dream job, right? A lot of online resources talk about the good side of being a programmer, but let me shine some light on the bad. First off, being a developer today is somewhat of a big deal, and there are lots of people trying to get into the field. People are finishing boot camps, dominating their classmates at an Ivy League school, and even learning on their own. All this just to become a programmer. So, I don’t say it lightly: Being a programmer is a very hard but rewarding job. I remember when I earned my first dev job. It was the first time that I felt marketable in today's economy. It’s like joining a cult or declaring that you're in a gang—that’s how proud I was. When someone was to ask what I do for work, I would stand with broad shoulders and say with a stern informative voice, “I… am a software engineer.” I was proud, and this proudness would shine, circumventing its way back into others I came in contact with who had the same dream as I. Most people only talk about the benefits and positive aspects of becoming a programmer. So, let me shed some light on the bad that I have experienced."

Whatever it is you’re doing, you’ve finally arrived at the point where you can call yourself a self-taught developer. But the question then becomes — now what? There will always be someone out there better than you, who knows more and can code more effectively than you. At what point can you upgrade yourself and begin to say that you’re a real developer? It’s hard — especially if you’re coming from the self-taught track. Those coming from a computer science degree track will always have an edge over you. This is because they have something you don’t: at least three years of intensive study of the inner workings of computer programs. It ranges from algorithms to thinking theories that may make them, by design, a better developer than you. But the mark of an effective and efficient developer isn’t based on a degree alone, nor can it be judged based on the number of years in the game. Every developer will experience different levels of work pressures that determine the speed and quality of their output. Code intuition is built through experience, namely past failures — because when things go well, we don’t really learn. It’s when we have to fix things that the real code lessons are taught. Here are nine things you should consider doing to expand your mind and experiences and upgrade your practical skills beyond coding tutorials."

Having worked as a developer at various businesses and agencies, I know this relationship can go from good to bad in a heartbeat. Us coders face a dilemma while working within a team: to be productive we need as little distraction as possible, but we also need to stay in regular contact with managers so they can monitor the status of a project. While also dealing with the stress of what can go wrong while coding — bugs, server crashes, rogue commits, etc. —we’ve already got too much on our plate to deal with relationship management. For developers and project managers, our interests are aligned: at the end of the day, we need the same tasks to be completed to get paid. So, we should make it our mission to create a good relationship with each other. When unstable, it spells disaster on any project: the tension, stress, and awkwardness mean we can’t communicate effectively so they aren’t completed on time or on budget. But during my development career, I’ve found ways to capture the best of both worlds: minimal distraction and maximum connectedness. I’ve not only honed my coding skills but also made an effort to improve my interpersonal skills to address this dilemma. After a lot of trial and error, I’ve found that to create amazing software and maintain good relationships with coworkers, it all comes down to thinking a little outside the box in certain situations."

I totally understand the appeal. In fact, when I was building companies, I often justified my 16-hour-days by arguing that at least I was working according to my own schedule. Surely you see the paradox. When you’re working a 16 hour day, it doesn’t really matter who’s schedule you’re following since you’re filling every waking minute with work. In retrospect, I’m not sure how I fooled myself into believing I had freedom. Regardless, I genuinely believed I was in charge of my own destiny until, finally, I took a job at a big company (well… a university… close enough). Yes, I have a boss now. I no longer “work for myself.” However, the biggest difference isn’t that someone else can control what I work on. The biggest difference is that only one other person directs my work. In contrast, when I was working for myself and running my own companies, I had thousands of bosses… I just never recognized them for what they were. You’ll work for your employees Running my own company meant my employees were my bosses. While they technically worked for me, in reality, I spent every day working for them. They would tell me what they needed in order to be successful accomplishing the work they’d been assigned, and then I’d spend most of my time trying to provide those resources. This was particularly true when running venture-backed tech companies which were largely pre-profit. Since the companies operated at a loss, we constantly relied on venture capital to keep the lights on and pay salaries. If I couldn’t raise more money, people had to be fired. Did I want to spend weeks at a time fundraising? No. But I was doing it because that’s what my company (and its employees) needed me to be doing. You’ll work for your investors Since I was running venture-backed tech companies, my investors were my bosses. They were my bosses because they sat on my board and could, theoretically, fire me. Granted, investors always want to avoid firing their CEOs, but it was certainly a possibility. Regardless of whether they were or weren’t going to fire me, my investors were my bosses because they regularly made demands on my time for updates, board meetings, reports, and so on. When they did, I had to stop what I was doing and serve their needs. Did I want to create report after report and slide deck after slide deck to explain what was happening in my company to people without day-to-day knowledge of the business? No. But I was doing it because that’s what my investors needed me to be doing. You’ll work for your customers While employees and investors are important, my most important bosses were my customers. Ultimately, I was operating a company for them. It was my job to figure out what they needed and deliver it. If I didn’t, they wouldn’t hesitate to fire me. When customers needed things my employees couldn’t provide, I was the person who got the call. Depending on the value of that customer to the company, it could mean running point on a critical new feature or flying across country at a moment’s notice to save a contract renewal that was looking shaky. Did their needs align with what I wanted to be working on? Never. Did I work on what they needed instead of what I wanted? All the time. We’re always working for other people Yes, I officially have a boss now. Yes, he can tell me what to do. For example, during the summer he said I looked overworked and told me to take a week off. What a jerk, #AmIRight? When I was my “own boss,” can you guess how many times I told myself to take a week off? Never! And when I did take time off, either for sickness or because my car broke down or even for “vacation,” I never truly unplugged. Instead, my “time off” always stressed me out because “vacation” just meant having to stay up late into the night doing all the work I couldn’t do because I spent the day “relaxing” and “enjoying myself.” Yeah right… you try relaxing and enjoying yourself when your company is burning money faster than it’s making it, you’ve got employees expecting paychecks, and you haven’t hit the metrics you need to raise another round of funding. In contrast, now that I only have one boss, I look back on my time “being my own boss” and I chuckle. How could I have been so naive? When I was my own boss, I never got to work on the things I wanted. I never even had time to do things like write this article. Worst of all, every minute I spent not working on my company felt like I was letting down the people who — theoretically — worked for me."
Medium.com,Industry,How my style changed when I became a software engineer,Work,https://medium.com/@jamesonzaballos/how-my-style-changed-when-i-became-a-software-engineer-7c3e2dc27151?source=topic_page---------22------------------1," TL;DR While I dressed a bit more formally as a PM, I changed my style to being more casual as a dev, as it fit the audience I interacted with. This set a tone for those working with me. I used both styles to leverage the situation I was in, and you should, too. P.S. If you’re ever looking for free fashion advice, feel free to shoot me a message, and I would be happy to lend an eye. It’s August in Austin, and despite it breaking triple-digits in temperature almost daily, I’ve decided to show up to work in a cotton two-piece suit. You can see it in the picture above. I’ve got an interview for a new development gig, and despite the fact that not a single person on the new team wears suits, I’ve shown up for an interview in one. A suit. For a software engineering job. It’s quite possibly rule zero of interviewing: don’t overdress. This wasn’t some blunder, or laziness on my part. I also knew this wasn’t going to be how I dressed if I ended up taking the job (which I did.) This being said, I was very intentional about which suit I picked. It wasn’t charcoal. It was unique and a little bit quirky. It also made a big statement. Miraculously, that statement wasn’t “I have no idea what I’m doing.” Rewinding a bit here. In my first job, I talked to a lot of people outside my team. UX, marketing, merchandising, and, in a very corporate way, this usually happened in 30-minute time slots. The other 8-odd hours a day were spent with my team, and they knew me well. I would frequently meet new coworkers, and my outfits became not only a conversations piece, or a way to remember me, but a brand associated with me. It didn’t have to be dramatic. Interesting shoes go a long way. Given that I was interfacing with other teams a lot, these outfits got a lot of face-to-face time. It created a noticeable, however small, reputation that preceded me. That’s (partially) why I was very deliberate about outfit choices. I had to create a way to stand out that was a great addition to the work I was delivering. I could write many more articles about this effect, and it’s important in the context of my old job. What happened when I took the new job, though? There’s definitely a reason that HBO’s Silicon Valley dresses all the PMs like career fair attendees and software engineers like, well, software engineers. I switched from spending a large portion of time interacting with external teams to spending a large portion of time interacting with just my team. My PM, my pairs, and my manager. This change in environment required a change in style to match. Even though I just spent a few paragraphs preaching about how my “dressing up” turned out to be a huge advantage for my professional brand, I’m no fool. Given the new situation I was in, changing jobs from being a PM to being a software engineer and not changing some part of my style would be like showing up to a Halloween party dressed as “myself.” Technically correct, but probably not the right move. Even though the above graph is not actually how I make fashion choices, safety is a huge factor in how I dress. Staying on my brand was smart, but not adapting to the situation I was now in was riskier. Calibrating, in this case, meant moving the casual factor up a notch. I bought a few polos, ditched the blazer, and bought a second pair of AllBirds. Yes, I know, AllBirds are almost a cliché at this point, but I genuinely enjoy them. So sue me. Did this mean that I was abandoning the brand I had established? Absolutely not. I just wore different things to express myself. It didn’t mean buying an entirely new wardrobe either. Monday PM (Before): Quirky button up, blazer (no matching pants), khakis, Oxford shoes Engineer (Current): Same quirky button up, khakis, Oxford shoes Sometimes it’s really just removing the blazer. I have a lot of fun dress shirts from Bonobos (No referral, I just like their stuff.) and I kept wearing those, just with the sleeves rolled up. Tuesday PM (Before): First suit day. Loafers or Oxfords for the shoes. Engineer (Current): Well-fitting Polo, the blackest jeans you can get, AllBirds Big contrast. I’ve had to up my Polo investments. I like Brooks Brothers, RL, and Banana Republic for those. Wednesday PM (Before): Button-up, patterned or colored chinos, oxfords. Engineer (Current): Crewneck sweater, chinos, sneakers I don’t really think wearing sneakers as a dev, or at a tech job in general, is particularly groundbreaking, but it’s in stark contrast to what I would wear in my last job. No complaints yet. Thursday PM (Before): Button-up, patterned or colored chinos, Chelsea boots. Engineer (Current): Another Polo day with jeans and AllBirds. AllBirds are my guilty pleasure. Are they the slimmest profile? No. Are they the hottest trend in fashion? No. Do they fit in with what I used to wear? Also no. But do they blend decent form, great function, and durability into one comfortable shoe? You bet. Friday PM (Before): Typically second suit day. Loafers. Engineer (Current): T-shirt, bomber jacket, jeans, Chelsea Suede boots. Friday was usually my most creative day out of the week to test out new fits and looks, and that trend continues with my new job."
Medium.com,Industry,WeWork Dropped the Best Idea They Had,Work,https://medium.com/swlh/wework-dropped-the-best-idea-they-had-bd37d087f24b?source=topic_page---------23------------------1," The initial emphasis of WeWork was not property but shared services. The idea was this — all over the world, startup founders are trying to figure out some very specific things — how to roast the best coffee beans, how to use AI in BtoB, or any other myriad of generally very focused problems. On top of this, they all have to deal with the same set of standardised issues — managing a P&L, sorting payroll, staying on top of their sales activities. And for many of them, they are facing these issues for the first time. The initial pitch for WeWork was that, as well as a shared office space, the company would centralise some of these services and offer them to tenants. Imagine being a tenant in a building with an amazing accountancy firm, an amazing HR consultancy, and a best in class law firm, all of whom know your business and take care of all those issues for you for a flat fee, allowing you to focus on those coffee beans you’ve been importing. Ultimately, they doubled down on the real estate element of the business. This makes sense with what we now know about Adam Neumann — chasing the maximum possible valuation, it made sense to focus on the business of property rather than the business of complex business services. Obviously, things haven’t gone so well for WeWork. Arguably, this focus on the bricks and mortar element would have made sense if they hadn’t been so ambitious with their valuation — they built a great brand and had some good margin, so probably could have built a single-digit billion-dollar business with only a paired back version of their strategy. But I also think they could have been wrong to abandon the shared services element. The initial insight — that so many small businesses grapple with services that are neither a core competency nor need reinventing for each entity — seems like one with legs. How many businesses have failed, not because they didn’t have a great idea, but because they didn’t know how to accrue revenue properly? Or PR? Or build a website? It also would have allowed them to build the software element of their business. They have been widely mocked for their attempts to pitch WeWork as a tech company, but imagine if the shared services side of their business included software — maybe an acquisition like LawPath, or maybe just revenue share deals with companies like Salesforce — they could have figured out entirely new ways to automate these services and show significant margins alongside the property side of their business. I broadly subscribe to the Andreessen Horowitz view that as time passes, software will take over more and more businesses that were thought of as needing human intervention. We’ve seen elements of sales taken on by companies like Salesforce, accounting by Xero, and now even more human heavy industries like legal are being automated. I think WeWork had a truly unique opportunity to leverage their network of tenants to lead this process of automation whilst also offering a helping hand to their tenants as they each scale. I also think we’re going to see the rise of consultancies founded on this very premise — assistance with the management of core business services, with a strong preference for automation. WeWork might have missed their chance. But it’ll be interesting to see if anyone else takes on the challenge."

Medium.com,Industry,The Marker Guide to Hiring for Your Startup,Work,https://marker.medium.com/the-ultimate-guide-to-startup-hiring-f05df3ea2f9c?source=topic_page---------25------------------1," One of the most common questions I get from company leaders is about who to hire and when. It doesn’t matter if your company is two people or 20 or 200 — your next hire is always the most important hire. Filling the wrong role at the wrong time is a waste of money and potentially even a waste of talent. But how do you know when the time is right and which skills are most critical for your success? Here’s a guide I put together, based on building dozens of companies, for all stages of a company’s growth cycle, from the first hire to the 500th. When I get asked for help on a hiring decision, nine times out of 10 it comes to me as “What role should we hire for next?” And nine times out of nine I try to gut-check whether a hire needs to be made at all. Here’s the rule: Good hires are like bullets. You don’t want to use them until you’ve locked in on a target and you’re 100% sure you want to pull the trigger. During the early days, a hire shouldn’t be made until the pain of missing that additional resource is twice the value of the total hire package. In other words, if it’s going to cost $100K all-in to bring on a resource, it shouldn’t be done until the company is feeling $200K worth of pain. That’s not always an easy metric to gauge, let alone live by, so it’s more of a guideline than a hard-and-fast rule. Just keep in mind that the only thing worse than living without a needed resource is paying a salary plus benefits for the wrong resource. A second factor in a growth-hiring decision — and maybe even more important than relieving pain — is grabbing opportunity. Employees are the biggest gamble a company makes, but growth just doesn’t happen without talent. So sometimes we need to hire opportunistically, rolling the dice on great talent in the hopes that the payoff will be exponential. I’d always rather hire for opportunity over pain management, and I try my best to make the money work out. Here’s the rule: Try not to hire a full-time resource right out of the gate. This is something I’ve done my entire career and actually adopted as policy at my company Automated Insights until we reached about 60 full-time people. Here’s how it worked: Instead of the normal screen-interview-welcome-aboard process, we put all new hires on a 60-day consulting contract. This allowed us to do several things. 1. It gave us runway to be able to weigh the risk-reward factor of the hire in real time. 2. It provided a window to make sure we weren’t imagining the fit. 3. It allowed us to take our time on benefits and equipment and onboarding. This was critical when we had a shoestring budget for HR. 4. It actually allowed us to take more risks with our hires. We landed some extremely valuable talent we probably wouldn’t have taken a chance on if faced with the specter of commitment after a couple of short interview sessions. We hired 98% of the folks that went through the consultant-to-hire process, and both we and they were more productive for having gone through it. That covers when and how to hire, so let’s talk about who to hire. The top two things we’re usually looking for are makers and sellers. “We have too many developers.” — No growing company ever. A startup can never have too many makers — and by makers I mean whoever is actually using their hands and brains to build the product or deliver the service. Since most of my readers are in the business of tech, I’ll use developers to discuss this role, but the advice applies to any product or any model. Here’s the rule: You should always be hiring makers. Strip away all the nuance and sunshine and we’re left with the fact that businesses exist to make things and sell things. So the question isn’t “Should we hire a developer?” so much as it is “When should we hire our next developer?” And that’s the trick managing supply so that it slightly exceeds demand. It’s a balance, and the equation seems simple: When the revenue realized by adding a developer exceeds the cost of adding a developer, add the developer. However, you need to keep a close eye on the future, both opportunistically and cautiously. If you see an opportunity to add an innovative developer to help deliver better product at lower costs, you need to take it. These hires are the difference between growth and stagnation. On the flip side, you also need to account for the fact that sales rarely go up and to the right perpetually. Companies get into trouble when they hire up to meet a demand that starts to erode over time. So there’s a second, broader balance: All demand peaks if left unprovoked, and opportunistic hires delay the inevitable erosion. With that in mind, your decision becomes less whether to hire another developer, but more about what you’re hiring that developer for — either to generate more revenue or to build a better product or both. Be careful with “both.” Revenue generation and innovation require two different skill sets. Finally, this maker hiring question shouldn’t be confused with another maker hiring question: Should we bring production in-house? A lot of startups farm out the building of their product to a third party, especially at the beginning. My answer to that question is almost always: Yes, as soon as possible. Bringing production in-house gives us the control we need and the flexibility we’ll want in order to be able to scale at a faster pace. This is the second and last of your basic need hires — the “sell things” part of business. And this hire is about putting that function into the hands of a professional. But you don’t hire your first salespeople to sell more product. You hire your first salespeople to develop a systematic sales strategy for your product. You might be really good at throwing your product against a wall and watching it stick, but even if that’s working, you’re leaving money on the table. So ideally, you want to hire your first salesperson just after the realization of a working product. As for when to hire additional salespeople, it’s important to realize that you don’t just hire a bunch of salespeople and set them loose to sell. You need to think about how you break up their territories — by product line, by location, by customer size, or some combination. Here’s the rule: When penetration in a single territory gets too deep for the person who owns it, you break the territory into two and give the other half to a new hire, under the tutelage of the original owner. Repeat this until you’ve built a solid sales organization. This role is always tricky, especially for young companies. But first things first: there’s a difference between leadership and management. Your company needs leaders right away, but managers can wait. In the beginning, the founder is (or co-founders are) the leader for everything. For hires in any leadership area, much like as it is with sales — you’re hiring to remove that burden from the founder(s). Unlike with sales, and despite conventional wisdom, initial leadership hires don’t have to be an experienced visionary or a strategy guru. For example, a good, strategic-thinking developer, maybe senior, can fill the technology leadership role for a long time. Your company needs leaders right away, but managers can wait. So be careful that you don’t hand out executive leadership roles too early. Is the CTO you’re about to hire really an experienced CTO? Maybe they’re just a great developer and, since you don’t have any great developers yet, this looks like your CTO. Here’s the rule: You should always be hiring leadership for one step ahead of where you are today. So if you’re in the early stage, you’ll need to bring in leaders with experience growing a company. If you’re in the growth stage, you’ll need leaders who can stabilize growth. And so on. On the other hand, managers are growth-triggered hires. These are big company roles, and really shouldn’t happen until the 50 to 75 employee stage. You’ll know you need a manager when you’ve hired enough individuals in a critical area to allow you to form a team because you’ll need one to run it. Here’s the rule: When your company is generating revenue but you believe it could be generating a lot more revenue, you need to fill the product role. At some point between the early stage and the growth stage, the evolution of the product pushes it out of the domain of the CEO or CTO. When this happens, you need someone who is tasked solely with figuring out how the product makes money and grows. A lot of company leaders wait too long on this role. Product is a relatively new science that uses sales data, performance data, marketing data, and industry and market knowledge to build the best product to grow the company. I’m a big fan of hiring a product role early in the company life cycle. This will kick-start a data-driven and quantifiable approach to growth from the beginning. Support should never be an afterthought, and the days of farming out support to call centers overseas are ending. A good customer support presence can elevate a company, and a poor one can bring it down. In the beginning, it makes sense to create a support role as soon as it becomes affordable and just before it becomes painful to not have it. The expansion of a support team has its own rhythm as well. You don’t want to hire support to meet peak levels, because when you get off peak, you’ll have a lot of people with nothing to do. So this is a situation where you’re always trying to do more with less. Here’s the rule: Once you have your minimum support requirements filled, you should avoid hiring more CSRs and instead start looking to technology and automation to allow those minimum resources to handle peak volume without falling over. There are two approaches for hiring marketing. In some businesses, getting marketing right and fully functional from the launch of the product is mandatory to get to the growth stage. In other businesses, marketing is only there to craft the message and build the brand, and it’s well into the growth stage before a resource is even needed. So first you need to figure out which kind of business you are. A lot of this comes down to B2B vs. B2C. In B2C businesses, forward-thinking companies will launch the product and the marketing at the same time, with at least one dedicated marketing resource to build an audience that can turn into customers. In B2B, the sales team was traditionally responsible for building the brand and getting the message out through one-to-one contact. But the lines between sales and marketing are blurring in B2B. Business buying decisions are starting to look more like personal buying decisions, sometimes with no salesperson in the middle, especially at first contact. Here’s the rule: If your sales process contains the notion of turning a broader audience into sales prospects, you need a marketing resource. For example: If there is any ad spend going on, it makes sense to hire a marketing resource to create and manage the advertising campaigns. The growth-triggered hires are those roles you bring on not because you need them to grow, but because you’ve grown to need them. Now, all of these roles are important to fill from the beginning, but in the beginning, they can usually be filled part-time, on a consultative basis, or with a third-party service, like an accounting firm, or legal firm, or recruiting firm on retainer. The question here then becomes when do you hire to bring these roles in-house? And in all cases, here’s the rule: You hire when you want the function to evolve from reactive to proactive. Human Resources: Any recruiting service, web or human or otherwise, can help find you candidates for your open positions. When you outgrow the ability to take action on the great candidates, you’ll need an HR resource to marshal this process. That same resource should also be able to manage benefits, policy, and the general upkeep and happiness of your workforce. Finance: From the first days of your company, you should have access to an accounting firm. When your sales contracts start to become more custom, or too voluminous, or when you’re looking to raise money, you’ll want a finance resource at least half-time. When you generally get to 50 employees, payroll will be another reason to drive the need to full-time. Legal: Like finance, you’ll want to have a relationship with a legal firm from the beginning. But unless your business has specific legal requirements or risks, you generally don’t need legal on staff until you’re paying the firm more than you’d pay to hire someone. Administration and Assistants: No slight intended, but in the startup world, the traditional executive assistant role is generally considered a luxury. It’s rare that I meet a startup executive who has a traditional assistant where I’ve thought they needed that assistant. Administration is far more important, and usually at about 50 employees, you’re established enough to have logistical and office tasks that can no longer be shared among the employees. A great administrator makes everyone’s lives easier. Bear in mind the exact timing to add any of these resources is a decision that can only be made by the executive team. In general, it’s always better to hire a little too late rather than a little too early. But the most important thing is to always hire the right person for the right role, regardless of when you bring them on."
Medium.com,Industry,Stop Faking It: Why We Should All Be More Vulnerable at Work,Work,https://medium.com/swlh/stop-faking-it-why-we-should-all-be-more-vulnerable-at-work-39722fbd8bfd?source=topic_page---------26------------------1," The old adage, ‘fake it til you make it’ is something that many working folks can relate to. It’s the idea that climbing the ladder of professionalism and success requires us to get tough instead of vulnerable. It requires us to power through times when we’re tired, sad, anxious, depressed, etc. It encourages us to save our vulnerable emotions for our personal lives; where they’re tucked away from deadlines and work expectations. But are they? Faking it in the workplace can actually lead to lower employee performance and engagement. It can also impact our overall mental health. Not to mention there’s a whole slew of problems with faking it. For example, men are statistically better at the ‘fake it ‘till you make it’ game. Which puts them at an advantage over women for promotions, recognition, and growth. Faking requires us to put aside our values and separate our authentic selves from our work selves. HR professionals around the world can tell you why that is troublesome. Faking it has the potential to spark bad work behaviors like “the dirty yes,” and even burnout. But vulnerability can be the solution, not the weakness, for us to be more authentic, more productive and overall happier in our work lives."
Medium.com,Industry,Words from a Failed School Administrator,Work,https://medium.com/swlh/words-from-a-failed-school-administrator-3fb641f93101?source=topic_page---------27------------------1," You know what’s funny? In a contemporary climate where so many schools are failing to meet the needs of their students, it is increasingly easy for school leaders to keep moving the goal-setting bar lower and lower in our own minds. After all, the National Assessment of Educational Progress tells us that less than 40% of high school graduates in the WHOLE UNITED STATES are prepared for college and careers. There are so many of us — failed school administrators, that is — that we have skewed our self-judgment in favor of sympathy for our collective disappointment. We now allow ourselves to fault any number of “extenuating circumstances” when we fail. Let’s start a new trend. Let’s just be honest about what we mean to do (or meant to do) and talk about how and why it didn’t happen. Let’s just tell the truth when we fail to meet our SMART goals, fail to inspire our employees, fail to inspire our student bodies, fail to gain the support of our communities. I’ll start with me. For two school years, 2015–2017, I had the privilege of serving in two different school leadership roles. From 2015–2016, I was assistant principal for a middle school, grades 6–8. From 2016–2017, I was director of a middle-high school, grades 6–12. Each time, I was so… so… so excited to get to work running after the golden standard: Get 70+% of students to cross the line of proficiency on end-of-year exams. Some of you are already shaking your heads, musing about whether or not this goal was reasonable. But, I present to you this reality: Shouldn’t a school leader be able to guarantee that at least three out of four students attending school can meet their academic goals? I mean, 70% is less than three of every four children. What else was I supposed to be doing if not facilitating an environment where more than half of the children could achieve success? So, I said to myself what I always said to myself as a teacher: “You have one job. Get every child across the line. Prepare them to pass their exams. Do what you have to do to make it happen.” You have one job. Get every child across the line. Prepare them to pass their exams. Do what you have to do to make it happen. Because, if you fall short of 100%, aiming for 100% affects how hard you are willing to work along the way and your general trajectory. Israelmore Ayivor said it like this: “If you aim upward, you will shoot at higher things (future prospects). If you aim downwards, you may shoot your feet (foundation).” If you aim upward, you will shoot at higher things (future prospects). If you aim downwards, you may shoot your feet (foundation). -Israelmore Ayivor It is important to understand that the United States runs on test scores. Schools are celebrated or rebuked, kept open or closed, based on students’ end-of-year test scores. This makes sense. You can’t get a job in this country without a certain level of computer literacy to complete your online application… without passing a certain level of pre-employment testing… You can’t get into the military without the ASVAB. You can’t get into a technical program without the ACT WorkKeys or a similar test. You can’t get a promotion without passing performance reviews. The idea that you are a successful administrator in a school where your students can’t pass tests is delusional. If those students don’t achieve enough proficiency to take and pass exams, they will find themselves isolated in an economy that is only growing more and more reliant on testing to select the best workers for the 21st Century. Alix Stuart calls this, “the rise of hiring machines.” I’m a mix between the transformational and coach-style leader, so I believed my success depended on two main focuses: This work required non-stop communication with everyone: students, parents, teachers, community leaders and other administrators. It meant holding people accountable for completing their part of the work. It meant finding the right teachers to work in the classrooms. It meant providing high quality training, regular observation and useful feedback. It meant using the right practice assessments. It meant optimizing planning periods. These two focus points… they meant so much alone and together. The list in the paragraph before this one is not even complete. When you are the teachers’ teacher, what you do or don’t do ripples down through the organization and ultimately leads to success or failure. When you are the teachers’ teacher, what you do or don’t do ripples down through the organization and ultimately leads to success or failure. I understood this in the beginning as I do now, so I committed myself everyday to doing whatever it took to continually communicate the proficiency goal and continually demonstrate commitment to its fulfillment. This is an article about FAILURE, so you KNOW we didn’t meet the 70+% proficiency goal. Not only did we not meet the goal (two years in a row), but the results hovered around the 30th percentile when all scores were taken together (averaged). What I’m not going to do is make excuses like: Because, the people who employ us… the school administrators… they pay us a decent amount of money to change the status quo, not report it. They trust us with whatever problems stand in the way of the goal, and then they pay us to troubleshoot — every day — to make the proficiency goal a reality (no matter what). Without proficiency… without commitment to producing prepared children… who will suffer most? The answer is obvious: the children suffer most. We get to hang around and excuse our failures while our students go into the world and struggle to obtain employment. I do not excuse myself. I live with my failure. I visit it sometimes on the weekends to analyze it, to reflect, because I fully intend to try again… and I fully intend to go in without making a single excuse… and I fully intend to win. After two years of mulling it over, here’s where I think I fell short. I Didn’t Win All of My Teachers The teachers, all of them, have to buy into the goal if the school has any chance at dramatic turnaround. On any given day, I could tell who was running toward 70+% proficiency, and I could tell who was angry at the very idea of having to get from where we were (the historic 30th percentile) to where we were going. Teachers who bought — wholesale — into the goal brought about significantly better student outcomes. I Didn’t Communicate Well with My Community I didn’t have the messaging power I needed flowing through my school community. As a matter of fact, I can’t think of a single community leader who would have been able to repeat my proficiency goal to me. This was a huge failure on my part, because students and parents feed on the energy of the school’s goals. Those goals have to reverberate everywhere they go. Proficiency goals that stop at the school doors after dismissal are doomed to fail. I Didn’t Act Decisively When Others Failed Sometimes, no amount of coaching can turn around a classroom. There were instances where if I had focused my energies on getting a more successful teacher into a classroom, the whole organization would have performed better. This is, perhaps, one of the hardest parts of promoting a proficiency goal on school campuses, but schools are not just service agencies. We have to produce results. Teachers who don’t produce results in one environment may fare better in other schools, but students deserve the best wherever they are. Sometimes, you have to let a teacher go. Honestly, I didn’t know there was a “what.” After two years of failing a community that needed a strong win, I fully intended to stay away from brick and mortar schools altogether. I did some online teaching for EuroAsian populations for a while, and that seemed easy enough. The students were eager. The pay was steady. The hours were very flexible. But did I want that? Did I want flexibility and stability over growth? Was it enough to know that students IN OTHER COUNTRIES could buy into a goal so strongly that THEY would take classes 8 p.m. at night to pass Monday’s English exam in school? My students… they could buy into a goal like that too, couldn’t they? My community could promote this kind of commitment to academic excellence. My teachers could inspire this kind of engagement. There is still NO REASON TO BELIEVE that success is beyond reach for my population. So the thing to do, I think, is admit that I failed and give that failure its proper place in my reflections as a professional. There are some things I should never do again, and there are some things I had better do if I want the success I know I can have as a school leader. If I want to give children and their community a fighting chance at great change in their academic lives and economic futures, it starts with me acknowledging where and why I wasn’t able to do that before. I hope you are willing to take out some time and do the same. We don’t have to fail you know, school administrators. We can achieve our goals too. ;)"

urrently, I’m a digital nomad based in Barcelona, freelancing for an awesome American-based tech start-up. If you’ve had a minute to read my previous stories, you’d know I’m new to the tech/start-up world, navigating it mentorless. I made a 180° switch in my career and went from English HS teaching to web development two years ago. Honestly, scariest and best decision of my career. “Did you really hate teaching that much?” you may ask… and the answer is no, I loved teaching, but I craved easier mobility, faster progress, and less bureaucracy. Over the last two years, I’ve had to build my career again, from the ground up, starting with no internships, no experience, no references, and no mentors, nothing but my education, studying at the global kick-a$$ bootcamp, Le Wagon. It’s been a test (note: “been”, meaning “it still is, and may always be”). Over the course of these first two years, I’ve evolved, explored, and carved a small niche in this massive, competitive industry. The industry is growing, but that doesn’t mean it’s not drenched. The need for workers with coding skills is growing above and beyond… and rising, but that doesn’t mean you’re not competing against the best, and that can be intimidating for a newbie. Essentially, I’ve evolved from web developer to web consultant, to coding curriculum developer, to QA testing and customer support + analysis, my current position. This has been a journey, to say the least. My career has made more evolutions in the last 2 years, than the previous 7. I’ve been seeking my niche, finding my groove, figuring out where I feel most driven and thriving, and where I can best combine my tech/coding world with my communication/teaching world. Currently, I can say I’m thoroughly content with my current role, fusing my skills in customer service, problem-solving, code, and data while keeping it challenging. But it’s an uphill climb of uncertainty, the anticipation of the next change, the next learning curve, the constant “will I be ready for it?” feeling, the challenge of explaining to friends and family what I even do, the imposter syndrome, the sometimes lingering thoughts of “I can’t do this on my own, but I’m scared to ask for help”. You see, I’m a bit burnt because as a teacher, I had the great fortune of having an amazing mentor, who changed my life and drive for teaching through compassion, nurture, curiosity, and her profound intellect and wisdom. We became best friends. Everyone needs one of those. And I didn’t realize how important a mentor was until I no longer had one. If you scroll through LinkedIn, every other post talks about the impact and benefits of having a mentor, the statistics, the data, the emotional reliefs, etc, etc, blah blah blah… yeah, I’m bitter. I also agree with every one of those studies and opinions. A lot of startups are nurturing, and promote curiosity, questions, open communication, including the one I’m currently with. But I’ve also had experience with not-so-nurturing startup environments, and it was very “every man for himself”. I’d ask for help, but help was brief and abbreviated. People are there only to help when asked, and honestly, I completely get it. They have their own roles, deadlines, responsibilities and don’t have the emotional space to mentor. I’m guilty of this too. Here ends my massive, self-therapeutic guide to self-mentorship, and by the way, this Medium story definitely counts as a step in my own self-mentorship and self-gratitude. Apparently, the journey never ends!"
Medium.com,Industry,How to Learn Python as an SEO,Work,https://medium.com/@Derek_M_Hawk/how-to-learn-python-as-an-seo-d56528b1dedf?source=topic_page---------29------------------1," It’s the cutting-edge, tech-driven SEOs that have begun to shine in both modern agency and in-house organizations. For those who have adopted programming, automation, and innovation into their everyday lives, the rewards are significant results in their organic search performance and best-in-class SEO strategies/processes. Looking to up my marketing game with something more advanced drove me to take on the intensive process of picking up programming from scratch. Two years later, many of my day to day processes being rooted almost exclusively in Python. Learning the language has been one of the most important steps in my career so far. But, with no formal training under my belt, no degree that states “Python Master,” and no pre-set pathway to picking up the language, the question has been asked many times over has arisen. “How did you learn Python?” Or just as much, “How should I learn Python?” While no pathway is perfect and mine had many bumpy roads along the way, I wanted to share the tips and advice I wish I had gotten before diving headfirst into a brand new programming world. I spent (and still spend) a large amount of time reading/watching anything I can get my hands on. I never used a specific book or online course (though there are many out there that cover fundamental Python). Rather, I gave myself a lot of time to immerse myself in code and piece together an understanding of what I was looking at. Answering the basics for myself (“what is an IDE?” “what is a string” “what is a dictionary?”) while also tackling slightly more complicated code bases over time. From technical documentation, Stack Overflow threads, Github repo documentation, learning Python is just as much an exercise in reading the language as it is writing the language. Before you start with jumping into technical docs, I would highly recommend just turning to videos online. YouTube is a great resource for learning on the fly fundamentals through visual examples (and probably remains one of the biggest sources of education for me nowadays). While the realm of Python videos is vast online, some of the channels I heavily relied on to start were sentdex, Data School and CS Dojo Reading. A lot of what I did personally in terms of self-learning came out of necessity. When I first started I made two goals for myself to First, always attempt to implement a pythonic approach to any work task presented to me. Even when the task would take more time compared to conventional methods, understanding how to deconstruct a process into its core steps allows for developing the means to build code which can further optimize and automate the process. Does your day to day SEO work include reporting for example? When developing a weekly or monthly report, take the time to write down every step of the process in its most granular form, and don’t skip a detail. Once you have each step written out, approach each chunk of the process purely with Python. This allows for a step-by-step process rather than trying to drink straight from the fire hydrant. Secondly, always have a side project that you are building for your own personal development/interest. For myself that has been building GUI applications for trend spotting in historical keyword data, along with web scrapers for sneaker websites to track price fluctuation. Having separate, non-work based projects allows for your mind to create and solve problems at your own pace and with your interests, making it less of a chore to learn but more so something you can enjoy throughout. Overall, for both steps, you’re coding goals should have reachable goals. Start simple and work your way up. There are many SEOs in the community who are breaking new ground in applying Python into the SEO space. From automated meta description writing to finding expired domains online, the SEOs who are working in the language day to day serve as beacons for those who want context into what can be done by blending Python and SEO. Whether it is setting up a time to meet with them in person, or just sending a friendly LinkedIn message or email, look to further learn from those who are actively in the same world. While learning and collaborating with other SEOs in the niche we are all in, I have had the great pleasure of getting to know other SEO-programmers such as The community of Python focused SEOs is small (but ever-growing). If you are interested in what they are working on or want to know more about some of their processes, take the steps to network around the space! No marketer works in a silo. They interact with all aspects of the organization from sales to strategy to tech and everything in between. It should work in the same way for learning. Taking up the challenges of learning not only with your peers in the SEO community but with internal teams across all facets of the organization. I am thankful that my office has a ton of other people who work in Python so I spent a lot of time working alongside teammates on more complex problems, picking brains along the way. Asking questions about what they are working on, showing genuine interest, engaging and trying to understand their code for myself. This can be achieved digitally via Github. Find over SEOs who are looking to learn and build something together, exchanging and editing GitHub repos. It goes a long way when you are working together with others during the learning process, much like being in your everyday office setting."

Being bound to your desk more than 39 hours a week at work also means you’re more likely to develop mental health problems (according to research from the Australian National University). People like the one and only Tim Ferris have been praising flexible working for over 10 years (check out 4 Hour Work Week for more on that ). More and more entrepreneurs I talk to these days embrace flexible working as a way to communicate and manage a team. My team works remotely most days, we communicate via Quip (most people use Slack these days), and I let them choose the days they are online — they both work part-time, which suits their own business dreams and goals. In the UK alone, laws about working are changing. Conservative MP Helen Whately introduced a flexible working bill in Parliament this week which, if taken forward, would make flexible working the norm in employment contracts and require employers to advertise positions as suitable for flexible working unless certain conditions are met."
